really

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,239
looking forward to this discussion and

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,000
we really appreciate everyone

share my screen and we're going to jump

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,279
into

12
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,480
our podcast section

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,920
so this is team com podcast

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,960
number three

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,399
welcome to team com everyone this is a

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,879
recorded and an archived live stream

17
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,280
that we're performing we are an

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,000
experiment

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,079
in online team communication and

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,160
learning and we are the active inference

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,760
stream for now

22
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,000
so people can connect with us via

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
twitter at inferenceactive

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,719
at this gmail address here we have a

25
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,399
public key based team

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,000
and also if you're watching this you

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,840
probably know but we're on youtube

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,200
at this username we really welcome

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,320
all skills backgrounds and perspectives

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,720
so please let us know how we can help

31
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,880
you and help help provide an on-ramp for

32
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,720
wherever you're coming from

33
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,759
and please be respectful of the rules of

34
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,080
online communication and dialogue

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,920
so you if you're not speaking if there's

36
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,280
noise in the background

37
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,600
you can use the raise your hand feature

38
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,040
which is on the bottom

39
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,479
left of jitsi and so on

40
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,560
and please provide us with feedback so

41
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,840
we can be improving

42
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,880
our work here's going to be the

43
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,000
structure of the discussion today first

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,200
we're going to have a

45
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,159
check-in and a warm-up then we're going

46
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,520
to briefly cover

47
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,560
tin bergens for questions which are a

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,680
big idea

49
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,240
that help us organize some of the

50
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,399
concepts that are discussed in the paper

51
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,360
then we will get to discussing the paper

52
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,280
we'll talk about the goals of the paper

53
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,520
and the abstract we'll go through the

54
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,840
road map of the paper and talk about the

55
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,920
section headers and how the authors get

56
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,520
from a to z

57
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,280
we'll talk about each one of the figures

58
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,720
and try to understand them

59
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,040
and then we'll have time for questions

60
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,080
throughout as well as at the end

61
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,640
so in the check-in or warm-up everyone

62
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,319
absolutely feel free to introduce

63
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:22,800
yourself

64
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,800
briefly and your location however you'd

65
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,319
like and maybe

66
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,239
for each of these questions if one or

67
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,000
two people could just

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,120
give a first thought so first warm-up

69
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,920
question is

70
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,839
what is communication

71
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,599
people can raise their hand or just kind

72
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:50,879
of pop corn in

73
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,080
yeah go ahead jared uh yeah so

74
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,599
alright yeah so hi everyone my name is

75
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,120
uh jared faisal i'm

76
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,360
uh uh in north carolina in uh

77
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,720
in the united states of america um

78
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,080
yes uh for me communication is just uh

79
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,360
a kind of a set of behaviors and

80
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,480
inferences that

81
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,680
people use to align their mental states

82
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,280
it's kind of like an abstract

83
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,319
i think kind of way to think about it

84
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,200
but um it inherits from my advisor's

85
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,560
line of thought that communication is a

86
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,040
sort of tool for people aligning their

87
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,720
mental states to a degree good enough

88
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,840
for their purposes

89
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,200
um yeah that's that's it i'd

90
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,480
like to think of it as a behavior that's

91
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,680
extended that uh

92
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,599
is like a sort of continuous extension

93
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,959
of

94
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,280
uh behaviors that species across the

95
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,560
animal kingdom use

96
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,519
um trying to think of it in a way that's

97
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,480
anything too too special

98
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,080
in linguistics for instance thought of

99
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,760
something very very special and unique

100
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,920
and it is in a certain way but

101
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,680
uh the way that i found it useful to

102
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,840
think about communication is as a

103
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,360
another sort of behavior in people's

104
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,840
toolkits

105
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,879
any other thoughts on that

106
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,518
yep stefan

107
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,000
yeah i would say that i agree with what

108
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,160
was just said there actually and uh

109
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,160
if you take like an active embodied

110
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,519
approach you could say that the um

111
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,600
it's an extension communication is an

112
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,960
extension of

113
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,520
the organism into the environment but

114
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,759
one which can happen

115
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,639
with interactions with other organisms

116
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,120
also extending into their environment

117
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,840
and their niche

118
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,199
cool and that kind of presages this

119
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,639
second question which is

120
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,199
what is special interesting or important

121
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:45,840
about

122
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,400
human communication and could be nothing

123
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,120
could be

124
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:56,560
everything um any thoughts on that one

125
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,479
yeah so i have a thought that it's maybe

126
00:04:58,479 --> 00:04:59,759
not super special

127
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,320
anything about human communication um my

128
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,360
name is shannon

129
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,600
i'm at the university of california in

130
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,639
merced

131
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,639
but because of the pandemic i'm at home

132
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,240
in south dakota for

133
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,360
the foreseeable future um but yeah i

134
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:13,759
think

135
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,440
what is special about human

136
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,280
communication is that it's

137
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,639
the point of view that we're coming from

138
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,479
so when we're like studying

139
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,160
communication across the animal kingdom

140
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,680
it's always the point of comparison

141
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,880
either implicitly or

142
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,080
explicitly um but

143
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,720
you can look at like anything from

144
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,280
non-verbal communicative behaviors of

145
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,120
like our primate relatives or even of

146
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,560
our pets with

147
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,680
us um like outside of their species or

148
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,560
even

149
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,759
of like chemical signals and plants um

150
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,080
so maybe there's just a question of

151
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,080
how much of something that we want to

152
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,880
call agency or intentionality

153
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,280
is necessary to call communication

154
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,800
important in a specific

155
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,319
um like niche or

156
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,240
specific animal or plant kingdom or

157
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,720
something like that

158
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,520
very nice and science as a special form

159
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,360
of human communication it's the one that

160
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,160
we have

161
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,240
if nothing else and so as we kind of

162
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,479
continue to build towards the paper

163
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,199
how do prior beliefs so beliefs that

164
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,240
communicators

165
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,759
have about identity narrative or culture

166
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,000
play into communication in human or

167
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,120
non-human systems

168
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,160
sasha um yeah just

169
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,319
building on these really great previous

170
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,360
answers

171
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,400
i'm sasha i'm in davis california

172
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,720
um but i just wanted to say

173
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,319
that communication is highly

174
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,080
culture and context dependent and

175
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,199
in thinking about how to align

176
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,000
different peoples or organisms uh kind

177
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,319
of

178
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,599
views of the world culture

179
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,080
and context plays a big role in deciding

180
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,680
on how much to align

181
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,840
and whether or not that's important at

182
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,520
all

183
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,960
cool jared uh yeah so

184
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,080
um i wanted to

185
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,360
briefly say something about the second

186
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,840
point as well i for me real quick the

187
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,479
something that's maybe the the main

188
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,759
point of interest for me in terms of

189
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,199
human communication specifically human

190
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,639
communication is the

191
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,680
the uh goals of communicators in the

192
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,000
human

193
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,880
case tend to be or seem to be based on

194
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,919
um

195
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,680
a lot of for instance developmental and

196
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,680
cooperative research um

197
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,080
seem to be unique in that the goal is

198
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,039
the alignment of

199
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,400
mental states per se um so that turns on

200
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,680
gathering evidence for

201
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,280
that in terms of our interaction so i

202
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,199
have to get certain cues from you that

203
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,800
you understand what i'm saying and so

204
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,360
it's not you know

205
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,599
if you grab the thing for me that i i'm

206
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:56,560
asking you to get

207
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,039
by accident say accidentally you get the

208
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,120
thing that i wanted you to get

209
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,199
but you're also giving me cues that you

210
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,479
misunderstood what i said and so it was

211
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,000
just you know fortuitous

212
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,360
circumstance that you happen to get what

213
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,680
i wanted even in like young kids you'll

214
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,080
see them try to correct that and say

215
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,520
no you got the right thing this is

216
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,520
really what i wanted and so those sorts

217
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,080
of

218
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,240
that sort of result for instance um

219
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,199
suggests that

220
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,360
something that's unique is the

221
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,039
alignmental states per se

222
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,720
um rather than just having some

223
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,319
functional outcome

224
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,919
which is often the case in for instance

225
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,440
other non-human primates forms of

226
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,800
communication

227
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,760
um and then that turns into prior

228
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,200
beliefs for instance how does that

229
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,640
play an important role in communication

230
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,200
for me that's building what the

231
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,039
uh previous speakers said um

232
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,399
uh your prior beliefs

233
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,360
are the way or an important part of your

234
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,519
prior beliefs are the set of cultural

235
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,120
conventions that you learn

236
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,720
um i.e how a phrase or a

237
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,920
a mental state some how a a mental state

238
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,600
or intention should be

239
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,560
uh made manifest in the environment for

240
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,640
others to pick up on

241
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,080
that's a set of prior beliefs how do i

242
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,000
best do this something that your culture

243
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,519
installs in you through

244
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,480
all sorts of joint attentional practices

245
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,120
earlier in

246
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,320
uh earlier and earlier in in development

247
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,680
and that's also something that species

248
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,000
unique that other species

249
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,480
don't don't seem to engage in um is the

250
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,440
installation of these kinds of

251
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,959
culturally acquired

252
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,480
uh patterns and and

253
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,200
practices for communicating one's mental

254
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,279
states in a way that everyone deems

255
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,160
good enough for um sufficient for

256
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,560
current purposes i guess

257
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,399
cool yeah our last warm-up question

258
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,959
is for you what might a satisfying

259
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,120
formal framework for communication look

260
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,440
like and that might include

261
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,360
human and non-human it might include all

262
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,120
these features that people are talking

263
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,120
about but what would be the attributes

264
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,640
of a comprehensive or a formal framework

265
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:00,959
for

266
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,640
thinking about all this diversity of

267
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,399
communication styles in humans and

268
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,760
non-humans

269
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,160
what features would that kind of a model

270
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,839
be expected or desired to have

271
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,160
yes stiffen i think one of the key

272
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,880
things

273
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,959
is it would have a spatial component in

274
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,640
terms of how the dynamics happened

275
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,360
in space and around space particularly

276
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,600
personal space around

277
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,000
the organism and one of the key things

278
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,120
about humans is that we can also enfold

279
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,000
narrative within itself in story we can

280
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,079
and we spatially arrange things so we

281
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:36,880
often say

282
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,480
like that's right what's left what's

283
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,680
ahead what's been

284
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,079
so that ability to somehow

285
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,839
tag or embed within the niche

286
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,399
is key and then the actual language part

287
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,680
is somehow

288
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,200
tied to that rather than the other way

289
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,440
around which is what a lot of the kind

290
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:57,920
of

291
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,519
mind-based approaches it tends to be

292
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,720
cool shannon i think i'm touching up on

293
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,360
that

294
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,839
so having this account of how we use

295
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,040
space

296
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,880
in conversation it also needs to be

297
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,880
flexible enough to account what sasha

298
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,320
was talking about

299
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,720
the way different cultures use space

300
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,720
like putting the past in front of you

301
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,839
which is

302
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,040
awkward to me but makes a lot of sense

303
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,920
to other

304
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,560
other cultures um and also aspects of

305
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,800
communication that aren't linguistic

306
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,959
so non-verbal would be obvious but

307
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,320
communication and

308
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,760
like a musical situation um where no

309
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,000
not necessarily any semantic referent is

310
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,800
being

311
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,600
called upon but all the same we know

312
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,079
that we're

313
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,560
feeling the same beat or like we're

314
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,240
really

315
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,519
in the same abstract

316
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,360
space of interacting with each other

317
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,079
cool um yvonne or alex anything to add

318
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,880
on any of these

319
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,200
points

320
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,639
not by no cool i agree about

321
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,160
that um aspect where linguistics

322
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,760
are one of the modes of communication

323
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,279
and yet there's this spatial element

324
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,040
and sometimes they blur when you say do

325
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,959
you grasp it or can you see what i'm

326
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:17,920
talking about it's

327
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,639
very cross-sensory and you can type out

328
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,760
what you mean to say

329
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,360
yet we're sometimes talking about

330
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,360
specific things sometimes not

331
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,800
so let's just talk really briefly about

332
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,639
tin bergen's four questions which are

333
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,120
modeled off of aristotle's four wise

334
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,160
and this is a image from cap heim's

335
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,639
paper

336
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,839
from the u social insect literature and

337
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,920
tim bergen's four questions are kind of

338
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,920
like a two by two matrix

339
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,279
the two aspects on the left side the y

340
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,399
axis are whether the domain of analysis

341
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,880
is contemporary happening right now or

342
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,720
historical in the past

343
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,519
and then proximate or ultimate are

344
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,240
referring

345
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,639
not to ultimate like the best but rather

346
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,920
like close and far

347
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,720
again kind of a spatial metaphor and the

348
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,760
four

349
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,440
domains though they sometimes go by

350
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,800
slightly different names

351
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,120
are causation which is happening

352
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,040
approximately and now

353
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,000
uh utility which is happening it's the

354
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,399
ultimate y it's the it's the teleos

355
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,639
and it's happening now as well and then

356
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,839
in the proximate

357
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,320
version of history so recent history we

358
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,639
have development or ontogeny

359
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,279
and then the ultimate why of history why

360
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:29,680
do

361
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,240
birds have wings why are we here that's

362
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,800
captured by evolution and just to put a

363
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,639
little bit more of a specific

364
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,959
vision on this as we turn towards some

365
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,480
of the figures in the paper which will

366
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,760
involve birds

367
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,519
this is from bateson and lalon 2013

368
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,680
which was a 50-year update on tim

369
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,839
bergen's original 63 paper

370
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,560
and here's the same four categories of

371
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,399
mechanism which is causation

372
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,320
uh current utility development and

373
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,800
evolution reflected by

374
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,680
uh respectively the neuroscience the

375
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,399
actual

376
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,120
meaning of the song the developmental

377
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,160
basis of the song

378
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,399
which is showing the songs trace change

379
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,199
through time

380
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,040
and then the evolutionary history of the

381
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,120
trait reflected on a phylogeny

382
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,360
so any points on that or can we jump

383
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,839
into the paper

384
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,959
cool this was just to kind of bring up

385
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,040
this idea for those who are maybe coming

386
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,279
from outside of a philosophy of biology

387
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,040
background because it's a really awesome

388
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,360
framework and it helps us get on board

389
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,639
with this idea that there's going to be

390
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,720
more than one answer to why

391
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,440
not just because of just uh different

392
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,000
opinions

393
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,680
there's actually different kinds of whys

394
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,279
when we're talking about why is a bird

395
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,880
singing there might be multiple answers

396
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,560
just fundamentally

397
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,959
so the paper that we are here to talk

398
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:45,760
about today

399
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,480
and lucky enough to have jared the first

400
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,560
author here for a little bit longer

401
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,480
is a world unto itself human

402
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,760
communication as

403
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,040
active inference and what i sketched the

404
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,040
two goals of the paper down as

405
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,880
were to formalize cooperative

406
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,279
communication as a process of active

407
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:03,920
inference

408
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,880
under the free energy principle and to

409
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,279
link

410
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,199
the mechanistic developmental and

411
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,560
evolutionary perspectives on

412
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,360
communication

413
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,440
by using active inference as a process

414
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,399
theory

415
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,399
jared what would you say about that or

416
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,399
how does that reflect on what you've

417
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,800
intended when you wrote the paper yeah

418
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,000
no no i think that's

419
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,839
i think that's great and um i want to

420
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,680
put particular emphasis

421
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,199
within the context of the cs pacific

422
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,120
paper on the second point um

423
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,199
i really was hoping to um

424
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,480
yeah hone in on the idea that all these

425
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,920
different scales of analysis

426
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,040
are in some sense linked to one another

427
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,759
um i.e like you had mentioned in the

428
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:44,800
last slide you know if you want to

429
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,399
explain any kind of behavior or

430
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,920
inferential pattern or whatever that you

431
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,480
see any aspect of a phenotype in in

432
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,880
the animal kingdom that's gonna turn in

433
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,800
every single case

434
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,839
on to fully explain it on on explaining

435
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:58,959
what's going on in each of these

436
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,399
different scales of analysis and showing

437
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,639
how they all kind of fit into a coherent

438
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,480
poll in this case if you take the active

439
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,720
inference framework the kind of

440
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,320
the idea of gathering evidence for your

441
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,000
model your evolutionarily

442
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,959
uh favored model um that bottoms out in

443
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:13,279
in

444
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,360
real time uh sorts of behavioral

445
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,759
patterns um

446
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,199
that yeah i was basically trying to link

447
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,320
these different scales

448
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,160
um and show how they're all sort of part

449
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,759
of this evidence gathering procedure

450
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,720
um it emerges in this idea of

451
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,839
cooperative communication which is

452
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:30,480
something

453
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,399
from my advisor mike tomasulo and i hope

454
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,120
that uh that this will lead to some sort

455
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,759
of uh

456
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,440
future more uh technical explicit uh

457
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,480
formal analysis cool

458
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,279
and when i see tim burgin's four

459
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,560
questions i think about

460
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,519
yes and because not only is that a tenet

461
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:51,920
of

462
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,160
improv and communication as we know it

463
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,839
at the mechanism time scale

464
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,160
to foreshadow but it's like yes there's

465
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,839
evolution that's an explanation

466
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,079
and there's other kinds of explanations

467
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,000
that we want to be addressing as well so

468
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,280
it's kind of communication

469
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,119
through and through and integration

470
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,319
through and through

471
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,559
any other comments on the goals the

472
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,439
paper before we

473
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,319
get to the abstract

474
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,319
okay so let's work through the abstract

475
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,959
and see how the authors reflected or

476
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,079
summarized

477
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,439
for everyone what they did they wrote

478
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,599
the purpose of this paper is to extend

479
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,280
the account of human cooperative

480
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,160
communication

481
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,080
by proposing an integrative model of

482
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,320
biobehavioral dynamics of cooperative

483
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,919
communication

484
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,160
our formulation is based upon active

485
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:38,960
inference

486
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,720
active inference suggests that action

487
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,000
perception cycles

488
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,919
operate to minimize uncertainty and

489
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,160
optimize an individual's internal model

490
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,080
of the world

491
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,000
we propose that humans are characterized

492
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
by an evolved adaptive prior belief

493
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,520
that their mental states are aligned

494
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,360
with or similar to those of con

495
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,480
specifics

496
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,720
for example that we are the same sort of

497
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,000
creature inhabiting the same

498
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,200
sort of niche any thoughts or

499
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,880
comments on these first parts of the

500
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,360
abstract

501
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,200
so we're within this integrative

502
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,039
framework we want to bring together tin

503
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:13,679
bergen

504
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,440
as well as active inference with

505
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,799
hopefully an eye towards

506
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,320
more formal integrations that are

507
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,640
possible in the future

508
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,880
the use of cooperative communication

509
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,039
emerges as the principal means to gather

510
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,640
evidence for this belief again that

511
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,080
we're in a shared niche and that we're

512
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,160
similar kinds of interactors or english

513
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,000
speakers or we're interested in this

514
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,200
topic

515
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,960
allowing for the development of a shared

516
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,360
narrative that is used to disambiguate

517
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,919
interactants hidden and inferred mental

518
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:40,799
states

519
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,720
any thoughts on that part what does it

520
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,559
mean to disambiguate

521
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:56,080
the hidden and inferred mental states

522
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,840
well one thought on that shannon go

523
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,280
ahead oh

524
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,799
yeah um so i guess it's

525
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,960
not just to know what the other person

526
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,320
might be thinking

527
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,440
um or could say in words but also to

528
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,559
know that

529
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,000
you're both maybe attending to the same

530
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,520
reference or that you're both

531
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,280
experiencing a similar emotion

532
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,600
or if it's different like why is the

533
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,320
other person

534
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,559
sad right now um so any sort of

535
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,320
experience i suppose that two people

536
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,080
could be feeling it's to

537
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,600
figure out what they're feeling and what

538
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,360
you are feeling and

539
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,480
yeah a lot of them yeah

540
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,640
and we have such a rich internal

541
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,000
experience that it's not

542
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,559
enough just to infer the external states

543
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,320
of a person oh they're sitting down

544
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,960
uh big surprise we need to actually do a

545
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,840
lot of work

546
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,840
to disambiguate or to reduce our

547
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,679
uncertainty about hidden states which

548
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,679
are mental in this case

549
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,640
thus by using cooperative communication

550
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,880
individuals effectively attuned to a

551
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,400
hermeneutic niche

552
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,039
composed in part of others mental states

553
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,000
and reciprocally

554
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,240
attuned the niche to their own ends via

555
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,240
epistemic niche construction

556
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,440
uh jared what is a hermeneutic niche

557
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,600
and an epistemic niche how are those

558
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,400
similar ideas or different

559
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,720
yeah so the idea of a hermeneutic niche

560
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,840
is that you know

561
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,280
when we're when we're communicating we

562
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,640
both have our sort of individual

563
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,400
perspective so it's you know

564
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,919
um it's a an i or a me

565
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,240
and a you in addition to that there's

566
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,200
you know the we

567
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,640
the it's our shared dialogue um

568
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,200
we are talking about something um at the

569
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,720
same time of course we can decompose

570
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,080
that into like i just said our own

571
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,000
individual perspectives and so

572
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,760
what i was trying to get out there um

573
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,039
was

574
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,000
the idea of hermeneutics is if you all

575
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,760
have read for instance the first and

576
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,480
fifth 2015 duet for one paper um they

577
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,480
talk about this hermeneutic idea where

578
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,600
it comes from the idea of like a deep

579
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,120
reading of a text so

580
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,559
if you want to really fully understand

581
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,720
a text for instance you have to both

582
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,919
take words

583
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,440
in their immediate context in a sentence

584
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,480
in which they're composed then also

585
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,240
relate them to the larger context of the

586
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,000
paragraph or the the

587
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,039
um the chapter or the whole book or

588
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:15,600
whatever

589
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,159
um so the idea is relating these two or

590
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,600
more different scales of analysis to one

591
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,400
another

592
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,240
um and seeing it as a sort of

593
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,640
integrative explanatory whole

594
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,360
um and the epistemic niche construction

595
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,320
component uh

596
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,400
trying to link up with uh some of the

597
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,840
stuff that axel constant

598
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,840
um has been doing on niche construction

599
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,240
so um

600
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,120
we construct our niche so as to offer up

601
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,000
very precise

602
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,240
uh certain affordances for us

603
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,720
i.e we make our niche more easily

604
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,159
understandable

605
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,080
that could in this case in the instance

606
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,240
of

607
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,760
communication across long

608
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,240
stretches of intergenerational time you

609
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,520
see these patterns of

610
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,520
what using this this terminology

611
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,520
epistemic niche construction where

612
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,000
um languages cultures build up i should

613
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,360
say cultures build up a set of

614
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,840
constructions a set of four meaning

615
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,130
pairings um

616
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,280
[Music]

617
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,679
that if you align to that set of four

618
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:16,720
meaning pairings and

619
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,120
ontogeny makes your niche very easily

620
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,080
understandable

621
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,120
i.e easily inferable you can

622
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,640
easily grab a hold of others hidden

623
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,760
states as there were others mental

624
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,400
states

625
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,039
by using these sorts of uh uh very

626
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,000
reliable

627
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,039
um sort of epidemic tools or devices

628
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,240
which are

629
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,440
we talked about in the paper uh

630
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,679
communicative constructions

631
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,440
and and the way that you describe that

632
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,799
it makes me think about the

633
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,520
royal we in english and if somebody said

634
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:45,919
well

635
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,000
what am i talking about it's almost like

636
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,360
wait what are you talking about if

637
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,400
you're not sure what you're talking

638
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,679
about what are you talking about

639
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,280
but when somebody says what are we

640
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,360
talking about here it's a rhetorical

641
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,039
question that helps us

642
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,200
have a shared informational niche and i

643
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,200
agree axel's work in that respect is

644
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,400
excellent

645
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,480
this means that niche construction

646
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,320
enables features of the niche

647
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,880
to encode precise reliable cues about

648
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,840
the deontic

649
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,600
or shared value of certain action

650
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,360
policies e.g

651
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,120
the utility of using communicative

652
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,880
constructions to disambiguate mental

653
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,600
states

654
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,760
given expectations about shared prior

655
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,720
beliefs

656
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,159
what is deontic value in this context

657
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,360
jared or anyone else

658
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,880
maybe jared first and anyone else can

659
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,720
raise their hand

660
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,760
i think if if stefan wants to go oh

661
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,320
have in a in your environment so um

662
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,159
it can be useful so it's kind of a

663
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,000
longer standing queue that's kind of

664
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,840
established in the niche

665
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,760
um just one thing i was thinking when i

666
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,120
was seeing this i think it's quite

667
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,400
important that they're talking about

668
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,520
cooperative communication here

669
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,400
um and that narrows it down then to

670
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,880
something a bit more instrumental

671
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,840
um it's not necessarily coordinated

672
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,520
communication so it's not necessarily as

673
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,480
action-oriented as that but there is a

674
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,480
sense that this is trying to get to

675
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,480
we're trying to achieve or trying to

676
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,480
cooperate towards something therefore i

677
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,880
want to align my mental states

678
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,240
because if you're not cooperating with

679
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,679
someone you could be just trying to work

680
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,880
out the hidden states of like what is it

681
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,559
that it's important for me to talk to

682
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,880
them about which may not be their mental

683
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,720
state it just may be

684
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,200
their state in the world at the moment

685
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,520
if that makes sense which i think

686
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,880
this is like you've already got some

687
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,720
alignment and

688
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,600
assumed i think

689
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,679
right and if it's not cooperative it

690
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,679
might be adversarial which kind of takes

691
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,679
us to dennett's intentional stance

692
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,360
where you just say whatever it is if

693
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,960
it's a computer or if it's a human i'm

694
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,000
just trying to win this

695
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,559
little local game theory interaction and

696
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,760
the paper doesn't go

697
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,039
that direction it moves towards

698
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,279
cooperative communication so

699
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,559
jared any thoughts there yeah yeah so

700
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,120
this is

701
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,559
all great discussion and this um

702
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:13,600
building on the point you just said

703
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,799
about you know cooperative versus

704
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,320
adversarial sorts of

705
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,760
for instance communication um

706
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,159
even in the case of you know i say you

707
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,919
know i'm using communication

708
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,480
or shared language to try to outsmart

709
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,080
you or outdo you or something

710
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,720
um exercising like a kind of like

711
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,679
machiavellian

712
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,320
intelligence i think it's been called um

713
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,200
that still relies on you know the shared

714
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,480
presupposition i guess you want to use

715
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,120
that language of um

716
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,520
a cooperative bedrock so you know the

717
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,360
idea is if i'm using

718
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,440
this piece of language typically it's

719
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,559
for you know honest

720
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,960
genuine communicative goals and the idea

721
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,559
for instance deception relies on

722
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,120
me using you know kind of exploiting

723
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,480
that shared assumption

724
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,799
to my own benefit to your detriment um

725
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,480
so even at least in the case of humans

726
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,159
when you're you know lying or something

727
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,200
um adversarial communication or whatever

728
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,080
still relies on there being some shared

729
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,159
set of cooperative presumptions and that

730
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,720
that that is what is exploited um for

731
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,080
humans when they're communicating

732
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,440
um and also about the

733
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,520
the deontic value that those sorts of

734
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,320
ideas uh deontic or shared value that

735
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,720
um the idea there is that

736
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,200
we you know when in ontogeny when you

737
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:31,840
are

738
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,000
attuning to learning your culture set of

739
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,919
communicative constructions

740
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,200
what what these constructions are are

741
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,760
in speaker's brains there's um lots of

742
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,120
good work for instance from

743
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,919
someone who i like joan bybee that

744
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,440
suggests that these are very automatized

745
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,400
automatic

746
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,840
sorts of mappings between form and

747
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,679
meaning that

748
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,720
at least in their normal use don't

749
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,880
require

750
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,799
expensive heavy sorts of computations

751
00:26:58,799 --> 00:26:59,840
maybe when you're first learning them

752
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,880
they do but

753
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,480
the more you use them and exercise them

754
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,080
in actual

755
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,400
joint practice with others uh in

756
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,679
aligning mental states

757
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,520
they become very automatic and so the

758
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,880
idea of geontic value is that it

759
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,679
bypasses

760
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,240
uh the deontic value of policy bypasses

761
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,840
all the kinds of heavy computational

762
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
updates that

763
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,480
might be required by for instance

764
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,000
someone learning how to use

765
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,159
constructions but

766
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,640
yeah and instead provides a very

767
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,360
automatic mapping between

768
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,279
states so it depends how you chunk a

769
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,039
construction but

770
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,640
constructions become linked up in a very

771
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,880
automatized way and then it can be used

772
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,279
effortlessly by speakers um that's the

773
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,559
idea of at least in this case the

774
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,320
deontical shared value of certain action

775
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:42,960
policies

776
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,159
ie constructions cool and and using the

777
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:46,799
niche

778
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,279
info niche uh idea it's kind of like a

779
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,480
tragedy of the commons

780
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,960
if people pollute the environmental

781
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,600
niche

782
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,600
it doesn't work as well as it could and

783
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,360
if people pollute the informational

784
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,000
niche

785
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,159
with deceptive signaling it also doesn't

786
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,159
work so it's a the niche metaphor

787
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,039
really works well so let's think about

788
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,200
the last part of the abstract

789
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,679
in turn the alignment of mental states

790
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,039
which are prior beliefs

791
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,600
enables the emergence of a novel

792
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,360
contextualizing scale of cultural

793
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,520
dynamics that encompasses the actions

794
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,440
and mental states of the ensemble of

795
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,720
interactants and their shared

796
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,320
environments

797
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,399
the dynamics of this contextualizing

798
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,240
layer of cultural organizational

799
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,039
feedback

800
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,520
across gales acts to constrain the

801
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,000
variability of prior expectations of the

802
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,399
individuals who constitute it and then

803
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,640
just to close it with the contribution

804
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,960
our theory additionally builds upon the

805
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,320
active inference literature by

806
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,760
introducing a new set of

807
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,440
neurobiologically plausible

808
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,200
computational hypotheses

809
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,880
for cooperative communication we

810
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,480
conclude with directions for future

811
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,440
research

812
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,679
any last thoughts on the abstract or can

813
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,559
we go to the roadmap

814
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,200
cool really awesome and it just shows

815
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,559
how much there is to unpack

816
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,679
in the very distilled representation of

817
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,120
the abstract

818
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,960
so and jared i know that you have to

819
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,039
head out at some point so feel free to

820
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,120
just anyone can bounce when they need to

821
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,039
yeah i was gonna say i'm gonna i'm gonna

822
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,559
head out right now actually i have to go

823
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,640
but thanks this was this was wonderful

824
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,600
thank you for uh

825
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,679
putting us on thank you we would love to

826
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,000
have you at a future conversation too

827
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,279
so see you later thanks cool

828
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,520
so the road map of the paper now now

829
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,279
that he's gone and we can really talk

830
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,559
about the paper

831
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,760
uh it starts with an introduction part

832
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,159
two

833
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,320
is a theoretical background and they

834
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,919
cover several of the key

835
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,520
areas of background which are the

836
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,960
evolutionary origins

837
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,799
and the developmental origins of

838
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,559
cooperative communication so two

839
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,960
different time scales evo and devo

840
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,000
often called then they take

841
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,399
stock and table one summarizes some of

842
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:51,440
the key features

843
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,960
that are related to cooperative

844
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,799
communication so two

845
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,640
a b and c don't have to do with free

846
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,080
energy they don't have to do it with

847
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,039
active inference

848
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,399
this is more classical understandings of

849
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,279
cooperative communication section three

850
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:05,600
is

851
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,320
explicitly about active inference first

852
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,240
they talk about the idea of active

853
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,440
inference broadly

854
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,080
and about how adaptive priors help

855
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,240
organisms relate in the world and about

856
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,919
the idea of alignment of

857
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,360
priors within the active inference

858
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,440
framework figure 1

859
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,840
and figure 2 show active inference in

860
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,480
the world

861
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,000
as well as active inference and

862
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,679
communication in the world and we're

863
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:28,640
going to look through each one of the

864
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,720
figures one by one

865
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,799
they then turn to the topic of deontic

866
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,799
values which are shared expectations

867
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,559
about the value of policies

868
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,720
so section three takes us from what is

869
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,919
active inference

870
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,120
and why is it important for

871
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,600
communication to what is this concept

872
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,240
of deontic value in the context of the

873
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,480
active inference framework

874
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,320
then they bring it together in section

875
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,000
four where they

876
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
uh more clearly talk about human

877
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,399
communication as active inference

878
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,480
first they look at the dynamics of

879
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,240
communication at the time scale of

880
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,360
mechanism

881
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,919
which is the individual in context as

882
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:06,320
well as the dyad which is the minimum

883
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,600
communicative unit then the dynamics of

884
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,720
communication at the time

885
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,679
scale of ontogeny or development and

886
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:14,320
then

887
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,480
zooming back one more level what are the

888
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,240
dynamics of communication

889
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,440
at the time scale of cultural evolution

890
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,399
figure 3 is a really nice representation

891
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:25,200
of the

892
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,120
communication and coupled action

893
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,720
perception cycle

894
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,320
figure 4 has some examples in the bird

895
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:32,960
song

896
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,519
as well as figure five of free energy

897
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,399
minimization

898
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,279
in the case of improvisational duets and

899
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:39,600
then

900
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,440
figure five is a duet for one learning

901
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,840
to synchronize through active inference

902
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,360
they then conclude with future

903
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,440
directions and conclusions

904
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,760
so we're going to get from introductions

905
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,760
to communication from an evo devo

906
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,880
perspective

907
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,200
through the free energy principle

908
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,240
inspired

909
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,640
framework of active inference to the

910
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,399
point where we're actually making

911
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,880
useful claims about the world within

912
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,799
what we've put together in sections two

913
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,600
three four and then leading to future

914
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,440
directions what might be interesting for

915
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,960
people to study

916
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,440
any thoughts on the roadmap or can we go

917
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,080
to the table

918
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,720
and figures cool

919
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,080
so table one would anyone else like to

920
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:28,799
give this a first summary

921
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,279
i put up on the top right the remember

922
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,320
the cap time

923
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,919
figure just so that we remember that

924
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,200
these are not uh they're not conflicting

925
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,120
uh layers of analysis or scales of

926
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,360
analysis they're they're all part of one

927
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,480
integrated

928
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,760
punnett square if you will and what

929
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,240
table one does is and anyone can just

930
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,679
raise their hand if they

931
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,519
want to jump in but otherwise i'll just

932
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:52,799
kind of keep the

933
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,000
error alive table one summarizes some of

934
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,120
these key features

935
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,559
that have to do with cooperative

936
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,519
communication using the terminology

937
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,919
in many cases from the non-active

938
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,440
inference community so that's why this

939
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,960
paper is such a bridge

940
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,039
from a conceptual and even a keyword

941
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,080
perspective

942
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,880
and these four scales of analysis which

943
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,000
are reflected by

944
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,960
tin bergen's four whys are the real-time

945
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,159
mechanism

946
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,080
and the characteristic dynamics there

947
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,679
have to do with ostension

948
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,919
which means to show or clearly

949
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,279
demarcated

950
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,360
joint attention which is people looking

951
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,720
at the same thing

952
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,320
and in the human case often the the um

953
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,399
whites of the eyes surrounding the

954
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,399
colors part of the eye have been

955
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,080
discussed maybe shannon if you're

956
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,320
familiar with uh with the non-human

957
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,519
primate literature

958
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,840
i know that the non-human primate and

959
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,679
humans have quite different eyes

960
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,440
and people have speculated that has to

961
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,880
do with attention

962
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,600
um also at the real time level there's

963
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,000
the

964
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,320
optimization of relevance which is if

965
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,279
someone says okay

966
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,200
i i know this part of trigonometry you

967
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,880
can skip through that it's not relevant

968
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,360
to me

969
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,519
or that word wasn't relevant to me

970
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,960
because i don't know what it is

971
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,039
so could you could you optimize the

972
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,000
relevance of your sentence

973
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,399
by defining the word coupled

974
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,159
bidirectional information flow

975
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,159
as well as approximate motivation to

976
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,320
align and coordinate mental states

977
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,879
uh like if somebody needs something and

978
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,239
you want to make sure you have the other

979
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,199
person's attention

980
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,119
hey i'm driving and i'm thirsty can you

981
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,719
get me this water bottle

982
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,839
if the other person's not paying

983
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,239
attention then you're gonna stay thirsty

984
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,599
but if the other person is paying

985
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,839
attention it's the motivation that you

986
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,839
have to align your mental states

987
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,159
so they can get you the water bottle um

988
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,440
and there's other

989
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,199
characteristic dynamics at the time

990
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,639
scale of development

991
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,679
phylogeny as well as adaptation any

992
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,960
any remarks on this

993
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,520
um yeah i was gonna say it makes a lot

994
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,199
more sense

995
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,800
that this is jared's advisor

996
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,918
to understand better the ontogeny of

997
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,599
communication or cooperative

998
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:58,960
communication

999
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,160
so i found this an interesting um

1000
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,400
and really relevant bridge to

1001
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,359
understanding

1002
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,640
the onset of cooperative communication

1003
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,280
in a person's life as well as comparing

1004
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,680
it across species

1005
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,280
but yeah i just thought that was a

1006
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,320
very interesting and irrelevant

1007
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,720
uh connection to think about how we

1008
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,599
learn to

1009
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:27,920
uh cooperate and make our uh

1010
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,240
internal states known and that we

1011
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,760
actually

1012
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,560
are unsatisfied until we are able to

1013
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,359
make our internal states known

1014
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,240
cool stefan

1015
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,119
yeah i kind of think i always find these

1016
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,320
these

1017
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,920
these the way they link with each other

1018
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,160
kind of interesting um

1019
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,280
and kind of um

1020
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,400
could be read different ways um because

1021
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,680
you could you could the real-time

1022
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,920
mechanism could stretch out over

1023
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,599
time in terms of how you think your

1024
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,000
cooperation is going to have impact on

1025
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,200
your life um as an as an elder

1026
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,119
or as a teenager but

1027
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,560
in some ways i kind of wonder if

1028
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,520
everything in most organisms comes back

1029
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,400
down to those evolutionary priors

1030
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,920
and we're able to kind of play with

1031
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,480
um well even even a puppy is different

1032
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,280
to a full grown dog in terms of how they

1033
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,240
fit themselves into establishing their

1034
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,599
role in communication but we really do

1035
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,320
go outside of what our gut feeling tells

1036
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:34,640
us

1037
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,000
and start to sort of change the rules of

1038
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,839
the game so to speak um

1039
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,480
about causation and ontology and current

1040
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,680
utility

1041
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,720
so it's it's quite it's quite useful in

1042
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,640
terms of sort of generative

1043
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,599
discussion beyond like what this

1044
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,960
immediately says in a direct short-term

1045
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,599
interaction

1046
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,320
cool alex or yvonne any thoughts on that

1047
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,800
and and also just if you you can raise

1048
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,920
your hand if so um

1049
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,480
one other thought is the two by two kind

1050
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,599
of punnett square

1051
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,240
layout makes us think if we threw a dart

1052
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,320
it would be okay it's that's causation

1053
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,160
that's utility that's development that's

1054
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,839
evolution another

1055
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,800
spatial metaphor would be like a wave

1056
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,400
and a ripple on a wave

1057
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,599
so the big wave is evolution um and then

1058
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,680
there's smaller waves within that

1059
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,640
and so yes it totally builds on the

1060
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,320
evolutionary priors like you were just

1061
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,200
saying

1062
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,920
and it's totally about development

1063
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,680
because that never stops either

1064
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,680
and it's totally about the mechanism

1065
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,359
because without mechanism you don't have

1066
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,160
the

1067
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,160
voice box or you don't have the audio

1068
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,320
processing so it's all of those and

1069
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,760
they're all happening in an

1070
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,839
overlapping way that's not quite

1071
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:52,240
reflected by the cleanliness of this two

1072
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,160
by two or even a continuum

1073
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,760
model cool any last thoughts on the

1074
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,640
table or

1075
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,640
can we get to the figures awesome

1076
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,760
so here we are in figure one and for for

1077
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,480
team com

1078
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,520
this was a uh really a great image that

1079
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,200
we had shared a lot before this

1080
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,839
discussion

1081
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:15,440
because it brings together the skeleton

1082
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,560
of active inference in a way which is

1083
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,440
this cycle that goes from internal

1084
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,960
states which influence

1085
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,440
through policy states action states

1086
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,760
action states influence external states

1087
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,599
of the world which are also influencing

1088
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:32,160
each other

1089
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,800
but we're not too worried about those

1090
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,640
external states influence our

1091
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,680
sensory states the retina and the

1092
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,240
tympanic membrane and then the sensory

1093
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,040
states

1094
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,359
allow us to update our internal model of

1095
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,480
the world that's also

1096
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,200
generative so that's the very basic

1097
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,000
skeleton

1098
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,880
of the active inference cycle here

1099
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,240
reflected with just

1100
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,280
one agent in feedback with the world

1101
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,480
and so the the flow is always going this

1102
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:00,960
way

1103
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,280
but also it's happened all these things

1104
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,800
are happening all at once

1105
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,640
your legs are always engaged in an

1106
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,839
action state

1107
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,760
your retina is always involved in a

1108
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,200
sensory state even if your eyes are

1109
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:11,760
closed

1110
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,760
your internal states are always updating

1111
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,440
so they're all happening at once

1112
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,920
but we can kind of trace this causal

1113
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,960
diagram

1114
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,560
uh through time and then we also see

1115
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,640
represented in this image the equations

1116
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,680
and there is a level of

1117
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,839
math that is just sort of brought up in

1118
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,040
this paper and

1119
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,440
cited to other places for where people

1120
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,800
can learn more

1121
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,560
but suffice to say that each of

1122
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,000
these different uh sectors can be

1123
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,640
thought of

1124
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,880
as happening at various levels of

1125
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,240
mathematical

1126
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,040
description so in this center part of

1127
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,839
the image

1128
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,920
it shows like the the the minimal

1129
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,359
version of the

1130
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,480
uh math and then this is a little bit

1131
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:58,880
more

1132
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,520
fleshed out of an equation and then

1133
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,720
there are citations

1134
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,280
and future work to be done that really

1135
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,079
builds it out

1136
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,440
more fully so what does anyone else see

1137
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,319
in figure one

1138
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,680
i suppose not quite in figure one but in

1139
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,640
something you mentioned

1140
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,800
about the parts of your body that are

1141
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,079
doing the action they're doing the

1142
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,359
sensation

1143
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,960
um is a great skeleton like you said

1144
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,880
um but then there's all of the action

1145
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,240
that's happening

1146
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,400
constantly at sometimes consciousness at

1147
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,599
the subconscious level

1148
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,839
but likes the cods of the eyes so you're

1149
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:34,880
constantly

1150
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,640
having the small action to resample the

1151
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,400
environment or

1152
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,560
the like proprioceptive sensations of

1153
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,520
your legs

1154
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,800
so even within that larger

1155
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,319
cycle there's all of these much much

1156
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:49,040
smaller cycles happening where

1157
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,760
this perception action loop is

1158
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,880
functioning

1159
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,000
in like every part of the sensorium of

1160
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,400
your body

1161
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,599
very nice good point and this image has

1162
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,760
the sensations coming into the person

1163
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,079
and this kind of puts the black box or

1164
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,160
the markov blanket if you will

1165
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,640
around the whole person but it's

1166
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,200
actually

1167
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,640
a nested markov blanket situation so

1168
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,640
each neuron has internal states

1169
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,720
action states external states for the

1170
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,880
neuron which are other neurons

1171
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,280
other cell types and then sensations so

1172
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,480
this is something that

1173
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,800
is about the world and about people but

1174
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,599
it also

1175
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,400
exists as a skeleton whenever we want to

1176
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,839
draw the boundary around

1177
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,280
any kind of uh active inference system

1178
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,359
and thinking about communication more

1179
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:39,359
broadly than the human case is where we

1180
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:40,960
start to see oh yeah that's right

1181
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,520
um honest communication is the norm

1182
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,280
neurons don't expect each other

1183
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,480
to be deceptive sure it might happen but

1184
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,160
that's the decimal point

1185
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,319
and the real framework is about how

1186
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,240
cooperative communication goes down

1187
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,160
because adversarial relationships just

1188
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,079
don't persist over as long

1189
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,560
of time durations or spatial durations

1190
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,680
because they break down

1191
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,680
almost by definition and so thinking

1192
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,440
about this multi-level

1193
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,079
in space as well as multi-time scale

1194
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,480
kind of tying it back to the tim bergens

1195
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,760
levels um or four questions and

1196
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,640
there's a lot to this and it's awesome

1197
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,960
and one of the key contributions

1198
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,520
of the free energy principle which have

1199
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,000
to do

1200
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,079
with all of these equations that

1201
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,240
potentially despite the differences in

1202
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,359
the specifics

1203
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,920
between time scales and spatial scales

1204
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,760
and different modes of communication

1205
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,680
there may be some similar equations

1206
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,119
underlying the dynamics

1207
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,359
and that would be something quite

1208
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:39,440
fantastic

1209
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,160
so let's build on figure one to figure

1210
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:42,960
two

1211
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,680
so here we go we have the same the same

1212
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,640
colors

1213
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,280
and the same layout here if you just

1214
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:49,680
block

1215
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,040
off one side of the picture and you just

1216
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,800
look at this side for example

1217
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,800
it would be the same thing the one

1218
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,160
person with a sensory

1219
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,720
uh the action states that influence the

1220
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,359
world i guess

1221
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,440
action and sense have been flipped here

1222
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,359
it's the action states that influence

1223
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:04,160
the world

1224
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,319
and then comes back through sense to the

1225
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:07,280
person

1226
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,680
but the two key differences here first

1227
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,200
off is instead of just

1228
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,560
internal states um it's now reflecting

1229
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,319
specifically the regime of

1230
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,160
attention so that's salience or

1231
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,599
attention and

1232
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,040
it's thought it could be thought of as a

1233
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,800
subset of the total

1234
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,880
internal generative model of the world

1235
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,960
by the brain but now we're talking about

1236
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,280
what specifically the in the internal

1237
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,359
model should attention be paid to

1238
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,240
and then the key here and this is almost

1239
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,760
the genesis of team com

1240
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,800
in some senses is the world for

1241
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,720
communicating agents is other

1242
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,319
communicating agents

1243
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,119
and it's a deceptively simple conclusion

1244
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:45,440
or

1245
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,240
claim because it's one thing when you

1246
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,760
have the person in feedback with the

1247
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,319
world

1248
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:52,160
that makes it it's kind of i'm thinking

1249
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,319
about tom hanks playing ping pong

1250
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:55,359
against a wall

1251
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:58,000
it's him he's he's in feedback it's a

1252
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,839
it's a dynamical system

1253
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:03,280
but the fixedness of his opponent

1254
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,560
makes the uh moves that he makes very

1255
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,119
very

1256
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,400
uh specified and easy to determine

1257
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,359
whereas once you even get two that are

1258
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,960
communicating and they have different

1259
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,160
attention they're paying attention

1260
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,280
different things because they have

1261
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,480
different internal

1262
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,920
models all of a sudden you get these

1263
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,599
totally novel and

1264
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,480
improvisational dynamics that they call

1265
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,160
thinking through other minds

1266
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,680
any thoughts on this

1267
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,520
that was a really great tom hanks ping

1268
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,640
pong metaphor though for

1269
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,240
i mean it'd be it would be that easy if

1270
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,560
you were just typing to a chat box and

1271
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,119
then it just

1272
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,880
copied and pasted exactly what you wrote

1273
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,640
back for example it wouldn't be quite a

1274
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,000
conversation

1275
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,880
and then you could imagine speaking to a

1276
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,800
chatbot or something like that and

1277
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,240
maybe attention is playing out

1278
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,640
differently on the computer

1279
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,359
versus in your brain so the internal

1280
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:00,960
states are different but again we kind

1281
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,640
of already knew that the action states

1282
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,280
are different

1283
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,359
the point is the shared epistemic

1284
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,440
resources so the epistemic

1285
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,800
being related to the knowledge the cues

1286
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,040
for the chat box what time the message

1287
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,160
was sent or

1288
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,480
who the person who sent it was the cues

1289
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,599
and the resources

1290
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:19,760
are a shared resource they're a shared

1291
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,760
niche and then

1292
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,480
each of those uh agents depending on

1293
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,200
which sense

1294
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,520
states make it to their regime of

1295
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,640
attention

1296
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,079
are going to update their action

1297
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:31,680
policies in a different way

1298
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,440
and so one other thing i really like

1299
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,240
about this framework for communication

1300
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,880
is it highlights the the necessity and

1301
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,720
the importance of alignment

1302
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,280
but not perfect alignment it actually as

1303
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,400
a starting place

1304
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,160
takes that different people are going to

1305
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,240
be coming from different perspectives

1306
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,920
it's not that there's one correct

1307
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,920
interpretation of what person a says

1308
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,920
and if person b gets it perfectly they

1309
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,119
succeed and if they don't get it

1310
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,560
perfectly they failed

1311
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,720
it's kind of an absolutist notion of

1312
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,839
communication

1313
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:01,440
and here we take a really fully

1314
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,200
pluralist approach to communication

1315
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:03,760
where

1316
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,240
you have two communicating agents they

1317
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,920
have different internal models of the

1318
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,720
world

1319
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,880
and the communication is happening in

1320
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,400
this world that they share

1321
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,640
in the informational and in the physical

1322
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,319
niche that they share

1323
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,520
and it's actually an action-oriented

1324
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,440
interaction that the agents are engaged

1325
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,520
in that's happening as their very

1326
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,920
different internal models are aligning

1327
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,440
and so it highlights the process of

1328
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,200
alignment without

1329
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,359
being too hard on the need for a perfect

1330
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:32,800
alignment and

1331
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,520
that just in so many situations is a

1332
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,079
helpful

1333
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,359
starting point about where where am i at

1334
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,480
in this conversation

1335
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,319
where is my conversant in this

1336
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:44,560
conversation how are we going to align

1337
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:48,000
what is this alignment for any

1338
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,599
thoughts here uh

1339
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:55,119
let me try to end about maybe

1340
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:58,480
about actions because as for this model

1341
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,000
and everything is about alignment

1342
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,680
of the models and actions are like not

1343
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,200
side effects

1344
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,119
but not a primary one for example if a

1345
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,480
team or a company speaking about playing

1346
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,760
actions some kind of strategies

1347
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,800
or something like this

1348
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,839
basically it's again about alignments

1349
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:24,800
and that's why

1350
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,319
if a company or team want

1351
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,160
to develop something or make some

1352
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,839
research

1353
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:35,040
it's need to planning recursively

1354
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,400
not from actions but from

1355
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,319
models and alignments

1356
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:44,880
yeah and to kind of give an example that

1357
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,839
if we were uh

1358
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,760
working together on a team to build a

1359
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,760
car the goal isn't to

1360
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,720
align on what the perfect car would be

1361
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,280
the goal

1362
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,520
is the action of actually making that

1363
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,800
car happen

1364
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,160
and that's going to require us to

1365
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,480
synchronize on mental states but also

1366
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,119
contribute

1367
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,599
our unique skills and perspectives and

1368
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:04,400
then to give

1369
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,839
one more example about action um

1370
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:10,800
declarative speech is an action it's an

1371
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,880
action it's a motor behavior it has to

1372
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,640
do with the way that muscles move so

1373
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,119
speech

1374
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:17,520
is an action this is one action that

1375
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,880
results in speed in

1376
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,240
sound clapping but their body actions

1377
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,960
that result in different cues and so

1378
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:25,599
placing

1379
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,280
speech uh fundamentally as an action

1380
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,079
state it helps us get away from this um

1381
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:32,960
well you have

1382
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,200
acts and then you have speech but of

1383
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,240
course there are speech

1384
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,359
acts and speech is an action and in

1385
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:42,240
pure conversation where the feedback is

1386
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,160
happening through conversation

1387
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,240
uh it gives us that same uh

1388
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,480
action-oriented uh model that we can

1389
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,280
apply

1390
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,680
to non-linguistic systems and now we're

1391
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,960
thinking about speech

1392
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,680
as an action in a communicating system

1393
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,640
so we can really

1394
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,880
build on the strengths of linguistics

1395
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,400
like jared was talking about

1396
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,800
without overly making it about the

1397
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,960
specifics of any human

1398
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,800
communication style or even a cultural

1399
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,400
communication style because

1400
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,319
speech is again just one of the many

1401
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:13,760
multi-faceted ways

1402
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,160
that we share information and that we

1403
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,520
call people's attention to different

1404
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,319
features of the world

1405
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:22,880
any thoughts on figure 2 or anything

1406
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,920
else any questions yeah stefan

1407
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,599
i think this is all this is also good

1408
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:29,760
for bringing

1409
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:34,079
um action into what language is about

1410
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,520
like action is out there in amongst the

1411
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:41,119
world as part of sort of interacting

1412
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,400
with

1413
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,240
rather than being these representations

1414
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,720
in the minds that codify everything

1415
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,760
so i think it's quite um it's quite

1416
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,680
useful to see that and see the world in

1417
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,559
the background

1418
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:55,680
um so yeah one thing i find in some ways

1419
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:56,880
i'll always be interested to see if

1420
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,280
there was a triad here to see how that

1421
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,559
would play out

1422
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:03,200
because because that might really bring

1423
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:03,920
that out

1424
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,960
um but it is interesting that the

1425
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,760
descriptions you were given there around

1426
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,559
how things are unfolding and i i didn't

1427
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:14,400
haven't quite unpacked all the equations

1428
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,520
but i think there's something

1429
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,000
useful in like there's something about

1430
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,480
the epistemic resources and more like

1431
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,640
general complex adaptive systems which

1432
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,400
maybe aren't entirely stable

1433
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,240
but kind of they're interacting and

1434
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,760
bounces off each other

1435
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,119
and the more internal stuff is much more

1436
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:34,319
noisy non-linear and

1437
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:37,040
it's a sort of achievement between like

1438
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,880
entities in the environment

1439
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,319
bouncing with each other and our kind of

1440
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:45,440
non-linear kind of free energy trying to

1441
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,040
understand what's that all about by

1442
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,119
minimizing free energy so i think

1443
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,720
this is actually quite there's quite a

1444
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,240
lot that can be played around

1445
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,680
awesome um yeah i agree about the the

1446
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,319
getting more than two actors so we can

1447
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:01,200
imagine another

1448
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,760
yellow box up here and through action

1449
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,359
states it's contributing to the

1450
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:07,680
epistemic resource and we can be

1451
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,000
super specific let's think about this

1452
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,119
video chat

1453
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:13,920
so the action states are what people are

1454
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:14,960
speaking about

1455
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,880
and the sensory states are happening to

1456
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,880
me through my eyes

1457
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,240
as i look at the screen and through my

1458
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,240
ears as i'm listening and

1459
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,760
through the sensations that i'm

1460
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,599
receiving i'm updating the regime of

1461
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:26,240
attention

1462
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,040
when i see a little uh cue an ostentive

1463
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,000
cue like a little

1464
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,480
blue box around the speaker that's

1465
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,760
putting my attention

1466
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,480
to not just where i should be looking

1467
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,040
but

1468
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,800
conceptually what i should be paying

1469
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,240
attention to

1470
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:43,280
um and then it also relates to the

1471
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,319
hermeneutics idea that jared was

1472
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:47,200
bringing up

1473
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,440
and so i'm imagining this epistemic

1474
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,760
resource our shared informational niche

1475
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,839
is we're all seeing basically the same

1476
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,200
six boxes

1477
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,000
on our screen our shared informational

1478
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:58,960
resources

1479
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,760
are identical and we can in a computer

1480
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,599
system even know that they're identical

1481
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:06,319
but each one of us are going to unpack

1482
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:07,359
in a different way

1483
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:09,359
what is being said and so it's like the

1484
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:10,400
book's on the table

1485
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,079
and someone says the meaning is in the

1486
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:13,440
book well it's not

1487
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,960
technically in the book it's not

1488
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,640
physically contained in the book that's

1489
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,079
a spatial metaphor that it's

1490
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:21,040
in the book and so where is the meaning

1491
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,160
well if the meaning

1492
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,720
is in the relationship between the

1493
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,240
regime of attention

1494
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,480
and the shared epistemic resources well

1495
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,359
then you get

1496
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:31,440
almost pluralism for free you get this

1497
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,880
idea that different people

1498
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,280
are going to by looking into the book in

1499
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,640
their own unique way they're going to

1500
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,720
unpack the book differently

1501
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,000
maybe one person doesn't read the

1502
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,319
language and so the book doesn't reduce

1503
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:44,319
their uncertainty about anything

1504
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:46,640
but for someone else who's very familiar

1505
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,839
with the work of the

1506
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:50,720
author potentially they can read between

1507
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:51,680
the lines

1508
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,079
and even see things or unpack things in

1509
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:55,040
the book that aren't

1510
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,760
directly there and so we get all these

1511
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,720
amazing

1512
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,680
special cases and and uh richness of

1513
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:02,800
communication

1514
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,359
coming out within this scaffold and so

1515
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:07,280
again just to go from figure one

1516
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,839
where okay this is just the minimal

1517
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:10,559
possible

1518
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,880
active inference cycle just external

1519
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,240
states internal states

1520
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,920
and then the markov blanket is being

1521
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,359
pierced on the inbound

1522
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:19,119
by sense and being pierced on the

1523
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:20,720
outbound by action

1524
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,040
let's just zoom one layer out now we're

1525
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,720
looking at the dyad

1526
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,839
and also we can just say the dyad's not

1527
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:28,640
just their

1528
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,880
um dissipating energy for nothing

1529
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,040
they're communicating to a line on

1530
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:33,760
something

1531
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,000
we're here to reduce our uncertainty

1532
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,160
about this paper and about the free

1533
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,359
energy principle about

1534
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:42,000
active inference um as well as other

1535
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:42,559
goals

1536
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,559
and so all of this is already starting

1537
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:45,599
to come out just

1538
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,480
as we qualitatively look at it and i

1539
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,079
agree that the mathematics

1540
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:53,119
uh of complex adaptive systems and

1541
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:55,040
free energy principle provide a lot of

1542
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,839
those non-linear dynamics that we

1543
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:59,599
would want to see for a formal

1544
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:01,680
communicative framework

1545
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,599
i think it's a good time to show figure

1546
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:05,040
three this is

1547
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,040
the last figure in this sequence of

1548
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,079
three

1549
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:11,599
so here we're kind of just um specifying

1550
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:13,520
uh again just drawing out again this

1551
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,599
communication between two brains

1552
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,920
and it's one canonical loop of the

1553
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,599
coupled action perception cycle

1554
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,359
so we're keeping in mind it's always

1555
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:22,880
happening continuously

1556
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,800
and we're just going to trace out one

1557
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,319
loop it's kind of like we

1558
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:28,400
inject a little dye into the river we're

1559
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,839
just going to look at the trace as it

1560
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:32,000
goes just through one small part to get

1561
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,040
a bigger

1562
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,240
sense about the flow so it starts with

1563
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,760
my idea and my idea is going to

1564
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:40,480
influence

1565
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,799
my behavior that my behavior is going to

1566
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:46,960
fill out or pour into that epistemic

1567
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,720
niche my behavior in this case

1568
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,599
is a vocal behavior and then through our

1569
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:53,680
shared informational niche

1570
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,839
my behavior is going to result i mean

1571
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:56,720
this arrow

1572
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,280
you can imagine putting in other steps

1573
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,880
intermediating here like

1574
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,400
going through the ear and going through

1575
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,160
this cortex and that cortex

1576
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,960
but just broadly my behavior will result

1577
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:07,280
in

1578
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,400
your version of my idea i said grab a

1579
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,280
gallon of milk

1580
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,280
and use you got it okay i got it a

1581
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,400
gallon of milk

1582
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,680
your version of my idea is going to

1583
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,680
uh result in combination this is the x

1584
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,240
your ideas and your version of my idea

1585
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,440
come together

1586
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,200
and that is going to influence your

1587
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,040
behavior then

1588
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,040
we're back right where we started where

1589
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,040
your behavior is going to say

1590
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:36,480
ah okay right they said exactly the

1591
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,920
thing that i wanted from the grocery

1592
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,240
store back to me so their behavior

1593
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,720
suggested that the attentional regime

1594
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:43,599
was there

1595
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:45,440
that the semantic content of what i

1596
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,280
wanted to convey was their

1597
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,680
i'm pretty convinced that my

1598
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,480
understanding

1599
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,520
of what you thought i said was accurate

1600
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:57,040
aka the alignment was adequate

1601
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,640
doesn't need to be perfect but for the

1602
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,319
purposes of that communication

1603
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:03,520
the alignment was adequate and then my

1604
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:04,319
ideas

1605
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,400
and how i perceived your perception of

1606
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,000
them combined

1607
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,680
again in the generative model the brain

1608
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,280
and that's going to influence behavior i

1609
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,200
say okay great glad you got it here's

1610
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:13,839
five bucks

1611
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:15,920
go ahead and do this so this is just

1612
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,119
tracing one loop

1613
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:20,160
but already we get so many of these cool

1614
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,920
patterns and ways to think about how

1615
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,119
different sources of

1616
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:26,799
prior information like my idea your idea

1617
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:30,160
relate to the uh just in time

1618
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,400
information that we receive everyone has

1619
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,000
years and years and years of their own

1620
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:34,720
thinking

1621
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,240
and then someone says hey what do you

1622
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,079
think about this policy

1623
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:39,680
and they're combining this recent

1624
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,760
sensory information from the person

1625
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,040
asking the question

1626
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:46,400
with a really big and rich sensory

1627
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,799
regenerative model of the world and so

1628
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:50,960
we we can capture that short term

1629
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,960
information as well as these deeper

1630
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,040
developmental and evolutionary aspects

1631
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:55,440
of

1632
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,599
of thought together in this type of a

1633
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,480
model

1634
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,200
and again it's just a wireframe but what

1635
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:01,680
does this

1636
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,079
um lead anyone to think about or what

1637
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:04,799
what might be

1638
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:06,720
uh uncertainty that some of our

1639
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,400
listeners would have about this

1640
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:13,839
figure one two three sequence

1641
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:23,680
yeah shannon i suppose in this figure

1642
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:24,839
one two three sequence

1643
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:27,760
um everything seems like this event

1644
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:28,640
right now

1645
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,680
um and what's left out is this iterative

1646
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,880
process

1647
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,000
um so like going through the

1648
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,680
these chains of language learners

1649
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,599
and as you get to the end you might get

1650
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:43,680
a simple

1651
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,160
construction by the time you get to the

1652
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:46,880
end

1653
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,160
or chains of interactions between people

1654
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,200
where my idea is continuously being just

1655
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,960
slightly adjusted by your version of my

1656
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,319
idea which slightly adjusts

1657
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:59,520
each other node in this figure until

1658
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:03,119
we as a dyad um sort of start to align

1659
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:06,160
on the like sort of

1660
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,760
final state or something of our

1661
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,680
interaction um

1662
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,520
which is brought up a lot in the paper

1663
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,839
but it's not

1664
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:15,520
it's not super clear just from seeing

1665
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,119
these these three figures sort of in a

1666
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,520
sequence

1667
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:23,200
yep anyone else there maybe

1668
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,280
sasha how do you think this relates to

1669
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,319
improvisation

1670
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:30,960
or where improvisation takes interactors

1671
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,000
um yeah i i quite like this figure

1672
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,440
um adding the extra or

1673
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,000
kind of the next logical step that um

1674
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,680
it's about

1675
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,480
not just how i'm expressing my idea but

1676
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,400
what is your version

1677
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:50,079
of the idea that i'm expressing um

1678
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:54,240
and yeah i think it's

1679
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:58,559
um yeah very relevant for

1680
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:01,760
uh improvisation and i'm just thinking

1681
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:02,960
of like context

1682
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,240
uh specific clues that we get from

1683
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:10,559
iterative interactions and um

1684
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:12,400
i'm thinking like almost like a secret

1685
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,000
language you know that

1686
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,200
you'd be able to speak in code

1687
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,280
once you did it once to the person you

1688
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,599
would know what these words mean

1689
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,880
kind of going forward but um

1690
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,400
as shannon mentioned like that wouldn't

1691
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,480
be captured in in this

1692
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:32,319
um in this figure uh precisely

1693
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:35,520
um or explicitly um

1694
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,160
but to know that uh when you're in this

1695
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,040
location

1696
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,559
you call something by a secret code name

1697
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:44,960
um these are the kinds of things that

1698
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,400
are really important

1699
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,599
for communication that wouldn't make

1700
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:52,480
sense in another context or place in

1701
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,720
your life

1702
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,280
cool one other thought and i wouldn't

1703
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,119
quite characterize active inference as

1704
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:00,960
an optimistic theory i i don't know if

1705
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,400
it's optimistic or not but

1706
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,400
what i really like as far as a starting

1707
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,079
point for our uh

1708
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:09,440
often discordant world is it starts

1709
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,520
from a notion that everybody has a

1710
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,880
unique perspective

1711
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,799
and through shared resources they're

1712
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:16,480
coming into alignment

1713
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,480
and that's why we need intercultural

1714
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,520
communication and

1715
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,280
non-violent communication all these

1716
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,720
types of ideas

1717
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,960
whereas the other way to think about

1718
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,000
communication

1719
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,200
would be somebody has the true idea of

1720
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:29,920
what this

1721
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,359
ism is you know socialism is x and if

1722
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:34,960
this person has the true one or this

1723
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,880
book has the true one and then

1724
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,280
those who diverge from it it's an error

1725
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,200
term and so instead of thinking about an

1726
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,720
absolutely correct

1727
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,200
idea and then divergence that different

1728
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,640
individuals have

1729
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,319
whether a person is the one who holds

1730
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:50,000
the absolute truth or whether no one has

1731
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,839
the absolute truth and everybody's deep

1732
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,200
in the error term

1733
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,359
we can just think about meeting people

1734
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:56,480
where they are

1735
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,240
starting with the states that people

1736
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,680
actually have

1737
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,240
instead of um starting from some

1738
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,599
hypothesized perfect

1739
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:05,280
state and then trying to bring people

1740
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,640
into alignment there

1741
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,720
i think it's just a very helpful idea

1742
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,240
and the secret language

1743
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,240
and the intermodal to kind of put one

1744
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,079
more finish on that

1745
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:16,880
if somebody puts their um scare quotes

1746
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,160
on the video

1747
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,760
uh with their fingers which is a

1748
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,400
non-verbal cue that suggests i'm using

1749
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,119
this term

1750
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:25,200
ironically or it could mean different

1751
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,559
things but

1752
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:28,160
importantly it might mean different

1753
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,680
things in different cultures

1754
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:32,079
so one might want to be very careful

1755
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:33,440
when they're using

1756
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,839
non-verbal or secret or culturally

1757
01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:37,280
specific cues

1758
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,119
because if someone's not looking at your

1759
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:41,040
video square the second that you make

1760
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:42,480
those scare quotes

1761
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,640
or you lag out for a second in the

1762
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,799
context of online communication

1763
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:50,160
your semantic content will not

1764
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,319
update their model appropriately they

1765
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:53,680
may think that you're saying something

1766
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,440
that's quite the opposite of what you

1767
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,720
intended to say

1768
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,039
and so a lot of the times when people

1769
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:01,520
are talking about how to improve

1770
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,920
the communication throughput in online

1771
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:04,960
meetings

1772
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,119
and there's distraction that's kind of

1773
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:08,480
the opposite of attention there's all

1774
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,160
these issues that confront online

1775
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,760
meetings and online teams

1776
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,359
and people will say well use the body

1777
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:15,359
language and use nonverbal cues

1778
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:18,319
and yeah it's important to use those to

1779
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:20,640
the extent you can but also

1780
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,400
within this framework we can already

1781
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,559
start to think about some cases where

1782
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:25,200
maybe that

1783
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,280
wouldn't help as much as we thought

1784
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,520
especially when we're in the challenging

1785
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,839
communication contexts like low

1786
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:32,720
bandwidth

1787
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:35,280
or different language speakers so these

1788
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,400
are the communication

1789
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,640
uh scenarios where we actually want to

1790
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,799
have useful theory

1791
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:42,559
we don't just want to describe the easy

1792
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:43,920
low-hanging fruit of

1793
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,760
two people who are twins and speak the

1794
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,920
same language and read the same books we

1795
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,039
want to talk about

1796
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:50,480
the professor who's speaking with a

1797
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,799
child about math and we want to get them

1798
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:55,520
together on the same vocabulary and cut

1799
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,680
those are the communication scenarios

1800
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,640
that really

1801
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:01,200
are meaningful to explore and the ones

1802
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,640
that are so natural

1803
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:06,000
to this skeleton but are not as easy to

1804
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,799
model in other frameworks

1805
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,880
um any other thoughts on this figure

1806
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,400
yeah stefan

1807
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,400
yeah i think it's like you just

1808
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,599
mentioned in fact that they say

1809
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:17,039
canonical

1810
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:20,400
like this feels like it makes more sense

1811
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,000
for deductive thinking

1812
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,559
that you're trying to line up because

1813
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:25,920
just having the brain there

1814
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,559
obviously that kind of sort of it's it's

1815
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:30,000
in this kind of

1816
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,599
slightly disembodied slight way and

1817
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:36,400
so okay i have a deducted idea and then

1818
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:37,440
he was like okay what

1819
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,480
is that and this this could make sense

1820
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,640
now if we're gonna ground it more in

1821
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,240
like my state

1822
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:47,280
or my embodied

1823
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:50,000
um feeling about something more

1824
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,920
generally if i'm working in a more

1825
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,880
iterative or inductive way or trying to

1826
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:55,359
sort of

1827
01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:58,559
feel the situation abductively i don't

1828
01:03:58,559 --> 01:03:59,680
know if this

1829
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,680
probably would be quite how i would

1830
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,200
maybe one of the other diagrams is more

1831
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,240
appropriate but this

1832
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,480
may be that idea that an idea pops out

1833
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,240
which would probably be a deontic

1834
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,880
or you know deductive here's a new

1835
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,200
equation and now it's like tick tick

1836
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,799
tick tick tick you can imagine it being

1837
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:18,319
a bit more schematic like this

1838
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:22,000
nice agreed and um the five e's

1839
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,599
uh that are sometimes brought up in

1840
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:25,200
these papers inactive

1841
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,079
embodied and cultured all these ways

1842
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:29,599
that go beyond just

1843
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:32,960
idea teleporting into another idea

1844
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,440
that is uh it's not even like that's the

1845
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,200
payload of communication

1846
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,880
it's just we can come at it from the

1847
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,400
other side by thinking okay what are the

1848
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,319
bodies doing what is actually being

1849
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:45,039
perceived in that embodied

1850
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:47,680
setting and then yeah the ideas are

1851
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:48,240
there

1852
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:50,720
but um we could just as well have had

1853
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,359
two

1854
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:53,440
stick figures instead of two brains

1855
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,039
because or we could have had a stick

1856
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,720
figure over here for my behavior or

1857
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,079
mouth or something

1858
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:00,640
so let's go to figure four and five

1859
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,359
which are

1860
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:05,280
closer to empirical uh figures

1861
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,280
and these are specifically in the

1862
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,119
context of birdsong

1863
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:12,160
so here's the upper part of

1864
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:15,599
figure four and what is

1865
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:17,440
happening here anyone wanna just

1866
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,720
describe what they

1867
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:23,839
see when they look at this

1868
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:29,039
well on the x-axis of these diagrams

1869
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:32,000
yeah sasha go ahead

1870
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,640
um yeah so this is looking at um

1871
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,839
birdsong improvisation and

1872
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,880
um sound is a really nice way to do that

1873
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,079
because

1874
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:47,280
you can have a kind of a dimensional

1875
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,720
reduction

1876
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:52,960
and look at just the outgoing sounds

1877
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,200
um instead of trying to analyze like

1878
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,680
body posture and interaction which is

1879
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:01,280
um quite challenging and um

1880
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:04,319
when uh

1881
01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:07,119
birds sing together versus sing singing

1882
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:08,000
alone

1883
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,520
um we might imagine that um

1884
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,920
we could take the two of them singing

1885
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,920
alone and average it out

1886
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:18,480
or something like that that could be um

1887
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:19,920
one possible outcome

1888
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:23,599
of when we put them together um

1889
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:28,079
and then the other outcomes are that

1890
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:30,480
they improvise and create something

1891
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,000
completely different

1892
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,039
that isn't just the average of the two

1893
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:38,960
agents yes so from the caption

1894
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,760
it says two birds endowed with prior

1895
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:42,720
expectations

1896
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:45,200
about the hidden states generating a

1897
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,240
shared birdsong

1898
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,760
narrative and i love that they called

1899
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,359
the sheriff bird song

1900
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:51,760
narrative um the way that it works it

1901
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,680
says sing for two seconds and then

1902
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,280
listen for a response so that's why

1903
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,440
on the x-axis here where we have time in

1904
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,039
seconds you have one

1905
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:00,960
two in blue and then listen for response

1906
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,200
one two listen for a response

1907
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,440
the posterior expectations so that's

1908
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,359
after the priors have been updated what

1909
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:09,039
you get are posteriors

1910
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:10,960
the posterior expectations for the first

1911
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,319
bird are shown in red

1912
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:14,319
and expectations for the second bird are

1913
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:16,640
shown in blue both as a function of time

1914
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,640
the left panel shows the chaotic and

1915
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:20,480
uncoupled dynamics when the birds cannot

1916
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:20,799
hear

1917
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:22,400
each other while the right panel shows

1918
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,000
the synchrony in the hidden states that

1919
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
emerges when the birds exchange sensory

1920
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:26,640
signals

1921
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:29,119
so the the left image is kind of like

1922
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:30,720
two people they're in two recording

1923
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:31,359
studios

1924
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:33,039
that are separated they can't hear each

1925
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:35,200
other and they're both singing a song

1926
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:38,640
it's a call and response song and under

1927
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,039
the uh model or the ecosystem where

1928
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:42,160
they're not sharing

1929
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,240
a shared informational niche they're in

1930
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,240
two isolated recording studios

1931
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,000
there would be no expectation that the

1932
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,440
turn taking would happen

1933
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,280
um if if someone took off their

1934
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:53,200
headphones and just was talking randomly

1935
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,119
there'd be no expectation of turn taking

1936
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:57,760
in fact to be quite impossible and so in

1937
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:58,400
this

1938
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,480
singing alone like singing alone with

1939
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,319
two of the birds who are both seeing to

1940
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:03,520
themself

1941
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:06,160
um you see that there's basically uh

1942
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:06,559
there's

1943
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:09,119
there's strong discordances where the

1944
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:10,960
one bird is like okay i'm gonna sing now

1945
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,079
and the other one's like i'm gonna sing

1946
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:12,799
now

1947
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:15,039
and also just um i think this is more of

1948
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:16,080
a schematic

1949
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,000
but let's just think about this as like

1950
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,679
a prefrontal cortex

1951
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:21,520
this is where the higher order thought

1952
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:22,719
is happening

1953
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:24,799
and then this is like a motor cortex

1954
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:26,080
this is where the speech is being

1955
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:26,719
generated

1956
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:29,759
between um the more basal regions of the

1957
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:30,399
brain

1958
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:32,399
and the more cognitive elements so on

1959
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:34,399
this left side we have the bird

1960
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:37,279
is singing it's it's um infer it's

1961
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:39,120
deciding when to sing and also listening

1962
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,880
for a response but it's not hearing any

1963
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,399
response so it's uncoupled

1964
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:45,198
you get uncoordinated dynamics however

1965
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:45,759
when you

1966
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:48,799
allow for the birds to sing together you

1967
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:49,198
see

1968
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:51,279
that they can synchronize so that they

1969
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:53,040
can actually um

1970
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,679
communicate and really importantly it's

1971
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,439
not enough just to have the two

1972
01:08:57,439 --> 01:08:59,839
singers in the same recording studio or

1973
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:01,359
have them listening to the same

1974
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:04,399
sounds they actually have to have priors

1975
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:06,319
that they want to strive towards

1976
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:08,158
alignment because if someone says

1977
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:10,158
yeah yeah yeah this is a turn-taking

1978
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:12,319
song but i don't care about that

1979
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,560
well then you're also going to get the

1980
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,960
emergence of uncoordinated behavior

1981
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,198
so you need the sensory coupling which

1982
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:20,000
takes place through

1983
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,040
the shared informational niche and the

1984
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,479
adaptive prior

1985
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:26,880
that the person or the bird that you're

1986
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,158
communicating with

1987
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:30,960
is an agent like you who also wants to

1988
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,080
synchronize

1989
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,479
because that's the cooperative part if

1990
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:35,679
you're prior about your

1991
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:38,560
your um conversions is that they don't

1992
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:39,839
want to synchronize or that they're not

1993
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:40,880
going to synchronize

1994
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,960
well then you might not synchronize with

1995
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,040
them you might not give them the opening

1996
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,158
to synchronize

1997
01:09:46,158 --> 01:09:47,839
so when we start from this place of

1998
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:49,759
communicative communicate or

1999
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:51,600
cooperative communication that means

2000
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,759
we're going to need that sense

2001
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:56,719
coming to the person appropriately so

2002
01:09:56,719 --> 01:09:58,480
that they can turn take

2003
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,560
but then at an internal generative model

2004
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,080
level we also want to have

2005
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:04,960
this deep prior about our communication

2006
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,719
that we want to synchronize

2007
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:09,199
and so a lot of the later work after

2008
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:10,080
this paper

2009
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,640
has gone into this more about how

2010
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:13,520
individuals

2011
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:16,560
who just want to believe or want to

2012
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:17,040
reduce

2013
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:19,199
uncertainty about a higher order entity

2014
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:20,640
that they belong to

2015
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,880
that is what can actually lead to group

2016
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:23,840
formation

2017
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,560
so this is a really interesting uh

2018
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,440
concept

2019
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,840
any thoughts on the top half of figure

2020
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,120
four or can we jump to the bottom of

2021
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:33,199
figure four

2022
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:36,159
cool so here we are on the bottom of

2023
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:37,199
figure four

2024
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:41,520
and on these plots though the x-axis

2025
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:44,159
is the second level expectations which

2026
01:10:44,159 --> 01:10:45,760
is like what you expect to be hearing

2027
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,280
the first level i believe is referring

2028
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,199
to what um like i'm

2029
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:51,040
my first level expectations of my speech

2030
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,480
are just what i'm generating

2031
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,640
whereas the second level expectations is

2032
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:55,600
what do they think

2033
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:58,480
um what do i think that my conversant is

2034
01:10:58,480 --> 01:10:59,280
getting

2035
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:02,239
and so on the x-axis of both of these

2036
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:04,640
plots are the second level expectations

2037
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:05,679
of the first bird

2038
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:07,679
and the y-axis is the second level

2039
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:09,679
expectations of the second bird

2040
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:12,159
so here what's being communicated is a

2041
01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:12,960
number between

2042
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:15,199
negative 20 and 60. but it's just a

2043
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,080
number line so

2044
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,159
yeah how how many uh or what's the price

2045
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:20,480
of oil today negative 20 to 60.

2046
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,400
we're trying to reduce our uncertainty

2047
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:23,679
about this shared

2048
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:26,880
niche and what we're seeing is um

2049
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:29,440
we can just go to the right side first

2050
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:32,320
the y equals x line this one to one line

2051
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,400
would mean the second level expectations

2052
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,640
of the first bird is negative 10

2053
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,679
and the second bird got negative 10. so

2054
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:40,320
this line

2055
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:43,120
represents points on this line represent

2056
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,480
where there's an alignment of

2057
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:45,520
communication

2058
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:47,199
because the expectations of the first

2059
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:49,199
bird are aligned with the expectations

2060
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:50,560
of the second bird

2061
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:53,360
and we can see it really clearly on this

2062
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,199
right side when they're synchronized

2063
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:56,560
that whether the value being

2064
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,320
communicated is negative

2065
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:01,199
10 or whether it's 50 or 60 it's a

2066
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:02,719
dynamical system so we're still getting

2067
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:04,560
a trace that kind of flows above and

2068
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:05,840
beyond the line

2069
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,719
but we're spending most of our time on

2070
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:10,880
alignment about what is being said

2071
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,760
but if we go back to this isolated case

2072
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,600
where there's no sensory coupling and

2073
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,320
there's no

2074
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,880
ability for even if there were a deep

2075
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,719
prior that said i want to be aligned

2076
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:22,239
with another bird

2077
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:24,320
we're spending as much time off of this

2078
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,480
y equals x line as we are spending near

2079
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:26,960
it

2080
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,280
because the birds are just uncoordinated

2081
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:30,320
in their singing

2082
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,719
and so this is just showing this is what

2083
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:34,480
happens when you don't have alignment

2084
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,159
and this is what happens when you have

2085
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:38,880
synchronization and a manifold

2086
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:41,920
is a lower dimensional line let's just

2087
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:43,120
go with for now

2088
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,600
that is a dimensional compression from a

2089
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:46,560
higher dimension

2090
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,480
so the points are in very higher

2091
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,480
dimensional space but when you put them

2092
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:51,760
down on the two-dimensional piece of

2093
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,360
paper it makes a parabola

2094
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,040
or in this case it's a higher

2095
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,560
dimensional space

2096
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:59,360
of two dimensions the expectations of

2097
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:00,320
the two birds

2098
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:03,280
yet it exists or it at least converges

2099
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:03,840
towards

2100
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,760
this one-dimensional manifold which is

2101
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:08,080
just a line representing

2102
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:11,040
from negative 20 to 60 what the actual

2103
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,800
communicated state is

2104
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,120
so this is just another a phase space

2105
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:16,880
dynamical representation

2106
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,719
of what alignment looks like in the

2107
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:20,239
uncoordinated case

2108
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:21,760
and then in the coordinated case where

2109
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,840
you have sensory coupling and those deep

2110
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,320
priors for alignment any thoughts on

2111
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,639
this one

2112
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,120
cool let's just go to five so that we

2113
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:32,400
can finish the figures

2114
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:36,000
and have any last thoughts okay anyone

2115
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,440
want to take a first stab

2116
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,199
on figure five what is being

2117
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:42,000
communicated here

2118
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,400
so in the caption of the figure it

2119
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,040
writes

2120
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:51,360
a shows changes in the posterior

2121
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,520
expectations of an order parameter for

2122
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,520
the first bird in blue and a second bird

2123
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:56,239
in green

2124
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:57,920
determining the chaotic structure of the

2125
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,159
songs depicted in figure four

2126
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:02,000
and so and it's as a function of the

2127
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,600
number of exchanges so here

2128
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,800
the x-axis isn't the time in seconds

2129
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,800
with the two seconds of singing two

2130
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,000
seconds of listening

2131
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,920
now we're gonna those that two seconds

2132
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:13,360
of singing and listening we're going to

2133
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,000
condense that

2134
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,239
into one exchange so now we're kind of

2135
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:17,760
thinking in that iterated

2136
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:20,320
um way so we're starting to get towards

2137
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:21,840
iterated communication

2138
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,800
here by condensing through time and

2139
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,719
almost looking at kairos rather than

2140
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:28,560
kronos

2141
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:32,239
and then we have this uh value of a

2142
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:35,760
of a order parameter and uh

2143
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:38,800
yes so we have an order parameter and

2144
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,880
what we see is that the order parameter

2145
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:42,880
starts off high

2146
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,040
again the green and the blue are the two

2147
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,080
birds

2148
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:49,280
and the green bird is starting

2149
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:52,159
starts higher organization in both of

2150
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:54,000
these traces the more dim one

2151
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,520
the learning alone which is these two

2152
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,239
dimmer traces and this the

2153
01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:00,719
line represents the the mean of these

2154
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:01,840
simulations and the

2155
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:05,920
the shaded area represents the um 90

2156
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:07,920
bayesian confidence intervals just to

2157
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,199
clarify that

2158
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:11,679
so we can start up here this green bird

2159
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:12,560
starts at

2160
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,960
perfectly ordered and then the blue bird

2161
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:15,760
starts at

2162
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:18,719
0.5 so a little bit more disorder maybe

2163
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:20,400
this is like a mentoring relationship

2164
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:23,040
between a more encultured bird and a

2165
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,120
younger bird who's on to genetically

2166
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,800
learning how to communicate

2167
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,920
and what we see is that when we have

2168
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,400
the ability to learn together that the

2169
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:33,520
order parameter

2170
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,640
stays high and we can actually

2171
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:40,000
increase the order of disordered agents

2172
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,080
so for example if five of us had a

2173
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,520
really good internet connection and one

2174
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:45,679
person was lagging a lot

2175
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:48,560
through cues we could help order the

2176
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,560
person's communication even if they had

2177
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:51,360
lack

2178
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:55,040
however if we learn alone then

2179
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:56,560
the order parameter even though it

2180
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:59,040
starts very high for the green bird and

2181
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,520
a medium for the bluebird in both cases

2182
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:03,280
you get this exponential decay

2183
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:06,719
so that after 30 bouts so 30 times 4

2184
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:07,280
seconds

2185
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:10,480
30 exchanges 30 choruses you have

2186
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,880
zero correlation the order parameter is

2187
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:13,600
zero

2188
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,000
because they started out like partially

2189
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,040
synchronized just by

2190
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,120
happenstance like you told the two

2191
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:20,480
singers in the two different recording

2192
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,080
studios okay start singing

2193
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:24,480
and initially they started just by

2194
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:25,520
coincidence

2195
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,239
synchronized but rapidly that decays and

2196
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:30,080
it decays monotonically there's no

2197
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:31,600
chance they're ever going to recoup

2198
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,120
alignment because they're not

2199
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,960
coordinated but again

2200
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:37,840
if you are coordinated you can learn

2201
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:38,560
together

2202
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,880
and just like sasha was saying um when

2203
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:43,360
you have improvisation and feedback

2204
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:45,040
it's not just that the green parameter

2205
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:47,520
stays at one and the blue one converges

2206
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:48,159
toward it

2207
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:50,159
it's actually that the two converge

2208
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:51,679
together and they meet in the middle

2209
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:52,719
which is just so

2210
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:55,280
um reflective of communication and we're

2211
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:56,640
getting this just from

2212
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:59,600
birdsong this isn't at the semantic

2213
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:00,640
level this isn't

2214
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:04,800
at any other higher order level sasha

2215
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,920
um this also makes me think of um like

2216
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:08,719
you know the two

2217
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:11,040
birds uh teaching each other the the

2218
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:13,280
song or coming to a kind of more ordered

2219
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:14,080
state

2220
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:16,640
and mentoring relationships as well as

2221
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:17,760
teams

2222
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:21,440
um and while i think um people

2223
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,199
kind of intuitively understand that

2224
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:24,960
there's going to be um

2225
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:27,440
some sort of meeting in the middle

2226
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:30,159
linguistically to describe it um

2227
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:34,320
but how to rise to that highest order

2228
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:37,840
um and how to converge on something that

2229
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:38,480
is

2230
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,480
more ordered and not drop down to

2231
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,239
something that is less ordered

2232
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:44,159
um i think is an interesting question

2233
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:46,239
for teens and maybe is a little more

2234
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:47,760
straightforward in like a teaching

2235
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,480
relationship where um one person is

2236
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:50,800
quite

2237
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:54,000
fixed and um both people know that

2238
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,679
that's the fixed point to rise to um

2239
01:17:57,679 --> 01:18:00,640
from the student's perspective yep and

2240
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:02,000
it's kind of like when we say

2241
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,880
everybody can learn from everyone even

2242
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,880
if one person's knowledge base totally

2243
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:08,480
encompasses someone else's knowledge

2244
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:08,960
base

2245
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:10,880
at the very least we're learning how to

2246
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,400
communicate we're learning how to learn

2247
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:12,719
so

2248
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:15,280
really we can honestly say everyone can

2249
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:17,440
learn from every interaction with every

2250
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:18,239
person

2251
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:20,719
and now we have a framework to really go

2252
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:21,600
into that

2253
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,159
let's just close it out with five b and

2254
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:24,800
c

2255
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,840
so this is reminiscent of figure four

2256
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:31,280
where again we have the expectations um

2257
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:33,600
here are the second level and uh

2258
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,360
expectations of the first bird and then

2259
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:38,080
the expectations of that second bird

2260
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,960
um and again we have this y equals x

2261
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:43,280
manifold that would reflect

2262
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,760
points on the line uh being in perfect

2263
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,520
attunement where the first bird is

2264
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:49,360
expecting to communicate 40

2265
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:50,960
and the second bird's expectation is

2266
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,800
also 40. so that's the uh

2267
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,600
alignment of the internal models through

2268
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,120
coupled communication and

2269
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:59,440
a deep prior that you want to align and

2270
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,360
what we see is that before learning

2271
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:02,800
so now we're going to be talking about

2272
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,960
this learning together trace

2273
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:07,440
so before learning is here so before

2274
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:09,280
learning

2275
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,760
it's not as wacky as figure four was

2276
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,440
where these are like all over the place

2277
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:15,280
they're it's truly uncorrelated it's

2278
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:17,040
like a cloud of points

2279
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:19,600
here we're starting with a partial

2280
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,320
ordering

2281
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,080
the green order parameters one the blue

2282
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:23,520
or the parameters point five

2283
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:27,280
so this um oval is halfway between

2284
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:28,320
perfect

2285
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,960
and random um and there's some math that

2286
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:32,000
we could go into

2287
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,480
but not today but it starts off

2288
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,719
partially organized and you need to kind

2289
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:38,400
of start from a place of partial

2290
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,400
organization for communication

2291
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:43,120
and that's actually granted by evolution

2292
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:43,679
and

2293
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:45,360
the synchronization manifold before

2294
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,040
learning gets tightened

2295
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:48,960
to the synchronization after learning

2296
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,400
where the parameters have been

2297
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,320
improved so that now the birds are in

2298
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:56,000
improved alignment yeah stefan

2299
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:01,199
is your hand raised yeah sorry i was

2300
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:01,920
just trying to

2301
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:04,000
yeah yeah i just thought one thing was

2302
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,600
interesting on the other

2303
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,800
is the more experienced birds um

2304
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:11,280
it's like there's still a slight dip in

2305
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:11,840
their

2306
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:14,880
coordination um as they learn as they

2307
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:18,960
as you know in their kind of um

2308
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:21,120
now maybe there's a trade-off but the

2309
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:22,800
green one still goes down a bit and is

2310
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,480
there maybe a sense that you need to

2311
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,400
relax a little bit of the

2312
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:31,040
rigidity of the pattern to enable

2313
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:34,320
some compromise or some sort

2314
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:35,840
i'm not exactly sure how they came up

2315
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,760
with the the way that that that model

2316
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:38,400
works but

2317
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,239
that i just noticed that i thought

2318
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:41,760
that's kind of interesting there that

2319
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:42,159
that

2320
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:45,199
there's a slip in that and maybe that's

2321
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:46,719
just a degradation of

2322
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:48,639
degradation over time it just happens

2323
01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:51,360
but there seems to be something about

2324
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:54,800
that ability to relax the rigidity of

2325
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:58,400
the model that you use totally agreed

2326
01:20:58,400 --> 01:20:59,440
and i'm

2327
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:01,679
i'm thinking of a math setting where the

2328
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:02,800
equations are

2329
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:05,280
in the textbook and then one person

2330
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:06,560
might be very familiar with them one

2331
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,800
person has less familiarity so the green

2332
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,560
person is teaching math with the blue

2333
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:12,320
person and it's not teaching two that's

2334
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,320
that absolutist idea they're

2335
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:17,120
in a shared alignment they want to align

2336
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,440
around a proper understanding of math

2337
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:22,159
but the teacher person still has to be

2338
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:23,280
ready to address

2339
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,520
unexpected questions from a student

2340
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:27,760
which may be extremely valid and

2341
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,760
actually push the field forward by leaps

2342
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:30,560
and bounds

2343
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,239
by bringing that beginner's mind to the

2344
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:34,480
equations um and if nothing else

2345
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,639
the teacher might have to resort to some

2346
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:38,239
informal metaphors

2347
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:40,239
or say well this this parameter wants to

2348
01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:42,080
do this that's kind of

2349
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:43,199
if you just think about it from the

2350
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:45,040
textbooks perspective it reflects a

2351
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:45,840
divergence

2352
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:48,719
of that order parameter but it's being

2353
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:49,520
used

2354
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,520
towards this higher end which is the

2355
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,679
shared alignment on the concepts

2356
01:21:53,679 --> 01:21:55,840
and so yeah very interesting and i i

2357
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:56,880
wonder um

2358
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:00,400
about that too um and maybe that's

2359
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,239
reflected by initially the blue line

2360
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:02,800
takes a

2361
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:05,760
larger excursion away from order but

2362
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:06,880
then it spends

2363
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:09,840
it then converges a little bit more so

2364
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,120
that's like when you have a first

2365
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:12,560
conversation with somebody

2366
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,639
and it's like um so where are we coming

2367
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:16,480
from you're taking more of an excursion

2368
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:18,080
towards this order to be more in the

2369
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,120
explore phase

2370
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:21,040
and then once you have a better sense

2371
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:22,560
about where the person's coming from you

2372
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,400
can enter into a more

2373
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:27,520
exploit type phase um

2374
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:29,920
i think that's um almost all for our

2375
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:32,320
time and that's all the figures of the

2376
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,120
paper

2377
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:36,719
so on a closing page just if anyone

2378
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:38,560
wanted to share um

2379
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,440
uh closing thought or if they wanted to

2380
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:43,760
share a question that they had an idea

2381
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:47,199
or a future experiment so

2382
01:22:47,199 --> 01:22:49,600
anyone feel free to jump in or raise

2383
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:53,840
your hand

2384
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:59,040
uh i just want to say an idea what you

2385
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:02,320
should never sing alone

2386
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:07,840
is it a russian proverb

2387
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,159
yes well singing alone could be nice i

2388
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:12,080
mean solo performance can be

2389
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:14,800
beautiful and uh it makes me think about

2390
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:15,120
the

2391
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,440
seeing the national anthem which is

2392
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:19,760
often done with a solo performance

2393
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:22,239
they might do a little bit of more vocal

2394
01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:24,480
flair or they might draw out a certain

2395
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:25,040
thing

2396
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,840
that would totally disrupt the um if

2397
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,600
multiple people were trying to sing it

2398
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,679
but when one person is doing it they can

2399
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:33,520
have a lot more artistic license

2400
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:36,000
but if you're in a choir context where

2401
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:36,800
it has to be

2402
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,199
synchronized you you can't just say well

2403
01:23:39,199 --> 01:23:40,960
today i'm going to sing it this way

2404
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:44,000
it's not going to sound good um

2405
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,920
and so there's there's there's maybe

2406
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,920
times to sing alone but it's not singing

2407
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:50,320
together to sing alone that's for sure

2408
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,719
but are they singing alone i mean if

2409
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:54,719
you're performing you're singing

2410
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:56,639
performing for so you're engaging with

2411
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:58,239
an audience of some sort

2412
01:23:58,239 --> 01:24:01,280
or a recording studio which still has

2413
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:04,320
a implied audience

2414
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:08,080
very true and um they're the the um

2415
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:10,480
they have a paper this figure five

2416
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,719
caption it's a duet for one

2417
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:15,440
and so i think that the joke there is

2418
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:16,639
it's one

2419
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:19,600
dyad it's it's a conversation for one

2420
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,199
this is a conversation for one

2421
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:22,880
shared markov blanket it's a

2422
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,800
conversation for one informational niche

2423
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:25,440
it's one

2424
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:27,520
team com it's one conversation that's

2425
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,480
happening

2426
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:31,520
it's not six conversations but there are

2427
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:34,320
six perspectives happening and so that's

2428
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:36,400
where i find active inference to be such

2429
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:37,840
a powerful framework

2430
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:41,280
because it helps us um really give full

2431
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:44,239
value and cognition to six unique

2432
01:24:44,239 --> 01:24:45,120
perspectives

2433
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:47,760
coming together to one shared niche and

2434
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,840
so one fallacy would be well six shared

2435
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,360
perspectives means there's no way we're

2436
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,280
gonna synchronize that's a little bit

2437
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,880
too defeatist and then the other

2438
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,400
alternative would be well because

2439
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:56,960
there's one

2440
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,800
informational niche there's only one

2441
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,239
conversation and if you don't get it

2442
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:01,520
then you're not with a picture

2443
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,679
and that's also not right but somewhere

2444
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:05,920
in the middle we can have a shared niche

2445
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,440
and our own perspectives

2446
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:10,480
sash um

2447
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,960
yeah just to close it out with the the

2448
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:13,679
meta

2449
01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:18,000
uh connection um you know with the

2450
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,920
words teaching each other how to sing

2451
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:21,760
and coming to a higher understanding

2452
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:24,239
um we're trying to come to a higher

2453
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:25,280
understanding of

2454
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:27,760
active inference and it was really great

2455
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,360
to have the first author of the paper

2456
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,280
here to kind of

2457
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:34,960
align us and set the order so

2458
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:38,480
that was really nice yep yep he provided

2459
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:41,840
context to what we discussed and so it

2460
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,040
was very

2461
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:45,520
very nice to have jared come through any

2462
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:46,719
other

2463
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:49,120
thoughts

2464
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:53,040
great well that concludes um team com
