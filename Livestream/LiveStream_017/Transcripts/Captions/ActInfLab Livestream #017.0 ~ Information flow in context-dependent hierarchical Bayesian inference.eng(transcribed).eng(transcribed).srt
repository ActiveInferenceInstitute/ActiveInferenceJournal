1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,720
hello and welcome everyone

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,360
to the active inference lab and to the

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,120
active inference live stream

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,880
we're here in active inference live

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,480
stream 17.0

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,680
and it's march 3rd 2021

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,320
i'm daniel and i'm here with two of my

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,080
colleagues who can introduce themselves

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,840
blue

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,079
my name is sarah davis i'm a person

11
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,840
who's interested in things i'm a student

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,079
in

13
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,480
leibniz university in a master's program

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,320
in philosophy of science and i've

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,480
been an engineer and a bunch of other

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,920
things so i'm just generally interested

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,879
in how it's all connected

18
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,640
i'm blue knight i'm an independent

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,480
research consultant based out of new

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,239
mexico

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,640
cool well we're here for a fun

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,800
discussion so thanks both for joining

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,320
at the active inference lab we're an

24
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,879
experiment in online team communication

25
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,959
learning and practice related to active

26
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,400
inference you can find us

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,880
at our links and socials this is a

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,640
recorded and an archived

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,880
and a hastily produced live stream so

30
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,560
please provide us with feedback so that

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,119
we can

32
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,280
be improving on our work all

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,320
perspectives

34
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,159
and backgrounds are welcome here and

35
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,119
we'll follow good live stream etiquette

36
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,799
so here we are in paper number 17

37
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,479
and we've just completed our first

38
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,320
quarterly active inference lab

39
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,240
round table so check that out on our

40
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,920
channels if you haven't

41
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,320
and today we're going to be setting the

42
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,119
context

43
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,240
for 17.1 and 17.2

44
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,640
the paper that we're discussing in 17 is

45
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,600
information flow

46
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,520
in context dependent hierarchical

47
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,680
bayesian inference by chris fields and

48
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,320
james f

49
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,880
glazebrook it was published in october

50
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,079
2020

51
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,920
and what's funny is that the dot zero

52
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,680
videos have always been about

53
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,719
context set in context and we even wrote

54
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,920
in the previous videos

55
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,840
the video's introduction and its context

56
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,600
it's not a review or the final word

57
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,840
and then it got really meta with this

58
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,600
paper because it's a paper about

59
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,878
context the punchline or a punchline of

60
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,239
this paper

61
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,319
is that we can integrate various

62
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,879
approaches from mathematics mostly

63
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,120
to achieve a scale-free formulism that

64
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,120
leads to an interpretation

65
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,599
of nested systems where communicating

66
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,239
systems

67
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,160
are engaged in active inference and

68
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,920
distinguished by informational or

69
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,120
statistical patterns

70
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,800
or they're engaged in something that's

71
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,400
related to active inference let's say

72
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,280
because it's pretty

73
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,239
out there with what it is and it's a

74
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,519
challenging but also

75
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,879
a fun paper so we're gonna

76
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,640
start with the goals and the claims and

77
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,160
the abstract and

78
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,400
at that point it might be like wait what

79
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,360
with the roadmap

80
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,599
headers or with abstract claims it's

81
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,120
like driving through

82
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,560
a country where you don't speak the

83
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,480
language perhaps

84
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,760
and that's okay because the bulk of this

85
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,280
video in the keywords are going to be

86
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,080
going through

87
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,239
and kind of unpacking a lot of the key

88
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,680
terms that are gonna

89
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,599
matter for even just understanding the

90
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,879
lay of the land

91
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,319
and then we've pulled out a few other

92
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,200
key topics some quotations

93
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,920
didn't go as much into the formalisms of

94
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,239
the

95
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,920
paper itself but we're looking forward

96
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,519
to doing that with

97
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,400
the authors in 17.1 and so we're just

98
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,760
looking forward to that

99
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,040
in 17.1.2 we'll be discussing the same

100
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,840
paper

101
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,840
so read it and save and submit your

102
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,799
questions and get in touch if you want

103
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,400
to participate and also we're looking

104
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,680
forward to your

105
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,400
chats uh during this presentation giving

106
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,120
us a little

107
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,560
support along the way so here we go

108
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,799
with the goals and claims of the paper

109
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,879
under discussion so here are

110
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,400
um the goals and the claims so maybe

111
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,000
blue do you want to read the author's

112
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,720
goals and claims

113
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,599
sure so the goals in the paper are

114
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,560
twofold

115
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,200
first to model intrinsic or true

116
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,319
contextuality

117
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,959
using the general category theoretic

118
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,840
methods of two spaces and channel theory

119
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,400
and second to employ this formulation to

120
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,000
reconstruct hierarchical

121
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,799
bayesian inference in a

122
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,120
context-dependent way

123
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,880
it goes on to say here we have

124
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,880
formulated an approach to intrinsic

125
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,040
contextuality in general category

126
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,240
theoretic terms

127
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,560
a set of observations exhibits intrinsic

128
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,600
contextuality

129
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,400
if no cocoon can be constructed over the

130
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,000
observables that produce them

131
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,240
oh cone cocoon who knows

132
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,840
how to say it um so they're doing a

133
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,199
couple of things

134
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,360
here they have two main goals so it's

135
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,479
great that they're laying it out

136
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,840
clearly the first one is about context

137
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,639
and they want to be

138
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,560
having a more advanced way to talk about

139
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,479
context and it turns out that they're

140
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,360
going to be doing that

141
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,080
using category theory and two spaces and

142
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,960
channel theory

143
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,080
all of which we're going to be going

144
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,080
into at least a little bit and then

145
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,840
secondly they're going to be linking

146
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,520
all of this stuff that they just did up

147
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,280
here with context choose

148
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,120
channel theory category theory and

149
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,880
they're combined combining that with

150
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,240
context dependent

151
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,320
bayesian inference we've talked a lot

152
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,000
about active inference and bayesian

153
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,639
inference

154
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,960
and so this is sort of the hinge where

155
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,120
we connect some of these ideas

156
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,240
to active inference and then this is

157
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,639
a quote from their conclusion which is

158
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,720
that they have formulated

159
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,479
a new way of modeling contextuality

160
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,639
in very general category theory terms

161
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,800
specifically relating to this co-cone

162
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,680
construction

163
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,160
but the category theoretic term allows

164
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,759
them to move between a few

165
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,400
different areas that we're going to be

166
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,600
walking through

167
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,440
today so here we go with the abstract

168
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,199
i'll read the first of the three slides

169
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,960
of the abstract and anyone can give any

170
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,240
thoughts or just

171
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,840
start reading the second part of the

172
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,280
abstract

173
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,360
recent theories developing broad notions

174
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,360
of context and its effects on inference

175
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,639
are becoming increasingly

176
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,479
important in fields as diverse as

177
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,919
cognitive psychology

178
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,360
information science and quantum

179
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,600
information theory and computing

180
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,600
here we introduce a novel in general

181
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,120
approach to the characterization of

182
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,479
contextuality

183
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,319
using the techniques of two spaces and

184
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,160
channel theory viewed as general

185
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,240
theories of information flow

186
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,160
this involves introducing three

187
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,039
essential components into the formalism

188
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,360
events conditions and measurement

189
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,880
systems

190
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,639
any thoughts either of you two or

191
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,759
someone can just start reading the

192
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,800
second part of the abstract

193
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:39,919
let's go to the second part of the

194
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,039
abstract i think we'll have a lot of

195
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,400
time for um

196
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,239
off-the-cuff remarks soon

197
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,759
so sarah do you want to go for the

198
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,759
second part of the abstract

199
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,800
uh sure incorporating these factors in

200
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,080
relationship to conditional

201
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,319
probabilities leads to information flows

202
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,319
both in the setting of two spaces and

203
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,680
channel theory

204
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,080
the latter provides a representation of

205
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,199
semantic content

206
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,680
using local logistics from which

207
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,759
conditionals can be derived

208
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,160
we employ these features to construct

209
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,440
cone cacone

210
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,960
diagrams commutativity commutativity

211
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,919
of which enforces inferential coherence

212
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:18,479
um

213
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,000
with these built a scale-free

214
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,280
architecture incorporating a

215
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,680
bayesian-like hierarchical structure

216
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,479
in which there is an interpretation of

217
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,759
active inference in markov blankets

218
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,080
nice and then blue how about finish out

219
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,639
the abstract

220
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,080
we compare this architecture with other

221
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,000
theories of contextuality which we

222
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,199
briefly review

223
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,039
we also show that this development of

224
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,280
ideas conveniently accommodates negative

225
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,319
probabilities

226
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,840
leading to the notion of signed

227
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,000
information flow and address how quantum

228
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,120
contextuality

229
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,360
can be interpreted within this model

230
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,520
finally we relate contextuality to the

231
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,960
frame problem another way of

232
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,360
characterizing a fundamental limitation

233
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,440
on the observational and information

234
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,599
inferential capabilities of finite

235
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,000
agents

236
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,000
perfect so that is the abstract that's

237
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,879
how the authors

238
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,759
wanted to present and communicate their

239
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,479
work

240
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,560
to a broad audience of specialists and

241
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,000
non-specialists

242
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,160
and again we're going to be going into

243
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,240
basically all the words that might be

244
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,800
non-obvious in this abstract and the

245
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,240
keywords that come into play

246
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,840
that's what we wanted to be unpacking

247
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,280
today so

248
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,759
we're gonna look over their roadmap

249
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,440
because just like the abstract is how

250
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,880
they want to communicate

251
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,640
what they did the roadmap is how they've

252
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,399
chosen to organize what they've done

253
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,120
and get us from a to z and then we're

254
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,000
going to be

255
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,519
really going into this road trip

256
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,680
and unpacking what some of these key

257
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,880
terms are

258
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,880
it starts with an introduction which i

259
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,880
guess is helpful context

260
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,920
and then one of the focal ideas of the

261
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,480
paper

262
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,399
is this chew space or the chew

263
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,000
construction which we're going to be

264
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,600
talking about the history of

265
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,800
some examples some related topics and

266
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,760
just right off the bat when we saw that

267
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,240
the

268
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,320
examples of two spaces and chew

269
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,000
morphisms included

270
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
topological spaces so that's all of

271
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,200
network theory

272
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,760
and graphs and things like that so

273
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,040
that's one big area

274
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,560
but we're going to be talking about two

275
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,080
spaces as something that connects

276
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,839
all of network theory and topological

277
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,440
space to

278
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,000
types as processes probability spaces

279
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,440
bayesian belief networks

280
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,640
event space structure shoe flows kovac

281
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,680
libra

282
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,959
divergence and the free energy so

283
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,120
we're going to be popping up a level

284
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,640
from things that are already

285
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,800
pretty abstract but it's going to be

286
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,839
done in a way that's

287
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,880
quite useful especially for formulating

288
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,920
context

289
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,120
and it's actually really interesting

290
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,640
because a lot of times people will say

291
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,680
that these

292
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,560
um topics in the examples that they're

293
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,920
general but they actually don't have

294
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,880
enough context

295
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,320
for example you can make a social

296
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,320
network but that wouldn't be the total

297
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,160
context of the world if you only have

298
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,160
some of the users on the social network

299
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,000
so maybe there's a way where we're going

300
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,279
to be able to step up

301
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,440
from some of our previous conceptions

302
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,320
and

303
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,040
introduce context potentially by default

304
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,200
this leads the authors to a discussion

305
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,079
of

306
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,120
probability and how to use probabilistic

307
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,920
models

308
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,040
for contextuality for modeling context

309
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,160
and this comes to a recently derived

310
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,920
framework called contextuality by

311
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,560
default

312
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,320
which will be a topic we dive into

313
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,760
section 4 goes into some issues related

314
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,399
to

315
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,800
measurements and kind of the before

316
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,920
during and after

317
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,000
of measurements because you got to set

318
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,519
things up and calibrate and then you got

319
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,480
to make the measurement

320
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,079
at a certain moment and then you have to

321
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,480
analyze it in the context of a certain

322
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,320
system so it's like before during and

323
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,800
after the measurements

324
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,279
in section 5 they head into channel

325
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,399
theory

326
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,200
and information channels and this was

327
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,399
really fascinating

328
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,519
because it's quite distinct from shannon

329
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,360
information theory

330
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,360
in some ways that people might not

331
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,959
expect and

332
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,680
i had never heard this discussed

333
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,519
alongside shannon information theory

334
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,160
it's like

335
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,920
here's information theory and it's good

336
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,760
at abc but it's not good in these three

337
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,560
things

338
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,000
that's where the discussion ended i

339
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,760
didn't know that there was another area

340
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,160
that kind of picked up where shannon

341
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,760
left off in a sense

342
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,040
and that's related to this idea of an

343
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,519
infomorphism

344
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,760
as well as classifiers conditional

345
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,440
probabilities and this cocon

346
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,560
diagram thinking about information

347
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,519
channels

348
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,640
and flows of information leads to this

349
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,680
formulation of context compliant so

350
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,320
context

351
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,040
modeling or following hierarchical

352
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,000
multi-level

353
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,440
multi-scale bayesian networks and

354
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,480
first this section has a lot of

355
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,600
technical detail but it involves

356
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,760
making a connection between bayes

357
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,880
networks

358
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,600
approaches to probabilistic modeling and

359
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,200
statistics and inference

360
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,480
with context this leads to

361
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,399
a sort of conclusion or a

362
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,360
climax section where the hierarchical

363
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,200
bayesian networks that were just

364
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,200
introduced in six are brought into

365
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,360
the context of two specific uh practices

366
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,440
which is number one the idea of active

367
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,639
inference i highlighted it because

368
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,519
that's kind of

369
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,959
our lab that's what we're here to be

370
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,800
thinking about and then two

371
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,360
was the frame problem which is something

372
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,160
that's also

373
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,600
really interesting to think about it's

374
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,160
going to be the key motivator

375
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,959
so although they put it um last with

376
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,720
active inference in the frame problem

377
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,920
we're actually going to have those

378
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,680
topics closer to the front of the

379
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,560
presentation

380
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,240
so people who are listening to this from

381
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,160
the active inference perspective

382
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,480
or from more generally the frame problem

383
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,200
perspective

384
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,399
they're going to understand what

385
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,480
motivated us to be studying the paper

386
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,680
the way that we're doing it

387
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,760
and hopefully what motivated chris to

388
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,040
select this paper

389
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,160
when he suggested it to be discussed

390
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,839
during his visit that's the sort of

391
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,560
uh naked road map that's the turn left

392
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,639
at this part and turn right at this part

393
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,040
but there was a a narrative road map

394
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,560
that the authors actually

395
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,399
put out and their own words are on the

396
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,920
right so you can see that in the paper

397
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,040
or here

398
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,600
but on the left i just thought of this

399
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,279
is like the semantic road map

400
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,680
as far as the flow of the paper and i

401
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,680
just extracted this semantic flow

402
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,079
from the syntax that they wrote not

403
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,040
super knowing

404
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,160
what all these topics are but just

405
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,320
re-phrasing

406
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,800
what they had put previously these

407
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,160
authors had been researching

408
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,279
quantum and thermodynamics of separable

409
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,720
systems in this paper they started with

410
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,240
a recap of two spaces

411
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,839
and choomorphisms which suggests that

412
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,399
it's a foundational topic for the paper

413
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,320
they then reviewed contextuality

414
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,760
paradigms and

415
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,360
the diversity of approaches that model

416
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,880
contextuality

417
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,160
they then took a formal

418
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,199
uh diversion into

419
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,519
this idea into various ideas of

420
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,959
probability theory

421
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,040
above my detailed understanding but they

422
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,399
took an extension

423
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,600
in that direction they then turned to

424
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:17,920
the

425
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,000
semantically richer methods of channel

426
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,959
theory

427
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,040
and they're using channel theory as an

428
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,800
even more general approach

429
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,519
to inference rather than the syntactic

430
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,800
information theory like shannon

431
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,000
information theory which we'll get

432
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,639
to they wanted something a little bigger

433
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,839
thinking about

434
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,920
these kinds of uh local logics

435
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,480
of information channels leads to some

436
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,440
new ways

437
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,519
that they also combined ideas and

438
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,560
then they visualize this

439
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,600
slash represent it as this cone

440
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,560
cocon diagram as they say as a natural

441
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,279
scale

442
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,519
representation of bayesian inference so

443
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,120
scale free just means that

444
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,519
it doesn't have an a priori scale it's

445
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,040
not in inches or

446
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,839
in kilometers it's just at the level of

447
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,680
abstractness

448
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,480
and then they have the claim that is

449
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,600
proven

450
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,800
that the failure of the cccd the cone

451
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,399
cocone diagram

452
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,880
to diagrammatically commute is a

453
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,160
condition of the measurement operator's

454
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,720
non-co-deployability

455
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,240
so it's just sort of like if you have

456
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,480
two shapes and then they fit together

457
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,639
what they represent fits together and if

458
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,759
you have two shapes and the puzzle

459
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,519
pieces don't fit together

460
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,040
there's something mathematical that the

461
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,680
shapes represent isn't fitting together

462
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,920
in the way that it would as if these two

463
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,360
shapes fit together

464
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,320
i don't know what non-co-deployability

465
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,120
is

466
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,040
but it's like a puzzle piece if it were

467
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,480
co-deployable

468
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,480
and then the part that i think will be

469
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,320
of special interest to a lot of our

470
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,360
lab and colleagues is they're gonna

471
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,079
recover

472
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,079
this new theoretical and inferential

473
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,920
role for the markov blanket

474
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,920
it's the locus at which free energy is

475
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,120
minimized

476
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,279
part one and part two the epistemic

477
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,880
barrier that keeps contextual

478
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,120
information hidden from the observer

479
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,440
so when i saw that i was like whoa it

480
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,600
sounds fascinating because it's two

481
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,320
distinct and critical roles of a blanket

482
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,279
construction

483
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,959
and then i thought so contextual

484
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,279
information is hidden from the observer

485
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,720
because a lot of times we might think

486
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,639
about context as being like what's

487
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,920
around us

488
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,519
but it we'll see if that's actually the

489
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,279
way that context is being

490
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,120
used can i jump in for a second daniel

491
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,399
yep

492
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,399
so i think that i the way that i

493
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,360
understood um co-deployability

494
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,880
like measurement operator code

495
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,880
deployability like you can't

496
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,000
at the same time measure position

497
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,920
and velocity that was like one example

498
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,360
that they gave in the paper so like

499
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,360
because those two things like you can't

500
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,519
if you're moving you're not at a stable

501
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,959
position right so so it's

502
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,560
those those two measurements are not

503
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,399
co-deployable you can't measure

504
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,839
those two things at the same time and

505
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,199
that's kind of what they meant like

506
00:16:59,199 --> 00:16:59,680
about

507
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,439
measurement code deployability i think

508
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,959
cool thanks for that

509
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,880
here's to why it matters before we even

510
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,119
jump into the keywords which will be the

511
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:11,919
bulk of our

512
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,640
journey and this is quotes from the

513
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,880
authors

514
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,480
while the results presented here are

515
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,000
primarily technical so

516
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,799
just take a breath if it's worrying you

517
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,559
because they wrote the paper so we don't

518
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,319
have to and it's a technical paper and

519
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,199
that's what we're

520
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,000
learning by doing and exploring the

521
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,760
paper is technical and abstract

522
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,440
but now we're looking for where we can

523
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,679
go it's like a car is technical

524
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,679
but it lets you get somewhere so where

525
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,400
are we going and why will it matter

526
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,799
these results open a path to application

527
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,799
in a number of areas where contextuality

528
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,320
has largely been neglected but is

529
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,840
important in practice

530
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,080
that sounds really important because it

531
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,120
sounds like there's

532
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,760
um systems that are unknown unknowns we

533
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,039
don't even know what to model

534
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,480
but there might be a large category of

535
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,720
systems where we think we've modeled it

536
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,280
well

537
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,880
but then there's this problem where

538
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,960
context keeps on entering the picture or

539
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,720
something that we didn't model

540
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,880
throws our local model off that we spent

541
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,640
time and energy on so if we could find a

542
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,160
way to respectfully

543
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,640
interface with contextuality across

544
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,400
different areas that would be really

545
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,799
important well what are those areas

546
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,760
one of the models that they're

547
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,919
interested in just like fristen and a

548
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:20,559
lot of

549
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,240
active inference researchers is

550
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,720
neuroscience and so they suggest that

551
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,559
the current approach they're taking

552
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,320
takes a previous model which is the

553
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,960
global neuronal workspace model

554
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,720
and that's actually related to what ryan

555
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,160
smith and christopher white will be

556
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,440
talking to us

557
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,640
about in um number 18.

558
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,760
they're going to make that model

559
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,919
contextuality compliant and provide the

560
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,440
building blocks needed to incorporate

561
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,200
context switching and attention

562
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,640
switching into

563
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,799
global neuronal workspace models so it's

564
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,480
kind of these two cool parts of the

565
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,039
brain

566
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,200
which is that it can spiral in and

567
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,080
really hone in

568
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,760
with attention but then it can also

569
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,320
move attention so it's like side to side

570
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,200
and

571
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,760
in and out and that sort of context and

572
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,720
attention switching

573
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,400
is not dealt with well by our current

574
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,720
models which might be about attention or

575
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,440
inattention

576
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,679
to a stimulus but they're not actually

577
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:12,720
modeling what

578
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,840
the regime of attention is um

579
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,240
another then there's a formal result

580
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,840
which might matter to some

581
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,720
people or others that contextuality can

582
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,000
always be associated with

583
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,160
this sort of non-community kind of

584
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,919
related to the puzzle pieces the context

585
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,600
we just mentioned

586
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,880
and then um this is interesting from a

587
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,120
more probability theoretic point of view

588
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,440
our results further support the authors

589
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,440
of the contextuality by default

590
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,200
in showing that the distinction between

591
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,679
quantum and classical probabilities

592
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,840
lies not in any ontological difference

593
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,160
but rather in what has been explicitly

594
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,120
labeled

595
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,160
so this was really mind-bending because

596
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:52,960
a lot of times

597
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,880
it's like quantum you know theory of

598
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,640
small things where there's an observer

599
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,760
that has an effect

600
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,280
in the outcomes of how the system is

601
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,039
modeled or set up

602
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,320
and then um the sort of disinfo

603
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,720
debate is like who's an observer or does

604
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,240
it matter if it's a conscious deserve

605
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,840
you're going to go down a rabbit hole

606
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,200
because there aren't simple answers

607
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,480
there but the system of the particle

608
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,240
it turns out depends on how you

609
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,880
structure the context of the experiment

610
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,120
just as is the case for macroscopic

611
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,480
entities

612
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,360
so these were some questions that so so

613
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,480
in other words is there

614
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,600
a continuum of

615
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,720
uh tiny things and bigger things with

616
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,520
context as being what is distinguishing

617
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,039
the behavior that can seem quite

618
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,400
different across scales

619
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,080
so it's not that electrons are magical

620
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,520
and they can do

621
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,480
wave particle but nothing else exists in

622
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,000
a similar regime

623
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,039
it's not that we're going to get the

624
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,120
same diffraction of people walking

625
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,400
through a doorway

626
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,640
but then again maybe if it's set up the

627
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,559
right way there's more similarity

628
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,000
than not so a few opening questions

629
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,240
before we jump into the keywords just

630
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,720
how will we connect across formal and

631
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,159
informal or just

632
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,240
plain different senses of the word

633
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,760
context

634
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,400
and then what are some of these cases

635
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,200
where

636
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,880
whether they said it in the paper or not

637
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,880
where contextuality has been largely

638
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,120
neglected but it's important in practice

639
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,360
so even within an informal context

640
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,559
definition

641
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,080
what's in an area where potentially

642
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,480
context is not taken into account so

643
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,159
i'll start with one and then either of

644
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:28,880
you could

645
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,799
go maybe cultural context or

646
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,760
for understanding geopolitics or

647
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,440
individual context for

648
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,799
an individual relationship so it does

649
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,280
matter but when we approach those sort

650
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,799
of individual or collective level

651
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,159
problems as if we can ignore

652
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,360
context again just using it informally

653
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,440
we're not really operating in the space

654
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,720
that the system is in

655
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,720
we're operating in a reduced or a

656
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,840
distorted model

657
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,520
that we're projecting uh hey daniel i

658
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,520
i don't know if uh this is gonna mess up

659
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,960
your video setup but

660
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,559
if you're able to go into present mode

661
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,080
on your slides it would make the whole

662
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,760
thing a lot more readable for a small

663
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,760
screen

664
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,720
in the live stream which you can look at

665
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,000
and mute in the background

666
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,200
it looks different okay um

667
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,880
but yeah we've got a lot of small text

668
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,360
on these slides

669
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,240
yeah it's um i don't know it's so worth

670
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:24,960
unpacking

671
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,280
that last bullet point it's um there's

672
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,320
just a lot there

673
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,960
is is how so are you reading um

674
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,120
when i read this um you know that he's

675
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,880
saying ontological difference versus

676
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,480
what's explicitly labeled

677
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,320
i immediately just think well of course

678
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,440
because you're you know you're either

679
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,960
looking at small scale or you're looking

680
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,960
at macro scale but you think he's saying

681
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,840
something

682
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,360
something a little more subtle

683
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,720
um i would love to have a quantum

684
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,840
expert but just speaking with our friend

685
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,760
jason larkin he has often pointed to

686
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,120
um these sorts of almost like classical

687
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,440
meets quantum crossover situations

688
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,919
where you get the classical quote

689
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:08,799
behavior

690
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,200
from when you define the full system

691
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,280
with the quantum observer

692
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,360
then it behaves let's just use the twin

693
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,559
slit for example

694
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,880
the system behaves a certain way when

695
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,400
you define it a certain way with the

696
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,320
observer in the picture but when you

697
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,919
don't define the observer

698
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,840
you're just talking about a different

699
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,200
system

700
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,559
and so that might not be something that

701
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:31,039
only

702
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,640
electrons exhibit

703
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,799
it might be a feature of certainty and

704
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,360
uncertainty

705
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,240
in measurement and that would be various

706
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,200
kinds of measurements

707
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,279
it wouldn't have to be just things that

708
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,360
were smaller than

709
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,480
a molecule okay

710
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,600
that's how you're reading it yeah that

711
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,600
makes sense

712
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,400
but that's my non-technical um physics

713
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,520
for biologists

714
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,080
take yeah any thoughts on this blue or

715
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,679
we can go to the keywords

716
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,240
so i do have a little bit of thoughts

717
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,000
and so it's tied into the quantum but

718
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,600
it's also tied into

719
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,720
back in theorem 7.1 so you had skipped

720
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,159
over this word that i think is kind of

721
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,679
critical and important

722
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,600
um in the previous bullet point that

723
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,039
says our main form of result

724
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,279
theorem 7.1 shows that intrinsic

725
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:20,480
contextuality

726
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,120
can always be associated with

727
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,240
non-commutativity so like in that

728
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,919
non-commutative that means like you

729
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:26,480
can't

730
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,600
construct the big cocoon diagram right

731
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,799
like when it's not when it doesn't

732
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:31,679
commute

733
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,159
so i think that it's important to um

734
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,279
highlight that that kind of

735
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,279
contextuality um

736
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,799
is like you know where they were

737
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,640
describing the context like for

738
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
uh something that's beautiful like you

739
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,760
know a beautiful

740
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,559
what right like a beautiful leaf is not

741
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,240
the same as a beautiful person

742
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,919
if that leaf looked like a person it'd

743
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,760
be a really ugly leaf or if a person

744
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,200
would like leaf it'd be a really

745
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,600
ugly person right like so so beautiful

746
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,440
it's always good like that context

747
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,880
dependent a beautiful what like

748
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,720
beautiful does not always have the same

749
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,360
referential um meaning and so i think

750
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,000
that this

751
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,320
um is is really important and ties right

752
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,159
into the quantum

753
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,840
aspect of things right like how they

754
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,200
were talking about the

755
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,320
alice and bob um with the machine right

756
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,200
like so

757
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,080
it's always um you know when you can

758
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,559
measure

759
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,559
like it's always what is explicit

760
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,640
context right so the quantum is tied

761
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,520
into

762
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,240
explicit context like when we have a set

763
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,279
of variables

764
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,200
that we measure for every circumstance

765
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,799
at precisely the same exact time and

766
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,799
under precisely the same conditions

767
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,360
that is extrinsic context right and it's

768
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,559
different and separate from

769
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,960
intrinsic contextuality sorry i just

770
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,360
wanted to point that out

771
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,440
you might be saying something that i'm

772
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,960
yeah it's great thank you blue it's

773
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,440
um you might be saying something that

774
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,360
that that i'm already about to say

775
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,679
and um but or maybe just triggered my

776
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,039
thought but

777
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,279
yeah this intrinsic versus extrinsic the

778
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,360
way what it made me think of was that

779
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,640
um you know one thing is quantifiable

780
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,440
and the other thing

781
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,360
isn't it's like a gradient that's

782
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,440
essentially what you're saying yeah okay

783
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,799
it's great thank you fun well

784
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,960
let's get to the keywords this was

785
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,640
definitely one of our

786
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,000
um you know even though you look at the

787
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
keywords you think oh it's the abcs

788
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,120
i mean how hard is it gonna be no it was

789
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,840
really fun

790
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,200
and a good learning experience for all

791
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,360
of us to go through these topics

792
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,880
and includes active inference

793
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,559
and then bayesian inference which are

794
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,159
things that we've definitely talked

795
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:30,960
about before

796
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,000
as well as markov blankets a little bit

797
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,039
however the other words were basically

798
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,159
all just even new to learning about not

799
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:40,799
just in

800
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,120
active inference so that's um where we

801
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,400
kind of started this one and that's why

802
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,600
we want to just

803
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,600
include people in the conversation and

804
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,200
just see where everyone is at

805
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,840
in learning these topics so

806
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,400
contextuality

807
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,039
choose space channel theory information

808
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:55,760
flow

809
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,200
local logic cone cocoon diagram

810
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,720
frame problem and then it wasn't a key

811
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,080
word but it's kind of related is

812
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,640
concurrency and concurrent

813
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,559
processes and i just always want why is

814
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,200
the second c capitalized

815
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,240
let's motivate the paper um

816
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,640
not with what chew spaces are which is

817
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,600
how the paper

818
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,440
begins if you were to read it but let's

819
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,039
kind of motivate it

820
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,200
with the problems and the context that

821
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,120
we're looking to be applying in which is

822
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,000
the frame problem

823
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,880
and active inference and thinking about

824
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,159
something that most of us are more

825
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,360
familiar with which is bayesian

826
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,399
computation

827
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,320
so the frame problem is the problem of

828
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,159
using their words the problem of

829
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,559
circumscribing what does not change when

830
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:38,799
an

831
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,760
action is performed viewed broadly it's

832
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,360
the problem of circumscribing

833
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,600
what is relevant in a situation it's

834
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,039
kind of like if you want to say well

835
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,320
what are all the connections in the

836
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,360
social network

837
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,880
it's the shadow of what are all the

838
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,120
non-connections

839
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,760
because those two answers are arrived at

840
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,720
at the same time

841
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,000
and if you have no false positives and

842
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,080
no false negatives it's the same to know

843
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,080
what has changed versus what hasn't

844
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,039
changed so when we're thinking about

845
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,559
scenarios

846
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,880
those two are equivalent um

847
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,039
instead of just reading this for a first

848
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,159
pass um

849
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,159
what did either of you how would you

850
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,440
summarize the frame

851
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,520
problem or what is something that makes

852
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,360
it valuable or important

853
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,918
for study

854
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,039
okay think about it and then raise your

855
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,559
hand while i go through these

856
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,240
the issue with the frame problem and the

857
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,840
reason why people

858
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,360
are working on better solutions is that

859
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,919
let's say we want to understand uh what

860
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,360
does or doesn't change when action is

861
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,200
performed so we're making a self-driving

862
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,960
car and we want to understand how

863
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,080
something changes or not

864
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,120
when the scene changes um

865
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,159
in order to look for all the changes aka

866
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,840
what hasn't to change

867
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,960
it's really hard to know when to stop or

868
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,240
what has changed

869
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,760
there's just an exponentially large

870
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,760
number of things to check

871
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,000
and you can't brute force it so there

872
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,799
are heuristic

873
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,799
solutions so solutions that aren't exact

874
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,600
but get you on the right track

875
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,760
however the heuristic solutions which

876
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,919
often work extremely well like frame

877
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:14,559
differencing

878
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,000
like if something doesn't move between

879
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,600
two slides you just cancel it out and if

880
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,640
it does move you're going to do some

881
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,399
other algorithm on it

882
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,799
it's a good heuristic but it assumes

883
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,240
coherent context

884
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,480
it assumes that what is observed could

885
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,760
in principle be expanded

886
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,600
to include all that there is to be

887
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,440
observed so if it's a image and it's a

888
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,440
64 by 64 image and i do frame

889
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,159
differencing

890
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,320
and we're only studying the image then i

891
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,480
have captured everything that's changed

892
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,240
but when there are systems with

893
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,320
intrinsic contextuality

894
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,799
this coherence assumption is violated if

895
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,880
there is intrinsic contextuality

896
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,399
i.e some of the observables are

897
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:49,919
non-co-deployable

898
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,600
the current context cannot even in

899
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,120
principle be expanded to include

900
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,760
everything that's observable so blue

901
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,320
what do you

902
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,918
think about that or the frame problem

903
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,679
so one thing that um i thought was cool

904
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,600
about the frame problem is like

905
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,640
that they um so they had this corollary

906
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,320
8.1 i don't know if you have this up

907
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,279
there but when they're when they're

908
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,120
discussing the frame problem

909
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,360
it says a distributed inflammation

910
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,799
information flow system

911
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,200
can be informationally unencapsulated

912
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,200
only in absence of

913
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,240
intrinsic contextuality but so so what

914
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,360
that really meant to me

915
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,399
it was they said again they reiterated

916
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,279
practically that this means that proving

917
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,840
the absence of contextuality in a domain

918
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,200
requires discovering all of the

919
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,640
information that is relevant

920
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,559
to solving problems in that group in

921
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,559
that domain so the frame problem can

922
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,399
only be solved if it has already been

923
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:43,120
solved

924
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,039
like it's like having ground truth data

925
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,240
like if you're trying to predict

926
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,159
something like you can only predict

927
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,399
if you've been given a ground truth to

928
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:51,200
to predict

929
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,480
from or by um do you need me to repeat

930
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,440
that danielle you

931
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,960
caught it i just yes

932
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,279
interesting maybe just like has it been

933
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,880
solved like it has been solved like in

934
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,480
the past present or the future and we're

935
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,840
just like figuring it out again or

936
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,960
something or what does it mean

937
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,960
right like so it's essentially like you

938
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,640
can't go you can't go forward solving it

939
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,240
and this goes into and i know we're

940
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,840
gonna get into the computing

941
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,679
analogy later on in the in the paper the

942
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,200
reservoir computing but it goes into

943
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,760
that like

944
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,159
without ground truth data your neural

945
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,519
network is useless

946
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,000
like like you can't predict the future

947
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,200
based on something that if you don't

948
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:25,919
have the

949
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,320
the context for it right and not this

950
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,080
intrinsic contextuality but you have to

951
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,720
have like

952
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,880
like a real contextuality like know all

953
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,080
the variables that are

954
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,320
important for the for the problem um

955
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,080
anyway sorry that's that's my thoughts

956
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,679
on the frame problem

957
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,320
cool and at the bottom here um how would

958
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,640
domain specific or general solutions or

959
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,600
simply better heuristics lead to real

960
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,640
world implications

961
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,480
well we can probably think of a lot of

962
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,760
software and hardware and hybrid systems

963
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,240
that need to ask themselves what is

964
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,080
relevant in a situation

965
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,320
so that's going to be a recommendation

966
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,919
engine a self-driving car

967
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,039
whatever it is we want to be modeling

968
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,679
relevant aspects of a sim of a situation

969
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:08,480
so

970
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,960
that is the big and it also has

971
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,559
implications that each person is going

972
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,279
to

973
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,720
have their own take so you know put it

974
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,039
in live chat or the comment but

975
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,279
it's a cool topic of course there's

976
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,720
going to be new places of bias

977
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,000
that'll be kind of interesting too yep

978
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,360
any other thoughts on frame problems

979
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,159
sarah no that's it

980
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,200
so bayesian inference

981
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,600
another big topic but um we can start it

982
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,480
with a fun

983
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,200
little meme so on the top right it says

984
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,080
okay gang

985
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,919
let's see what deep learning really is

986
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,240
and this is like scooby dooby doo where

987
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,960
are you

988
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,360
uh meme genre and so we're gonna find

989
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,720
out what deep learning is at the end of

990
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,519
the episode

991
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,720
we unmask the villain oh it's rev bass

992
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,640
so this is sort of hinting at the idea

993
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,640
that bayesian inference

994
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,120
or bayesian thinking bayesian statistics

995
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,080
is underlying

996
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,200
what deep learning is what is

997
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,360
bayesian inference so there's two ways

998
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,799
we're going to show it here there's the

999
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,000
equation

1000
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,200
in its sort of um most simple form

1001
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,360
on the top left and then a more colorful

1002
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,120
unpacked

1003
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,360
version that's made a little bit closer

1004
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,120
to natural language

1005
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,120
there's equations and then also we can

1006
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,760
look at it in a graphical way

1007
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,840
and what the equation as well as the

1008
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,039
graphical

1009
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,600
um representation are getting at is the

1010
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,120
idea that there's a prior

1011
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,600
which means before and so there's a

1012
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,039
prior expectation

1013
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,760
and it is some type of distribution it

1014
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,039
could be

1015
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,720
tight or wide it could be different

1016
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,640
types of things and there's no

1017
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,440
uninformative prior even if it's flat

1018
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,039
like i'm not sure if it could be a zero

1019
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,440
percent or 100 chance or it's all equal

1020
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,840
that's not the same thing as unbiased so

1021
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,760
this really gives a better lens to talk

1022
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,399
about

1023
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,399
bias and implicit or explicit bias

1024
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:55,600
because we can actually talk about

1025
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,399
priors

1026
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,880
being updated rather than who is or

1027
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,640
isn't coming to the table with no

1028
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,799
prior expectations that person doesn't

1029
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,080
exist

1030
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,079
priors um are transformed through

1031
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,119
measurement into posterior

1032
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,839
estimates and so it's like reality is

1033
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,440
providing stimuli

1034
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,159
and then the prior gets dragged along

1035
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:18,639
either

1036
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,800
a little bit if the learning rate is low

1037
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,480
or a lot if it's going to be

1038
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,639
an overwhelmingly powerful stimuli it

1039
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,800
gets pulled a little bit or a lot

1040
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,199
to the data and um

1041
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:35,839
what else would you say about that blue

1042
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,440
um nothing else i mean i think that

1043
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:39,839
that's

1044
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:44,079
that's the deal um

1045
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,440
pretty well described what about you

1046
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,079
sarah i mean the only thing i thought

1047
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:48,960
about

1048
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,000
it's a little vague um i mean i was just

1049
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,040
looking at um some youtubes on koopman

1050
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,440
embedding and model discovery

1051
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,000
and and when i see these bays diagrams

1052
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,079
i'm often like okay well they have some

1053
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,839
data where they presuppose

1054
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,079
you know what what is connected to what

1055
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:06,960
prior and

1056
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,760
with the uh with this this other method

1057
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,599
that i was looking at it it seems like

1058
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,119
that's not the case you know they just

1059
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,280
feed it into this gigantic

1060
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,240
structured ai um but so i'm just

1061
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,680
thinking about bayesian inference in a

1062
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,079
lot of different ways

1063
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,800
cool and we can also ground bayesian

1064
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,839
inference in a

1065
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,160
history and a developmental trajectory

1066
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,000
of statistics which is to say more

1067
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,400
memes so first here's just one quick

1068
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,000
meme here's bayes saying

1069
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,200
i thought the volume of a high

1070
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,119
dimensional hypersphere

1071
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,520
would be evenly distributed throughout

1072
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,560
just funny stuff

1073
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,920
truly funny yeah exactly and on the

1074
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,560
right side

1075
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,839
is a smbc comic just

1076
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,800
joking about how when data comes in your

1077
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,839
model is updated

1078
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,440
but that doesn't mean it's going to be

1079
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,960
an adaptive model

1080
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,960
so there's a lot of ways to go about

1081
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,240
integrating new data

1082
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,560
into priors you could have fallacious

1083
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,240
priors you could fallaciously update you

1084
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,119
could make the wrong

1085
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,560
measurement you could interpret the

1086
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,160
measurement wrong so

1087
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,560
saying we did it bayesian is like saying

1088
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,160
you know i built the car out of metal

1089
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,359
it's like what else do you want to know

1090
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,079
does it work is it safe so we can't let

1091
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,200
the buzzwords

1092
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,000
um confuse us we just want to follow up

1093
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,520
with what the buzzwords are

1094
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,200
and here in the sort of stereotypical

1095
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,320
um human evolution meme

1096
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,200
there's um with a little extra labeling

1097
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,960
there's a progression

1098
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,240
from the and theta here is the model

1099
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,040
parameters

1100
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,040
or just the model and then x is like the

1101
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,400
data or the observable

1102
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,079
so the a priori homo apriorius

1103
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,599
just is walking around with a model

1104
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,440
here's how the world is i

1105
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,839
what data just it's the model this is

1106
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,280
what's likely

1107
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,359
homo pragmaticus is sort of again it's

1108
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:52,880
not an actual evolutionary or

1109
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,920
creationist um parallels just to me

1110
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,000
the data is the only thing that's

1111
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,440
considered what's the data

1112
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,920
show me the facts facts don't lie facts

1113
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,359
don't care about your feelings it's just

1114
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,520
the facts it's not even about the model

1115
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,200
and then we get to homo the frequentest

1116
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,520
so the frequentist is asking the

1117
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,040
statistical question

1118
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,680
what is the likelihood of the data given

1119
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,560
the model

1120
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,839
so what for example um a p-value

1121
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,119
is coming from like a t a t test

1122
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,160
is like what is the likelihood of this

1123
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,960
height data given the model that the two

1124
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,520
classrooms don't have different heights

1125
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,200
and so you can say that's 0.01 p value

1126
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,079
so there's such and such um likelihood

1127
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:38,800
for this data

1128
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
under that model so we can reject that

1129
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,839
model

1130
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,760
and then that's all this whole point

1131
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,200
with the rejection of

1132
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,000
null models and h naught versus h1 and

1133
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,599
rejecting things and the whole idea of

1134
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,520
falsification at the statistical level

1135
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,400
but also

1136
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,400
at the philosophy of science level oh

1137
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,160
one beautiful piece of data could ruin

1138
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,000
the theory and you just can disprove it

1139
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,760
this whole idea of disproving you have

1140
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,520
the model in the background

1141
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,200
explicitly or implicitly and then new

1142
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,720
data comes in you go is this likely or

1143
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,280
not

1144
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,760
and then if it's unlikely you think that

1145
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,800
it casts doubt on your model

1146
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,680
homo sapiens here is thinking about the

1147
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,400
the

1148
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,800
likelihood or modeling both the data and

1149
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,760
the model

1150
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,560
but then the sort of advanced or at

1151
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,280
least

1152
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,960
farthest right homo bayesiansis

1153
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,720
is thinking about the likelihood of the

1154
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,000
model given the data

1155
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,079
which actually is what we want to know

1156
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,839
we don't need to know the likelihood of

1157
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,920
all board positions and all possible

1158
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,599
chess strategies we want to know

1159
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:36,880
the likelihood of certain things

1160
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,480
happening given what we're observing

1161
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,920
which can often be quite limited or

1162
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,880
confusing

1163
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,599
so not to over analyze meme but yeah

1164
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:44,560
okay

1165
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,079
so can we wait i want to interject

1166
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,760
really quick so we were talking earlier

1167
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,440
about um frequentest and bayesian

1168
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,119
statistics prior to

1169
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,599
pushing the you know broadcast button on

1170
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,040
the live stream and you know i was

1171
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,119
thinking about the movie 50 first dates

1172
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,320
right like i don't know if you guys have

1173
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,520
seen the movie but she wakes up every

1174
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,040
day and can't remember anything except

1175
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,480
like before her car accident

1176
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,040
so the model's there it's existing right

1177
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,800
it's like she has the model

1178
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,800
but and then just just the model never

1179
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,800
updates so every day like you know

1180
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,560
it's you just go based on the model but

1181
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,240
then there's no there's no update and so

1182
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,680
like you know the bayesian

1183
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,920
would be like if every day you updated

1184
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,040
the model while you were sleeping at

1185
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,079
night and i think like

1186
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,720
you know that's a huge like like lead-in

1187
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,240
to the bayesian brain

1188
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,079
like framework right is that like what

1189
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,680
we're doing while we're sleeping really

1190
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,680
are we updating our model like is this

1191
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,520
why we need less sleep as we get older

1192
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,200
and we get stuck in a decade like

1193
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,240
you know you're stuck in your favorite

1194
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,400
decade because you're not updating your

1195
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:36,800
model

1196
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,920
as much or as well i don't remember the

1197
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,960
movie too well but

1198
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,520
didn't the other character have memory

1199
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,359
across the dates so it's almost like an

1200
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:46,640
alternative title it could have been you

1201
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:46,960
know

1202
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,359
when a frequentist and a bayesian date

1203
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,680
50 times

1204
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,000
that one definitely got left on the uh

1205
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,720
clipping room before

1206
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,480
so um bayesian networks are

1207
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,200
taking this bayesian inference idea and

1208
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,960
putting it in a graphical

1209
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,839
or a topological framework so it's

1210
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:08,880
representing

1211
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,520
variables in the nodes there's other

1212
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,880
graphical models but just for the ones

1213
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,760
we're showing here

1214
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,960
the nodes are random variables

1215
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,599
and then conditional dependencies are

1216
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:20,400
shown with

1217
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,960
arrows or with edges so this is like a

1218
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,040
very general one on the left it's like a

1219
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,119
is just having a conditional dependency

1220
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,160
with b

1221
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,400
and it's directed in this case this one

1222
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,280
right here

1223
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,000
is actually a bayesian network called a

1224
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,960
neural network

1225
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,119
this is a single layer neural network

1226
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,400
where one input

1227
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,000
kind of unfolds to all these hidden

1228
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,839
layers just one here and then it goes to

1229
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,200
an output layer

1230
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,599
but this is the structure of neural

1231
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:46,400
networks so

1232
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,599
everything that we're talking about like

1233
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,040
neural networks all kinds of deep

1234
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,839
learning are

1235
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,079
encapsulated and then on the top right

1236
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,599
from par at all

1237
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,280
2018 is the example of active inference

1238
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,960
and so here is the progression that we

1239
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,800
walk through in our model stream

1240
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,040
but the simplest bayesian network that

1241
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,720
we can imagine between a hidden state

1242
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,319
and an observable is you have s the

1243
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:07,200
hidden state

1244
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,359
and then there's some sort of p which is

1245
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,359
the probability of an observation given

1246
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:12,480
the hidden state

1247
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,040
of oh the observable so that's like

1248
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,160
hidden state and then you're getting

1249
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,119
observables

1250
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,079
and then you're trying to model the

1251
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,480
hidden state given the observables in b

1252
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,720
that same process happens through time a

1253
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,240
changing hidden state

1254
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,680
is emitting observables at different

1255
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,000
time steps still a bayesian graphical

1256
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,359
model

1257
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,400
c introduces control theory with

1258
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,119
pi that's why our lab logo is a little

1259
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:35,760
pie

1260
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,119
because it's action playing into the way

1261
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,760
that states are modeled to evolve

1262
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,520
through time

1263
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,200
d takes another level of complexity and

1264
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,480
allows actually

1265
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,800
policy so still we see this motif with

1266
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,119
pi influencing how s one two and three

1267
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:53,920
change

1268
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,079
but at each time point let's take this

1269
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,760
one down into s1

1270
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,200
at each time point it's being evaluated

1271
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,240
how a policy is going to play out at s1

1272
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,880
2 and 3. and notice that at one two and

1273
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,680
three

1274
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,920
there's an inference on one two and

1275
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,359
three and so

1276
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,520
um i'll re-enable my camera don't worry

1277
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,640
um

1278
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,240
the uh the trajectory of action is what

1279
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,920
is being estimated

1280
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,760
so it's not just doing state estimation

1281
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,520
at each of those time points it's

1282
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,920
estimating a trajectory of action and

1283
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,119
this idea of

1284
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,640
action trajectories is going to come

1285
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,480
back into play in a

1286
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,599
kind of interesting way

1287
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,560
let's just take one more second more

1288
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,839
generally to think about active

1289
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:38,880
inference and

1290
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,200
what it is why we're here where the

1291
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,640
markov blanket is

1292
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,560
in active inference we have internal and

1293
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,480
external states and it's a scale-free

1294
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,160
framework because these internal states

1295
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,000
could be small or large in scale

1296
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,720
it's outside the level of specifying a

1297
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,319
specific scale

1298
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,720
and these internal and external states

1299
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,560
are separated by

1300
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,119
a blanket and as we're going to show in

1301
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:02,079
just a second

1302
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,160
this markov blanket concept is just the

1303
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,480
total layer of insulating nodes

1304
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,000
such that the internal and the external

1305
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,520
states have a certain type of

1306
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,960
independence relationship from each

1307
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,760
other

1308
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,760
and then the innovation we'll get to

1309
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,040
where first thing came into play

1310
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,520
so that's active inference just um as a

1311
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,599
way to integrate action and perception

1312
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,599
um with sensations influencing internal

1313
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,520
states internal states including

1314
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,119
generative model estimates of the world

1315
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,880
and policy estimations

1316
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,440
implements action and action can

1317
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,280
influence external states which also is

1318
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,640
undergoing its own

1319
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,319
dynamics which we might think of as

1320
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:37,280
actually contextuality

1321
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,119
any other thoughts on active inference

1322
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,119
okay so

1323
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,119
here's where we go from bayes networks

1324
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:44,880
to markov blankets

1325
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,400
this was part of our discussion on

1326
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,760
actin 14 and the idea of

1327
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,560
making a markov blanket was introduced

1328
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,040
by

1329
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,480
pearl 1988 and where fristen's

1330
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,079
innovation occurred and this is i think

1331
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:00,480
from

1332
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,359
mel andrews's paper in 14 is that

1333
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:04,880
pearl's original construction of the

1334
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,920
markov blanket

1335
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,200
was subdivided into two kinds of nodes

1336
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,520
sensory states nodes whose influence is

1337
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,079
directed towards the blanketed node

1338
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:16,400
under interest x and active states which

1339
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,760
are nodes influenced by

1340
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,560
x so we can have an organismal metaphor

1341
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,000
with sense and action

1342
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,319
but a little bit more generally sense is

1343
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:25,680
like incoming

1344
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,960
of the system and action is outgoing

1345
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,680
and the markov blanket is the total set

1346
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,960
of all the

1347
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,480
ones that totally give you all the

1348
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,680
inputs and all the outputs of the system

1349
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,160
so stating the conditional dependencies

1350
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,599
is the same thing as stating all the

1351
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,440
conditional independencies

1352
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,680
just like we're showing where the social

1353
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,200
network who's friends with who is the

1354
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,560
same question as who's not friends with

1355
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,359
who

1356
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:51,040
who is there is the same question as who

1357
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,400
is not there

1358
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,880
and then to put markov pearl and fristen

1359
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,160
on a continuum

1360
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,200
you have markovian properties

1361
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,599
by andre markov and other mark hopes

1362
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:02,560
actually

1363
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,800
who are working in a more mathematical

1364
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,079
frame they don't have access to

1365
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,520
computers

1366
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,640
perl brings in bayesian statistics as

1367
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,720
well as computational approaches

1368
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,280
in the second half of the 1900s and then

1369
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,920
the innovations of fristen were to

1370
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,640
divide

1371
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,960
those markov nodes the markup blanket

1372
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,839
nodes into

1373
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:25,200
sense and action nodes which enables

1374
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,480
this cybernetic approach to

1375
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,160
input a generative model internal states

1376
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:32,960
and then

1377
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,319
outgoing uh action states in service of

1378
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,079
maintaining a non-equilibrium steady

1379
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:39,119
state

1380
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,440
and then though it's an ongoing and open

1381
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,040
and developing area with how we

1382
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,640
formalize these things

1383
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,720
the idea is that by this kind of

1384
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,640
partition of the blanket happening

1385
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,000
we'll be able to have um modeling of

1386
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
non-local dependencies like latent

1387
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,359
causes which are not observed in the

1388
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:56,160
world

1389
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,359
and therefore have cybernetic agents

1390
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:03,280
in niches that are enacting and embodied

1391
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,119
and encultured in a really rich way

1392
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:08,800
and then just to show one more figure

1393
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,160
this is from um

1394
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,280
wanja's paper with carl fristen which we

1395
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,280
talked about just a few weeks ago

1396
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,280
and just showing that you have internal

1397
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,520
states that influence external

1398
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,000
uh influence active states then there's

1399
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,599
a line with external and so here's the

1400
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:24,640
blanket here

1401
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,800
in the pink dashed line is the blanket

1402
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,079
states and then there's the internal

1403
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,880
states okay any thoughts on active

1404
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,079
inference or can we go to

1405
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:35,200
context so

1406
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,960
again putting the sort of end parts of

1407
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,280
the paper up closer to the beginning

1408
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,680
the context in practice the first

1409
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,680
context introduced is the idea of active

1410
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,599
inference in the paper

1411
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,440
and the motivation for active inference

1412
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,800
here and we can definitely talk to the

1413
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,680
authors more

1414
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,920
is that observers are constantly probing

1415
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,440
their environments through action

1416
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,720
influenced by hidden states and

1417
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,720
time-sensitive policies

1418
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,359
so these are some of the challenges that

1419
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,280
beset

1420
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,560
context agnostic or unspecified context

1421
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,520
modeling is when the environment is

1422
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,319
changing

1423
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,880
how does the action policy update does

1424
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,480
it just re-evaluate at every single

1425
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:12,960
moment

1426
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,760
as if it was like fresh looking at a new

1427
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:16,880
environment but how do you have these

1428
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,240
sequences of action

1429
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,920
that might involve sequential

1430
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,599
modifications of the environment

1431
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,720
and uncertainty in the action policy

1432
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,040
and the big question just like you know

1433
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,160
kindergarten

1434
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,800
is what actions are appropriate what

1435
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,319
actions will reveal aspects of the

1436
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:32,960
environment

1437
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,480
important for defining and reasoning

1438
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,000
within a context that's the frame

1439
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,240
problem what actions will reveal that a

1440
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,160
context has changed

1441
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,160
so we want to know which of the three

1442
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,520
cups the ball is under

1443
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,359
and so there's like this complex thing

1444
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,040
that's happening as we guide our

1445
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,599
action by changing the context to

1446
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,280
resolve our uncertainty

1447
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,839
about actions which we can then get more

1448
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,920
information on

1449
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,359
and active inference tells us that

1450
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,280
there's two ways to minimize expected

1451
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,160
free energy

1452
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,000
which is that we can modify internal

1453
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,400
state parameters of our generative model

1454
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,480
through learning and development or

1455
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,559
external states can be modified through

1456
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,839
action or um their own endogenous

1457
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:12,720
changes

1458
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,359
so active inference we're kind of going

1459
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,000
even

1460
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,839
more abstract than some of the other

1461
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:19,440
papers and just thinking about this

1462
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,000
question

1463
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,040
of if you're an agent who's operating

1464
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,000
under uncertainty

1465
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,760
modifying the niche but you don't know

1466
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,599
whether you should modify or explore

1467
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,359
or wait and all these things are coming

1468
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:30,880
together

1469
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,119
we want to set a frame that's big enough

1470
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,960
to encompass that

1471
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,480
any thoughts on that okay

1472
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,599
let's turn to context more generally so

1473
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:43,280
that was active inference in context

1474
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,839
they write contextuality in the behavior

1475
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,280
of complex systems has traditionally

1476
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,000
been regarded

1477
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,760
as a practical problem of limited

1478
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,359
experimental control that could in

1479
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:52,079
principle

1480
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,040
be eliminated by obtaining more uniform

1481
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,640
experimental subjects and achieving

1482
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,599
better control

1483
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,839
of experimental conditions this

1484
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:01,520
traditional view of contextuality as

1485
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,119
merely a practical limitation is

1486
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:03,839
howeverly

1487
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:07,280
increasingly under strain this kind of

1488
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,680
resonated with me as an experimentalist

1489
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,640
because

1490
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,880
in biology you'd get the sense like well

1491
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,559
if it was a clonal animal and we just

1492
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:15,280
had the

1493
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,920
light dark cycle the same and the same

1494
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,520
animal handler picked it up and there

1495
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,800
was no pipetting air

1496
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,559
everything was the same you'd get the

1497
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,000
same result

1498
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,559
and it was really exciting to think

1499
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:27,359
about

1500
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:29,280
um to what extent is that like a

1501
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,040
faith-based position

1502
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,680
and actually tiny amplifications in the

1503
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,359
system you have two clonal animals but

1504
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:37,280
if there's like a bifurcation point

1505
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,760
then unless you truly have every single

1506
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,359
part of the system

1507
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:43,440
you're always going to be subject to

1508
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,920
these intrinsic contextualities

1509
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,760
so that's kind of cool to think about

1510
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,400
and then here in the conclusion

1511
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,880
context is often used to designate what

1512
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,640
is neglected when an observation is made

1513
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,079
or an action undertaken

1514
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:57,920
environment is used in a similar way so

1515
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,839
that's how maybe informally people think

1516
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:01,359
about context like right now one of my

1517
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:02,240
contacts is like

1518
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,160
this cup of water it's in my environment

1519
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,839
it's in my niche it's in my local area

1520
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:07,520
like their context is used

1521
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,200
like that like what is around something

1522
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,079
um and the formalism of a theory like

1523
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:15,280
context by default

1524
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,800
challenges us to acknowledge that

1525
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,800
context is always there whether attended

1526
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,079
to or not

1527
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:21,920
so we're thinking about context in sort

1528
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,680
of a more active way

1529
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,559
in terms of what influences processes or

1530
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:28,720
where conditional dependencies are

1531
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,160
and so it might be the case that you can

1532
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,160
ignore context because you've actually

1533
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,680
isolated the system so it's like a

1534
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,440
closed system or it's a system where you

1535
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,880
can fully describe it

1536
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,520
and in those situations context is there

1537
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,079
but you've made a special sub problem

1538
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:44,720
where you have all the context but when

1539
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,520
you're in a

1540
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,880
situation where you don't have all the

1541
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,280
context we need to have

1542
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,000
a framework for reasoning that has

1543
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
contextuality by default

1544
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
so that we can work better in those

1545
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,280
spaces

1546
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,280
and let's talk a little bit more about

1547
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,960
this contextuality by default

1548
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,640
cbd not that cbd

1549
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:08,000
this is the authors talking about

1550
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,920
contextuality by default just totally

1551
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:10,640
you know

1552
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,079
raise your hand or jump in if you have a

1553
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:13,680
thought or a question

1554
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:18,319
and they say that the term um

1555
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:19,760
determining whether a particular

1556
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,359
instance of observed behavior of a

1557
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,119
complex system

1558
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:26,000
particularly one with memory exhibits

1559
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,599
intrinsic contextuality is not

1560
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,359
straightforward

1561
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:32,000
so that was interesting makes sense

1562
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:32,880
complex systems

1563
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,480
hard to know what to do sometimes

1564
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,240
whether you want to include memory and

1565
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,920
historiosity or not

1566
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,440
and in some ways like if you have like

1567
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,200
10 different animals and you think okay

1568
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,079
well they're the same

1569
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:43,839
background so we can just consider them

1570
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:45,760
even but they've actually had this

1571
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,079
history that differs so they're not the

1572
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:48,880
same

1573
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,280
but you want to imagine that they're

1574
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,800
replaceable or shuffleable in a

1575
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,040
statistical sense but that might not be

1576
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,359
and then here's the quantum sense of

1577
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:59,440
contextuality

1578
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,119
in quantum systems a set of measurements

1579
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:02,800
exhibits contextuality

1580
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,319
if it cannot be characterized by

1581
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:05,920
mathematically consistent

1582
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,760
context-free joint probability

1583
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,680
distribution

1584
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,119
asking whether a set of measurement

1585
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:12,480
outcomes exhibits intrinsic

1586
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,520
contextuality

1587
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,359
is in this case asking whether a

1588
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:17,040
consistent globally defined

1589
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,119
globally connectable joint probability

1590
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:21,680
distribution exists or not

1591
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,160
and that's where this formulism of

1592
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,640
contextuality by default

1593
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,040
addresses questions by labeling context

1594
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,480
and includes them explicitly in

1595
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,400
conditional probabilities

1596
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,079
rendering probability distributions

1597
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:35,680
context dependent

1598
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,200
so let's look at the papers

1599
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,400
that were cited and referenced and think

1600
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,839
a little bit about

1601
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:45,520
where is this contextuality theory

1602
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,880
coming from where is it taking us

1603
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,240
what do you think oh yeah comment

1604
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,599
um that that brought to my mind

1605
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:57,599
um emotion uh related to context because

1606
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:00,800
i've been thinking a lot about um

1607
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,240
how like if i'm attached to some idea or

1608
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,520
something like that

1609
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,520
and then and i just remember that i was

1610
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,040
attached to it but then i go to sleep

1611
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,319
and whatever and then i forget what it

1612
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:11,040
was

1613
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,520
i have a tendency to like really be like

1614
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,280
no that was really important and so

1615
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,280
regardless of whether it was true or not

1616
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,440
i want to go back to it and so there's

1617
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,599
i'm thinking about the way in which

1618
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:24,160
emotion is a kind of a context but it

1619
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,079
takes you over a longer time

1620
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:28,800
domain because like it doesn't even just

1621
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:29,280
sit in

1622
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,240
like a decay rate that would normally be

1623
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,280
you know related to the other

1624
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,480
information it pulls you

1625
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,800
way back into another space so it's this

1626
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,920
kind of like

1627
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,319
long-range driver i don't know that's

1628
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:40,960
just

1629
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,079
context cool

1630
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:46,240
and it brings us to this next question

1631
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,440
which is is there

1632
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,440
this is the title of a paper that's

1633
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,640
cited by um

1634
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,200
this offer of 2016 is there

1635
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,400
contextuality in

1636
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,520
behavioral and social systems so if we

1637
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,280
were dealing with this informal

1638
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,440
definition of context is just like the

1639
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,480
environment it's like

1640
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,440
yes the answer is just yes behavioral

1641
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,040
and social systems yes there's social

1642
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,640
context like oh you missed the context

1643
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,720
on this dinner party okay so

1644
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,839
off the bat we'll say yes but we're

1645
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:16,240
thinking about it formally and this is

1646
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,800
this is the most hyphenated sentence

1647
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,000
i've just ever seen in science

1648
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,599
so just the number of names

1649
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:28,880
it was quite something to read um

1650
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,800
but we're thinking about contextuality

1651
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,079
in a more

1652
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,559
formal way which is like so let's say

1653
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:35,920
someone says you're missing the dinner

1654
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,440
party context

1655
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,880
um and then it's like well if you would

1656
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,640
have told me all the info then i would

1657
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,079
have had all the context

1658
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:44,960
so then that would make it that's it's a

1659
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:45,520
similar

1660
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,559
notion but we're going for measurement

1661
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:51,680
systems and um

1662
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,319
they're proposing that their cbd allows

1663
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:56,319
one to define and measure contextuality

1664
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:57,680
in all systems

1665
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,559
of all these hyphenated types even if

1666
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,319
there are context dependent errors in

1667
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:03,200
measurement

1668
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,960
or if something in the context directly

1669
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,319
interacts with a measurement

1670
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:08,240
these are the two cases that really

1671
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,599
matter a lot for scientists

1672
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,079
like what if at higher temperatures your

1673
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:13,839
thermometer is biased towards

1674
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:16,480
over estimating or being more error

1675
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,599
prone

1676
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:18,480
then you're going to get this

1677
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,480
distribution that looks like it has some

1678
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,079
sort of super specific relationship but

1679
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:23,839
it's totally not the case it's all

1680
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:26,079
an observation error and the second one

1681
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:27,599
is that the context could directly

1682
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:28,880
interact with the measurement

1683
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,960
aka every single time you want to know

1684
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,160
something new

1685
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,319
so the context which you don't have

1686
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:35,760
because you don't have the full context

1687
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:36,799
because you're going out into the

1688
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:38,319
unknown to make a measurement

1689
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:40,480
is going to interacting interact with

1690
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,079
your measurement maybe even modify it

1691
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:42,799
itself

1692
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:46,240
what do you think blue so

1693
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,160
i think like you know this just goes

1694
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,920
back to that intrinsic

1695
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,880
versus extrinsic context like in a

1696
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,720
social and behavioral system

1697
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,520
there's no extrinsic concept right like

1698
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,240
every

1699
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,119
er there's no extrinsic context every

1700
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:01,520
like

1701
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,480
thing that you're going to try to

1702
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,559
measure if you ask like what was the

1703
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,400
temperature at that dinner party

1704
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,559
or how is the food you can ask like you

1705
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:09,920
know 12 different people

1706
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,079
and they're all gonna have different uh

1707
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:14,240
things to say or like did you have fun

1708
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,240
or or whatever like i mean everyone you

1709
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,839
ask because it's it's

1710
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:19,839
only defined by the intrinsic

1711
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:20,960
contextuality

1712
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,760
which is the experience of each agent in

1713
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,480
the room

1714
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,520
i think cool

1715
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,760
and interestingly they look at several

1716
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,119
data sets

1717
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:32,799
none of the data provide evidence for

1718
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:34,880
contextuality so again don't just

1719
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,040
yes there's a niche there's a context we

1720
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,640
know what social context is but we're

1721
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,079
actually thinking about it

1722
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:43,200
in this very interesting way where those

1723
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,400
data sets don't

1724
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,359
have contextuality so a good little gut

1725
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:47,680
check

1726
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,960
is if you're thinking about the

1727
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,799
applications this paper and you're

1728
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:52,559
thinking about it like social context

1729
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:55,599
it's just not that one because um

1730
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:58,400
it's not and their rule is that

1731
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,839
behavioral and social systems are

1732
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:01,040
non-contextual

1733
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,040
again if that makes you cringe it's

1734
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,319
because you're thinking about it

1735
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:05,760
informally and we're actually thinking

1736
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,359
about it in a way where that

1737
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:09,599
claim makes sense that's where we want

1738
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,440
to understand

1739
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,400
to be like oh right informally we get

1740
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,359
where they're saying it

1741
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:17,760
but then we're interpreting their claims

1742
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,040
rigorously

1743
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,680
i.e all contextual effects in these

1744
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,720
contexts or

1745
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,400
in these settings result from the

1746
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,839
ubiquitous dependence of response

1747
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:26,960
distributions

1748
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,559
on elements of context other than the

1749
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:30,480
ones to which the response is presumably

1750
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,000
or normatively directed

1751
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:32,960
so let's say you have a driving

1752
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,640
simulation and then there's going to be

1753
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,040
some

1754
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,680
green lights and some big red stop signs

1755
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,440
and you do the behavioral measurements

1756
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,040
and you find out that conditioned on

1757
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,319
whether it was a green light or a stop

1758
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:43,200
sign the people

1759
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,119
accelerate or break so that's your

1760
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:46,799
experimental data what you controlled

1761
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:47,839
and what you observed

1762
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,799
was stoplight and then whether they

1763
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:52,720
stayed still or accelerated

1764
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:56,079
now that is context um

1765
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:57,839
it's it is context for the person who's

1766
00:57:57,839 --> 00:57:59,599
driving that's the social

1767
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:03,680
sense but all the contextual effects

1768
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,839
in this experiment result from the

1769
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:07,359
ubiquitous dependence so across the

1770
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:09,040
whole population

1771
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,359
of response distributions on elements of

1772
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:12,079
context

1773
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:13,280
other than the ones to which the

1774
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,280
response is presumably or normatively

1775
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,000
directed

1776
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,200
so it's like you thought you were

1777
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,040
measuring the response to a green light

1778
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,160
or a stop sign

1779
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,480
actually you're measuring a social

1780
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:23,280
context

1781
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,119
and a group of people who were in a

1782
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:27,119
relation with those symbols

1783
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:30,160
such that they operated in a certain way

1784
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,400
so we need contextuality by default so

1785
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,160
that we don't fall into like correlation

1786
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,440
causation

1787
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,200
super fallacious scenarios

1788
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,440
here's another case of where context

1789
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,319
matters

1790
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:43,440
and what's going to be fun is actually

1791
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,960
this decision making is going to matter

1792
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,960
for context and arrogancity

1793
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:51,520
here's a paper by valve um

1794
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,040
local choices rationality and the

1795
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,720
contextuality of decision making so

1796
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,880
every decision has a context so we know

1797
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,400
about that

1798
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,200
however rational explanation appears to

1799
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,200
be challenged by apparently systematic

1800
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,559
irrationality

1801
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:06,160
observed in psychological experiments

1802
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,760
especially in the field of judgment and

1803
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:08,720
decision making

1804
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,880
so how many times have we heard oh

1805
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,400
people are so irrational they'll take

1806
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,000
the one dollar today rather than the

1807
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,920
dollar 20 cents tomorrow

1808
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,960
or they'll pick up their children

1809
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,319
from the daycare at the right time

1810
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:21,920
unless there's a monetary penalty and

1811
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,200
then that will make them later they're

1812
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,880
so irrational

1813
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:28,160
within this one variable that's being

1814
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:31,280
estimated here it's proposed that the

1815
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,720
experimental results

1816
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,720
require not that rational explanation

1817
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:35,839
should be rejected

1818
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:37,839
but that rational explanation is local

1819
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:39,680
i.e within a context

1820
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,280
thus rational models need to be

1821
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,359
supplemented with a theory of contextual

1822
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:44,799
shifts

1823
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:47,839
makes a lot of sense um it sounds like

1824
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,280
something that's relevant to learn a bit

1825
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,160
and this paper

1826
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,160
has probably other relevant things but

1827
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,520
it's like instead of just saying well

1828
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,680
who's rational and who's irrational

1829
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,200
couldn't we just understand that

1830
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,440
everyone is in a local

1831
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:02,160
logic and a local context and then

1832
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,240
they're operating a certain way

1833
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,720
conditioned on that and so it's not a

1834
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,400
rational versus irrational divide it's

1835
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:08,880
like

1836
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,119
what's the context who's the agent

1837
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:12,160
what's the niche

1838
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:15,520
what's the context shift so

1839
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:18,799
that's a much more open but also

1840
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:20,400
powerful way i think to talk about

1841
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,160
decision making

1842
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,400
okay just raise your hand if you want to

1843
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,359
pause it

1844
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:27,599
let's take this idea of context so we

1845
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:29,359
started with context in the sort of

1846
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:32,799
um folk sense and took it to this

1847
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:34,799
idea of defining all the relevant

1848
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:37,040
variables now let's think about defining

1849
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,240
relevant variables

1850
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:41,440
in a model in terms of topology

1851
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,119
so here's some cool slides from the

1852
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:44,799
simmons institute

1853
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:48,240
and in this top right one

1854
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:51,280
it says topology is about distinguishing

1855
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,079
the continuous from the non-continuous

1856
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:56,960
and also about moving around so i was

1857
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:57,520
like

1858
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,520
that's a cool definition of topology not

1859
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:00,880
nodes and edges not how things are

1860
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:01,520
connected

1861
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,520
but it's a way it's saying how things

1862
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:05,680
are connected and this slide was really

1863
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:06,720
informative

1864
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,400
when we're asking several questions at

1865
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,079
once the answers could

1866
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:11,920
obey constraints so like if you're going

1867
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,520
to measure the pressure and the volume

1868
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:14,480
and the temperature

1869
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:17,839
of an ideal gas there's an equation pv

1870
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:20,000
equals nrt that's going to relate those

1871
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,440
things and if one of them is out of

1872
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,319
whack

1873
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:25,920
like probably something is wrong so

1874
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,680
those bundles of answers are related to

1875
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:30,400
each other

1876
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,839
could be by the laws of physics like

1877
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:34,240
here's uh you know velocity

1878
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:35,760
and time or whatever it happens to be

1879
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,520
like physical constraints

1880
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:40,160
or logical constraints so like if things

1881
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:40,799
are true

1882
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:42,720
then if they're false if they're not

1883
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,160
that and then if it's double not

1884
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,920
that it's back to being true so you can

1885
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,240
have these bundles that are logical

1886
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,960
or a bundle that is based upon some of

1887
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,520
the constraints of physics

1888
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:54,880
and then also the constraints can be

1889
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:57,280
rows of a table in a relational database

1890
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,200
that's the trip because that's where

1891
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,599
like sql and a lot of programming comes

1892
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:02,799
into play

1893
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:05,200
and models distinguish good and bad ways

1894
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,640
of connecting the dots and bundles

1895
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,119
just like continuous sections so this is

1896
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:10,319
kind of like thinking about

1897
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:13,680
sql queries and database queries

1898
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:16,799
in terms of the context

1899
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:19,200
um that's being concerned saying in the

1900
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,400
context of this

1901
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,119
database i want to make a query within

1902
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:24,079
it

1903
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:25,839
so that's an interesting way to think

1904
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:28,240
about how things are connected and

1905
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,200
context but

1906
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:32,640
um this is also stuff that's

1907
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,960
we're all just trying to put out there

1908
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,720
and hear people's reflections and

1909
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,359
thoughts on what do you think sarah i

1910
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,280
just wanted to restate it to make sure i

1911
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,359
understand it um

1912
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:45,039
i mean basically say they're saying the

1913
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:46,400
the the

1914
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,039
the way you move through context sets

1915
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:50,720
creates the topology space

1916
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,280
i think that's is that an accurate way

1917
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,920
to phrase it

1918
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:02,640
um just another

1919
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,920
aspect of it yes like there's certain

1920
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,960
in the space of making multiple

1921
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,319
measurements

1922
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:11,839
those measurements can have different

1923
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:13,119
topologies like if you make three

1924
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:14,559
measurements they could be in a line

1925
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:17,920
they could be in a triangle like there's

1926
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,240
that's not at the formality that's on

1927
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,680
here but when you're making different

1928
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:22,400
measurements

1929
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,920
they can either be in a well-behaved

1930
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,440
bundle or

1931
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,240
a not well-behaved bundle and then watch

1932
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,400
whether it's well-behaved or not

1933
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,440
is um

1934
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,520
related to whether it blew what do you

1935
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,280
think

1936
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,200
oh yeah i mean it's a hard thing let me

1937
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,839
just i'll jump in for you

1938
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:45,359
so so um going back to like the

1939
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:49,359
intrinsic and extrinsic um contextuality

1940
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:52,799
like so it's contextu it's contextuality

1941
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:56,000
when you have like a set of measurements

1942
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,359
that you know um are

1943
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:02,240
corresponding measurements right like so

1944
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,400
i mean it's like um

1945
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,240
i don't know do you have bio background

1946
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,240
sarah like like i'll i'll talk about it

1947
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,440
just in terms of like

1948
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,200
you know rna sequencing right like you

1949
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,039
can sequence your sample

1950
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:14,960
in a different lane on the same flow

1951
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,359
cell or in two different flow cells

1952
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:19,280
and there's variability right so you

1953
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,640
always have to try to like design

1954
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,880
controls into your experiment from flow

1955
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:24,799
cell to flow cell from lane to lane and

1956
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:26,000
so that's why you replicate

1957
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
the sample sequencing just to kind of

1958
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,039
control that that

1959
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:31,599
variation in just running it at a

1960
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:32,880
different time the temperature in the

1961
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:33,839
room might be different

1962
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:35,440
or you know the machine might not be

1963
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:36,880
feeling as well that day or

1964
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:39,760
or whatever so so it's these kinds of

1965
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,200
are the measurements

1966
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,640
are they all like do they all link up

1967
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:45,280
together

1968
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,359
like is there like a correlation between

1969
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:48,799
all of the measurements or not

1970
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:50,559
so that's the well-behaved bundle is

1971
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:52,000
when they do all link up

1972
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,559
they have that shared um information

1973
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:55,760
right so also

1974
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,599
i think as we get into the paper maybe

1975
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,359
it might start to make more sense

1976
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:02,799
yeah okay let's go to channel theory

1977
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:06,319
okay so this part was super fascinating

1978
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:09,200
um and i'm drawing a little bit on one

1979
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,960
of the background papers mosaic of two

1980
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,880
spaces and channel theory one

1981
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,400
by fields and glazebrook which we're

1982
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,240
going to talk more about the two

1983
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,640
mosaic papers soon but let's

1984
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,240
contextualize this in terms of

1985
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,559
information theory so-called info theory

1986
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:24,960
but i personally call it dis info theory

1987
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,480
and i've called that for a long time and

1988
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,000
now i know why actually

1989
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,720
so here's the second paragraph of claude

1990
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:33,119
shannon's 1948

1991
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:36,319
work shannon writes the fundamental

1992
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:37,839
problem of communication

1993
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:39,839
is that of reproducing at one point

1994
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,920
either exactly or approximately a

1995
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,920
message selected at another point

1996
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,760
wait is that the problem of

1997
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:46,960
communication

1998
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,599
am i trying to reconstruct something bit

1999
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:50,480
for bit

2000
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,480
via communication or is the goal of

2001
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:53,680
communication to

2002
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:56,720
impel joint action to update

2003
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,440
other agents not to replicate a message

2004
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,200
shannon's working with telegraphs

2005
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,760
and copper wire so it makes sense why

2006
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,000
you want high fidelity data transmission

2007
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,359
a signal of transportation of

2008
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:09,520
information but

2009
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,119
let's think about how broad people have

2010
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:12,640
gone with info theory

2011
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,520
according to shannon um and then he

2012
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:16,160
writes

2013
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,079
frequently the messages have meanings

2014
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:19,760
they refer to or are correlated

2015
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,119
according to some system with certain

2016
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:22,880
physical or conceptual entities

2017
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,119
these semantic aspects of communications

2018
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:26,559
are irrelevant to the engineering

2019
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:27,359
problem

2020
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:30,000
o semantics are relevant to

2021
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,079
communicating information semantically

2022
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:34,640
for people or for what the significant

2023
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,640
aspect is that the actual message is one

2024
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,160
selected from a set of all possible

2025
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,160
messages the system must be designed to

2026
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,680
operate for each possible selection

2027
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:43,039
not just the one which will actually be

2028
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:44,640
chosen since this is unknown at the time

2029
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:45,680
of design

2030
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,760
so fair enough a through z you want to

2031
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,520
have all of those options because

2032
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,119
you don't know what next letter needs to

2033
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:52,960
be poked

2034
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,359
but i think if people read through

2035
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:56,559
shannon's work

2036
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:58,799
and considered a few of the aspects of

2037
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:00,480
the shannon entropy like how it

2038
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:01,680
disorders

2039
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,680
messages like it just asks what's the

2040
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,839
symbol frequency of the whole message or

2041
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:07,119
page or genome

2042
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:08,960
if you think about how it removes the

2043
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,160
ordering of

2044
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:13,200
symbols and is actually asking about

2045
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:16,319
replicating bit for bit messages

2046
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:18,480
not communicating in any sense people

2047
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:19,839
would really consider what information

2048
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:20,799
theory is

2049
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:24,240
thankfully in this paper the

2050
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,400
fields of glazebrook wrote about

2051
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,079
comparing and this was cited in the

2052
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:30,240
2020 paper comparing and combining the

2053
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,440
shannon theory of information with

2054
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:32,400
channel theory

2055
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:36,160
okay so um though very general as a

2056
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,680
quantitative theory of communication

2057
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,480
flow

2058
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,400
the original shannon theory had largely

2059
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:41,760
overlooked the question of semantic

2060
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:42,880
content

2061
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:46,160
in any dretski type theory the basis of

2062
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,480
semantic content is in the world i.e the

2063
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,000
events or situations that signals or

2064
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,559
states carry information about

2065
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:54,160
the car you know it's out there it's in

2066
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,480
the world by showing how local logics

2067
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,319
are connected by information networks

2068
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:00,000
channel theory provides a generative

2069
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,599
general qualitative theory of

2070
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:04,799
information flow in this context

2071
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:07,280
so that's pretty interesting it's more

2072
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:07,839
about

2073
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:10,160
information flow that semantic rather

2074
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,280
than syntactic

2075
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,799
and then this last part here um

2076
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:16,880
this is there's more to say here but all

2077
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:19,198
while in 2004 create a synthesis of

2078
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:20,640
shannon's quantitative information

2079
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:21,679
theory

2080
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:24,319
with the bar wise seligman qualitative

2081
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:24,880
theory

2082
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,479
to address how the question of how

2083
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:28,238
specific objects situations and events

2084
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:30,238
carry information about each other

2085
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:32,479
that's what people are always talking

2086
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:33,920
about when they want to be talking about

2087
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,279
sharing information

2088
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:37,679
not sharing surprising symbols but

2089
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:38,960
updating each other

2090
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:40,799
semantically informationally in the

2091
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:42,640
terms of bayesian priors

2092
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,158
about the world things that we're

2093
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:46,319
referencing in the world the temperature

2094
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:48,238
not just as a variable but like as about

2095
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:49,839
something in the world

2096
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:53,120
so some thought questions is

2097
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:56,479
shannon 1948 correct about

2098
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:58,238
the stance taken on the fundamental

2099
01:08:58,238 --> 01:08:59,359
issues of communication or what

2100
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:01,439
communication is or isn't

2101
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:03,120
how is channel theory distinct from

2102
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,719
information theory so

2103
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:06,238
called this info theory we can start

2104
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:08,479
calling it and then how is

2105
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,560
real communication the kind that we care

2106
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,479
about and want to model in many cases

2107
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:14,960
how is it both syntactic and semantic

2108
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,158
all these things at once

2109
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:20,000
grammatical logical as well as lexical

2110
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,679
word-based it's also narrative driven

2111
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:25,839
a narrative or the narrative context can

2112
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:27,439
make just one word

2113
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:30,000
semantically powerful speak now or

2114
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,759
forever hold your peace it's a narrative

2115
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:33,040
context

2116
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:35,279
where one word cannot be reduced to just

2117
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:36,158
the bits

2118
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:37,679
or something like that oh well but no is

2119
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:39,839
a common word or yes it's a common word

2120
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:41,439
it doesn't matter that it's a common

2121
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:43,759
token because it's semantic information

2122
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:44,719
and then

2123
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:49,839
how is it contextual blue

2124
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:53,120
so i mean i think that there's this of

2125
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:53,520
like

2126
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:56,400
i i like shannon information theory i

2127
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,360
like how it's very

2128
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,560
logical and it appeals to like my my

2129
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:03,679
my brain structure um the

2130
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:06,239
semantic information that's contained in

2131
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:07,280
this channel theory

2132
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:10,159
description is very squishy uh and and i

2133
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:10,960
think maybe

2134
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:14,320
um not as appealing to me but i

2135
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,080
do think that it's more correct right

2136
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,080
like when you say when you reproduce

2137
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:22,719
the information like if i say

2138
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,040
um something like oh it's raining

2139
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,520
outside i live in the desert so like

2140
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,040
it's raining outside it's like a really

2141
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,360
awesome like event like let's go play in

2142
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,239
the rain right

2143
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:34,480
so when i say that and someone else says

2144
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,560
oh oh it's raining outside

2145
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,880
like like oh i'm like my plans are you

2146
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,159
know destroyed because i wanted to go to

2147
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:41,440
the park and i can't because it's

2148
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,400
raining outside so

2149
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,880
so it's two it's the same information

2150
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:45,440
but

2151
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:47,520
like i the way that i said it was very

2152
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,159
different in those different contexts

2153
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:50,560
right

2154
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:54,800
so cool let's return the discussion

2155
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:57,280
from information flows and communicating

2156
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,040
information and we're kind of

2157
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,679
thinking shannon syntax information

2158
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:02,719
reproducing bits

2159
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:04,719
bits on this computer to bits here we're

2160
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:06,320
going to take it up a level to semantic

2161
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:07,199
information

2162
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:09,280
and then semantic information so like

2163
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,440
i'm thinking of a purple cat

2164
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,120
now you're thinking of a purple cat but

2165
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,320
that could have been in a different

2166
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,080
language and it's not really related to

2167
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:17,280
how surprising each

2168
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:20,000
word is let's return to this question of

2169
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,400
local logic and contextuality

2170
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:24,880
so here's um a paper not sure if it was

2171
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,080
cited or not

2172
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:27,679
but it's going to bring together local

2173
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:29,360
logics contextuality and

2174
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,600
topological approach so we're just going

2175
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,120
to kind of give multiple codes of paint

2176
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,239
on everything

2177
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:37,440
local logic is like the local rules or

2178
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,120
the context

2179
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:43,679
and in this um kishida 2016 paper

2180
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:46,239
they wrote the topological approach

2181
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:48,239
characterizes contextuality as

2182
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:51,280
global inconsistency coupled with local

2183
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:53,760
consistency so that was kind of cool to

2184
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:55,440
me it's like if you have this field

2185
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,440
and it's globally consistent then it's

2186
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,360
like transparent there's there's nothing

2187
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:00,800
inconsistent to speak of there's no

2188
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,640
fracture in the glass

2189
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:06,000
so it just is purely transparent so

2190
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,719
um that's just the same it's part of the

2191
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:10,159
same context

2192
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:13,600
but local consistency coupled to global

2193
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,040
inconsistency

2194
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,880
is like a bubble it's like it's an

2195
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,679
inconsistency in the tank of water

2196
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:22,000
but then locally it has another

2197
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,120
transparency

2198
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:26,239
that makes sense in that local context

2199
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:27,920
and so you could have like a computer

2200
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,600
program and then that could be a local

2201
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,600
logic but it's embedded in another

2202
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,440
logic of being a turing complete or you

2203
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,960
know whatever kind of computer

2204
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,800
and then within that program there could

2205
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,719
be like a simulation of another program

2206
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:40,080
of an n64

2207
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,800
running another program and even if it's

2208
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,159
all the way back up at the top it's

2209
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:45,199
running on linux

2210
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:47,360
but that local program is running on the

2211
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,120
n64s

2212
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:52,080
local logic and then another kind of

2213
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:52,719
metaphor

2214
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:55,040
oh and then in the paper they write our

2215
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,400
goal is to capture this local

2216
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,840
consistency part

2217
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,600
not just the global inconsistencies the

2218
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,040
global inconsistency is like our

2219
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:03,360
receptor is not getting any photons

2220
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,920
boom it got a photon inconsistency so

2221
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,040
not just that part

2222
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:09,840
but the local consistency part which so

2223
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:10,719
how do we know

2224
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:12,000
how do we know that it was consistent

2225
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,239
before that photon hit which requires a

2226
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,520
novel approach to logic

2227
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,000
sensitive to the topology of contexts to

2228
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,600
achieve this we formulate a logic of

2229
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:20,880
local inference by using

2230
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,719
context-sensitive theories and models in

2231
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:24,560
regular categories

2232
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,159
and that's going to be powerful here's

2233
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:27,520
how i was thinking about this in terms

2234
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:28,480
of chess

2235
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:31,199
so the rules of the game of chess are

2236
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:31,600
like

2237
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,280
which piece can move which way and then

2238
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,120
some of the imperatives like

2239
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:38,159
you have to um alleviate check otherwise

2240
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:39,520
you lose the game

2241
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,600
that's the context the local rules of

2242
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,120
the game

2243
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,840
then there are local or situational

2244
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,280
patterns like a pin

2245
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:48,719
where one piece is like in front of the

2246
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:49,920
king and it can't move out of the way

2247
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,199
because then the king would go into

2248
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:51,679
check

2249
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:54,960
so that's not a rule of chess but

2250
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:57,520
it's an emergent pattern that arises

2251
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,960
from constraints in the space

2252
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:01,840
given the local logic of chess but now

2253
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:02,880
we're in this even

2254
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:06,159
sub-local logic i'm not going hyper

2255
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:07,760
formal maybe chess players have another

2256
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,040
way of doing this but it's like

2257
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,120
there's a local logic in the corner of

2258
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,880
the board with a king

2259
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:15,760
and not every piece or rule of chess

2260
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,600
like okay well the pawn can move two or

2261
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:18,320
one

2262
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,960
but that rule might not matter for this

2263
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,640
pin with these pieces

2264
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:25,920
and so not every single rule or piece

2265
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,640
is going to matter for these local

2266
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:29,920
logics

2267
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:33,440
and maybe there's a way to pursue this

2268
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:34,960
topologically in terms of the

2269
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,640
connectedness of different relationships

2270
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,960
of the system

2271
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:42,719
let's take that to choose spaces

2272
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:44,960
okay so this one was um you know it's

2273
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:46,400
the second section of the paper so it's

2274
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:47,840
like okay you gotta

2275
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:50,480
understand and and learn this one so we

2276
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,800
were kind of excited to do this

2277
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,280
so they start by defining one of the

2278
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,120
simplest categories so we're in category

2279
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:57,920
theory

2280
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:00,159
is the category of two spaces which

2281
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:01,920
we're going to talk more about

2282
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:05,520
and it basically is about a set

2283
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:09,120
k and then within k there are kind of

2284
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,320
two kinds of things

2285
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:13,440
objects and attributes and the two space

2286
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:16,000
is like a matrix that is the

2287
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,440
relationship

2288
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:20,719
over that set k of the relationships of

2289
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:20,960
a

2290
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:24,000
and x it's so it's actually probably a

2291
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,920
data form that we've seen a ton of times

2292
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:26,320
like

2293
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,000
here's ten people and then have they

2294
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,159
rsvp'd for my event or not

2295
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:33,520
yes yes yes no one one one zero

2296
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,560
that's a two space for rsvps but it's

2297
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:37,360
like that

2298
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,679
you know here but it could be a lot more

2299
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:41,199
general and we're going to keep on

2300
01:15:41,199 --> 01:15:43,840
generalizing on that but the basic two

2301
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,440
space

2302
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,120
is a matrix but it probably can be

2303
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,560
higher dimensional

2304
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:52,000
that is just a regular matrix but

2305
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,719
a topological space is also a matrix so

2306
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:56,480
you can have like the adjacency matrix

2307
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,080
right like all the nodes by all the

2308
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:59,920
nodes one or zero connected or not or a

2309
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:00,719
weighted graph

2310
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:02,719
how strong is the connection or it could

2311
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:04,000
be symmetric

2312
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,840
and undirected or there could be a from

2313
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:08,560
and a two so like all of topology

2314
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,880
is matrix forms and it turns out that

2315
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,159
they're two spaces

2316
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:13,920
but also we can think about like

2317
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,520
programming languages

2318
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,960
and we can have a type as

2319
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:21,280
one of like an attribute or a type you

2320
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,320
know is the wood

2321
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:25,679
tabling shoe space or is the object a

2322
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:26,159
table

2323
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:28,239
that's a chew space so there's a lot of

2324
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:29,840
programming relationships that the chew

2325
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,360
space covers

2326
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:34,480
probability spaces um coin flip you know

2327
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,480
content you know that is it gonna happen

2328
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:37,600
or not

2329
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,600
so this it's like if it's a matrix i

2330
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,199
don't know if it's you can go as far as

2331
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:43,040
say it is a two space but it

2332
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:46,640
certainly a broad family of

2333
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,159
objects or categories i don't even know

2334
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:50,000
what to say there are within this

2335
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,040
two-space

2336
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,920
paradigm there's a few more definitions

2337
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,520
because we looked up just a bunch

2338
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:58,080
here's from wikipedia and basically the

2339
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,520
big idea

2340
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:02,159
is that the true morphisms are

2341
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:03,600
transformations on

2342
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,640
two spaces and if things are set up

2343
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:07,360
properly

2344
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:10,320
the morphism's continuous and the pair

2345
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:11,120
of functions

2346
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:15,040
has some special relationships so um

2347
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,640
one example this makes me think of is

2348
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,800
like the typographical number theory

2349
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,280
in girdle escherbach where it's like one

2350
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,400
plus one equals two

2351
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,080
and then you make a set of text rules

2352
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:26,239
like you can add an s

2353
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:28,080
to the string under these contexts or

2354
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,000
you can add um or you can you know

2355
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,840
it's like it's basically doing addition

2356
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,520
and subtraction

2357
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:36,880
by typographical like letter based rules

2358
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:39,360
so if you can prove something in one

2359
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,239
system

2360
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:42,800
because you've super strongly shown that

2361
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,480
there's a morphism

2362
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,400
you can show that that same relationship

2363
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,159
should exist in another system

2364
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:49,840
it also turns out that's actually at the

2365
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,679
heart of like the whole gerdell

2366
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:54,400
question but that's the static

2367
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,159
interpretation

2368
01:17:56,159 --> 01:17:58,560
and then um here's dynamically two

2369
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,159
spaces transform in the manner of

2370
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:02,080
topological spaces

2371
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:06,320
um yeah don't go too deep down here but

2372
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:09,520
there's special relationships of two two

2373
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:12,080
spaces that are chewmorphisms

2374
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:14,159
and then if that morphism is

2375
01:18:14,159 --> 01:18:16,320
bi-directional it just allows a really

2376
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:17,840
nice thing where you can sort of make a

2377
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,760
finding on one side and then arbitrage

2378
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:20,080
it

2379
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,360
to some relationship that might have

2380
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,679
been difficult to show on the other side

2381
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:26,080
so it's like a perfect language mapping

2382
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,120
you could say you know

2383
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:29,679
the the boy is younger than the car if

2384
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:31,440
you had a perfect language mapping

2385
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:34,000
semantically you could say it in another

2386
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,760
language and the semantic information

2387
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:37,360
would be perfectly preserved

2388
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:39,040
so then maybe one person has a piece of

2389
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,480
semantic information in english and then

2390
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:41,679
they could convey it through the perfect

2391
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:42,719
morphism

2392
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:46,159
and it would be correctly semantically

2393
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:49,920
understood on the other side okay

2394
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:52,960
here it's just a couple these we just

2395
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,480
we wanted to actually understand it and

2396
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,000
also um

2397
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,320
shout out to master students everywhere

2398
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,560
so here's history from this

2399
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,159
paper the chew construction takes a

2400
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:04,880
symmetric monoidal closed category

2401
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:08,400
v and with pullbacks i got

2402
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,880
reading it and an object k of e and

2403
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:11,600
completes v

2404
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:15,360
to a self dual category chu v k

2405
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,040
the details of this construction appear

2406
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:19,199
in ph choose master's thesis

2407
01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:21,360
published as an appendix to his advisors

2408
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:22,320
mbar's book

2409
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,400
introducing the notion of a asterisk

2410
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,239
autonomous category

2411
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:29,360
so chapter that was an appendix

2412
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:32,719
and now here we are many years later

2413
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:34,880
so it's all good to research whatever

2414
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:36,080
you're researching on

2415
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:39,360
if it appears to you to be

2416
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:41,840
the big question here's barr's

2417
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:42,640
perspective

2418
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:45,679
so bar is another perspective on

2419
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:49,199
shoe spaces barr had this idea during

2420
01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:51,679
his sabbatical to study duality in

2421
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:52,719
categories

2422
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:55,840
in some depth just what most of us

2423
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:58,800
take our sabbatical wondering he wasn't

2424
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:02,239
wondering about the simple dualities

2425
01:20:02,239 --> 01:20:05,440
but self-dual categories like

2426
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:07,600
complete semi-lattices or finite abelian

2427
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,600
groups

2428
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,040
he was interested in the possibility of

2429
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,960
having a category that was not only

2430
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:14,000
self-dual

2431
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,040
but one that had an internal home and

2432
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,960
for which the duality was implemented as

2433
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:20,000
the internal home

2434
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,760
into a dualizing object it's technical

2435
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:24,880
so duality

2436
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,320
is going to mean something different to

2437
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,239
a mathematician than a non-mathematician

2438
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:28,719
and

2439
01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:32,080
i don't know what a home is however

2440
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:33,920
searching for an internal home i just

2441
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:35,360
thought okay the dual it's like forwards

2442
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:36,719
and backwards or it's like it's

2443
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:38,639
it goes both ways that would be nice you

2444
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:39,840
know reversible

2445
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,600
it's like those are always good things

2446
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,360
and then the internal home

2447
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:45,760
internal homes when chained together

2448
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,280
form a language called the internal

2449
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,120
language of the category and i thought

2450
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:52,000
okay so now we're going from categories

2451
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,560
and attributes to like

2452
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:56,719
something else the most famous of these

2453
01:20:56,719 --> 01:20:57,920
internal homes

2454
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:01,199
are simply typed lambda calculus

2455
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:02,400
which is the internal language of

2456
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,159
cartesian closed categories and the

2457
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:06,000
linear type system the internal language

2458
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,719
of closed symmetric monoidal categories

2459
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:10,560
lambda calculus is something that's

2460
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:13,120
quite broad and central to

2461
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:16,000
computation so this is like something

2462
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,440
about how logic

2463
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:20,480
local logics and nested logics

2464
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:23,679
are related to categories in an

2465
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:25,360
analytical way

2466
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:27,760
such that the kinds of logic that we see

2467
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:28,800
on computers

2468
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:32,159
is only a type of it because in a way

2469
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:35,760
we're dealing with syntaxed based logic

2470
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,520
you know you have two files are they the

2471
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:40,000
same it lines up the bits and if they're

2472
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:40,480
the same

2473
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:43,679
it's yes no but what

2474
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:46,560
would this mean if it could be

2475
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:47,360
semantically

2476
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:48,800
the same and how would we make that

2477
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,800
non-squishy because

2478
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,800
to ask whether semantics were the same

2479
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:55,040
you need all the context

2480
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:57,520
so that's kind of this fun twist and it

2481
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:58,880
makes sense

2482
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:02,000
why for simplicity you use frequencies

2483
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,520
statistics instead of bayesian

2484
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:06,159
inference because it is hard to do

2485
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:07,280
sometimes

2486
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:08,960
or you do have to grapple with unknown

2487
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,400
unknowns and it's easier to just do a

2488
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:11,199
t-test

2489
01:22:11,199 --> 01:22:13,440
or a multi-linear regression rather than

2490
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:15,040
some other type of generative model

2491
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,800
because that takes like bravery to

2492
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,719
specify your uncertainty

2493
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:20,320
and to give support to why you did a

2494
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,560
certain thing rather than just say

2495
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,480
well you know the countries differ with

2496
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,159
a p-value of 0.01 but

2497
01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:28,000
it's easy just to say that and move on

2498
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,760
rather than actually do some sort of

2499
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,360
rich modeling underneath

2500
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:34,159
okay true spaces and channel theories so

2501
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:34,800
like we're kind of

2502
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,560
just trying to bring all these two you

2503
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,159
know connect two of the ideas and then

2504
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:40,880
you can start nucleating some ideas

2505
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:44,400
from the ones that are making sense in

2506
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,679
channel theory which again we're

2507
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:48,080
thinking of like the um more general

2508
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:51,199
cousin of shannon dis info theory in

2509
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:52,560
channel theory

2510
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:54,960
two transforms these are the

2511
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,639
transformations between

2512
01:22:56,639 --> 01:23:00,719
the two sets um or spaces

2513
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:03,199
become infomorphisms which are natural

2514
01:23:03,199 --> 01:23:05,120
maps between classifiers

2515
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:07,520
okay so blue what would you say about

2516
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,199
the red underlined part or

2517
01:23:09,199 --> 01:23:12,560
what you wrote at the bottom um

2518
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:15,120
so this will i'll like transition you

2519
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:15,760
into the

2520
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:18,239
next slide maybe here in a minute but um

2521
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:20,000
just the red underlines part it's

2522
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,719
the transform from a to b so if you have

2523
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:23,920
one two space

2524
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,960
and another two space the whatever it's

2525
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,639
like you know you can think about like

2526
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:30,639
a territory and the map of that

2527
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:32,400
territory like whatever

2528
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,480
transform going from the territory to

2529
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:35,679
the map

2530
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:38,800
that is that channel right is

2531
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:41,520
thought informally of as a channel um

2532
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:42,239
that is

2533
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:43,760
uh like the channel that we're talking

2534
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:46,560
about here in in terms of channel theory

2535
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:50,080
and so these um the

2536
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:53,120
the classifiers here so the

2537
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:57,120
um a classifier is

2538
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:00,840
the um set of where did i have that here

2539
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:03,520
somewhere

2540
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:06,400
classifiers link tokens to types oh yeah

2541
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:07,120
but so

2542
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:09,040
oh that's that's this is the definition

2543
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:10,719
of a classifier so classifiers link

2544
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:12,080
tokens to types

2545
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,520
that encompass them oh yeah because

2546
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:15,199
you've already read this so the channel

2547
01:24:15,199 --> 01:24:15,760
theory the

2548
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:18,159
two transforms become infomorphisms

2549
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:20,320
which map between classifiers

2550
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:22,239
so if you have different sets of

2551
01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:23,679
classifiers right so

2552
01:24:23,679 --> 01:24:25,679
classifiers link tokens to types that

2553
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:26,719
encompass them

2554
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:29,120
so for the type stoplight the set of

2555
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:30,480
tokens could be like you could have a

2556
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,239
red stop light a yellow stop light or a

2557
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:34,320
green stop light and that's also known

2558
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:37,199
as a local logic the classifier which we

2559
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:38,719
talked about local logics

2560
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:41,199
just a few um slides back but flip to

2561
01:24:41,199 --> 01:24:43,520
the next slide and i'll continue this

2562
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:46,639
so mapping between classifiers

2563
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:49,120
so here if you have the classifier

2564
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,639
stoplight and then you have like

2565
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:52,400
what the motorist should do with the

2566
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,400
stoplight so that's the second

2567
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,159
classifier you could have the tokens

2568
01:24:56,159 --> 01:24:56,960
like

2569
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,600
stop at the red light go forward at the

2570
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,520
green light or proceed slowly at the

2571
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:02,239
yellow light or

2572
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:03,360
like get out of the intersection or

2573
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,639
whatever it is you think you should

2574
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:05,840
actually do at the

2575
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,760
at the um stop light but then you can

2576
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:09,360
have other classifiers too so it doesn't

2577
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:10,960
just have to be the stop light and the

2578
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:12,400
what the motorist should do

2579
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,080
it's also like what pedestrians should

2580
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,239
do and like at the game like red light

2581
01:25:16,239 --> 01:25:17,440
green light that you play when you're a

2582
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,880
kid like you should run forward run

2583
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,639
slowly or walk or or then

2584
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:23,040
and stop so i mean there's different um

2585
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:25,040
classifiers that you can have that all

2586
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:28,080
mapped to the same central information

2587
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,000
core right and so that's what you see

2588
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,360
here the classifiers are

2589
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:34,159
these things a1 a2 and you can have many

2590
01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:36,080
of them up to a to the k

2591
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:38,400
and then you have at a core this

2592
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:39,199
information

2593
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:40,800
channel right so this is the

2594
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,280
infomorphism that allows semantic

2595
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:45,199
information not just shannon information

2596
01:25:45,199 --> 01:25:46,880
to be transmitted between

2597
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:49,840
classifiers so this comes down to having

2598
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:51,679
a shared memory so we all learn from the

2599
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:52,800
time that we're six

2600
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:55,920
that red means to stop green means to go

2601
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:58,400
yellow means to slow down so so but to a

2602
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,000
six-year-old it means running

2603
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,360
you know when you're a pedestrian you're

2604
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:03,040
looking out for other cars and and there

2605
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:04,480
are other behaviors that you do

2606
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:07,040
and as a motorist also and as a police

2607
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:08,800
officer policing the motorists there's

2608
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,239
all kinds of people that have different

2609
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:11,360
reactions to what

2610
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:12,800
the stoplight is doing but that's all

2611
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,400
based on this shared

2612
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,159
memory like we've everybody has been

2613
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:17,840
taught like this is what you're supposed

2614
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:18,239
to do

2615
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:20,880
out of light um and so so that's this

2616
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:21,280
core

2617
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:23,600
information channel um through which

2618
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:24,400
information

2619
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:27,040
flows it's can be also be thought of as

2620
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:28,480
a shared memory or

2621
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:32,959
um a shared context if you will

2622
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:35,440
cool one thing that that makes me think

2623
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,480
of here

2624
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:39,679
is like this sentence that said um uh

2625
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:41,840
the existence of a true transform a to b

2626
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,440
is equivalent for every flow formula

2627
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:44,239
valid in a

2628
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:46,480
being valid in b so it's kind of like

2629
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:48,320
you have the chessboard

2630
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,480
and the board position says it's game

2631
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,239
over and then you have the

2632
01:26:52,239 --> 01:26:55,360
the data file and then those two are

2633
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:55,920
within

2634
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:59,600
a bigger c that is establishing

2635
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,520
a connection between these very

2636
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:04,000
different types and so it's like there's

2637
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,440
um in the example you gave the local

2638
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:08,159
logic

2639
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:10,480
is like there is a total logic that it

2640
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:12,639
does all come back to

2641
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:14,320
even though there's disparate types and

2642
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:17,440
there's sub logics

2643
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:20,239
let's hear what everyone else and chris

2644
01:27:20,239 --> 01:27:21,679
can bring to this discussion because

2645
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:23,199
it's like super interesting to think

2646
01:27:23,199 --> 01:27:23,679
about

2647
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:29,760
um yep okay so what about sequence blue

2648
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:33,760
um so the sequence here uh

2649
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:36,000
i just wanted to put this in because i

2650
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,120
thought it was it was

2651
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:39,360
important for information flow so

2652
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:40,800
sequence uh

2653
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:43,280
when a secret incl encodes a semantic

2654
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:45,360
like a causal constraint

2655
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:48,480
uh that effectively functions as a logic

2656
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:51,280
gate so this really what it's what

2657
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:52,400
enables

2658
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:55,679
semantic um information as opposed to

2659
01:27:55,679 --> 01:27:56,080
just

2660
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,840
shannon information so it's like you

2661
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,840
have the message but there's a logic

2662
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:00,480
gate there

2663
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:02,400
that says if the message is applicable

2664
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:04,639
or not applicable or to be transmitted

2665
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:05,440
or not

2666
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:08,480
um and also that it um i think

2667
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:12,159
puts forward into the um it enables

2668
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:13,520
putting forward into the

2669
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:16,560
scale-free or scalable uh infrastructure

2670
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:17,760
here i think

2671
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,760
um and then i like all this like math

2672
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,280
symbols like i've never seen this stuff

2673
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:22,400
before these like

2674
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:24,480
what is this like parallel line lollipop

2675
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:26,000
stick i don't know

2676
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,400
um but but i just i i put a box around

2677
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:29,679
this because it's like oh

2678
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:32,639
that goes back to bay's probability all

2679
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:33,920
right i know this

2680
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:37,360
so it's coming home again

2681
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:39,360
cool i think this one just reading this

2682
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:40,960
one um x

2683
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:43,679
then shape n to assign a probability x

2684
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:44,480
satisfies

2685
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:47,199
n so maybe it's the sign of satisfaction

2686
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:47,679
um

2687
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:49,440
i guess it just says something that we

2688
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:50,719
don't know what it looks like

2689
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:53,360
um but it's like there's a satisfaction

2690
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:54,000
of

2691
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,840
x to assign a probability that x

2692
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:57,760
satisfies n given that it satisfies

2693
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:59,440
m so it's like what's the probability

2694
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:01,760
that we're in checkmate on the board

2695
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:04,560
given that the file says checkmate well

2696
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:06,080
if you have the morphism

2697
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:08,480
it's perfect but if you don't have that

2698
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:09,440
morphism

2699
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:11,760
then it's probabilistic or it's

2700
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:12,639
different

2701
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:15,520
so it's a conditional probability that's

2702
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,199
conditioned upon the way that you can

2703
01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:19,280
map across different kinds of things

2704
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:22,159
and it was the perfect connection to

2705
01:29:22,159 --> 01:29:23,440
beijing inference

2706
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:25,600
because at the bottom here we have um

2707
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:26,960
basically m

2708
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:30,080
satisfying um a

2709
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:33,360
is the true space that's the the scarlet

2710
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:34,400
letter the fancy a

2711
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:37,440
is the two space um and so

2712
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:39,440
this is almost like saying m is

2713
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:41,280
satisfying some true flow

2714
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:44,560
relationship with n that

2715
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:47,280
is itself about how tightly the spaces

2716
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,880
are connected

2717
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:51,360
and so then we can take this p m given n

2718
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,000
single line

2719
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,280
not satisfied um and it is

2720
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:58,400
belief updating and so then

2721
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:01,199
uh yeah it provides the necessary

2722
01:30:01,199 --> 01:30:03,600
semantic consistency for such updating

2723
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,920
infomorphisms thus capture a significant

2724
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:08,159
representation of bayesian inference

2725
01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:10,480
with the necessary coherence since the

2726
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:12,719
target classifier context emits the same

2727
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:14,320
semantics as that as the source within

2728
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:16,239
the information flow

2729
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:18,880
information or infomorphisms are

2730
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:20,880
information flows

2731
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:22,639
that capture the updating of something

2732
01:30:22,639 --> 01:30:25,199
semantic because it's semantic in that

2733
01:30:25,199 --> 01:30:26,239
dretzki

2734
01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:28,800
meaning is in the world way like the

2735
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,400
prior and the posterior are

2736
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:34,320
about the world and then as

2737
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:37,040
new data or events come in which i

2738
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:38,400
didn't think we captured as much here

2739
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:40,800
but like this event theory connection

2740
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:43,679
it's like bayesian um statistics is kind

2741
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:45,040
of like

2742
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:47,120
the steady state and then new data comes

2743
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:48,080
in it's like an event

2744
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:50,880
in a network and the in that event

2745
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,800
propagates through a network

2746
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:57,199
of semantic information flow and then

2747
01:30:57,199 --> 01:30:58,800
that updates the system and maybe it's

2748
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,560
like the system's already vibrating and

2749
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:02,320
so the new event comes in

2750
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:04,800
nothing changes with a vibration that

2751
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,080
might be a situation

2752
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:10,000
like the system semantically is already

2753
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,400
at its non-equilibrium steady state and

2754
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:13,440
so it's like not

2755
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:15,920
surprising but then there's other kinds

2756
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:16,880
of events

2757
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:18,880
that enter a system that might be more

2758
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:20,560
surprising

2759
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:23,600
but it's all about the semantic

2760
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:27,360
nature of a system okay so wait wait yep

2761
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:29,600
can i just add on to this yep but like

2762
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:31,040
in our in our

2763
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:32,960
um contextualizing like and i don't know

2764
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:34,320
if you were going there or not but i

2765
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,400
just want to explicitly state that like

2766
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:39,600
bayesian inference is the event

2767
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:41,520
like which we are updating with active

2768
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:42,719
inference and

2769
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:45,120
category theory and two spaces were you

2770
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:45,920
like like

2771
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:48,080
implying that or i just wanted to state

2772
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:49,280
that explicitly because

2773
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:52,800
in this context contextuality talk about

2774
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,639
contextuality

2775
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:57,520
like we are updating our own like events

2776
01:31:57,520 --> 01:31:59,199
with our with our own knowledge

2777
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:02,239
yep and i i think what's sort of fun

2778
01:32:02,239 --> 01:32:03,120
about this

2779
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:05,280
semantic info flow idea the whole

2780
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:06,480
channel theory thing which i really

2781
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:07,440
didn't

2782
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:10,239
get exposed to in a lot of contexts was

2783
01:32:10,239 --> 01:32:10,960
that

2784
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:13,520
instead of the propagation of bits and

2785
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:15,199
bytes on wires

2786
01:32:15,199 --> 01:32:16,800
and the signal fidelity and then it's

2787
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,239
like well then where does the semantics

2788
01:32:18,239 --> 01:32:19,120
get unpacked

2789
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:20,960
does it get unpacked at every little

2790
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:23,120
post office and they just say no no just

2791
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,800
syntax all the way down

2792
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,639
so it's inherently reductionist because

2793
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:29,040
you go no we've explained away

2794
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:31,679
meaning because we're studying the

2795
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:32,719
connection

2796
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:35,679
from a entropy perspective and then it's

2797
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:36,719
sort of a strong

2798
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:39,120
internally logical argument which is why

2799
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:40,080
there's people who believe

2800
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:42,880
it and then it's like could we actually

2801
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:45,440
think of semantics as the heart of the

2802
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,400
question

2803
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:47,679
because when we're talking about

2804
01:32:47,679 --> 01:32:49,920
communication of action or modification

2805
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:50,880
of the niche

2806
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:53,280
or solving the frame problem we don't

2807
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:55,199
need the syntactic differences we want

2808
01:32:55,199 --> 01:32:56,560
the semantic differences

2809
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:58,800
like what has changed my car is broken i

2810
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:00,560
don't need to know the syntax

2811
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:04,320
but from a action-oriented semantic view

2812
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:05,840
that's what we're communicating on and

2813
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:07,679
then we're seeing these specialized

2814
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:08,480
communication

2815
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,480
message passing systems like on a

2816
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:11,679
silicone chip

2817
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:14,000
it's a special case it's a controlled

2818
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:14,880
system

2819
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:17,520
where we've defined the context

2820
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:18,320
semantically

2821
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:22,560
so that it isomorphically maps onto bits

2822
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:26,000
and voltages okay

2823
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,159
here's the two fields and glaze brook

2824
01:33:28,159 --> 01:33:29,040
papers from

2825
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:32,159
uh 2018 uh

2826
01:33:32,159 --> 01:33:33,840
mosaic of two spaces in channel theory

2827
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:35,280
one and two so

2828
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:37,520
one category theory concepts and tools

2829
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:38,960
is like a lot of

2830
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:42,000
formalisms diagrams but two has some

2831
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,440
nice images

2832
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:45,679
and that's applications to object

2833
01:33:45,679 --> 01:33:47,199
identification and

2834
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:50,560
neurological complexity is

2835
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:53,600
parts and whole relationships and

2836
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:56,480
this is to go from the two spaces to

2837
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:57,440
this

2838
01:33:57,440 --> 01:34:00,639
cocoon a system capable of both object

2839
01:34:00,639 --> 01:34:02,320
history construction and its

2840
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:05,520
dual category learning

2841
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:07,920
so just there history reconstruction and

2842
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:09,840
its dual category learning it's like

2843
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:12,880
i'm learning about cars being broken or

2844
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:13,600
not

2845
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:14,800
and then if you tell me it's a broken

2846
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:16,880
car i can generate a vision in my mind

2847
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:18,239
of a broken car

2848
01:34:18,239 --> 01:34:19,679
so it's like you have a bi-directional

2849
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:21,440
relationship that's that's open to

2850
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:22,960
generating specifics

2851
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:26,159
from the abstract or

2852
01:34:26,159 --> 01:34:29,280
updating the abstract from the specifics

2853
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:31,120
which is really related to this

2854
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:32,719
hierarchical bayesian learning and

2855
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:34,400
active inference

2856
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:36,480
and they have reached after many years

2857
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:38,080
of research

2858
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:40,480
and understanding that objects that have

2859
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:41,920
this sort of analytical

2860
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,520
relationship between object history

2861
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:46,239
construction and category learning

2862
01:34:46,239 --> 01:34:47,679
with a singular category of maintenance

2863
01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:49,679
as a special case not sure i think that

2864
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:51,760
maybe that has to be one object that

2865
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:53,679
does both a self dual

2866
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:55,199
not just two objects one that does one

2867
01:34:55,199 --> 01:34:56,800
part one that is the other is

2868
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:58,239
characterized by a cone

2869
01:34:58,239 --> 01:35:02,080
cocom diagram a cone cocon

2870
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:04,719
diagram captures the simultaneous upward

2871
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:06,400
and downward flow of constraints that

2872
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:07,119
characterize

2873
01:35:07,119 --> 01:35:09,920
human visual object identification and

2874
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:11,360
it is reasonable to suppose other sense

2875
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,560
modalities

2876
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:15,920
and they then take it very instantly

2877
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:16,880
into

2878
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:18,159
something fascinating which is the

2879
01:35:18,159 --> 01:35:20,480
functional duality between a high

2880
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:22,320
precision expectations and high

2881
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:24,480
precision inputs in an active inference

2882
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:25,920
system

2883
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:27,600
and hence the duality between dorsal

2884
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:29,119
active and ventral passive attention

2885
01:35:29,119 --> 01:35:29,840
systems

2886
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:34,080
so it is about this precision modulation

2887
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:35,920
and the way that you get high precision

2888
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:38,000
expectations and high precision inputs

2889
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,159
so how do you have a clear generative

2890
01:35:40,159 --> 01:35:42,400
model of the visual field but then at

2891
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:43,679
the same time

2892
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:45,440
you want to be able to recognize new

2893
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:47,679
objects at high fidelity as they come

2894
01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:50,159
into the screen come into your field so

2895
01:35:50,159 --> 01:35:52,159
how are you going to have high precision

2896
01:35:52,159 --> 01:35:55,360
generating and high precision learning

2897
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:57,600
and there's going to be this rich

2898
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:59,199
multi-level

2899
01:35:59,199 --> 01:36:02,239
um ongoing integration of priors and new

2900
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:03,840
events and posteriors

2901
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:06,800
that's semantic so it's like i'm looking

2902
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:08,560
at oh it's a face and then my

2903
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:10,239
eyes engage in an action selection

2904
01:36:10,239 --> 01:36:12,080
pattern appropriate for a face

2905
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:14,159
that reveals some sort of anomalous

2906
01:36:14,159 --> 01:36:15,360
information pattern

2907
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:17,760
and all of a sudden the meaning has

2908
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:19,360
changed and so it's almost

2909
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:21,280
like what is crossing the interface

2910
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:22,480
perhaps is

2911
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:24,480
the the data the observable the

2912
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:25,840
measurements

2913
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:28,960
but what is crossing

2914
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:30,719
is actually like the reconstruction of

2915
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:32,239
semantics

2916
01:36:32,239 --> 01:36:34,560
rather like if it's a car driving across

2917
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,480
your view but it's going 5000 miles an

2918
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:38,080
hour and you can't see it

2919
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:40,320
then for you as the measure it doesn't

2920
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:42,159
matter because you didn't see it

2921
01:36:42,159 --> 01:36:44,239
so even though it was perhaps there but

2922
01:36:44,239 --> 01:36:45,280
it's just a blur

2923
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:47,600
and so this is just getting at something

2924
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:49,360
very interesting which is these systems

2925
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:53,360
that are exquisitely generative yet also

2926
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:56,800
hyper able to recognize and

2927
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:59,840
to update the generator based upon

2928
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:01,119
the specifics of which have been

2929
01:37:01,119 --> 01:37:03,440
generated oh all cats have stripes

2930
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:04,800
all right you just saw one that had

2931
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:06,960
polka dots and now you can generate that

2932
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:08,560
and then maybe you might generalize and

2933
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,400
even generate another type of pattern

2934
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,880
of cats and then you could see whether

2935
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:15,360
that was

2936
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:18,880
accurate or not so here is the diagram

2937
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:20,000
that blue talked us through

2938
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,920
here with the core information channel c

2939
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,119
at the top

2940
01:37:23,119 --> 01:37:24,880
and so this is the cone diagram on the

2941
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:27,280
top it's it's like a pyramid diagram but

2942
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:27,679
like

2943
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:29,679
maybe if it rotates it's like a cone or

2944
01:37:29,679 --> 01:37:30,880
there's some other way of thinking of it

2945
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,560
like a cone

2946
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:35,040
and you have the classifiers and this is

2947
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:36,719
the whole choose space as classifiers

2948
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:37,840
scarlet letter a

2949
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:41,040
choosebase so the classifiers are

2950
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:43,360
linked through infomorphisms semantic

2951
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:44,400
bridges

2952
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:46,880
to the core information channel so like

2953
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:48,960
here's the chess board here's um another

2954
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:49,760
two space

2955
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:51,119
and here's another two space for chess

2956
01:37:51,119 --> 01:37:52,320
and they're all linking to this like

2957
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:53,119
game of chess

2958
01:37:53,119 --> 01:37:55,199
local logic and then there's a map

2959
01:37:55,199 --> 01:37:56,639
between the board and the computer

2960
01:37:56,639 --> 01:37:57,520
program

2961
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:59,520
so g one two two three are the

2962
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:01,280
commutivity so this is like

2963
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:02,800
you got a link between the board and the

2964
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:04,560
computer and the computer and the

2965
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:05,679
drawing

2966
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:08,719
and they're all infomorphisms to see

2967
01:38:08,719 --> 01:38:11,040
the game of chess so semantically if

2968
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:12,480
there's a checkmate on one board it's

2969
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:15,199
like a checkmate across paradigms

2970
01:38:15,199 --> 01:38:18,239
now when you're um

2971
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:21,199
when this is a a tight cone and it

2972
01:38:21,199 --> 01:38:23,440
represents like a huge variety of things

2973
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:25,040
and then i'll get you the second blue

2974
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:26,719
the co cone

2975
01:38:26,719 --> 01:38:28,480
is when we oh yeah go ahead go ahead

2976
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,400
good let me let me interject before you

2977
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:32,480
do the cocoon that's why i was like

2978
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:34,480
okay so i want to interject here for

2979
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:35,920
sarah cause remember we were talking

2980
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:36,880
about like the

2981
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:39,520
the observables being like a tight like

2982
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:40,560
a tight little

2983
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:43,520
cluster of of measurements versus a not

2984
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:45,119
tight cluster of measurements

2985
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:47,280
and so here they define it in this

2986
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:49,119
before we go into the cocoon

2987
01:38:49,119 --> 01:38:51,440
um so so you can kind of take this back

2988
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:52,239
to like

2989
01:38:52,239 --> 01:38:54,080
the stop light and the kids playing and

2990
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,520
what the driver does what pedestrian

2991
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:56,400
does and whatever but

2992
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:58,080
but here if you think about it instead

2993
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:00,639
of like that the categories or the sorry

2994
01:39:00,639 --> 01:39:01,920
the classifiers

2995
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:04,320
uh it says when we define a finite

2996
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:05,440
information channel

2997
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:08,800
c uh as a finite indexed family

2998
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:11,840
of infomorphisms those are all the f's

2999
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:14,960
having a common core the component

3000
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:16,480
classifiers will be taken to

3001
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:17,679
characterize

3002
01:39:17,679 --> 01:39:20,639
a system of observables or some

3003
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:22,080
subcomponents thereof

3004
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:23,520
so here they're specifically stating

3005
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:25,600
that all of the classifiers here

3006
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:27,280
are all of the things that can be

3007
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:28,719
measured or observed

3008
01:39:28,719 --> 01:39:31,520
in a in a context that's extrinsic as

3009
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:32,239
opposed to

3010
01:39:32,239 --> 01:39:35,440
intrinsic i think so i could be wrong i

3011
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:36,960
hope that someone someone corrects me

3012
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:38,560
but i feel like this is where

3013
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:41,760
where it's going

3014
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:45,920
cool cone diagram then we introduce

3015
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:49,679
the co cone the shadow as above so below

3016
01:39:49,679 --> 01:39:51,679
wouldn't have it any other way a

3017
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:54,080
commuting finite

3018
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:56,239
cone cocoon diagram which one's the cone

3019
01:39:56,239 --> 01:39:57,920
which one's the cochrone right

3020
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:00,960
comprises both a cone and a cocoon

3021
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:02,960
on a finite set of classifiers so

3022
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:04,639
they're mapping to the same

3023
01:40:04,639 --> 01:40:07,679
set of a classifiers the same two spaces

3024
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:09,520
are being bridged

3025
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:12,719
and um then you have like sort of two

3026
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:13,360
systems

3027
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:17,280
looking at the same bridge

3028
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:21,199
and then uh if there's a cumulativity

3029
01:40:21,199 --> 01:40:23,760
across the elements of the of the two

3030
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:24,560
spaces

3031
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,960
we have that from above and then there's

3032
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:29,119
infomorphisms from all the a's to c

3033
01:40:29,119 --> 01:40:29,760
prime

3034
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:33,679
and all the a's um to d prime

3035
01:40:33,679 --> 01:40:37,520
then it's a special kind of object what

3036
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:40,560
is special about it it captures

3037
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:41,840
in addition to a ton of other stuff

3038
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:44,239
probably a more subtle duality

3039
01:40:44,239 --> 01:40:45,679
remember the whole thing about studying

3040
01:40:45,679 --> 01:40:47,360
objects that were dual

3041
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:50,320
objects from like bars 1975 paper and

3042
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:51,920
chris fields other research like what is

3043
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:52,800
a dual

3044
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:56,239
object shadow a more subtle duality

3045
01:40:56,239 --> 01:40:58,400
between processes so not an object

3046
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:01,040
duality but a process duality maybe

3047
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:03,199
forward and backwards

3048
01:41:03,199 --> 01:41:06,960
it enables object files object tokens

3049
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:09,760
and object histories to be viewed not as

3050
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:10,639
tokens but as

3051
01:41:10,639 --> 01:41:14,960
types that organize respectively

3052
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:17,280
trajectory components that's files

3053
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:18,159
features

3054
01:41:18,159 --> 01:41:21,440
that's tokens and feature based singular

3055
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:22,159
categories

3056
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:24,080
histories into mutually consistent

3057
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:25,360
collections

3058
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:29,280
so this is some next level token algebra

3059
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:31,199
and i wondered if it related to crypto

3060
01:41:31,199 --> 01:41:33,760
because it's like instead of the history

3061
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:36,000
like the object history my web history

3062
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,440
well that's actually a feat that's a

3063
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:38,080
singular

3064
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:40,560
category it's a singular trajectory if

3065
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:42,560
you take this list of a million things

3066
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:45,360
and it's like one of a unique kind of

3067
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:46,400
thing

3068
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:49,840
and then even objects and tokens and

3069
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:51,119
descriptors

3070
01:41:51,119 --> 01:41:53,040
are all understand under being

3071
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:54,639
understood as highly relational

3072
01:41:54,639 --> 01:41:58,880
highly semantically mappable way

3073
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:02,560
so that's pretty cool and i guess we'll

3074
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:04,880
look forward to seeing what the authors

3075
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:07,040
can help us with or like what system

3076
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:08,560
could we apply this to first

3077
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:10,239
or what would be an empirical system

3078
01:42:10,239 --> 01:42:11,760
where this is being measured

3079
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:14,480
or what would we gain by measuring

3080
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:15,840
something this way

3081
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:17,360
yeah what are various examples of

3082
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:19,440
context um

3083
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:20,960
and then here's just a few figures from

3084
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:22,719
that other paper the number

3085
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:25,440
mosaic two so here's a cat well it's an

3086
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:26,560
image

3087
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:28,639
it's a pattern on a google slide who's

3088
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:30,639
to say it's a cat right that's semantic

3089
01:42:30,639 --> 01:42:32,719
but there's all kinds of things that we

3090
01:42:32,719 --> 01:42:34,239
might want to

3091
01:42:34,239 --> 01:42:36,239
have so it says an object token is

3092
01:42:36,239 --> 01:42:37,280
classified

3093
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:39,520
at construction into multiple types by

3094
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:42,239
distinct but cross-modulating processes

3095
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:44,320
this includes animal animacy and agency

3096
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:45,920
detection emotion-mediated threat

3097
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:47,520
detection and entry level

3098
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:49,199
followed by super and subordinate

3099
01:42:49,199 --> 01:42:51,600
categorization into types of objects

3100
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:54,400
so it's like depending on the context

3101
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:55,360
and the agent

3102
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:58,320
observing this stimuli whether it's a

3103
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:00,239
predator or prey

3104
01:43:00,239 --> 01:43:02,560
whether it's a cat or whether it's felis

3105
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:03,920
domesticus

3106
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:06,480
or whether it's a sub breed of cat

3107
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:08,000
whether it's something that you approach

3108
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,760
or something that you withdraw from or

3109
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:11,199
something you associate culturally with

3110
01:43:11,199 --> 01:43:12,639
good or bad luck

3111
01:43:12,639 --> 01:43:15,199
that is like the agent's ontology

3112
01:43:15,199 --> 01:43:16,400
semantically

3113
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:18,639
as they interface with a cue in the

3114
01:43:18,639 --> 01:43:19,600
environment

3115
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:21,600
and then this is a funny image it's

3116
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:24,320
mapping chris fields brain

3117
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:28,000
so it's like it's it's it says like

3118
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:31,360
cf that's that's him so here's cf

3119
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:34,400
is a human humans has a brain

3120
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,480
and then here's like another ontology of

3121
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:38,800
brains a private brain is a mammal brain

3122
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:40,880
is a vertebrate brain is a brain

3123
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:43,280
so you can go superordinate and

3124
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:44,560
subordinate

3125
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:48,239
categories in a relational ontology

3126
01:43:48,239 --> 01:43:50,080
as well as have these like totally

3127
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:52,000
disparate classification

3128
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,119
schemes just like you could in

3129
01:43:53,119 --> 01:43:55,040
programming so you could say this person

3130
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:56,400
has a height and a weight and that's in

3131
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:57,280
their public health

3132
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:59,040
record and then there's this other thing

3133
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:00,400
are they a friend or foe and that's my

3134
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:01,760
private information

3135
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:04,840
and then all of those are being linked

3136
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:06,880
semantically

3137
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:11,119
in a special kind of system all right

3138
01:44:11,119 --> 01:44:15,600
that kind of that's one little section

3139
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:17,679
here is bringing in this element of

3140
01:44:17,679 --> 01:44:19,040
concurrency so some people will have

3141
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:20,080
heard about this from

3142
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:22,400
programming languages like golang or

3143
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:23,840
from other kinds of concurrent

3144
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:25,119
programming

3145
01:44:25,119 --> 01:44:26,800
but this is pretty interesting because

3146
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:28,320
it's from 2005

3147
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:30,400
and it's called paper by pratt it's i

3148
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:32,080
think cited in glazebrook

3149
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:33,760
and fields two spaces and their

3150
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:35,600
interpretation as concurrent objects

3151
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:37,360
so it's yet another way that we can

3152
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:39,199
think about two spaces not just as

3153
01:44:39,199 --> 01:44:39,840
mapping

3154
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:42,239
attributes to types or doing all these

3155
01:44:42,239 --> 01:44:43,920
other transformations but like

3156
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:47,280
also as concurrent programs so

3157
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:49,760
they write here that the two pressing

3158
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:51,440
questions for computer science in

3159
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:54,159
2005 maybe forever are what is

3160
01:44:54,159 --> 01:44:56,159
concurrency and what is an object

3161
01:44:56,159 --> 01:44:57,600
the first question is of interest to

3162
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,040
today's sibling growth industries of

3163
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:00,880
parallel computing and networks

3164
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:02,719
both of which stretch our extent models

3165
01:45:02,719 --> 01:45:04,719
of computation all well beyond their

3166
01:45:04,719 --> 01:45:06,000
sequential origins

3167
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,600
so you have the turing tape and it's

3168
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:09,199
just zooming backwards and forwards on a

3169
01:45:09,199 --> 01:45:10,639
tape it's a standalone machine it's not

3170
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:12,239
connected to the internet

3171
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:13,600
when you have machines that are in

3172
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:15,360
networks then

3173
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:18,400
there's semantic logics that are

3174
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:20,800
happening due to those local logics that

3175
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:21,520
are boolean

3176
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:23,360
but at a higher level they might be more

3177
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:25,360
like a complex adaptive system

3178
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:28,560
like a ddos attack on a network

3179
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:31,040
or a certain type of governance game

3180
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:31,679
theory

3181
01:45:31,679 --> 01:45:33,920
uh situation in a crypto economic

3182
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:36,159
network using a cad cad model

3183
01:45:36,159 --> 01:45:39,360
those kinds of complex adaptive dynamics

3184
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:43,119
at the network level may or may not

3185
01:45:43,119 --> 01:45:46,239
actually um be able to recapitulate

3186
01:45:46,239 --> 01:45:48,560
from the syntactic or from the lower

3187
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:49,360
level

3188
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:51,040
and so that's the first question is how

3189
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:52,639
do we think about

3190
01:45:52,639 --> 01:45:55,520
um about concurrency and about designing

3191
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:56,639
for

3192
01:45:56,639 --> 01:45:59,360
good concurrent systems when our

3193
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:01,520
parallel and distributed computational

3194
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:03,440
and even unconventional computational

3195
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:04,719
paradigms are

3196
01:46:04,719 --> 01:46:07,600
rapidly expanding the second question is

3197
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:09,199
relevant to programming languages where

3198
01:46:09,199 --> 01:46:10,560
the definition of object

3199
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:12,239
seems to be based more on whatever

3200
01:46:12,239 --> 01:46:13,760
software engineering methodologies

3201
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:14,800
happen to be in vogue

3202
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:16,880
than on the intuitive sense of object so

3203
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:18,239
in other words people use

3204
01:46:18,239 --> 01:46:20,480
object and process in a way that might

3205
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:22,239
have a name space meaning for computer

3206
01:46:22,239 --> 01:46:22,960
science

3207
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:24,960
but is actually less connected than we

3208
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:26,080
might want it to be

3209
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:29,679
to the formal math and this is pretty

3210
01:46:29,679 --> 01:46:32,880
another last quote on this paper they

3211
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:36,159
write in as the separate chapters of a

3212
01:46:36,159 --> 01:46:37,679
theory of concurrency

3213
01:46:37,679 --> 01:46:39,920
all these different topics petri nets

3214
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:41,520
event structures and domains stone

3215
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:43,360
duality and process algebras

3216
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:45,440
these topics make concurrency something

3217
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:46,800
of a jigsaw puzzle

3218
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:48,480
one is then naturally led to ask whether

3219
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:49,760
the pieces of this puzzle can be

3220
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:52,400
arranged in some recognizable order

3221
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:54,639
and then they give a strong endorsement

3222
01:46:54,639 --> 01:46:56,080
of the two-space framework

3223
01:46:56,080 --> 01:46:57,520
so it's just interesting that these two

3224
01:46:57,520 --> 01:46:59,199
spaces can be objects

3225
01:46:59,199 --> 01:47:01,760
of relations that can be processes but

3226
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:02,239
also

3227
01:47:02,239 --> 01:47:04,159
it can include context that's what this

3228
01:47:04,159 --> 01:47:05,360
paper is about and

3229
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:07,280
algorithmic and game-like elements so if

3230
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:08,639
you can do it in golang

3231
01:47:08,639 --> 01:47:10,800
if you can do it in the process algebra

3232
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:13,199
if you can use higher order reflexive

3233
01:47:13,199 --> 01:47:14,880
process algebra

3234
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:18,400
maybe that's a two-space all right

3235
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:21,199
let's talk a little bit about ergodicity

3236
01:47:21,199 --> 01:47:22,960
so this is going to have a few

3237
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:24,800
slides and definitions so on the top

3238
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,000
left

3239
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,159
a process is says to be ergotic if the

3240
01:47:28,159 --> 01:47:29,199
ensemble average

3241
01:47:29,199 --> 01:47:31,600
and time average are equivalent and

3242
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:33,440
here's a more formal definition from

3243
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:34,960
this is from the neurobytes

3244
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:36,960
site a more formal definition is from

3245
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:39,679
ole peters who's uh

3246
01:47:39,679 --> 01:47:41,199
been at the santa fe institute an

3247
01:47:41,199 --> 01:47:43,360
economics professor

3248
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:45,119
the ergotic hypothesis is a key

3249
01:47:45,119 --> 01:47:47,040
analytical device of equilibrium

3250
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:48,400
statistical mechanics

3251
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:49,840
it underlies the assumption that the

3252
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:51,840
time average and the expectation value

3253
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:53,840
of an observable are the same

3254
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:56,080
where it is valid dynamical descriptions

3255
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:57,920
can often be replaced with much simpler

3256
01:47:57,920 --> 01:47:59,199
probabilistic ones

3257
01:47:59,199 --> 01:48:00,960
time is essentially eliminated from the

3258
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:02,400
model so

3259
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:04,639
this is in on the website neurobites

3260
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:05,440
it's a

3261
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:07,119
live and updating but here it's just

3262
01:48:07,119 --> 01:48:08,880
static it's kind of

3263
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:10,480
thinking of two ways you can make purple

3264
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:12,080
from blue and red

3265
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:15,280
one is to have the spatial uh

3266
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:18,000
resolution increasing and pretty soon

3267
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
semantically it's interpreted as purple

3268
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,159
so if you doubt that you can zoom in on

3269
01:48:22,159 --> 01:48:23,840
an old comic book and see how they made

3270
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:24,239
color

3271
01:48:24,239 --> 01:48:25,760
which is by increasing the scale of

3272
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:27,280
resolution really small

3273
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:28,880
then it makes it look like a new color

3274
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:31,040
is there or you can flash things really

3275
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:32,000
fast and then it will appear

3276
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,480
as if there's purple and those

3277
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:35,679
equivalencies

3278
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:38,159
or ways of reaching and also deviations

3279
01:48:38,159 --> 01:48:40,480
from ergodicity spatially and deviations

3280
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:42,400
from ergodicity temporally

3281
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:44,159
are what we're talking about now why

3282
01:48:44,159 --> 01:48:45,840
does the ergodic assumption matter and

3283
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:47,760
what happens if this is empirically

3284
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:50,080
if this is violated so here's an example

3285
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:52,159
from modern portfolio theory

3286
01:48:52,159 --> 01:48:54,719
which is what ole peters and others like

3287
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:55,600
glenn begerman

3288
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:57,760
study which is that and this is quote

3289
01:48:57,760 --> 01:48:58,719
from neurobites

3290
01:48:58,719 --> 01:49:00,719
modern portfolio theory stipulates there

3291
01:49:00,719 --> 01:49:02,639
exists some optimal risk to return

3292
01:49:02,639 --> 01:49:03,520
profile

3293
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:05,119
but the theory rests on the ergotic

3294
01:49:05,119 --> 01:49:07,040
hypothesis by conflating an

3295
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:09,440
ensemble aggregate return with the

3296
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:11,280
individual's path-dependent return

3297
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:12,560
through time

3298
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:15,280
so it's really interesting um and this

3299
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:17,119
is related to the st petersburg paradox

3300
01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:19,199
and a couple other economic ideas

3301
01:49:19,199 --> 01:49:21,199
that basically the total population's

3302
01:49:21,199 --> 01:49:22,480
performance or

3303
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:23,679
a hundred different portfolios

3304
01:49:23,679 --> 01:49:25,920
performance at one snapshot is not the

3305
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:26,960
same thing as

3306
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:28,880
any portfolio being carried forward

3307
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:31,360
through time why does that matter

3308
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:34,480
how off on the wrong track would we be

3309
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:36,159
so here's some funny examples of

3310
01:49:36,159 --> 01:49:38,159
ergodicity violations and also

3311
01:49:38,159 --> 01:49:41,360
a hypothetical example of ergodicity so

3312
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:44,480
um number two from the neurobites if it

3313
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:45,920
takes one pregnant woman nine months to

3314
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:46,560
give birth

3315
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:48,159
nine pregnant women should only take one

3316
01:49:48,159 --> 01:49:50,719
month and then this says recipe says

3317
01:49:50,719 --> 01:49:52,800
bake for 60 minutes at 200 degrees but

3318
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:54,560
i'll just bake for 30 minutes at 400

3319
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:55,280
degrees

3320
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:57,760
so like if if the degree minute is all

3321
01:49:57,760 --> 01:49:58,960
things being equal

3322
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:01,040
why couldn't we just vaporize it with 10

3323
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:02,719
000 degrees celsius for just a split

3324
01:50:02,719 --> 01:50:03,599
second

3325
01:50:03,599 --> 01:50:06,400
um it turns out that there's a process

3326
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:08,000
that has to play out

3327
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,480
and so yeah what do you think about this

3328
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:11,040
blue

3329
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:12,800
or how would you link it to anything

3330
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:15,679
else we talked about today

3331
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:19,599
um i'm like i don't know i think my

3332
01:50:19,599 --> 01:50:20,159
brain is

3333
01:50:20,159 --> 01:50:22,960
is uh i i i'm still giggling at the nine

3334
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:24,080
nine segment uh

3335
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:26,400
months

3336
01:50:27,119 --> 01:50:29,280
i'll say something i i find those

3337
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:31,599
examples actually worse than just giving

3338
01:50:31,599 --> 01:50:32,880
me no example

3339
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:36,000
because like ergodicity implies you have

3340
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,639
to have a system level demarcation

3341
01:50:38,639 --> 01:50:40,880
and so you know to compare it to like

3342
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:42,719
nine pregnant women it's like well

3343
01:50:42,719 --> 01:50:45,040
the the system is the woman so you can't

3344
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:46,960
really do that in the analytic it

3345
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:49,280
actually makes it harder to understand

3346
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:51,599
which is good good point yeah it's it's

3347
01:50:51,599 --> 01:50:52,960
it's all right

3348
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:55,679
it's like but it just it yeah i think it

3349
01:50:55,679 --> 01:50:56,159
makes it

3350
01:50:56,159 --> 01:50:58,880
more confusing yeah i agree it's not a

3351
01:50:58,880 --> 01:50:59,360
perfect

3352
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:01,920
mapping it's like syntactically it's the

3353
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:04,000
kind of error you'd be making like

3354
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,880
here's the ergotic in a lifestyle span

3355
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:07,520
but then

3356
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:09,199
if you go too down the rabbit hole we're

3357
01:51:09,199 --> 01:51:11,360
trying to add the variables that's why

3358
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:13,760
we always pull back to the actual

3359
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:16,639
formalisms so here is from math

3360
01:51:16,639 --> 01:51:18,159
encyclopedia

3361
01:51:18,159 --> 01:51:20,080
and here it's i thought it was quite

3362
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:21,440
interesting so

3363
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:23,360
it's about trajectories of points and

3364
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:25,440
saying that as you'll hear with many

3365
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:26,880
other definitions that it's about

3366
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:28,560
visiting a phase space through space and

3367
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:29,360
through time

3368
01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:32,239
that was sort of that first example

3369
01:51:32,239 --> 01:51:34,000
here's what was interesting though

3370
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,520
when the birkhoff ergotic theorem had

3371
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:37,040
been proved it became clear that

3372
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:38,880
ergodicity is equivalent to metric

3373
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:43,280
transitivity measurement transitivity

3374
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:45,679
the more general situation it was no

3375
01:51:45,679 --> 01:51:47,520
longer suitable to talk of the equality

3376
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:49,920
of time and space averages

3377
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:52,960
systems with an infinite so what kinds

3378
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:53,520
of systems

3379
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:56,000
are beyond spatial and temporal

3380
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,119
ergodicity

3381
01:51:57,119 --> 01:51:58,880
systems with an infinite invariant or

3382
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:00,400
quasi-invariant measurement

3383
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:02,320
not only flows in cascades but also more

3384
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:04,000
general transformation groups and semi

3385
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,199
groups

3386
01:52:05,199 --> 01:52:08,000
transformations groups categories semi

3387
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:09,920
groups we saw abelian semi groups

3388
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:10,480
earlier

3389
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:13,360
in the bar paper so it's almost like

3390
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:16,239
we're taking ergodicity even beyond

3391
01:52:16,239 --> 01:52:19,520
the trajectory visitation idea i don't

3392
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:20,960
know where it's going

3393
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:22,719
in the way that the authors are using it

3394
01:52:22,719 --> 01:52:25,040
but it's like there's there's like the

3395
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:28,960
you know the totally inadequate metaphor

3396
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:32,080
like of just making a total category

3397
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:32,800
error with

3398
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:36,960
the recipe and then there's the more

3399
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:40,000
empirically observable strategy

3400
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,360
violations and like you're going to have

3401
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:42,880
a bad strategy if you make if you're

3402
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:45,119
using a model with an ergotic assumption

3403
01:52:45,119 --> 01:52:46,800
you're gonna do strategy that's just

3404
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:48,159
ridiculous you're gonna fit

3405
01:52:48,159 --> 01:52:49,599
what seems to be the best or the most

3406
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:51,679
likely strategy and you're just gonna be

3407
01:52:51,679 --> 01:52:52,800
way off base

3408
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:55,040
empirically but this is even taking it

3409
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:57,040
to another way okay let's just

3410
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:59,520
with a couple of these questions bring

3411
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:00,639
some of our clothes

3412
01:53:00,639 --> 01:53:03,760
um i think you may have raised this one

3413
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:07,199
sarah but it was asking that

3414
01:53:07,199 --> 01:53:10,960
this context by default

3415
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:12,880
generalizes the intrinsic contextuality

3416
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:14,000
of quantum theory

3417
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,520
to the case in which other properties of

3418
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:17,280
a context for example the order in which

3419
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:18,960
questions are asked

3420
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:20,400
also affect the distribution of a

3421
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:22,080
variable of interest

3422
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:23,360
this kind of direct influence is

3423
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:25,920
generally avoided by experiment design

3424
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:27,760
particularly by imposing no signaling

3425
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:28,719
conditions

3426
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:29,920
in physics but it's virtually

3427
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:31,440
inescapable when studying complex

3428
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:33,280
macroscopic systems

3429
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:35,760
so these are some pretty open questions

3430
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:38,159
how does context relate to erodicity

3431
01:53:38,159 --> 01:53:39,840
especially when systems are changing

3432
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:41,520
their context or

3433
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:44,719
vice versa or both and

3434
01:53:44,719 --> 01:53:47,840
how uh does this contextuality by

3435
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:49,040
default

3436
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:52,239
specifically help us here and then how

3437
01:53:52,239 --> 01:53:54,639
does fields in glazebrook build upon

3438
01:53:54,639 --> 01:53:57,440
contextuality by default

3439
01:53:57,440 --> 01:54:00,639
to maybe add another plank to this

3440
01:54:00,639 --> 01:54:04,480
question okay

3441
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:07,119
here's another set of questions the

3442
01:54:07,119 --> 01:54:08,800
existence of complementary observables

3443
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:11,040
has perplexed physicists for decades

3444
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:12,719
feignman characterized it as the only

3445
01:54:12,719 --> 01:54:14,800
mystery of quantum theory

3446
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:17,840
how are such paradoxes of resolved at

3447
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:19,119
the implementation level

3448
01:54:19,119 --> 01:54:20,480
if they are or worked around if they're

3449
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:22,480
not what happens when workaround

3450
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:23,760
mechanisms fail

3451
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:25,840
what is required to detect failure post

3452
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:27,199
hoc

3453
01:54:27,199 --> 01:54:29,679
ability to prove this experimentally

3454
01:54:29,679 --> 01:54:31,119
would begin to answer the broader

3455
01:54:31,119 --> 01:54:32,880
question of how prior probabilities are

3456
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:34,400
represented in memory and how different

3457
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:36,080
sets of priors can be deployed in

3458
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:37,599
different contexts

3459
01:54:37,599 --> 01:54:40,239
so how do we know what we don't know for

3460
01:54:40,239 --> 01:54:42,560
a given context and how can a context be

3461
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:44,400
made to entail

3462
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:48,159
unknown unknowns how do we bound our

3463
01:54:48,159 --> 01:54:51,280
not knowing and i think part of the way

3464
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:53,040
is going to be

3465
01:54:53,040 --> 01:54:55,280
defining everything as the markov

3466
01:54:55,280 --> 01:54:56,239
blanket

3467
01:54:56,239 --> 01:54:58,560
which is going to be us internal states

3468
01:54:58,560 --> 01:54:59,920
and blanket states is what we can

3469
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:01,199
observe and control

3470
01:55:01,199 --> 01:55:02,800
and so everything is going to be

3471
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:04,560
conditioned on generative model of

3472
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:05,679
external states

3473
01:55:05,679 --> 01:55:07,360
so we're never even going to peep

3474
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:09,520
outside of the blanket states

3475
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:11,440
we're going to be super serious about

3476
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:12,960
modeling ourself

3477
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:15,599
and the blanket states as interacting

3478
01:55:15,599 --> 01:55:18,000
with and modeling external world states

3479
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,080
so instead of how tall is the tree

3480
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:21,840
you're going to have like you

3481
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:23,679
and the measuring device and the

3482
01:55:23,679 --> 01:55:26,080
measurement in a system

3483
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:28,080
and maybe for some easy questions it's

3484
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:29,760
going to be total overkill

3485
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:31,360
but i think for other questions it's

3486
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:32,880
going to really open the door

3487
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:35,840
because once people frame it in this way

3488
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:36,639
what was an

3489
01:55:36,639 --> 01:55:39,920
unknown unknown is going to be

3490
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:41,440
something that we can actually

3491
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:44,159
encapsulate

3492
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:47,119
so that's bringing us this question

3493
01:55:47,119 --> 01:55:48,239
here's a quote

3494
01:55:48,239 --> 01:55:50,159
we apply this development of ideas to

3495
01:55:50,159 --> 01:55:52,080
recover among other things a new

3496
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:53,840
theoretical and inferential role for the

3497
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:55,599
markov blanket concept we read this in

3498
01:55:55,599 --> 01:55:57,119
the introduction because it's a key

3499
01:55:57,119 --> 01:55:57,840
point

3500
01:55:57,840 --> 01:55:59,599
as the locus at which free energy is

3501
01:55:59,599 --> 01:56:01,199
minimized and

3502
01:56:01,199 --> 01:56:03,599
the epistemic knowledge barrier that

3503
01:56:03,599 --> 01:56:05,199
keeps contextual information hidden from

3504
01:56:05,199 --> 01:56:06,080
the observer

3505
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:08,800
so where is markov blanket coming into

3506
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:09,920
play

3507
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:12,159
what does this have to do with our

3508
01:56:12,159 --> 01:56:13,119
active inference

3509
01:56:13,119 --> 01:56:15,760
modeling and learning and then just all

3510
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:17,040
these issues that we've been talking

3511
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:17,360
about

3512
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:20,400
representation internal versus external

3513
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:23,840
perspectives and um

3514
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:29,040
where is this paper coming into play

3515
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:32,639
okay then sarah this is one of your

3516
01:56:32,639 --> 01:56:35,760
suggestions slides from a couple weeks

3517
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:36,960
ago

3518
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:40,239
so but it's relevant here again so

3519
01:56:40,239 --> 01:56:42,639
what maybe what if you want to anything

3520
01:56:42,639 --> 01:56:43,840
that's interesting

3521
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:47,280
like about context or frame or reservoir

3522
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:51,199
just you're you know a high foraging

3523
01:56:51,199 --> 01:56:52,480
philosopher of science

3524
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:53,599
so it's always good to hear what you

3525
01:56:53,599 --> 01:56:56,159
think about it and my brain is pretty

3526
01:56:56,159 --> 01:56:56,880
fried but i

3527
01:56:56,880 --> 01:57:01,360
i think i can um my eyeballs are fried

3528
01:57:01,360 --> 01:57:05,280
anyway um the thing that

3529
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:08,320
strikes me as a kind of contrast about

3530
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:11,760
what i'm able to read from this paper um

3531
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:14,800
is i i don't know i get the sense when

3532
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:16,239
they're writing in the paper that they

3533
01:57:16,239 --> 01:57:17,760
just have this like you know how can we

3534
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:20,159
have the eye of god in like all contexts

3535
01:57:20,159 --> 01:57:20,800
and shift

3536
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:22,639
like i you know or at least they're

3537
01:57:22,639 --> 01:57:23,920
talking about that in the context of

3538
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:25,520
like modeling and talking about how our

3539
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:27,119
world actually is but

3540
01:57:27,119 --> 01:57:29,199
um the thing that makes reservoir

3541
01:57:29,199 --> 01:57:31,760
computing so powerful

3542
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:35,159
one of the things is is its

3543
01:57:35,159 --> 01:57:37,679
non-ergodicity it's it's kind of natural

3544
01:57:37,679 --> 01:57:39,760
partitioning it's it's um

3545
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:43,679
heterogeneity in some way um and so

3546
01:57:43,679 --> 01:57:44,960
i don't know that's really interesting

3547
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:46,480
to me this kind of how can a body

3548
01:57:46,480 --> 01:57:47,440
compute

3549
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:49,440
um and what are the attributes about a

3550
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:50,560
body that

3551
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:52,239
what are the kind of imperfections about

3552
01:57:52,239 --> 01:57:53,599
the body that make it

3553
01:57:53,599 --> 01:57:56,639
um that make it intelligent in that

3554
01:57:56,639 --> 01:57:57,199
sense

3555
01:57:57,199 --> 01:58:00,639
so so yeah you know

3556
01:58:00,639 --> 01:58:03,520
in what way do channels form like these

3557
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:05,440
natural cutic natural joints or make

3558
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:06,719
these kind of boundaries and

3559
01:58:06,719 --> 01:58:08,719
and why i don't know that's those are

3560
01:58:08,719 --> 01:58:12,000
the interesting parallels for me

3561
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:16,880
yep that idea of like it's the the local

3562
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:19,280
consistency the organismality the ending

3563
01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:21,760
of itself that's like the kantian

3564
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:25,599
organism concept but it's an aberration

3565
01:58:25,599 --> 01:58:28,400
it's far from equilibrium from the

3566
01:58:28,400 --> 01:58:29,199
global

3567
01:58:29,199 --> 01:58:32,159
context which is just hydrogen molecules

3568
01:58:32,159 --> 01:58:33,280
dispersed

3569
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:35,520
so it's like when you have a global

3570
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:38,239
disordering or some sort of perturbation

3571
01:58:38,239 --> 01:58:39,840
and then you have a locally organized

3572
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:41,280
bubble

3573
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:44,639
it's then it's like it is our unique

3574
01:58:44,639 --> 01:58:47,119
differences and situation that allow

3575
01:58:47,119 --> 01:58:48,480
that agent to be

3576
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:51,920
adept in the niche it almost couldn't be

3577
01:58:51,920 --> 01:58:55,119
another way or it's hard to see i don't

3578
01:58:55,119 --> 01:58:56,320
know the thing that's interesting

3579
01:58:56,320 --> 01:58:57,520
is like you don't even have to think

3580
01:58:57,520 --> 01:58:59,360
about well

3581
01:58:59,360 --> 01:59:00,560
i'm sure there is more you have to think

3582
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:02,159
about in terms of adaptation and you

3583
01:59:02,159 --> 01:59:03,520
know response and things like this but

3584
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:04,000
just

3585
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,159
you know how does a rock compute and and

3586
01:59:06,159 --> 01:59:07,679
there was one paper that i was reading

3587
01:59:07,679 --> 01:59:09,679
where they were talking about like well

3588
01:59:09,679 --> 01:59:11,440
okay if you stick a rock in the oven you

3589
01:59:11,440 --> 01:59:13,040
know it doesn't necessarily heat up in

3590
01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:14,800
all the same places so you do have this

3591
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:16,800
kind of um you do have these

3592
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:18,880
these um non-homogeneous kind of

3593
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:20,320
attributes about the rock and

3594
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:23,280
and it's a it's a very loose analogy but

3595
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:23,840
you know

3596
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:26,000
that is essentially like this this um

3597
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,520
non-boltzmann type

3598
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:30,239
type distribution that is what makes

3599
01:59:30,239 --> 01:59:32,480
these bodies computable in some way that

3600
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:33,199
is

3601
01:59:33,199 --> 01:59:36,480
yet still a little bit mysterious yep

3602
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:38,239
and it's like if it were um a little

3603
01:59:38,239 --> 01:59:40,480
worm you said if it oh its body

3604
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:42,080
is set up with the muscle the connective

3605
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:43,440
tissue in the nerve so that it moves

3606
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:44,080
away from

3607
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:47,599
a prick from on the side it doesn't need

3608
01:59:47,599 --> 01:59:49,040
to be computing where

3609
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:50,960
everything is if it's body is able to

3610
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:52,639
respond

3611
01:59:52,639 --> 01:59:54,800
then it can do it needs to do in the

3612
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:56,560
niche okay

3613
01:59:56,560 --> 01:59:57,840
but i mean you don't even need to be

3614
01:59:57,840 --> 01:59:59,119
alive that's the thing that kind of

3615
01:59:59,119 --> 02:00:00,719
blows my mind about how this computing

3616
02:00:00,719 --> 02:00:03,040
works

3617
02:00:03,679 --> 02:00:06,800
yes so

3618
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:10,320
implications next steps the first so

3619
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:10,800
this is

3620
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:13,520
good that they went there so the first

3621
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:15,119
question which is expanded upon

3622
02:00:15,119 --> 02:00:18,960
more in this bestiava paper is exploring

3623
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:21,599
contextuality for human measurements

3624
02:00:21,599 --> 02:00:22,560
cool

3625
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:25,360
a second is understanding how context

3626
02:00:25,360 --> 02:00:26,480
switching

3627
02:00:26,480 --> 02:00:28,400
is implemented at the neurocognitive

3628
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:30,159
level so that's

3629
02:00:30,159 --> 02:00:31,520
the feigning quote that we just looked

3630
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:34,159
into but basically what is happening

3631
02:00:34,159 --> 02:00:36,080
when it's like somebody's your friend

3632
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:37,920
you're in a narrative of friendship

3633
02:00:37,920 --> 02:00:40,159
and i get from the cultural down to the

3634
02:00:40,159 --> 02:00:42,400
you know the day down to the second down

3635
02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:42,719
to the

3636
02:00:42,719 --> 02:00:44,800
micro expression you're in a narrative

3637
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:46,639
and then a stimuli happens and a context

3638
02:00:46,639 --> 02:00:47,760
switches

3639
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:50,320
and that trajectory is still a unitary

3640
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:51,840
your relationship with them is still a

3641
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:52,639
thing

3642
02:00:52,639 --> 02:00:53,760
but it's changed in a way that the

3643
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:56,159
context has changed like how does that

3644
02:00:56,159 --> 02:00:57,440
get implemented

3645
02:00:57,440 --> 02:01:00,000
this combination of the high precision

3646
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,239
priors and the high precision inputs

3647
02:01:02,239 --> 02:01:04,480
how do we get the best of both worlds

3648
02:01:04,480 --> 02:01:05,599
with this rapid

3649
02:01:05,599 --> 02:01:09,040
attentional modulation as brains

3650
02:01:09,040 --> 02:01:11,119
into and away from objects and then

3651
02:01:11,119 --> 02:01:12,639
context switching

3652
02:01:12,639 --> 02:01:15,040
those are features that are just not

3653
02:01:15,040 --> 02:01:15,840
within

3654
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:18,639
the scope of shannon disinfo theory and

3655
02:01:18,639 --> 02:01:20,000
they're much more semantic

3656
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:23,119
questions a third and broader question

3657
02:01:23,119 --> 02:01:24,880
is whether intrinsic contextuality can

3658
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:26,159
be detected and characterized at

3659
02:01:26,159 --> 02:01:28,000
multiple scales in complex systems

3660
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:29,280
generally

3661
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:31,119
by formulating a scale-free model of

3662
02:01:31,119 --> 02:01:34,000
contextuality in category theory terms

3663
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:35,440
and in particular by employing the

3664
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:37,360
concepts of classifiers and information

3665
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:38,400
channels

3666
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:40,000
we hope to have opened a new pathway

3667
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:41,440
towards addressing these questions in

3668
02:01:41,440 --> 02:01:42,480
multiple ways

3669
02:01:42,480 --> 02:01:43,520
or addressing these questions in

3670
02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:46,159
multiple systems

3671
02:01:46,239 --> 02:01:48,080
so maybe if there is something special

3672
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:50,480
to be said about contextuality

3673
02:01:50,480 --> 02:01:52,800
or the violations thereof two sides of

3674
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:53,520
the same coin

3675
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:57,440
maybe we could identify in a less

3676
02:01:57,440 --> 02:02:00,800
biased way what scales of organization

3677
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:04,159
are relevant or just detect

3678
02:02:04,159 --> 02:02:07,440
new dynamics of complex systems

3679
02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:09,840
because there's a lot of recent work

3680
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:11,760
showing that like with complex systems

3681
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:12,639
they can emit

3682
02:02:12,639 --> 02:02:14,880
structured outputs that have the

3683
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:16,719
signature of white noise

3684
02:02:16,719 --> 02:02:18,960
or have a signature of nothing like an

3685
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:20,080
encrypted file

3686
02:02:20,080 --> 02:02:21,760
is going to have a distribution

3687
02:02:21,760 --> 02:02:23,360
syntactically

3688
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:25,760
that's going to be looking like nothing

3689
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:28,159
different from the frequentists

3690
02:02:28,159 --> 02:02:31,360
expectations but it's a semantically

3691
02:02:31,360 --> 02:02:32,639
encoded

3692
02:02:32,639 --> 02:02:34,560
local logic that is allowing

3693
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:36,239
communication through that channel

3694
02:02:36,239 --> 02:02:38,000
so if all you have is the white noise

3695
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:39,520
detector you're going to think up that

3696
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:41,040
looks like the signal is not

3697
02:02:41,040 --> 02:02:43,199
containing information but actually

3698
02:02:43,199 --> 02:02:44,719
semantically it is

3699
02:02:44,719 --> 02:02:47,840
so there's there could be systems just

3700
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:50,080
in and around us that are doing things

3701
02:02:50,080 --> 02:02:51,599
we don't even see

3702
02:02:51,599 --> 02:02:54,000
and that would be no weirder than if

3703
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:55,599
there was wavelengths we didn't see we

3704
02:02:55,599 --> 02:02:56,639
know that's true

3705
02:02:56,639 --> 02:02:57,760
we know that there's things that are too

3706
02:02:57,760 --> 02:02:59,679
big or too small for us to see so could

3707
02:02:59,679 --> 02:03:01,360
there be things informationally or from

3708
02:03:01,360 --> 02:03:02,719
a narrative perspective

3709
02:03:02,719 --> 02:03:06,080
that we're just not perceiving

3710
02:03:06,080 --> 02:03:07,920
doesn't seem out of the picture so i

3711
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:09,440
think it's a it actually is

3712
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:11,760
a major area and you know for those who

3713
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:13,520
have participated or listened to this

3714
02:03:13,520 --> 02:03:14,719
deep in

3715
02:03:14,719 --> 02:03:16,480
chris fields was the one who recommended

3716
02:03:16,480 --> 02:03:18,000
this paper to us and just said

3717
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
i think this is a topic that is not

3718
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:21,360
really thought about in the active

3719
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:22,480
inference community that much but it

3720
02:03:22,480 --> 02:03:23,040
will become

3721
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:25,199
important later i don't even know what

3722
02:03:25,199 --> 02:03:26,880
topic he was referring to but this was

3723
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:28,080
the paper that

3724
02:03:28,080 --> 02:03:31,199
really raised some huge questions

3725
02:03:31,199 --> 02:03:34,080
so all kinds of questions that we have

3726
02:03:34,080 --> 02:03:34,480
but

3727
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:38,320
i think it's fair enough just to say um

3728
02:03:38,320 --> 02:03:41,520
thanks to r2 3

3729
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:44,000
brave and awesome participants thanks

3730
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,400
sarah and blue because that was a fun

3731
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:48,639
convo and we definitely laughed and

3732
02:03:48,639 --> 02:03:50,159
memed because

3733
02:03:50,159 --> 02:03:52,800
it was like the hardest paper i think

3734
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:55,280
we've read yet

3735
02:03:55,280 --> 02:03:57,040
definitely but you know the paper was so

3736
02:03:57,040 --> 02:03:59,040
well written like i am not a big fan of

3737
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:00,719
reading like math papers and

3738
02:04:00,719 --> 02:04:03,360
lemma this and theorem that like i'm not

3739
02:04:03,360 --> 02:04:05,199
i usually don't enjoy it at all but i

3740
02:04:05,199 --> 02:04:06,159
really did find

3741
02:04:06,159 --> 02:04:08,000
this paper to be very well written and

3742
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,320
easy to follow

3743
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:12,560
i agree when there was a formalism it's

3744
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:13,440
a theorem

3745
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:16,239
definition figure formalism is like okay

3746
02:04:16,239 --> 02:04:17,679
i'm not going to understand that but

3747
02:04:17,679 --> 02:04:19,840
i know that that's just the theorem so i

3748
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:21,119
could just say okay

3749
02:04:21,119 --> 02:04:23,520
got it something i don't understand put

3750
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:25,679
it away encapsulate that so i agree

3751
02:04:25,679 --> 02:04:29,840
um any last thoughts sarah blue

3752
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:31,760
i just thought i was almost wishing like

3753
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:33,440
as i was reading the paper like for some

3754
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:34,639
concrete examples but

3755
02:04:34,639 --> 02:04:36,480
we would have ended up with like a 65

3756
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:39,040
page paper

3757
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:40,480
so i guess that's our job to be the

3758
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:42,880
concrete example you know

3759
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:44,880
yep and that will be fun to talk to

3760
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:46,320
chris about so

3761
02:04:46,320 --> 02:04:49,679
um let's um until the

3762
02:04:49,679 --> 02:04:51,520
time we actually get to talk about this

3763
02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:52,719
paper which is going to be

3764
02:04:52,719 --> 02:04:55,679
on march 9th so between now and march

3765
02:04:55,679 --> 02:04:56,079
9th

3766
02:04:56,079 --> 02:04:58,800
let's just chill you know do our other

3767
02:04:58,800 --> 02:04:59,679
jobs

3768
02:04:59,679 --> 02:05:02,719
instead of just reading this paper think

3769
02:05:02,719 --> 02:05:05,040
about what would be really

3770
02:05:05,040 --> 02:05:08,840
powerful and meaningful to ask them

3771
02:05:08,840 --> 02:05:11,840
semantically
