hello

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,400
and welcome everyone to active inference

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:10,880
lab

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,880
to the active inference live stream

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,120
today is march 9th

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:19,119
2021 and we are in livestream 17.1

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,880
the active inference lab is an

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,160
experiment in

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,160
online team communication learning and

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,359
practice related to

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,599
active inference you can find us at the

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,480
links and the contact mechanisms here

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,399
this is recorded in an archived live

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,000
stream so please provide us with

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,360
feedback so that we can be

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,840
improving on our work all backgrounds

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,000
and perspectives are welcome here

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,079
and we'll be using good video etiquette

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,280
for live streams

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,440
muting if we're not talking raising our

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,960
hands so that we can hear from everyone

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,800
on the stack and using respectful speech

23
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,480
behavior

24
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,160
here we are today in 17.1 coming fresh

25
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,280
off of our

26
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,680
fun quarterly roundtable number one and

27
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,320
the first

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,840
of two weeks discussing this paper with

29
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,920
uh the author chris fields and we're

30
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,280
gonna have a ton of time

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,680
to get into it today and a follow-up

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,400
discussion

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,159
next week today our goal is to

34
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,040
discuss and learn this awesome paper and

35
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:15,600
area

36
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,920
some areas that are probably new to

37
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,040
everybody

38
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,439
and today in 17.1 we're just gonna

39
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,360
introduce ourselves say hello

40
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,920
then chris is gonna give a presentation

41
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,280
and then we'll be able to

42
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,880
ask questions and continue the

43
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,640
discussion from there

44
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,520
so without further ado we can get into

45
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,759
the introductions and warm-ups

46
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,079
so everybody can just go around we'll

47
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,200
introduce ourselves

48
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,479
say hello and then we can also consider

49
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,920
these warm-up questions

50
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,320
so after introductions and anyone

51
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,759
wanting to say something on a warm-up

52
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,439
question we'll go to chris's

53
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,159
presentation so i'm daniel i'm a

in 17.0 and learn and uh

60
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,479
recalibrate and correct and i'll pass it

61
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,040
to

62

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,400
the the discussion today about

77
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,720
information flows we deal in

78
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,879
as name sounds and risk flows and

79
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,200
information and risk are really

80
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,560

109
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,159
discussion session

110
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,159
today i wanted to

111
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,920
start with just a quick

112
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,360
presentation to provide some background

113
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,080
context

114
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,000
on this paper which is about context

115
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,239
uh written by myself and and jim

116
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,040
glasbrook

117
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,319
who is a mathematician uh we've been

118
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,200
working together

119
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,760
several years we actually connected and

120
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,279
started working together because we were

121
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,880
both interested in the

122
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,400
perceptual and intentional phenotypes

123
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,360
that one

124
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,639
finds on the autism spectrum and

125
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,960
that's where we encountered uh carl

126
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,080
fristen actually

127
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,240
and the whole active inference framework

128
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,280
in some of his papers on autism

129
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,320
so uh let me just start this little

130
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,880
presentation

131
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,120
and that'll give some background for

132
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,759
discussion

133
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,199
here we go okay as i said just some

134
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,560
some context for uh

135
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,320
this paper about context

136
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,360
and let's see oh okay

137
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,240
so am i so good on on vision and hearing

138
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,039
and all that

139
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,120
looks perfect thank you okay cool

140
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,800
so um here's a standard picture from

141
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,520
carl fiston on the theory of active

142
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,120
inference

143
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,479
uh it describes the interaction between

144
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,440
some system that has internal states and

145
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,800
some system that has

146
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,160
external states and the interaction is

147
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,160
mediated by

148
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,800
sensory states and and active states of

149
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,240
the form of arkham blanket

150
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,800
and when i first encountered this

151
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,039
um it seemed like a very nice

152
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,039
modern statement of ideas that i would

153
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:55,520
trace

154
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,440
back to robotics initially

155
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,800
in terms of the the

156
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,400
learn slash explore distinction

157
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,560
that one finds in in developmental

158
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,960
robotics especially

159
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,240
and and even from there uh

160
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,520
back to the basic theory in

161
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,160
ethology where you have the approach

162
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,160
avoid distinction

163
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,759
um approach of being very similar to

164
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,720
explore

165
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,360
to acting on the world in order to learn

166
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,720
something

167
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,080
and avoid being

168
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,400
a state in which the organism backs off

169
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,840
and tries to figure out what it did

170
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,520
wrong

171
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,720
so the the theory has a very rich

172
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,840
history and i think

173
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,880
when it's what its current formulation

174
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,319
uh due to fristen and his colleagues

175
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,520
brings to it is a large

176
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,479
body of applicable formalism and in fact

177
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,240
i would characterize the theory of

178
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,280
active inference as it's been presented

179
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,520
as perception and cognition from a

180
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,240
physics perspective

181
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,520
and the presentation

182
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,680
of the theory thus far has been

183
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,520
primarily in the language of

184
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,639
classical physics and

185
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,280
i think that the language of classical

186
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,160
physics

187
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,919
is actually seriously

188
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,520
unsuitable for

189
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,919
talking about active inference it's

190
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:32,960
complicated

191
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,400
and messy and so

192
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,160
what i'm going to do today is provide a

193
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,400
little bit of background

194
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,840
from a from a more quantum theory

195
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,240
perspective

196
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,800
and i consider today just starting with

197
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,879
a an introductory talk about quantum

198
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:49,919
theory but i

199
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,680
that won't give us quite the background

200
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,840
that we need for this

201
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,319
so um

202
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,440
i won't be quite so uh

203
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,039
straightforward about quantum theory but

204
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,919
i am i'm happy to answer any questions

205
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,199
about it

206
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,520
and you can go on and on about it as

207
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,520
shauna knows

208
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,199
um so what i really want to

209
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,240
to do is give you another way of looking

210
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,479
at

211
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,879
active inference which i would

212
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,080
characterize as

213
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,479
physics from the perspective of

214
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,960
perception and cognition

215
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,319
so taking the idea of observation

216
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,839
and reformulating physics using that

217
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:34,479
idea

218
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,799
and you'll recognize from the paper

219
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,360
there's a

220
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,200
a a coco diagram

221
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,919
that's sitting next to something that

222
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,800
looks a lot like a markov blanket

223
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,880
so the cocoon diagram represents the

224
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,440
internal state of some system

225
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,680
and the external state is completely

226
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,880
unspecified

227
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,640
all that's happening out there is some

228
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,920
dynamics

229
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,720
and the job of system a is to

230
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,240
learn as much about system b as it can

231
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,240
in order to make good predictions so

232
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,440
this is still

233
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,279
active inference just from a different

234
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,680
point of view

235
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,320
and looking at it this way it gets us

236
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,200
into

237
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,480
a a cloud of issues that are

238
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,760
all related and i hope uh

239
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,760
by this little introduction to show you

240
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,839
how they're related at least somewhat

241
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,480
give you a sense of how they're related

242
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:30,880
and

243
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,360
i'll i'll start this this cycle with

244
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,760
system identification

245
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,600
which is the old problem from

246
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
engineering and cybernetics

247
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,760
of figuring out what system you're

248
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,519
working with

249
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,560
and in physics this is typically just

250
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,240
taken for granted

251
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,399
and in biology it's often just taken for

252
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,839
granted

253
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,360
um but in uh computing theory for

254
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,080
example

255
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,000
and in what are called device

256
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,080
independent protocols in physics now

257
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,760
it's not taken for granted system

258
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,800
identification is up for grabs

259
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,200
intrinsic contextuality is the topic of

260
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,079
the paper

261
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,680
and it has to do with the unavoidable

262
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,920
uncorrectable effects of

263
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,160
unknown contextual variables on

264
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,200
measurements being made

265
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,880
now that's clearly related to the

266
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,120
question of reference frames

267
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,240
how am i making my measurements

268
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,800
and in fact the first formulation of

269
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,959
contextuality and physics by coca and

270
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,000
specker

271
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
was about making measurements with

272
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,480
different kinds of apparatus

273
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,079
and showing that experimental results

274
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,200
could vary even for the same

275
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,720
observable based on how what other

276
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,160
things were measured at the same time

277
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,920
this connects to the frame problem from

278
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,920
ai which is the problem of

279
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,399
of predicting side effects of your

280
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,279
actions

281
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,360
so side effects of making the

282
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,360
measurement in a particular way would be

283
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,120
an example

284
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,839
this gets to the problem of memory if

285
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,360
you're going to predict

286
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,120
side effects you have to remember what

287
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,959
you've done and so

288
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,959
you have to ask about what are the side

289
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,959
effects of recording your memory

290
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,800
someplace because that's a physical

291
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,680
action and finally we get to the

292
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,920
question of ensemble sampling

293
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,160
and the question of what probability

294
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,440
actually means right prior probability

295
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,519
is fundamental to bayesian decision

296
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,800
theory

297
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,519
but it becomes problematic to say what

298
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,120
does prior probability

299
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,800
actually mean and all of these issues

300
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,680
swirl around at least in my view one

301
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,880
issue which is the issue of separability

302
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,040
what does it mean to separate the world

303
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,920
into a set of systems that then interact

304
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,440
and separability

305
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,760
has a very precise meaning in quantum

306
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,560
theory

307
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,240
so this is one reason for diving

308
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,839
immediately into quantum theory

309
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,560
in quantum theory the notion of

310
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,240
sufferability

311
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,440
is defined

312
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,040
in terms of whether a quantum state

313
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,079
factors into two quantum states

314
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,200
so if if i have a system and i can draw

315
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,160
a boundary

316
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,800
somewhere in it that divides it into two

317
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,000
compartments a and b

318
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,920
then if the joint state the state of the

319
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,959
entire system a b factors

320
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,079
into a state of a and a state of b then

321
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,519
the system is separable

322
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,800
and otherwise it's entangled

323
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,440
and entanglement is kind of the natural

324
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,639
state of systems

325
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,200
in quantum theory whereas separability

326
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,680
is the

327
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,160
the only state of systems in classical

328
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,920
physics

329
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,839
so a has a state and b has a state

330
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,399
and we can specify those two states

331
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,240
independently of each other

332
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,360
if this joint system is separate that

333
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,160
means a and b

334
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,240
have identities and we can talk about

335
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,040
their interaction

336
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,399
so i want to go back in history to the

337
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,560
18th century and

338
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,839
and just mention how strange an

339
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,000
idea this is if you think about

340
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,079
physics at the time of laplace

341
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,680
he was mixing the kind of atomism of

342
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,200
democritus

343
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,079
the kind of hard sphere irreducible

344
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:40,800
particle

345
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,120
atomism with the dynamics of newton

346
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,040
and so laplace's world was a bunch of

347
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,480
atoms each of which was a hard sphere

348
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,440
a monad and they were moving around

349
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,079
according to newton's laws

350
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,720
and newton's laws act instantaneously

351
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,240
so there's no sense in newton of forces

352
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,720
being communicated the forces are just

353
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,800
there and oh this is something that

354
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,560
newton was aware of

355
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,959
and here's a quote from nicholas guyson

356
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,959
who's been very concerned about this

357
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,120
issue of locality and physics and

358
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,040
he in fact wrote a beautiful paper

359
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,160
pointing out that the

360
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,639
passion for locality in physics is very

361
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,360
recent

362
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,720
it comes from einstein einstein invented

363
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,839
this idea that

364
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,279
information travels at a finite speed

365
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,760
before that everything happened

366
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,320
instantaneously so newton understood

367
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,639
that if you go up to the moon and move a

368
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:47,440
rock

369
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,639
then everybody's weight on earth changes

370
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,279
instantly now that's contextuality

371
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,320
that's a change

372
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,120
here that happens

373
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,040
unpreventably due to

374
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,079
completely unknown events happening

375
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,760
somewhere else

376
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,880
so intrinsic contextuality is closely

377
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,320
linked to non-locality

378
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,639
now in laplace's world of

379
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,240
all these atoms obeying newton's laws

380
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,360
there aren't any boundaries there are no

381
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,399
boundaries around

382
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,639
systems like the earth or you or me

383
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,240
uh or a cannonball so where do those

384
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,800
boundaries come from

385
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,360
in a laplacian world they have to be

386
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,160
imposed from the outside

387
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,519
so we impose a boundary we slice

388
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,720
this picture in two and we say those are

389
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,880
two different systems

390
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,199
now if you think about that in classical

391
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,639
physics

392
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,279
that means that you've created an

393
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,199
infinite potential

394
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,360
that separates the particles from each

395
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,600
other and prevents the newtonian

396
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,160
dynamics from mixing them up

397
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,160
and frank tipler several years ago wrote

398
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,759
a beautiful paper

399
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,160
published in pnas showing that if you

400
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,959
just start with laplacian physics

401
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,079
and you remove these singularities the

402
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,920
boundaries around objects you get

403
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,800
quantum theory

404
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,000
automatically so laplace in a

405
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,560
sense had a theory very much like

406
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,440
quantum theory

407
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,680
and he had a notion of the universe very

408
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,600
much like entanglement who was full of

409
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,120
what einstein would later call

410
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,720
spooky action in the distance

411
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,480
okay so in this picture where we

412
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,639
start with the system and we slice it

413
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,720
down the middle and call the two parts a

414
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,440
and b we're assuming that there's a

415
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,560
boundary there

416
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,680
it's not given to us by the physics

417
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,440
and we're assuming that it stays

418
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,839
constant over time

419
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,839
and in quantum theory unlike classical

420
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,319
physics

421
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,679
the dynamics will automatically erase

422
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,039
this boundary

423
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,439
so quantum dynamics of an isolated

424
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,160
system

425
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,520
is unitary and so it mixes everything

426
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,319
together into a superposition

427
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,520
so if we say that a and b can be

428
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,439
separated

429
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,199
what we're effectively assuming is a

430
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,359
weak local interaction

431
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,919
that's only well defined for a short

432
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,039
period of time

433
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,679
because eventually the dynamics of the

434
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:34,559
of the

435
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,400
joint system will erase the boundary

436
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,280
that we've put there

437
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,080
okay but if we have

438
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,960
a separable system and if it's finite

439
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,160
dimensional

440
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,080
we have a perfectly general way of

441
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,080
talking about the interaction we can

442
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,360
always write the interaction in this

443
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,400
simple summation form

444
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,160
uh the whole system interaction which

445
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,120
i'll call h

446
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,640
a b with parentheses is the sum of what

447
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,600
a is doing

448
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,160
and what b is doing and then how they're

449
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,160
interacting

450
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,120
and this interaction can always be

451
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,760
written

452
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,679
in the form that i give that i've given

453
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,440
below which is

454
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,240
basically a bunch of thermodynamics

455
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,000
numbers of degrees of freedom

456
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,760
and kt and some measure of efficiency

457
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,280
times a sum of operators and those

458
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,400
operators we can choose a basis where

459
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,919
those operators have

460
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,720
binary outcomes so they question they

461
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,679
correspond to

462
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,799
asking yes no questions which is what

463
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,760
john wheeler postulated the very

464
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,360
foundation of physics was

465
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,000
just answers to yes no questions but we

466
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,320
can always do this in quantum theory

467
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,440
and that's why quantum theory is so nice

468
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,760
it allows us to

469
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,440
[Music]

470
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,280
write down a formalism that explicitly

471
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,679
describes the interaction between two

472
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,320
systems

473
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,039
in terms of exchanging information

474
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,480
and this depends on an insight that

475
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,679
boltzmann had

476
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,080
in the 1870s and it's really this

477
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,440
insight that that

478
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,000
gives us quantum theory boltzmann

479
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,200
realized that

480
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,039
information always costs energy

481
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:34,080
and what this did was rule out

482
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,480
the way of thinking about measurement

483
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,320
that one finds in classical physics

484
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,640
which is that the observer is completely

485
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,799
detached from the system

486
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,840
and information flows from the system to

487
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,520
the observer

488
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,200
but but that process of observation

489
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,679
doesn't affect the system and boltzmann

490
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,160
realized that this simply wasn't true

491
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,760
observers aren't gods uh if i want to

492
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,160
get

493
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,679
information i need to spend some energy

494
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,600
and that energy flows back into the

495
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,400
world so by getting some information i'm

496
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,240
always affecting what's going on so

497
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,919
from a formal point of view these

498
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,679
operators

499
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,799
the mk implement both perception

500
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,600
and action and that becomes key of

501
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,679
course to understanding active inference

502
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,080
because

503
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,000
active inference is about getting

504
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,360
information and

505
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,520
giving information by acting

506
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,159
okay so to sum this up whenever i have

507
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,039
a bipartite system that's finite and

508
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,720
it's separable

509
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,400
i can write the interaction as

510
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,919
thermodynamics times

511
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,000
questions and that looks just like

512
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,159
classical communication

513
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,640
i can think of my two systems as agents

514
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,320
alice and bob they're always called and

515
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,320
they exchange bit strings

516
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,678
finite bit strings

517
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,120
so now let's think of a specific model

518
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,600
let's suppose that alice and bob are

519
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,799
each

520
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,919
uh alternately preparing and then

521
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:10,960
measuring

522
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,799
the states of a bunch of independent

523
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,159
cubits quantum bits

524
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,080
and we can think of those as electron

525
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,760
spins or something like that

526
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,520
so um alice in some

527
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,720
time uh prepares in electron spins

528
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,280
and she hands those to bob and bob

529
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,960
measures them

530
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,559
and then bob writes a message by

531
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,360
preparing the electron spins in some way

532
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,039
and hands them to alice and alice

533
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,559
measures them so they've now

534
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,919
exchanged some bits

535
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,240
but there's no requirement that they use

536
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,720
the same z-axis to measure the spins

537
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,360
so if they use exactly the same z-axis

538
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,159
to measure their spins then if alice

539
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:56,960
writes

540
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,919
zero zero one bob is going to measure

541
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:00,559
one zero

542
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,760
zero one but if

543
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,320
alice and bob are using different z-axes

544
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,400
to measure their spins

545
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,039
alice will write one zero zero one using

546
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:11,520
her z

547
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,120
axis and bob will get some probability

548
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,960
distributions over 1 and 0

549
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,919
for each qubit measuring it with his

550
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:20,960
axis

551
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,520
and the way those probabilities will

552
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,480
look

553
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,440
will depend on how tilted his z-axis is

554
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,159
with respect to analysis

555
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,480
so this is now an interesting situation

556
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,480
and this gets to daniel's question about

557
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,840
shannon information versus other kinds

558
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,880
information with semantics

559
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,679
this is a purely quantum system

560
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,600
there's nothing to introduce any

561
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,360
classical noise

562
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,919
so the information exchange is perfectly

563
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:56,720
symmetrical

564
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,240
and completely free of classical noise

565
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,400
but by using different reference frames

566
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,880
they introduce quantum noise

567
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,440
and specifically what they lose is the

568
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,640
message

569
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,760
they lose the semantics from the message

570
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,280
so alice encodes four bits bob gets

571
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,480
four bits but the code

572
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,240
may have been lost and the code resides

573
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,840
in the z-axis if they're using the same

574
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,679
z-axis they share a code

575
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,960
if they're not they don't so semantics

576
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,080
depends on

577
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,559
shared reference frames and that's what

578
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,000
shannon information theory

579
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,240
is missing it's missing the idea of the

580
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,600
reference frame that's

581
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,279
used to decode the message

582
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,760
it's just counting bits so shannon

583
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,919
theory is just a quantitative theory of

584
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:48,640
bits

585
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,919
a way of counting bits and what we're

586
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,240
really interested in is decoding

587
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,240
encoding and decoding so we're really

588
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,559
interested in reference frames

589
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,880
and that will be a central theme it is a

590
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,279
central theme in the paper

591
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,480
okay so sum up every interaction between

592
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,400
finite systems and a sufficient joint

593
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,039
say can be represented in this way

594
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:15,360
of two agents and they're separated by

595
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,400
a set of bits a set of qubits that set

596
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,760
of qubits can be thought of as a

597
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,080
holographic screen

598
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,120
it functions as a markov blanket and the

599
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,360
information that he codes is completely

600
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,760
specified it's the eigenvalues of the

601
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,960
interaction

602
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,640
written in its hamiltonian form

603
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,480
so we know everything there is to know

604
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,480
about an interaction

605
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,679
in terms of a picture like this and

606
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,480
these pictures are uh everywhere

607
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,039
in biology um everyone is now using

608
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,159
the market mark all blanket concept it's

609
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,840
very common

610
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,559
in computer science exactly the same

611
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,320
concept is called an application

612
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,760
programming interface

613
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,840
and it can be plugged down between two

614
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,600
virtual machines and regulate their

615
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,919
communication

616
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,480
in cosmology the holographic principle

617
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,000
was originally invented to deal with

618
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,400
stretched horizons and black holes so it

619
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,760
separates the exterior from the interior

620
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,320
and it specifies exactly how much

621
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,640
information can be obtained

622
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,640
if you're an observer on the exterior

623
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,159
about the interior

624
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,880
and it's symmetrical so it also

625
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,279
specifies exactly what the interior can

626
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,520
learn about the exterior

627
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,120
but you also see this concept in

628
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,840
particle physics if you're thinking of a

629
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,600
scattering interaction for example

630
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,120
that's mediated by

631
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,440
a vector boson of photon or something

632
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,799
like that

633
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,760
say it's electromagnetic scattering then

634
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,240
all of the information is on that vector

635
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,880
ozone there's no information about

636
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,440
say entanglement on one side that's

637
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,360
communicated to the other side

638
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,600
it's it's just a single value

639
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,080
a momentum transfer for example that's

640
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,440
encoded

641
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,960
by this holographic screen

642
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,799
okay so where do we take this if we have

643
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,159
an observer

644
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,559
and she's got a holographic screen and

645
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,600
she's interacting with

646
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,120
the rest of the universe bob then by

647
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,600
looking at her bit string alice can

648
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,960
learn very little

649
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,880
she doesn't know what z-axis bob is

650
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,799
using so she gets a message but she

651
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,400
doesn't know what code

652
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,440
bob used she doesn't know how big bob's

653
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,720
state space is

654
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,799
so bob could be a small system could be

655
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,840
an enormous system

656
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,520
since she doesn't know the state space

657
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,640
you can't possibly know bob's state

658
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,640
she doesn't she doesn't know whether

659
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,360
bob's state is separable or entangled

660
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,279
so whether there are any divisions in

661
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,840
bob that she has to worry about

662
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,760
uh she doesn't know the dynamics on the

663
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,760
other side so she can't predict what bob

664
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,799
will do next

665
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:09,679
and all of this is in principle uh

666
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,360
looking out at the world i actually

667
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,200
don't know that there are any separate

668
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,480
objects in it

669
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,440
i can't based on the information that i

670
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,000
can get

671
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,120
at my boundary which is just a set of

672
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,320
interaction eigenvalues

673
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,240
and so these questions have to be

674
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,080
answered some other way they can't

675
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,640
be answered by observation they have to

676
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,880
be answered by a generative model

677
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,240
so hence active inference is based on

678
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,760
what models predict and

679
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,760
what quantum theory tells us about

680
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,880
generative models

681
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,840
is that they're heuristic by definition

682
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,240
they

683
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,200
can't be constructed based on the data

684
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,520
they're

685
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,320
only heuristics so where did they come

686
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,559
from

687
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,480
and here when we look back at our

688
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,799
picture our original picture of a joint

689
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,440
system being divided

690
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,760
uh recall that this boundary is

691
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,799
arbitrary

692
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,320
and it doesn't last very long

693
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,600
so this joint state isn't separable for

694
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,279
very long

695
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,080
and the only asymptotic dynamics the

696
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,320
only dynamics that's long lasting is the

697
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,720
joint dynamics

698
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,320
so alice's generative model

699
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,440
which is implemented by her dynamics is

700
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,520
effectively a sample of the joint

701
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,640
dynamics

702
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,440
it's just a temporary sample of what

703
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,559
would be going on

704
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,240
anyway if there was no division

705
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,159
so it makes sense that alice's

706
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,440
generative model

707
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,159
contains information about the world but

708
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,200
that information

709
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,080
did not come from observation it came

710
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:50,720
from

711
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,640
the time before the boundary was imposed

712
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,320
and it will still be there after the

713
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,840
boundary goes away

714
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,440
okay another thing that quantum theory

715
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,360
adds to the acting inference picture

716
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,559
is that it recognizes that all of the

717
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,279
energy that's required to run the

718
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,559
calculations

719
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,120
also has to come through the markov

720
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,880
blanket

721
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,919
so if you think about the states

722
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,399
on a holographic screen a markov blanket

723
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,320
of any information encoding

724
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,760
if that interface is the only interface

725
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,600
between the two systems which is how

726
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,760
we've defined it here

727
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,799
then some fraction of those bits can't

728
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,039
be informative because they have to be

729
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,720
burned as fuel so by definition they're

730
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,200
meaningless

731
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,360
now this tells us again something very

732
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,200
deep which is that

733
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,640
the context of a measurement of can

734
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,240
never be specified

735
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,159
completely and that again is in

736
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,679
principle

737
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,000
because some of the information on the

738
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,360
blanket has to be burned as fuel

739
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,600
and we see this on the output side too

740
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,720
of course

741
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,760
of some of my output

742
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,480
on the world some of my action on the

743
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,200
world

744
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,159
is just dissipating what for me is waste

745
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:23,840
heat

746
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,000
and i have no control over that that's

747
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,960
part of my metabolism

748
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,440
but i'm side affecting the world all the

749
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,159
time by

750
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,559
dissipating this waste heat which i

751
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:35,679
don't

752
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,320
think of as an action but which is an

753
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,840
action from the point of view of the

754
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,279
physics

755
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,640
so here again we have an addition to

756
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,520
the theory that we get from thinking

757
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,200
about the dynamics from a quantum

758
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,559
physics point of view instead of a

759
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,760
classical physics point of view

760
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,320
okay so this is the picture i showed

761
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,159
before

762
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,840
this set of qubits is the markov blanket

763
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,840
of generated model is represented by

764
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,640
this

765
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,240
coconut diagram and

766
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,919
it becomes clear of what the generative

767
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,080
model is it's a combination of a

768
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,120
reference frame

769
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,480
and some combination some computation

770
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,240
and it's clear what it does it

771
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,440
specifies the option space for

772
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,840
both perception and action it encodes

773
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,519
everything that's detectable

774
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,960
in everything that's actionable about b

775
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:38,399
4a so here just a couple of cartoons

776
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,480
for example if alice looks out in the

777
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,919
world and what she sees

778
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,640
is a red rectangle interacting with a

779
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,840
green diamond by some

780
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,799
interaction then she must have reference

781
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,159
frames for

782
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,720
seeing rectangles and diamonds and she

783
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,960
must have

784
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,200
state observables for red and green and

785
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,000
she must have a

786
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,840
memory so that she can keep track of

787
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,200
what's going on with those state

788
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,039
observables long enough to construct

789
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,279
this picture of an interaction

790
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,480
so all of the semantics is inside the

791
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,760
observer it has to be provided by these

792
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,480
structures

793
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,360
inside the observable observer so the

794
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,919
semantics that's imposed on the world

795
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,840
is imposed it comes from the generative

796
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,360
model

797
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:29,840
it's not out there in any sense

798
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,120
part of of what the observer has to do

799
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:35,600
is write

800
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,880
memories if the observer is going to see

801
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,200
change and since memories are classical

802
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,360
data those memories are effectively

803
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,120
written back in the blanket because the

804
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,880
blanket is the only place where any

805
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,600
classical data live

806
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,679
so we can we can infer from this that if

807
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:57,360
a memory looks internal to a system

808
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,799
that system has to have

809
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,200
intercompartmental boundaries inside it

810
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,440
to to write those memories on so this

811
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,279
actually tells us something gives us an

812
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,360
expectation of physiology

813
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,320
in organisms or in any sort of

814
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,840
artificial structure that

815
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,360
memories have to be written on

816
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,559
boundaries of some sort

817
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,840
so again here's this this swirl of

818
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,799
issues

819
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,120
that all surround this question of

820
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,240
separability

821
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,480
of the world being separated into

822
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,279
distinct

823
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,480
pieces and i've mentioned all of them

824
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,559
now except the frame problem

825
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,399
which is the problem of predicting side

826
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,840
effects

827
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,000
and clearly if you don't have

828
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,200
access to the dynamics outside you

829
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,000
and you don't have access to all of your

830
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,720
actions

831
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,320
because some of them are just heat

832
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,840
dissipation

833
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,960
you can't possibly predict side effects

834
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,200
all side effects so the frame problem is

835
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,519
unsolvable in principle

836
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:02,080
in this setting

837
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,119
so in this paper what gemini set out to

838
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,320
do

839
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,918
was to construct a general

840
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,679
representation of

841
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,719
these reference frames and because

842
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,239
they're physically implemented they're

843
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,760
quantum reference frames they're not

844
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,239
just

845
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:24,320
abstracted and

846
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,960
these things specify both what the agent

847
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,079
can expect

848
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,560
and what the agent could do so they

849
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,879
completely define the option space

850
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:37,760
for active inference for the agent so by

851
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,839
having a general representation of the

852
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,760
agent's reference frames we know

853
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,000
in a sense everything interesting to

854
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,560
know about the agent

855
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,239
then we wanted to distinguish the

856
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,679
reference frames that can be used

857
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,280
simultaneously and these are the

858
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,280
co-deployable reference frames from

859
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,719
those that can't

860
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,719
and the distinction again is given to us

861
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,079
by quantum theory it's just

862
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,960
operator commutativity so for example i

863
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,480
can't

864
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,800
deploy position and momentum at the same

865
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,760
time because

866
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,119
those operators don't commute

867
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,680
they side affect each other it's the

868
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,440
other way to think of it

869
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,920
and physics is full of operators that

870
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,119
don't commute

871
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,320
so my my action

872
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,920
space is is not unitary it's

873
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,280
segmented into uh sets of things that i

874
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,440
can't do at the same time

875
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,000
without introducing contextuality

876
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,480
so we showed that this

877
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,599
non-co-deployability of reference frames

878
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,160
actually induces intrinsic contextuality

879
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,839
as it's defined in the literature

880
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,000
what that means is that it creates

881
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,680
undefined joint probability

882
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,599
distributions

883
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,720
um not just probability distributions

884
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,480
that are difficult to make sense of

885
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,359
or that needs some information added to

886
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,079
them

887
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,040
but probability distributions that

888
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,000
actually can't be consistently defined

889
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,880
why not because there's the information

890
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,359
that would have to be specified

891
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,640
to make them well behaved as information

892
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,400
that you can't have

893
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,160
that you can't get even in principle

894
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,000
and then our final objective was to tie

895
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,760
this explicitly to the frame problem

896
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,400
which is

897
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,040
a canonical problem that artificial

898
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,680
intelligence

899
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,240
discovered by mccarthy and hayes back in

900
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,839
1969

901
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:37,440
the unpredictability of side effects

902
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,000
so that's that's it for my introduction

903
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,680
kind of context setting

904
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,040
and i am happy to

905
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,480
um as soon as i can get to this button

906
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,160
again

907
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,000
switch to discussion

908
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,960
chris thank you so much for that there

909
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,680
it is

910
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,400
yep we got it now thanks so much for

911
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,200
that

912
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,640
really amazing presentation i'm sure

913
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,320
everybody was having some pretty

914
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,160
interesting thoughts from what you were

915
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,079
communicating really though thanks again

916
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,520
for coming on the stream

917
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,320
so um for those who are here please

918
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,599
write down your questions

919
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,119
and then when you ask your question

920
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,880
let's stop after the question so that we

921
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,480
can get a response to that

922
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,560
question and not continue on with the

923
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,160
question and then we'll

924
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,720
raise our hands to hear from everyone so

925
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,480
i'm gonna first ask a question from the

926
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,400
chat and then stephen i saw you raise

927
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,520
your hand so anyone else

928
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,800
raise your hand otherwise there's a

929
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,880
couple questions from the chat

930
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,400
so here's the first question from the

931
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,000
chat can the context-based paradigm

932
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,800
especially quantum contextuality help to

933
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,280
answer

934
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,599
how does spontaneously generated thought

935
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:46,800
arise in the brain

936
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,000
if yes how how do you see this relating

937
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,640
to the brain

938
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,720
um good question

939
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,320
um i

940
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,640
actually suspect that

941
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:09,759
all cells are quantum computers

942
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,079
and that to to really get a handle on

943
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,079
information processing in cells

944
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,280
we'll eventually have to use quantum

945
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,320
information theory

946
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,800
and the the reason for that is that

947
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,880
cellular energy budgets are really

948
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,320
small and and place a pretty strict

949
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,000
upper a strict upper limit

950
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,160
on how much classical information cells

951
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,839
can encode

952
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:38,960
and that upper limit is much

953
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,200
much smaller than the information

954
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,480
required to encode

955
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,359
things like protein confirmation

956
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:52,079
so i think that that cells are

957
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,520
in fact uh devices where

958
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,599
contextuality and entanglement play a

959
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:58,880
role

960
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:04,000
now what what spontaneous thought means

961
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,079
i'm not sure oh

962
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,040
i'm um

963
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:15,280
very sympathetic to

964
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,480
the idea that thoughts

965
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,440
are and emotions and and everything else

966
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,170
that we experience

967
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:24,960
[Music]

968
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,680
just the experience tip of a very large

969
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,880
iceberg that we don't experience

970
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,160
so i think our experiential

971
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,279
access to

972
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,839
what our minds are doing is extremely

973
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:42,560
limited

974
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,520
and um

975
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,079
so how how what we actually experience

976
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,440
as a as it were rises to the surface is

977
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,839
uh a good question

978
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,320
i tend to think that global workspace

979
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,359
type theories

980
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:05,520
are a good classical answer to that

981
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,119
but all of those ideas

982
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,079
i think will eventually need to be put

983
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,560
in a

984
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,319
much better mathematical framework

985
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,880
thank you for the answer that's a long

986
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,200
way of saying i don't know

987
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,200
but it's what spontaneously came to mind

988
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,520
so how could we ask for anything else

989
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,200
stephen and then anyone else who wants

990
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,520
to raise their hand

991
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,640
yeah thank you um i was just curious um

992
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,440
you mentioned

993
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,720
sort of the quantum noise and the the

994
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,000
the way that if you um have

995
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,359
the z-axis um that you if you don't have

996
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,760
the z-axis you can't decode

997
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,720
back the information and often with

998
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,520
quantum

999
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,440
effects it's like it's when you have

1000
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,880
very low

1001
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,520
uh degrees of freedom for like a

1002
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,720
molecule or something that you

1003
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,240
particularly can see it

1004
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,079
compared to you know when it's in the

1005
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,000
melor of many degrees of freedom

1006
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,599
so i'm wondering if there's like a um

1007
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,960
certain scales where like

1008
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,760
the the interactions are in the cell or

1009
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,680
molecules are very quantum

1010
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,079
like and then it becomes more contextual

1011
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,920
and a bit more blurry and then another

1012
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,119
scale it becomes a

1013
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,800
bit more quantum like maybe once you

1014
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,680
start to get to brainwaves interacting

1015
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,280
and is the contextuality piece

1016
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,920
moving it in a way it's another way of

1017
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,800
moving it in and out of a more classical

1018
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,480
um kind of noisy space

1019
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,040
um so that it's like where it's got more

1020
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,160
um

1021
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,319
noise and it's less easy to see sort of

1022
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,160
more distinct quantum effects

1023
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,440
so i was wondering like is there

1024
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,760
particular scales at which

1025
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,160
you see the quantum effect being more

1026
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,680
like you think a traditional quantum

1027
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,000
like flipping between states

1028
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,839
um and if there's other scales where

1029
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:01,440
it's much more

1030
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,119
like fristen talks about this kind of

1031
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,720
non-linear

1032
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,200
miller

1033
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,000
great

1034
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,040
yeah that's that's a very good question

1035
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,160
is the question about

1036
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,920
is there a quantum to classical

1037
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,040
transition and if so where

1038
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,359
and

1039
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,560
that that question is typically posed in

1040
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,839
terms of decoherence

1041
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,880
and in in

1042
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,040
biological systems um

1043
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,319
estimates of decoherence times are

1044
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:39,040
anywhere from

1045
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,240
femtoseconds down

1046
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,400
there's the famous paper by tegmark from

1047
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,440
2000

1048
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,920
uh criticizing the hammer off penrose

1049
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,599
theory where

1050
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,079
um his argument against hammer off and

1051
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,319
penrose is basically the d coherence

1052
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:57,839
happen many orders of magnitude faster

1053
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:58,560
than

1054
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,800
than any cognitive processes or any

1055
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,760
neuronal processes

1056
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:09,440
so based on that type of reasoning

1057
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,480
biochemistry is thought of as being

1058
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,720
classical

1059
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,440
somewhere above the say finto second

1060
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,720
type of time scale

1061
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,400
so molecular dynamics calculations

1062
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,720
are basically classical when they're in

1063
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,720
like finto second types of time steps

1064
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,960
and that introduces the question of what

1065
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,040
is noise

1066
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,760
right what what does it mean to say that

1067
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,839
there's thermal noise in a system

1068
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:42,560
um when we think about thermal noise

1069
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,640
classically for example we might think

1070
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,400
about a protein

1071
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,839
that's sitting in a bath of

1072
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:53,280
water and the water molecules are

1073
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,119
thermally excited so they're banging

1074
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:56,319
into the protein like

1075
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:59,280
little billiard balls and that's in fact

1076
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,079
one way of

1077
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,760
thinking about a decoherence model

1078
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,359
so what we've introduced here is

1079
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:10,560
this idea of a temporal sample

1080
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,400
that we're looking at the protein

1081
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,000
molecule for a long enough period

1082
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,160
that the water molecules have had a

1083
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,200
chance to bang

1084
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,200
into it from many different directions

1085
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,520
and we're somehow averaging over that

1086
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,440
temporal sample

1087
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,000
so that gets to this question of

1088
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,400
ergodicity that came up in the earlier

1089
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,960
discussion

1090
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,640
and it it makes us ask how

1091
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,319
am i implementing this this temporal

1092
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,440
sample and

1093
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,119
the the obvious answer is i'm

1094
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:46,800
implementing this temporal temporal

1095
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,599
sample by

1096
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,520
measuring the state of the protein in a

1097
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,000
particular way so i'm i'm using

1098
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,960
an enzyme say to to measure the state of

1099
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,400
the protein

1100
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,920
and the the enzymatic reaction has some

1101
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,440
particular time constant

1102
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,880
so it takes a certain amount of time

1103
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,280
for the enzymatic reaction to take place

1104
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,359
and during that time the protein may be

1105
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,200
wiggling around

1106
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,920
so i think that that all of these

1107
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,319
questions about classicality

1108
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:19,119
in the end come down to questions about

1109
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,720
measurement

1110
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,640
and the temporal resolution of

1111
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,760
measurements

1112
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,040
implemented by something an instrument

1113
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,960
or another part of the biological system

1114
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,160
or an observer of some kind

1115
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,359
so this is a this is kind of a long way

1116
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:40,640
of saying

1117
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,119
that i suspect that this question of

1118
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:44,640
classicality is

1119
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,319
always a question of observation

1120
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:52,560
and the the sort of coin in picture that

1121
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,160
that i outlined implies that

1122
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,359
the classical information only exists

1123
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,760
on the mark on blanket that there's no

1124
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,920
classical information anywhere else in

1125
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,680
the system

1126
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,720
so classical information may not

1127
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,920
in a sense be ontological at all

1128
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,400
there may be no ontological classicality

1129
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,040
uh if this kind of communication picture

1130
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,800
is correct

1131
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,560
now if that's the case noise is

1132
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,480
um epistemological

1133
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,599
noise is an artifact of making the

1134
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:34,960
observations in a certain way

1135
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,960
with a certain reference frame right an

1136
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,800
instrument is just a reference frame

1137
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,839
thank you for the deep answer chris

1138
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:44,800
we're gonna go

1139
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,040
blue scott and then a question from the

1140
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,279
chat

1141
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:51,800
hi chris thanks for the um

1142
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,960
contextualization

1143
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,079
talk that was really nice um so

1144
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,000
i just was wondering you just mentioned

1145
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,920
earlier like the prospect

1146
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,200
of each cell being a quantum computer

1147
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,280
and i'm also like i have a similar kind

1148
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,720
of thought or

1149
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,160
theory and i just was wondering if

1150
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,960
you've heard of like quantum cognition

1151
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,440
and the positive molecule with the idea

1152
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,000
of these

1153
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,160
entangled pyrophosphates as as holding

1154
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,079
kind of quantum cognition cellularly

1155
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:21,520
have you heard this theory and

1156
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,760
do you think it's credible or do you

1157
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,200
have other

1158
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,960
suppositions as to where this quantum

1159
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,240
cognition could occur

1160
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,118
intracellularly

1161
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,839
i've certainly

1162
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,599
heard and seen various studies of

1163
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,800
localized quantum effects

1164
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,000
in particular molecular structures

1165
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,240
so

1166
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,240
stacked pi domains and and so on and

1167
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,720
there's the whole story about

1168
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,720
uh is there quantum coherence in

1169
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,319
um um

1170
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,079
goodness i've just dropped the word

1171
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,000
light harvesting molecules or

1172
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
electron transport or something like

1173
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,680
that

1174
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,800
and um you know there's the

1175
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,400
hemorrhage theory that there's that

1176
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,839
there's quantum processing in

1177
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:18,240
microtubules

1178
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,240
and in all of these approaches

1179
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,440
one is thinking about a quantum

1180
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,480
process happening in a background

1181
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,839
of a classical cell once one's thinking

1182
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:33,920
the rest of the of the biochemical

1183
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,400
situation as being classical a classical

1184
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,559
environment of some kind

1185
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:41,920
in which this single quantum process is

1186
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,839
happening

1187
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:48,000
and as i sort of expressed in

1188
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,520
in answering the last question i

1189
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,480
i suspect that that entire way of

1190
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,359
thinking is

1191
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:58,400
probably wrong

1192
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,960
that we we can't actually think of

1193
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:08,000
bulk biochemistry as being classical

1194
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:12,800
so um trying to think of

1195
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,280
a particular event as being

1196
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,599
a quantum event against a classical

1197
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:21,839
background

1198
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:25,200
may just be misleading us about what's

1199
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,440
how information processing is actually

1200
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,640
occurring

1201
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:32,400
and if we think of of the interior of a

1202
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,440
cell

1203
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,280
say the entire interior of something

1204
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,720
like a bacterial cell

1205
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,760
as being in one coherent state

1206
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,280
then um it's not that

1207
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,160
that their particular quantum molecular

1208
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:46,960
states

1209
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,680
is it's that the entire interior is one

1210
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,879
big entangled mess

1211
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,319
that demands a very different way of

1212
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:58,400
thinking about biochemistry and

1213
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,680
i don't even know how to formulate

1214
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,960
that way of thinking about biochemistry

1215
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,720
but i suspect that approaching it as a

1216
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,400
as a quantum information

1217
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,920
problem where we're extremely

1218
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,720
explicit about where measurements are

1219
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,640
made

1220
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,558
would be what would have to be done

1221
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:25,839
thanks chris really amazing about the

1222
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:26,640
relational

1223
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,599
and the semantic biochemistry that's not

1224
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:31,599
how we got it in 103.

1225
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:34,160
so scott and then a question from the

1226
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,480
chat

1227
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:38,559
chris thank you that's a absolutely

1228
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,160
fascinating presentation

1229
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,559
a number of questions but i'll just ask

1230
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,000
one or two

1231
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,680
um one of the challenges of quantum

1232
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,240
physics

1233
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,559
or challenges to quantum physics being

1234
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:52,640
applied in the macro level

1235
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,240
is that you know don't take people have

1236
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,680
said don't take the concepts and apply

1237
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,280
them to social constructions and things

1238
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,400
like that

1239
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,000
but here the um origin of the

1240
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,079
active inference notions or the

1241
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,400
relationship to the acupuncturist

1242
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,400
suggests to me um the opportunity

1243
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,960
to look at phenomenon of much larger

1244
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,240
systems larger scale

1245
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:17,440
social scale um and so

1246
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:24,079
i wonder about your um uh acceptance or

1247
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:27,280
enthusiasm for that notion of

1248
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,800
applying these ideas

1249
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,680
to uh social systems political systems

1250
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,319
economic systems other systems that have

1251
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,319
interactions that can be described with

1252
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:39,520
active inference

1253
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,559
um and this feels to me like a nice way

1254
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:43,599
to say hey

1255
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,160
we're talking about quantum politics

1256
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:46,880
quantum

1257
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,160
markets we're talking about uh prionic

1258
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,800
governance with conformational changes

1259
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,480
of narratives

1260
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,240
um and so a lot of the work that we've

1261
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,079
been doing on the information

1262
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,960
side is gonna is i've been saying

1263
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,559
without knowing you've explained to me

1264
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:04,079
what i've been trying to say for years

1265
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:04,559
now

1266
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:07,839
in this talk and i've been saying

1267
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:08,319
without

1268
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,400
knowing why that data plus meaning

1269
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,319
equals information

1270
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:13,760
and the meaning part is what you just

1271
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,400
explained to me what i meant by meaning

1272
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,000
and i always thought of it i was a

1273
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,680
lawyer for 30 years so i always thought

1274
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,359
of it as the meaning like a contract

1275
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:22,319
with an enforceable

1276
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,880
narrative which is meaning but you've

1277
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,319
just given me a new way of looking at

1278
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:28,240
that meaning from a quantum perspective

1279
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,880
which is extremely robust

1280
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,960
and scale independent i just wonder

1281
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,400
about your comments on that and your

1282
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,480
enthusiasm for that kind of application

1283
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,599
thanks oh thank you that's

1284
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,760
that's a very interesting observation

1285
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:46,720
um

1286
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,480
i think the experiments are going to be

1287
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,359
very difficult

1288
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,240
but i think if we can figure out how to

1289
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,960
do the experiments

1290
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,640
we're going to find contextuality and

1291
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:01,440
entanglement

1292
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,640
kinds of effects all over the place

1293
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,040
and i would i would point you to the

1294
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:07,920
work of

1295
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,960
of uh atamar zad zafarov and his

1296
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,480
colleagues some of which

1297
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:17,599
is referenced in the paper

1298
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,680
in in their formulation called

1299
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,720
contextuality by default

1300
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,000
what they've done is

1301
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,680
translate this kind of most standard

1302
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,559
model of

1303
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:35,200
quantum contextuality into classical

1304
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,399
probability theory

1305
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:43,920
and and given this criterion of

1306
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,400
if a classical probability a consistent

1307
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,760
classical probability

1308
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,240
distribution cannot be defined over a

1309
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,760
set of data

1310
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:56,319
then it displays contextuality

1311
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:59,760
and they they published a

1312
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,800
series of papers in the past four or

1313
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,079
five years

1314
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:07,359
on this approach and one of them

1315
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:10,319
deconstructs a large number of claims of

1316
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:14,160
quantum effects in psychological data

1317
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,079
which have been reported now by numerous

1318
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:17,359
groups around the world

1319
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:19,200
with various kinds of experimental

1320
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,440
protocols

1321
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,119
and there's active controversy between

1322
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:27,040
members of these different groups about

1323
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,440
what is and is not evidence of quantum

1324
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,000
behavior

1325
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,599
so it's an enormous literature now

1326
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:36,839
but using the contextuality by default

1327
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:38,880
approach

1328
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,720
zafrov and colleagues

1329
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,359
his student cervantes is one of the lead

1330
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:46,000
people

1331
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,280
who's done this work have

1332
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,640
constructed extremely careful

1333
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,079
experiments

1334
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:58,559
where under their their best criteria

1335
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:01,520
there are robust intrinsic contextuality

1336
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,960
effects

1337
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,079
and interestingly they have to do with

1338
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:07,680
meaning

1339
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,799
so one that we refer to in the uh

1340
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:12,559
in the paper is called the snow queen

1341
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,799
experiment and it's based on

1342
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:17,200
uh interpretations of the hans christian

1343
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,079
andersen story

1344
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:23,280
so i think that as

1345
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,880
as the tools and techniques for

1346
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,960
developing these these kinds of

1347
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,599
experimental protocols are improved

1348
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:32,480
uh we're going to see more and more uh

1349
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,319
effects that are

1350
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:37,440
very very difficult to challenge from a

1351
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,760
statistical point of view

1352
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,839
i mean the problem is as therefore often

1353
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:42,960
and i'll point out

1354
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,440
is that in physics if i'm doing

1355
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,599
something like a bell experiment

1356
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,160
i can put my two observers far enough

1357
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,880
apart that they can't communicate

1358
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,960
just due to the speed of light in the

1359
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,680
time it takes to do the experiment

1360
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,440
and you can't do that in biological

1361
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,799
systems

1362
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:04,079
so you always have this communication

1363
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:05,040
loophole

1364
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:08,960
to deal with and what what zafrovan and

1365
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,200
colleagues are really trying to do is

1366
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,280
develop the statistical analysis

1367
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,960
techniques

1368
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,240
uh to get around the communication

1369
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,520
loophole in an arbitrary experiment

1370
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,520
you know carried out with college

1371
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,240
undergraduates

1372
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:30,160
and i think they've been successful

1373
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:33,680
thanks for the response so we're gonna

1374
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:34,079
go

1375
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:35,920
to a question in the chat and then if

1376
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,200
anyone here

1377
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,040
who hasn't raised their hand yet raises

1378
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,880
their hand otherwise we'll go back to um

1379
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:41,920
someone who has

1380
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,480
so this is from sudakar in the chat how

1381
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:44,960
will an

1382
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,359
agent acquire information for their

1383
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,720
generative model

1384
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,960
you've uh said that there has to be some

1385
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,240
heuristic to infer

1386
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,920
the information even from the joint

1387
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,760
world and you said that the object

1388
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,760
semantics have to be inside the observer

1389
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,200
but how does the observer

1390
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,200
learn that in the first place for their

1391
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,000
generative model

1392
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:07,040
that's that's an excellent question and

1393
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,680
again i the only answer i can give is i

1394
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,520
don't know

1395
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,599
i'll but i think that i think that

1396
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:14,880
biology gives us

1397
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,200
hints

1398
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,839
if you look at the process of cell

1399
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:28,559
which is one of the best examples of of

1400
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:30,160
separation that we

1401
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,160
have to deal with that we can really

1402
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,598
manipulate in the laboratory

1403
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,920
then and if you ask how much information

1404
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:40,240
is

1405
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,960
is shared between the daughter cells

1406
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,559
well clearly their genomes are shared

1407
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:50,000
but the genome is only a very tiny part

1408
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,200
of the shared information

1409
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,240
they also share information that's

1410
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,880
encoded in their cytoskeletons

1411
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,720
they share information that's encoded in

1412
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,720
the cell membrane

1413
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,599
they share information that's encoded in

1414
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:09,599
the cytoplasm itself

1415
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:11,440
they may share aspects of their

1416
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,640
bioelectric states

1417
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,559
so there's a lot of information

1418
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:21,920
that is inherited if you will across

1419
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,640
cell division

1420
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:29,760
and most of it has not been quantitated

1421
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,000
in in any reasonable way i mean it's

1422
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
easy to quantitate the information in

1423
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,359
dna or protein

1424
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:37,359
but it's extremely difficult to

1425
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:41,040
quantitate this other information

1426
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:45,599
and i'll just give you one example of

1427
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:47,920
that's from my colleague mike levin's

1428
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,200
lab at

1429
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,319
tufts they work on regeneration and

1430
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:54,960
planaria

1431
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,920
and they've been able to show um

1432
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,760
experimentally

1433
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,520
that it's been known it's been known for

1434
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,480
quite some time that if you

1435
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,119
alter the

1436
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,720
ability of cells to communicate

1437
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,400
bioelectrically

1438
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,200
then you can get planaria to regenerate

1439
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:18,559
with two heads instead of one

1440
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:21,680
but what mike's lab was able to show

1441
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:25,520
is that this is epigenetically heritable

1442
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:29,520
so planaria that looked perfectly normal

1443
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:32,640
may have inherited the tendency to

1444
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:36,079
regenerate with two heads after injury

1445
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:38,799
and this happens without changing dna

1446
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:41,680
without changing rna without changing

1447
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,839
protein content without changing any of

1448
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:46,359
the kind of obviously

1449
00:59:46,359 --> 00:59:50,640
inheritable factors

1450
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,119
and have been able to show

1451
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:54,880
experimentally that the bioelectric

1452
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:55,839
effect happens

1453
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:58,400
first before the observable changes in

1454
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,480
gene expression

1455
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,599
so here's a case where a completely

1456
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:06,880
uh unlooked form kind of information

1457
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,119
is epigenetically inheritable and makes

1458
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:11,040
a huge difference to what the animal

1459
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,720
does

1460
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,040
with his with his physiology with its

1461
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,720
anatomy i mean the the two-headed

1462
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,559
planaria have two perfectly good

1463
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,960
operational brains that are

1464
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:24,079
independently able to direct behavior

1465
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:26,839
uh so they're they're pretty weird

1466
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:29,839
creatures

1467
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,240
thanks for the response and just briefly

1468
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,319
that's one reason why the information is

1469
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:36,160
in the genome kind of zoolander

1470
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,920
take doesn't work well because that's

1471
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,200
assuming there's this map

1472
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,920
between the source code in the program

1473
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,520
but then there's these alternate stable

1474
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:44,480
states that exist

1475
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,559
because the semantic or the epigenetic

1476
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,079
or the environmental frame

1477
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:49,680
so it's not quite as simple as just this

1478
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,440
one mapping that you made

1479
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,760
so that's a really nice point all right

1480
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:54,559
we're gonna have

1481
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:56,640
sarah and then shauna and then a

1482
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,760
question from chat

1483
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,880
thank you go ahead sarah yeah i

1484
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,960
um i have almost like two different

1485
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,720
questions or directions and i'm not sure

1486
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:05,920
how they're gonna match so i'll just

1487
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,359
start with one and see where it goes

1488
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:11,599
um one it seems to me like the

1489
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:14,720
the the way you frame the quantum um set

1490
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,480
up you know you have a you have b

1491
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,160
you could actually kind of do this with

1492
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,240
any problem it's probabilistic type

1493
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,240
notation that you're using but

1494
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,760
you know you have a you have b they have

1495
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,440
the joint distribution of the two

1496
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,280
and um it seems like

1497
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,799
i i guess the question that comes to my

1498
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:33,599
mind is like what happens

1499
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:36,480
when we don't if if we were

1500
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,000
hypothetically because i know our world

1501
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,240
is constructed around reductionism but

1502
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:41,839
if we were hypothetically able to

1503
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:42,799
separate out

1504
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:46,160
or to not think of things as um

1505
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,640
reductionist you know and so like for

1506
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:49,280
example

1507
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,440
um how would our how could our math

1508
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,040
possibly be different if

1509
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,799
we were looking at things as only

1510
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:56,960
spanning sets rather than eigenvalues

1511
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,640
and eigenvectors

1512
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,799
um yeah so this is kind of where my mind

1513
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:02,079
goes is like

1514
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:04,559
is there a is there even a kind of a way

1515
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:06,559
to approach a problem

1516
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:08,960
purely through contextuality rather than

1517
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,200
than you know reductionism of any kind

1518
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,000
that's yeah

1519
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:21,760
hmm

1520
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,680
i don't know on the on the math front i

1521
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,599
may actually defer to shauna here

1522
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:26,559
because

1523
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:30,240
as she she does know much more category

1524
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,079
theory than i do and i suspect the

1525
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:34,799
answer is a category theoretic type of

1526
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:36,720
answer

1527
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:41,118
but i'll make one comment which is that

1528
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:48,000
reductionism is one of these complicated

1529
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,599
words that has many different meanings

1530
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,280
for many different people

1531
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:56,559
but one way to think about

1532
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:59,839
what we're doing in quantum theory is

1533
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:03,839
merely labeling

1534
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:07,039
and we're labeling things for

1535
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:10,400
convenience with the full

1536
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:14,480
understanding that our labels

1537
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,720
in a sense don't have any physical

1538
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:19,118
meaning

1539
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:23,760
they they only have meaning

1540
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,680
in the context of particular

1541
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,400
observational outcomes

1542
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,640
that we've made by measuring things in a

1543
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,200
certain way

1544
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,280
but that in itself is a problematic

1545
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,400
statement right and this is

1546
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,079
this is in a sense the core of the

1547
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:42,000
copenhagen interpretation it's

1548
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,920
it's what bohr talked about in his

1549
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:49,039
paper in nature in 1928.

1550
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:51,359
uh he basically said at the end of the

1551
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:53,680
day

1552
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:57,359
we have to talk about apparatus and we

1553
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:58,559
have to talk about

1554
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:01,520
colleagues and we have to talk about

1555
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,480
classical communication

1556
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:07,359
and in a sense quantum theory tells us

1557
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:08,319
that

1558
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:11,760
all of that is um

1559
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,200
a poor approximation

1560
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,400
but it's the only language that we've

1561
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,720
got

1562
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:25,119
so uh i i think this this

1563
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:28,960
question of of how far can we go

1564
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,079
without uh reifying

1565
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:35,760
separation is a very good question

1566
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:41,839
and as usual my answer is i don't know

1567
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,760
awesome thanks for the response you have

1568
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:47,039
any thoughts yeah let's go

1569
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:50,319
oh yeah i wonder if i should um ask my

1570
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:50,720
two

1571
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,039
yeah category theory is really powerful

1572
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:54,640
and when chris says there's only one

1573
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,319
logic no no no he and i are trying to

1574
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:57,359
find another one

1575
01:04:57,359 --> 01:04:59,039
something called like a chromatic types

1576
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:00,160
and i was actually going to ask you

1577
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,440
chris if you think

1578
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,119
you know the phenomena of regeneration i

1579
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:04,640
think could actually be modeled by when

1580
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:05,839
we're trying to do that chromatic

1581
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:07,039
filtration

1582
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:09,280
right it seems like regeneration seems

1583
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,880
to be some kind of um

1584
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,960
morphism equivalent of when the stop

1585
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,880
mechanism is what does it mean to stop

1586
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,480
maybe that means stop means

1587
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,720
not making more morphisms and the two

1588
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,200
had a panera like actually has a two

1589
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,720
category structure

1590
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,400
right that has a one morphism and a two

1591
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,079
morphism and i think that's what's

1592
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:30,319
controlling the central nervous system

1593
01:05:30,319 --> 01:05:32,240
right that it if you can have two

1594
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:33,760
morphisms and you could have this double

1595
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:34,960
head kind of thing

1596
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:36,880
and so whatever the stop mechanism is i

1597
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,160
think it's almost like

1598
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:39,280
remember when i was showing you those

1599
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,359
filtrations how you could actually

1600
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:42,880
make more equivalences and more

1601
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,480
equivalences using that boost field

1602
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:46,000
localization

1603
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,920
so i think you know there's another one

1604
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,240
called the topological localization

1605
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,000
where the objects and the categories are

1606
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
reflections and that might be

1607
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,119
what might help um sar a little bit is

1608
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:57,599
that there's

1609
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:01,119
different categorical models for

1610
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:03,039
interaction anything interaction based

1611
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:05,280
should be immediately category here i

1612
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,559
think the tensor network step

1613
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:09,039
fails because like a node is just a

1614
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:09,680
point

1615
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:12,160
but in category theory you can add space

1616
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,440
to that point

1617
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:14,799
by making the point something else and

1618
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:16,160
then you're working in this modulized

1619
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:16,880
space

1620
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,799
so that was my thought that about like

1621
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:20,240
spawn and you know when you were talking

1622
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:21,760
about spontaneous thoughts whoever had

1623
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:22,720
the question about that

1624
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,880
i mean i also think that like our work

1625
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,880
on the pro finite condition chris could

1626
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,160
also account for like

1627
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,640
thought whatever that is right because

1628
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:31,280
um

1629
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,200
the thought doesn't really last right

1630
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,280
voice speech doesn't last the speech

1631
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:37,440
fades based on the composition of the

1632
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,280
molecules in the air but something

1633
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:40,960
remains i mean we all

1634
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,799
continue it seems to be that holographic

1635
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:44,960
copy of the pro finitely mini right in

1636
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,480
the diamonds and stuff

1637
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,799
so i just want so for syria you know i

1638
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:50,400
think a bunch of this category theory

1639
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,240
could really help you with uh

1640
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:55,440
you know uh you know it's like you have

1641
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:57,440
this object and topology called like a

1642
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,119
sheaf which is this very

1643
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:01,280
very complex structure but it attaches

1644
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,039
to a topological space and it's like a

1645
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,559
little bag and it keeps track of all the

1646
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:05,280
data

1647
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,319
you know and uh so if each space has

1648
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:09,920
these structures attached to it that

1649
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,359
keep track of what happens locally you

1650
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:13,119
can look at the modulized space and the

1651
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:15,680
isomorphism classes of those little bags

1652
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,440
so what's happening in the isomorphism

1653
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:18,720
space with the little bags probably

1654
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:19,359
seems to be

1655
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:22,000
what this like global consciousness

1656
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,119
things is

1657
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:25,839
so you can upgrade that one dimension

1658
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:27,599
using category theory you can work in a

1659
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:28,400
stack

1660
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,480
and a stack is going to be a sheath that

1661
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,720
doesn't take values in sets anymore

1662
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:34,160
all of quantum theory has taken place in

1663
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,520
sets and i think it needs to be a little

1664
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,200
bulldozed like it needs to go

1665
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:40,160
up if you can take values in categories

1666
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:40,640
then

1667
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,640
in each point you have so much more

1668
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,640
space to move around

1669
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,000
right so then if you actually have this

1670
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,760
object that takes values and categories

1671
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,359
and not in sets then you've

1672
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:52,640
allowed yourself more space so that you

1673
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:53,520
could have these

1674
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,599
phenomena like the the planera and stuff

1675
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:57,200
like that but if you're just working in

1676
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,319
like

1677
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:01,680
uh like points and like dots and like

1678
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,119
nodes connecting i think it's just not

1679
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:04,720
enough but you can do all these other

1680
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:05,119
things

1681
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:07,119
but um i'm not sure if i answered

1682
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:08,640
anything but yeah chris i think that

1683
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,079
regener i was going to ask if you

1684
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:10,640
thought would

1685
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,799
like our which we need to pick back up

1686
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:14,799
the chromatic you know our chromatic

1687
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:15,680
type over uh

1688
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,839
temporal logic if that could actually

1689
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:19,359
work with this

1690
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:21,040
i'm fascinated by the regeneration and

1691
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,279
the stop mechanism which is weird

1692
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:27,279
you know yeah i i'll just quote

1693
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:30,560
mike levin telling killing me

1694
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:32,319
over and over again and everyone else

1695
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:33,920
who will listen that the most important

1696
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,839
question of biology is when to stop

1697
01:08:36,839 --> 01:08:39,600
yes now how how how does

1698
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,158
how does the embryo know that it's done

1699
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:45,198
now i can stop i'm an adult

1700
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:48,158
no one knows and that the question even

1701
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:50,399
isn't even asked that way

1702
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:52,238
but when you think about it it becomes

1703
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:53,920
it is a key question

1704
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,359
because it's it's related when you said

1705
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:57,759
like uh our experiential

1706
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:00,799
phenomenon uh capacity is just

1707
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:02,880
this you know the the tip of the

1708
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,880
non-experience so it's almost like

1709
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,600
if the stop is the iceberg of everything

1710
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:08,880
else i'd like to see what's the

1711
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:09,679
everything else

1712
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:12,080
you know

1713
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:15,439
thanks for these points it's really an

1714
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:16,399
amazing

1715
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:19,120
mapping that is rigorous and something

1716
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,799
that we should be learning more about

1717
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:21,600
how the point

1718
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,120
can be just the tip of the iceberg kind

1719
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,719
of where it's piercing

1720
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:27,040
something that's a lower dimensionality

1721
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:27,920
and so

1722
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,759
what do we do with that so i'm going to

1723
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:31,920
go to a question from chat and then

1724
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,238
can i ask can i ask a second part of the

1725
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:35,520
question i was working with

1726
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:38,158
go for it it's this is and feel free to

1727
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:38,799
just be like

1728
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:41,359
eh it's not great just just move you

1729
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:43,359
know not answer it if it but i

1730
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:47,040
i can't help but analogize

1731
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:49,839
um something that i just yeah i cannot

1732
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:51,520
ever let go which is

1733
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,560
um in electrical engineering

1734
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,400
or in electronics essentially you know

1735
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,159
you have this

1736
01:09:58,159 --> 01:10:00,080
well in anything but i i really like

1737
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,760
electronics because it's very tangible

1738
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,280
you have the real component and the

1739
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,120
imaginary component of

1740
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,679
of of signal you know that goes across

1741
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:09,280
an interface and so i'm always really

1742
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,199
fascinated by that because it always

1743
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:14,000
seems like a really good analogy to this

1744
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,239
thing that we can look at through math

1745
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:17,520
or quantum mechanics but with

1746
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,040
electronics you actually have

1747
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,719
you know a thing that you can put on

1748
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:22,800
your desk um

1749
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,560
because you could think of this this

1750
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,640
this this phase change that happens at

1751
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:27,760
interfaces

1752
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:30,400
as the context and and so i've always

1753
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,120
been interested

1754
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:34,000
in in trying to look at that thing that

1755
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,560
gets lost without looking at the

1756
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,159
at the current or the voltage like

1757
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:40,159
measuring at a point but actually just

1758
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:42,000
keeping track of the context as things

1759
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,239
move across interfaces in a circuit

1760
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:46,480
it's not even a question i apologize for

1761
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,560
that but if it brings up any thoughts

1762
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:50,800
great

1763
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,840
either of you two if you'd like to give

1764
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,280
a thought otherwise

1765
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,120
it stands and i love how many ideas

1766
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,560
people are bringing up this will

1767
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,960
definitely be an episode for people to

1768
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:03,040
re-listen to and make some knowledge

1769
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,520
network stuff

1770
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,920
uh all i'll say is phase is extremely

1771
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,400
important

1772
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,640
this is important it's a very it's like

1773
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,000
phase according to whom

1774
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,760
so chris and i really torn apart this

1775
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,679
reference frame idea like according to

1776
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:18,080
whom

1777
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:19,760
at what point if phase was like

1778
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,280
non-local then everything would be the

1779
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,320
same thing

1780
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,239
but so what point do you actually have

1781
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:26,000
you know electronics you assume that you

1782
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:26,400
have a

1783
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:29,120
free that you're like local and stuff

1784
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:29,440
but

1785
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:31,280
um electronics are fascinating it's

1786
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,199
still like kind of tangible but if you

1787
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:34,159
work on that

1788
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:37,280
that space that's pre-actualization

1789
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:38,640
i think it's very just like for those

1790
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,560
presented it's very very difficult to

1791
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:41,199
say

1792
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:43,440
who you are what the boundary actually

1793
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,560
is and if the boundary

1794
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:46,880
um like a boundary in mathematics is

1795
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,800
like an asymptote or something right

1796
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,640
so it's like a horizon or a koshi

1797
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,239
horizon or something like that

1798
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:54,239
so inside that very notion of a boundary

1799
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:55,920
you already have

1800
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,840
causality and then this you know tensor

1801
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,120
product and there's all kinds of other

1802
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,960
tensor part there's wedge products and

1803
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,840
you know it's it's i think it's really

1804
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,920
hard to say what a phase is

1805
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:08,239
without bringing into play all these

1806
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:10,480
other reference frames that are um

1807
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:13,679
so fragile cool

1808
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:15,360
i'm going to do a question from the chat

1809
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:16,960
and then i have a simple question

1810
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:19,679
so a question from the chat is do you

1811
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:21,360
think a reformulation of quantum

1812
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:22,800
mechanics is necessary

1813
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,800
in order to tackle the problem of

1814
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,000
consciousness or life

1815
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,800
from a full mathematical generality i'm

1816
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,159
mainly thinking of the notion of

1817
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:31,679
intrinsic information from

1818
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:33,679
tishbe's paper information theory of

1819
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:34,960
decisions and actions

1820
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,960
but also maybe other approaches like

1821
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:39,280
self-organized criticality

1822
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,360
more generally i'm curious how necessary

1823
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:43,600
is it to bridge our understanding of

1824
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:46,080
thermodynamics information theory and

1825
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,920
biology or control theory

1826
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,920
to have a good understanding how far

1827
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,760
along are we and are there any concrete

1828
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:54,960
problems for a mathematician

1829
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:59,360
i read what they say you know that's

1830
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:00,560
that's an omnibus

1831
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:04,880
question i i guess my my first answer

1832
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:05,440
would be

1833
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:08,560
yes uh we do need to bridge all those

1834
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:10,960
all those disciplines uh in order to

1835
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,880
make progress

1836
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,159
um whether

1837
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:19,840
it will tell us something deep

1838
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:23,199
about what experience

1839
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:26,400
is in some ontological sense

1840
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:30,239
i have my doubts about uh

1841
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,320
whether it will tell us something

1842
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,159
interesting about

1843
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:37,760
what experience um

1844
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:40,960
in a sense does how it works

1845
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:43,280
uh i think it may tell us something very

1846
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:44,800
important about that

1847
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,440
but yes i i i do think that these

1848
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,239
disciplines

1849
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:51,679
need to be bridged i i think we're

1850
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:54,880
a bit of an impulse that's been imposed

1851
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:57,280
on us by the disciplinary structure of

1852
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:59,679
science

1853
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:02,000
thanks for the answer i'm gonna ask my

1854
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:02,960
simple question

1855
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:04,719
and then we're gonna go to stephen and

1856
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:06,560
blue and also sarah i know

1857
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:08,480
you had some other kinds of questions

1858
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:09,920
that were a little bit less about the

1859
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:10,800
math but

1860
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,040
here's my simple question where does

1861
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,000
active inference

1862
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,320
come into play or for those who are just

1863
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:18,080
learning about active inference and

1864
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,199
curious to

1865
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:20,880
how it might be the bridge for all these

1866
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,320
different areas

1867
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:24,480
um what do you think active inference is

1868
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,799
doing here

1869
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:30,000
well i as i said at the very beginning i

1870
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:30,320
i

1871
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:33,600
think of active inference in terms of

1872
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:34,480
this

1873
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:37,040
fundamental decision that that every

1874
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,920
system has to make all of the time

1875
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:43,120
between of

1876
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:48,320
do i explore do i act

1877
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:52,800
or do i retreat and

1878
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,440
and and try to do a kind of post-mortem

1879
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,239
on just

1880
01:14:56,239 --> 01:14:58,480
what just happened and learned something

1881
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:01,120
so do i modify my priors

1882
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:06,960
or do i try to modify my my experience

1883
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,840
and

1884
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:15,360
i think thinking of active inference in

1885
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,080
terms

1886
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,400
of

1887
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:25,120
what reference frames are being deployed

1888
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:28,080
it just allows us to pose that question

1889
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:28,800
a little bit

1890
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:32,560
differently it allows us to think of the

1891
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,239
question

1892
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:39,839
in the form of

1893
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,960
do i make another measurement do i act

1894
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,520
on the world

1895
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:50,080
or do i

1896
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:53,120
modify my reference frame

1897
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,440
right you can think of a reference frame

1898
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:57,120
uh like a category

1899
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:00,480
like a cognitive category so we have

1900
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:03,040
cognitive categories like this is a cat

1901
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,080
and that's a dog

1902
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,080
and this is a table and this is another

1903
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:08,480
person

1904
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:14,159
so modifying a reference frame

1905
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,960
can be thought of as going into your

1906
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,159
apparatus and

1907
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:20,480
changing the way it works you can also

1908
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:21,280
think of it as

1909
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:24,239
modifying my category modifying the

1910
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:28,000
things i'm capable of seeing

1911
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,159
and i i think you asked in the in the

1912
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:33,600
previous discussion last week

1913
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:37,520
what does the theory say about the

1914
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:40,880
the capabilities of organisms and or

1915
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,880
does it does it put a limit of what

1916
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:45,040
organisms can do

1917
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,480
and i think in a sense that's the

1918
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:49,760
question we're trying to answer

1919
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:53,120
to to what extent are

1920
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:57,360
you organisms have flexible capabilities

1921
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,679
to what extent can they retool their

1922
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:02,320
cognitive systems

1923
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,960
even if it's even if it's just e coli to

1924
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,560
what extent can

1925
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:09,760
can something like a microbial

1926
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:14,080
population retool what it's capable of

1927
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:16,400
and again biology gives us these

1928
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:17,679
beautiful examples

1929
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:19,520
in terms of things like lateral gene

1930
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:21,280
transfer where

1931
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:24,640
uh microbes in a community can pass

1932
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,400
around genes and so can

1933
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,800
can change very radically what they're

1934
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:31,120
capable of doing

1935
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:34,000
so i mean from an active inference point

1936
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,920
of view

1937
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:39,760
that's a question do i

1938
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:42,960
do i keep going with the capabilities

1939
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:44,960
that i've got or do i go shopping for

1940
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,920
some new dna

1941
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:52,000
cool it's like the active turn

1942
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,040
we don't know how far or what else what

1943
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,040
other stones are going to be turned

1944
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,120
when we actually start thinking and

1945
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,640
doing instead of

1946
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:03,840
just thinking about doing so we have

1947
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:07,840
stephen then blue then scott

1948
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:09,920
very excited to hear you talking about

1949
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:12,000
the work of my mike levin because

1950
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,040
his work's very uh when i saw the video

1951
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:17,760
of his work recently like last year was

1952
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:18,960
like wow

1953
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,640
it started to bring the whole idea of

1954
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,480
swarming and how swarming

1955
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,640
actually is underpinning a lot of what

1956
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,400
happens and the the

1957
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,239
the work with bioelectrics is really

1958
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:29,760
interesting and i

1959
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:32,400
i've been interested in how if that

1960
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:34,960
bioelectric aspect seems more maybe

1961
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:38,840
more closely tied to the sort of quantum

1962
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,480
transitions um

1963
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:43,440
and um just maybe a little clarity on a

1964
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:45,120
couple of things because often

1965
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:48,000
traditionally let's just ask the

1966
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,080
question and clarify it

1967
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:55,199
okay um so the question is um

1968
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:57,920
when you have these quantum effects you

1969
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,600
know normally they may be just you think

1970
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,360
of things flipping between one state and

1971
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,520
others another state in more sort of

1972
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:05,199
basic chemistry thinking about like

1973
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:07,600
energy levels or something like that but

1974
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,000
you have many levels potentially so is

1975
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,840
it a case that

1976
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:15,440
you're able to still infer

1977
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:19,040
from the noise what's going on with

1978
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,040
quantum states

1979
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:23,600
and therefore this gives us a way to not

1980
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:24,719
have to just

1981
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:26,640
go for like the attractor theory and

1982
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,199
complexity or catastrophe theory or

1983
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:30,719
phase theory that we use at the moment

1984
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:32,560
but you're able to still

1985
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:36,560
extract quantum state information

1986
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:38,960
in ways that's not just classical like

1987
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:40,719
one energy level to another energy level

1988
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:42,719
but you get this more

1989
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:47,920
higher information context

1990
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,719
yeah good question i i think what you're

1991
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:51,840
really asking is

1992
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:55,120
uh where are the experimental tools that

1993
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:56,640
let us

1994
01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:00,719
uh probe this domain

1995
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:04,000
and um i wish

1996
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,440
i knew and this is something that mike

1997
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:10,880
and i talk about for example

1998
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:15,600
how could we go about looking for

1999
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:20,400
contextuality effects for example in

2000
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:24,320
things like bioelectric effects and worm

2001
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:27,120
regeneration

2002
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:31,120
and i don't know i think i think there's

2003
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:34,400
a huge opportunity space here for

2004
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:37,760
for people to think about uh

2005
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:40,639
ways of doing experiments that we can't

2006
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:42,560
experiments that we can't do now

2007
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,560
or have never thought about being able

2008
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,239
to do

2009
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:48,559
that

2010
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:53,440
probe a domain of correlation

2011
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:57,360
that is non-classical or super

2012
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:58,800
determined or however

2013
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:02,480
however you want to think about it

2014
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:04,960
and i think that the the more we can

2015
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,880
think of biological systems in

2016
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:10,320
in communication theoretic

2017
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:13,600
terms the better prepared will be

2018
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:18,080
to design experiments to look for

2019
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:21,360
what are really communication theoretic

2020
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:24,000
effects and quantum theory is really

2021
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,320
about

2022
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:29,840
communication

2023
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:35,360
thank you cool blue and then scott

2024
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:38,159
so first because shanna dropped off i

2025
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:39,520
don't know if she's gone or if she's

2026
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:40,880
gonna rejoin and it's kind of a

2027
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:42,560
follow-up to some of the stuff that she

2028
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:43,040
was

2029
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:45,040
saying but i can still ask it um but let

2030
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:46,080
me pass to

2031
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:47,840
scott and then i'll go we'll we'll go to

2032
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,440
scott and hopefully um

2033
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,679
we can have some future category streams

2034
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:53,040
to really learn more about

2035
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:56,000
this area so yeah scott and then back

2036
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:56,880
split

2037
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:00,719
great um thank you this is my

2038
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:02,719
smile is hurting my face it's so such a

2039
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:03,760
great discussion

2040
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,360
um the two things i want to talk about

2041
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:07,199
embodiment and this is

2042
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:08,880
related and one is social level

2043
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,400
experiments so

2044
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,480
the first one is embodiment it seems

2045
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:14,800
like we have these internal states or

2046
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:15,760
embodiments of

2047
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:18,320
prior external states or their learned

2048
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:19,360
states

2049
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:20,639
and so it's kind of interesting because

2050
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:21,920
the external states in the internal

2051
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:22,880
states have bearish

2052
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,040
significant relationship through time

2053
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:26,480
not just through that individual

2054
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:28,480
organism's markov blanket but by the

2055
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,440
inherited

2056
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:31,760
and other factors that are become the

2057
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:32,719
priors

2058
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:34,400
right and so it's kind of interesting

2059
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,679
because they have embodiment externally

2060
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:36,560
and internally

2061
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,400
maybe that's extremely fluid right

2062
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,520
because if you talk about systems at

2063
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:40,800
different levels they're different

2064
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,719
types of systems cell systems social

2065
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:45,040
systems organisms organizations

2066
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:48,080
they all have different affordances and

2067
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:50,400
their embodiments are not necessarily

2068
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:51,600
they can be um

2069
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,440
they're not necessarily inconsistent

2070
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:54,880
when they're different right you can

2071
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:56,480
have an embodiment of something

2072
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,719
uh if i eat a lot of fatty food i become

2073
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:00,239
fat but that doesn't you know

2074
01:23:00,239 --> 01:23:01,520
anyway that's one thing is the

2075
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:02,800
embodiment if you talk a little bit

2076
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:03,840
about that

2077
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,920
for me from my perspective if you're

2078
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:07,920
looking at risk and change when you

2079
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:09,520
information being shifted around as a

2080
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,040
lawyer ex-lawyer i look at

2081
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:14,320
risk and risk being moved around and so

2082
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:15,679
one of the things that seems to me when

2083
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:17,360
you have the embodiment question

2084
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:19,199
is that among the relationships then you

2085
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:20,800
get the question since entropy or

2086
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,000
disorder is going to increase

2087
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,440
universally

2088
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:26,800
what we're doing is we're um managing

2089
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:29,760
local meg entropy in these systems right

2090
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:30,639
we're

2091
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:34,080
sharing uh local entropy and so the

2092
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,280
question is

2093
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:38,480
is that dynamic something that um tends

2094
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:39,440
to dissipate

2095
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:42,159
the markov blanket as a standalone thing

2096
01:23:42,159 --> 01:23:43,840
maybe markov blankets

2097
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:45,840
are a general thing that's one question

2098
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:47,360
okay let's get that

2099
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:48,719
let's try to do one question because

2100
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:50,560
it's really you know in a

2101
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:52,000
body domain let's just try to yeah

2102
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,840
thanks for the really great question

2103
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:58,880
go ahead yes okay um

2104
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,760
this is a wonderful question i'll make

2105
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,880
uh two comments

2106
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:09,760
one is in terms of of reference frames

2107
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:13,600
which i always come back to um

2108
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:16,000
i think what what what quantum theory

2109
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,199
contributed to the

2110
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:20,320
to the notion of a reference frame is

2111
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:23,520
it insisted that we regard reference

2112
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:24,239
frames as

2113
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:27,679
embodied as physically implemented

2114
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:30,719
and stop thinking of them as merely

2115
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:33,040
abstractions

2116
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:36,080
and we can we can go back for example to

2117
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:37,840
the idea of

2118
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:40,880
cognitive categories you know my

2119
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:44,080
my idea of a table is

2120
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:47,120
not an abstraction it's a

2121
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:49,360
it's something that's implemented in my

2122
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:51,679
brain

2123
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,040
and it can be changed

2124
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:58,639
by operating on my brain

2125
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:00,800
and i can change it that way we don't

2126
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,719
know how that works

2127
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:06,400
right but but what the

2128
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:09,280
what the the embodied movement or the

2129
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:10,159
the 4e

2130
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:12,880
framework whatever what that forces

2131
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,560
cognitive science to think

2132
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,080
to think about is these are not

2133
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:18,719
abstractions we're talking about things

2134
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:20,320
that have been implemented

2135
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,639
so i think that's an incredibly

2136
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:25,040
important point

2137
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:27,760
um the second point i want to make is

2138
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:28,239
about

2139
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:30,960
boundaries and i showed that picture of

2140
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:31,679
of

2141
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:35,760
uh right alice looking at her at her

2142
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,840
holographic screen and listed the things

2143
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:41,600
that she doesn't know

2144
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:44,080
but i could have added to that that

2145
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:45,600
alice doesn't know

2146
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:48,960
where her boundary is

2147
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:53,679
if if i'm a system

2148
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:55,920
and i'm i'm looking out at the world

2149
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:58,800
through my markov blanket or through my

2150
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:02,159
my encoded screen then

2151
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:04,480
what i'm seeing is this array of

2152
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:07,679
information that's painted on my screen

2153
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:10,880
right this array of bits

2154
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:12,960
and and fristen's point and the point of

2155
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,560
the holographic principle is

2156
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:18,560
i don't see what's on the other side

2157
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:20,960
but you can flip that around it's always

2158
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:23,280
symmetrical i don't see what's on my

2159
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:23,840
side

2160
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:26,880
either and

2161
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:29,120
that's that's why i tried to make this

2162
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,400
point very briefly about

2163
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:33,199
memory how if we think of memory as

2164
01:26:33,199 --> 01:26:34,560
classical

2165
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:36,159
then it's got to be written on the

2166
01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:38,800
screen because that's the only focus of

2167
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:41,360
any classical information

2168
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:44,480
so if i'm looking at my screen the thing

2169
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:44,960
that i

2170
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:48,400
don't see is myself

2171
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:51,520
and since i don't see myself and i don't

2172
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:54,000
see the other side i just see the screen

2173
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,520
i have no idea where it is

2174
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:00,880
so when you when you raise this question

2175
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:03,040
of

2176
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:06,800
a social system or or any other kind of

2177
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,639
complex system

2178
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:12,639
um we as as

2179
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:15,760
observers of that system are using

2180
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:18,639
our reference frames or our cognitive

2181
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:19,679
categories or

2182
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:22,159
our however you want to describe them to

2183
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:26,080
draw a boundary around that thing

2184
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:30,080
that boundary is our imposition

2185
01:27:30,159 --> 01:27:32,960
it's not the system's imposition the

2186
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:34,719
system doesn't know where its boundary

2187
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:36,880
is

2188
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:41,600
is there a talk is there a tautology in

2189
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,040
there though because that's

2190
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:44,480
interesting right because we're using

2191
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:46,320
our system we're drawing the system

2192
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:46,719
within

2193
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:49,920
our boundary it seems like that's an

2194
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,760
intrinsic quality of the thing that

2195
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:52,639
system can

2196
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:54,000
can a system know it's open kind of

2197
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,440
system know others and you can only know

2198
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:56,880
it through the boundary

2199
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:58,159
but you so you can't know yourself

2200
01:27:58,159 --> 01:27:58,960
because you're not written on the

2201
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,880
boundary so it's kind of it

2202
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:02,239
well let me let me get to the next

2203
01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:03,679
question because it relates to that so

2204
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:04,880
the next question

2205
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,560
but the quick answer to that question is

2206
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:09,120
yes yeah

2207
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:10,880
i like that's a good question it's good

2208
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,800
when there's a binary answer

2209
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:15,840
so the next question was i was

2210
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:19,280
wondering if we can um if the

2211
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:20,960
for experimentation this is the question

2212
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:23,040
of answering experimentation

2213
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,800
if and to the extent that this is

2214
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,400
there's scale independence and active

2215
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:28,239
inference and so that it applies at cell

2216
01:28:28,239 --> 01:28:29,199
levels and social

2217
01:28:29,199 --> 01:28:32,320
etc why can't we look at the social

2218
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:34,639
level to run experiments

2219
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:37,040
and then apply those what we come out

2220
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:37,920
with at

2221
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:40,480
other levels so it's similar to when you

2222
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,159
do a qubit at a macro you know they do

2223
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:42,800
cubit

2224
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,320
qubits that are manifested in different

2225
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:46,239
ways in different kinds of systems you

2226
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:47,679
know ionic qubits and things like that

2227
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:48,560
so you can measure them in different

2228
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:49,760
ways

2229
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:52,480
so we could be observers of the system

2230
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:52,800
to

2231
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:55,920
at the social level to identify some

2232
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,280
qualities and the reason i'm asserting

2233
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:58,800
that as a lawyer

2234
01:28:58,800 --> 01:28:59,920
even though the social has a lot of

2235
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:02,239
variables what we do is as lawyers is

2236
01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:03,040
create

2237
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:04,960
fewer variables right we take a meaning

2238
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:06,159
thing we say hey

2239
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:08,639
everyone in this area of the statute has

2240
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:10,320
to behave this way

2241
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:12,560
and so then internally everyone can

2242
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:14,800
absorb and embody the idea that

2243
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,480
i know everyone's going to stop at a red

2244
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:18,960
light i know i'm going to stop at a red

2245
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:19,440
light

2246
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,760
that's the story of the red light red

2247
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:23,520
means stop you're taught it as a kid

2248
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,600
so it becomes instantiated and kind of

2249
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:26,719
axiomatic

2250
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:28,800
so one of the things about the law is

2251
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,239
that i'm going at it from a slightly

2252
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:32,000
different way of

2253
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,320
effectively going in and trying to

2254
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:35,639
create

2255
01:29:35,639 --> 01:29:37,840
non-variables in the markov blanket that

2256
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:38,960
are shared

2257
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:41,040
right and so and then so i wonder about

2258
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,000
the embodiment

2259
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,159
relates in a way i think to the

2260
01:29:44,159 --> 01:29:45,840
experimentation question

2261
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,840
because can we do let's call them

2262
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,360
artificial embodiments

2263
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:52,480
into the internal states through things

2264
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,639
like law or folkways or shared meaning

2265
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:56,560
or norms or things like that

2266
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:58,800
that we can then experiment against is

2267
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,159
what i'm wanting cross-cultural

2268
01:30:00,159 --> 01:30:01,440
experiments things like that

2269
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:04,840
that then may have application at other

2270
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:06,239
levels

2271
01:30:06,239 --> 01:30:08,320
i i think that's i think that's a

2272
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:11,120
fascinating thing to try to follow up on

2273
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:14,400
and um

2274
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,560
i would say one of my one of the things

2275
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:19,360
that seems most mysterious to me

2276
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:23,120
is language is is the very possibility

2277
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:25,040
of classical communication of what

2278
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:27,440
what you're talking about a physicist

2279
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:30,480
would call super determinism

2280
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:34,799
and super determinism

2281
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:37,360
is essentially the same thing as

2282
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:40,080
entanglement

2283
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:44,719
if if i don't have a choice

2284
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:49,120
about what reference frames to deploy

2285
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:51,920
if there's a correlation in advance

2286
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:54,080
super determined

2287
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:57,120
uh by the past between the reference

2288
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,960
frames i use and the reference frames

2289
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,320
you use

2290
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:03,360
then and in an important sense we're not

2291
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,600
independent systems anymore

2292
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:08,080
right we're we're entangled but that's

2293
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:08,960
what language

2294
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:12,320
is in

2295
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:16,239
in some sense and so

2296
01:31:16,239 --> 01:31:19,440
i i i agree with you we should be able

2297
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:20,760
to

2298
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:23,760
redescribe

2299
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:27,280
communication generally in these terms

2300
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:30,480
of of

2301
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:32,639
reference frame sharing reference rank

2302
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:34,719
choice of

2303
01:31:34,719 --> 01:31:37,920
super determinism

2304
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:41,280
and apply some of this math that's been

2305
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:42,800
worked out in other places

2306
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:46,239
to reinterpret communication

2307
01:31:46,239 --> 01:31:49,840
and i i'll mention a paper by a guy

2308
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:50,239
named

2309
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:52,880
alexi grinbaum it's a philosopher of

2310
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:55,840
science at saclay

2311
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:59,199
and it's a paper on uh device

2312
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:00,800
independent methods in quantum

2313
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:02,159
communication

2314
01:32:02,159 --> 01:32:05,360
but the very last i see

2315
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:07,120
sarah you're nodding your head you

2316
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:10,159
probably read this paper

2317
01:32:10,159 --> 01:32:11,679
one of the very last sentences in the

2318
01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:13,760
paper is

2319
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:15,920
he says this redefines what physics is

2320
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:17,440
about physics is about

2321
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:21,280
languages and i think that's

2322
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:23,600
a phenomenally profound statement i

2323
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:27,360
think he's right

2324
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:30,960
nice let's continue in order so we got

2325
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:35,679
blue and then stephen and then sarah

2326
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,600
so shanna's not here i think she said in

2327
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:41,360
the chat that she um had to run

2328
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:43,920
but um i want to touch back on what she

2329
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:44,960
said like when

2330
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:47,360
a thought passes that there's still

2331
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,360
something there and also chris to what

2332
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:50,960
you were saying earlier about

2333
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:54,080
memory and what uh sarah was saying

2334
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:56,480
of keeping track of what gets lost and

2335
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:58,400
so something that i gleaned from this

2336
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:00,239
paper now i have like no background

2337
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:03,360
in category theory at all um as you may

2338
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:03,920
have

2339
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:05,280
been able to tell from the introduction

2340
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:07,360
video right so um

2341
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:10,239
the so it seems like that there's this

2342
01:33:10,239 --> 01:33:12,239
hierarchical nature of

2343
01:33:12,239 --> 01:33:15,280
some mathematical summation that is like

2344
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:18,400
able to occur like via these methods and

2345
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:20,159
i just was wondering if you're familiar

2346
01:33:20,159 --> 01:33:20,480
with

2347
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:22,960
eric cole's work um he put out a paper

2348
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:24,800
last year on causal geometry

2349
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:27,600
and um like he's done some coarse

2350
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:28,560
graining stuff

2351
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:32,000
and so so is there some relationship

2352
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,840
between like that kind of coarse

2353
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:35,040
graining or

2354
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:37,280
like dimension reduction and this

2355
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:39,280
category theory work or is the category

2356
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:39,920
theory

2357
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:43,040
somehow able to encompass um the

2358
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:45,360
entirety of the mathematical problem

2359
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:47,679
in a better way or a different way than

2360
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:50,239
say core screening

2361
01:33:50,239 --> 01:33:54,159
um yeah good good question

2362
01:33:54,159 --> 01:33:58,639
um uh yes i i do know eric's work

2363
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:01,840
and i talk to him almost every week

2364
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:04,320
because he's also part of

2365
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:08,480
mike levin's lab and

2366
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:12,639
so we have discussed this question of

2367
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:14,880
of

2368
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:20,000
course graining and causal emergence

2369
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,159
and effective information all these

2370
01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:23,280
concepts that

2371
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:26,800
that eric has been working with

2372
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:31,280
um i think are very closely related to

2373
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:33,440
the concepts that jim and i have been

2374
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:35,280
working with

2375
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:38,320
and we're

2376
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:42,719
we're coming at them from such different

2377
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:46,080
starting points that it's not clear

2378
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:49,199
at least to me exactly how they fit

2379
01:34:49,199 --> 01:34:51,678
together

2380
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:54,639
but what a what a coconut diagram does

2381
01:34:54,639 --> 01:34:57,360
is coarse-grain

2382
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:01,840
it

2383
01:35:03,119 --> 01:35:06,159
it represents a

2384
01:35:06,159 --> 01:35:09,199
an abstraction

2385
01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:12,400
of a set of logical relationships

2386
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:16,719
or or it represents a an abstractions of

2387
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:20,000
a set of criteria into

2388
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,679
a coarse-grained

2389
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:26,840
larger scale if you will uh

2390
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:30,639
criterion that

2391
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:34,239
covers all of the cases below it

2392
01:35:34,239 --> 01:35:37,760
but in which information

2393
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:41,280
is both lost and gained

2394
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:44,320
i i think the the

2395
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:46,719
the best example at least for me for

2396
01:35:46,719 --> 01:35:48,960
thinking about it is again going back to

2397
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:51,520
cognitive categories if you think about

2398
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:53,679
you know your category for a table or

2399
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:56,800
another person or whatever

2400
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:59,280
you you lose information in that

2401
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:01,920
abstraction process

2402
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:06,239
but you also gain information

2403
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:10,000
by tying all of those exemplars

2404
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:14,239
together and

2405
01:36:14,239 --> 01:36:17,520
each exemplar is then

2406
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:20,000
in some sense encoding through the rest

2407
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,560
of the network

2408
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:26,639
of its consistency

2409
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:29,679
in some sense with other exemplars that

2410
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:30,320
may have

2411
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:33,840
different uh detailed characteristics

2412
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:35,440
so at the token level they look

2413
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:37,360
inconsistent but at the tight level

2414
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:39,440
they're consistent

2415
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:43,040
and the

2416
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:47,360
um the coco diagram represents

2417
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:53,679
that that very complex relationship

2418
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:58,239
so when

2419
01:36:58,239 --> 01:37:01,440
one is doing a course grading and it

2420
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,919
works

2421
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:07,520
the the information in the course grain

2422
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:08,080
state

2423
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:12,000
is capturing just this kind of abstract

2424
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:12,960
information

2425
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,360
it's the it's the abstract information

2426
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:18,080
that's actually useful

2427
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:20,960
and that captures what is consistent

2428
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,320
between the

2429
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:27,040
the fine-grained exemplars

2430
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:31,199
and by organizing them that way it

2431
01:37:31,199 --> 01:37:34,800
allows each of them to represent

2432
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:37,360
the fact of its consistency with this

2433
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:40,159
larger set

2434
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:45,520
thanks i also like i'm curious to see

2435
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:46,960
because i do think that it's gonna

2436
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:48,800
like you guys are we'll lock together

2437
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,400
eventually at some point

2438
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:52,639
um you know maybe in 10 years but but

2439
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:53,920
i'm curious to see how that

2440
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:56,400
um you know kind of dynamic interplay

2441
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,719
unfolds

2442
01:37:58,719 --> 01:38:02,560
will also lie also um mike living will

2443
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:02,880
be

2444
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:05,040
on active inference live stream on july

2445
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:05,920
13th

2446
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:09,440
so we can talk before then or after then

2447
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:11,199
all right awesome so we have um a little

2448
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:12,880
bit less than 20 minutes

2449
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:15,040
left so we'll just do you know questions

2450
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:16,639
and try to get a few more questions in

2451
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:17,840
from the chat as well

2452
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:21,199
stephen and then sarah

2453
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:23,679
thank you yeah deep breath there's a lot

2454
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:25,040
a lot to

2455
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:27,280
go through here um i was gonna sort of

2456
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:28,719
build on that coarse grain

2457
01:38:28,719 --> 01:38:30,960
question and maybe just stepping back at

2458
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:32,679
some of the bigger implications of

2459
01:38:32,679 --> 01:38:34,320
contextuality

2460
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:37,600
um and how that is thought about so

2461
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:39,600
um you know the principles that you

2462
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:41,760
talked about or the paradigms

2463
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:45,600
um so i'm curious about how you see this

2464
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:48,719
maybe impacting contextuality

2465
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:50,880
um and the way people think about that

2466
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:52,960
um

2467
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:54,480
let's address that and then continue

2468
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:55,920
stephen let's just get one question and

2469
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:56,880
one answer

2470
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:59,199
okay

2471
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:03,600
okay i guess i didn't i didn't actually

2472
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:05,520
hear that as a question

2473
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:08,800
sorry guys okay thank you sorry

2474
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:10,639
yeah i just i just finished that thought

2475
01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:12,800
but basically

2476
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:15,360
just in terms of contextuality and

2477
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:16,400
coarse graining

2478
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:18,719
and you know how much granularity is

2479
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:20,000
thought about

2480
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:23,040
um and how that has a bigger

2481
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:24,719
that that general idea of how to think

2482
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:26,960
about contextuality

2483
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:29,199
um i'd be interested in your thought

2484
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:30,639
about that as how that

2485
01:39:30,639 --> 01:39:33,360
sort of has a bigger set of legs and one

2486
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:34,560
of the reasons i say that is because

2487
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:36,000
when people often talk about quantum

2488
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,119
theory

2489
01:39:37,119 --> 01:39:40,239
in a sort of broader world out there

2490
01:39:40,239 --> 01:39:41,560
they often think about this

2491
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:42,800
transpersonal

2492
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:45,040
it's all the same and it's unifying and

2493
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:47,360
it's actually decontextualizing in some

2494
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:49,119
ways you know it's almost

2495
01:39:49,119 --> 01:39:52,400
some ways this is quite revolutionary to

2496
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:54,400
me to really see quantum

2497
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:58,080
effects as being contextual you know

2498
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:01,119
being in that way so you know that maybe

2499
01:40:01,119 --> 01:40:03,119
ties in with david bowman's work

2500
01:40:03,119 --> 01:40:06,639
on implicit order and the awareness

2501
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:08,239
of things so rather than always being

2502
01:40:08,239 --> 01:40:10,320
about the whatness and going up

2503
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:11,840
indigenous approaches are very much

2504
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:14,320
about where you are and how you are

2505
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:17,280
what's your embeddedness in your niche

2506
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,080
so

2507
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:20,639
in some ways it's like quantitative now

2508
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:22,080
when i first heard about your paper i

2509
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:23,440
was thinking oh this is

2510
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:25,520
you hear quantum you think abstract but

2511
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:27,040
actually

2512
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:28,639
it's doing something very different i

2513
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:31,199
just wondered how that might have impact

2514
01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:34,840
in other practices okay

2515
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:38,320
so so i i heard a number of different

2516
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:39,440
ideas here

2517
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:43,840
that that are are parts of questions

2518
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:46,400
one is to do with with course training

2519
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:48,320
and contextuality

2520
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:52,080
and you put your finger very precisely

2521
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:55,440
on the danger of course grading

2522
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:57,678
uh

2523
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:01,920
and this this you can also state this in

2524
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:05,199
terms of the frame problem

2525
01:41:05,199 --> 01:41:07,840
it's it's often the little details that

2526
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:10,480
come back to bite you

2527
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:12,320
and when you coarse grain you're

2528
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:14,400
specifically getting rid of those little

2529
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:16,960
details

2530
01:41:17,119 --> 01:41:20,559
so this is uh

2531
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:24,719
goodness it it it's like the the

2532
01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:27,040
metaphor of the hammer and the nail

2533
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:30,560
right if

2534
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:32,320
any choice of reference frame is

2535
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:35,600
effectively a choice of course grading

2536
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:37,920
and choosing a reference frame choosing

2537
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:40,000
a course greeting determines what you

2538
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,480
can see

2539
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:44,840
but that also determines what you can't

2540
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:46,960
see

2541
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:50,639
and it's what you can't see

2542
01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:53,040
that is responsible for the contextual

2543
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:54,080
effects

2544
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:57,840
that you can't avoid by

2545
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:01,520
by by you know um

2546
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:04,400
learning more about the context if

2547
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:06,000
you've if you've arranged your

2548
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,920
measurement procedures in a way that

2549
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:11,199
prevents you from seeing them

2550
01:42:11,199 --> 01:42:12,880
then you can never take them into

2551
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:14,080
account when you're building your

2552
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:16,560
probability distribution

2553
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:19,679
so so coarse graining

2554
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:22,960
is something that we're stuck with

2555
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:26,400
but it's it's very much a double-edged

2556
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:27,360
sword

2557
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:30,080
right it allows us to get around in the

2558
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:31,920
world it allows us to see these

2559
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:34,159
similarities

2560
01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:37,280
it allows us to learn things but

2561
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:40,639
it forces us to ignore things that

2562
01:42:40,639 --> 01:42:43,280
may turn out to be important or may turn

2563
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:44,320
out to have been

2564
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:46,880
important

2565
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:51,600
thanks for the really interesting answer

2566
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:53,119
there

2567
01:42:53,119 --> 01:42:56,320
um so so with respect to you

2568
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:59,040
to your other question about if you will

2569
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:00,880
embeddedness

2570
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:02,800
uh yes i think that's crucially

2571
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:05,119
important

2572
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:10,800
um let's go to sarah

2573
01:43:11,199 --> 01:43:12,800
i'm just going to say yeah that that

2574
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:14,400
that whole embeddedness

2575
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:18,719
is huge for the inactive ecological

2576
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:22,080
cognition work and sort of the

2577
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:26,400
the pragmatic turn in psychology so

2578
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:28,880
there's a lot of implications of that so

2579
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:29,840
i just

2580
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:32,400
think that's very exciting so thanks

2581
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:32,880
yeah

2582
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:35,520
yeah i i'm very attracted to this sort

2583
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:36,000
of

2584
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:40,000
notion that ecosystems are

2585
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,600
are in a sense extended organisms etc

2586
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:46,159
that whole way of thinking in biology

2587
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:49,280
is i think very important

2588
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:52,239
and also to connect that it's like

2589
01:43:52,239 --> 01:43:54,239
there's this embedded practice and then

2590
01:43:54,239 --> 01:43:55,440
we're talking about the physical

2591
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:57,040
electronic circuits

2592
01:43:57,040 --> 01:43:59,840
so it's almost like across domains we're

2593
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:00,440
taking an

2594
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:04,159
action-oriented and a realist manifested

2595
01:44:04,159 --> 01:44:05,840
focus but then seeing the what is

2596
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:07,840
actually manifest as the tip of the

2597
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:08,400
iceberg

2598
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:10,719
in another sense but it's totally real

2599
01:44:10,719 --> 01:44:11,920
for what it really is

2600
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:13,840
which is our measurement and then also

2601
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:15,440
it's the tip of an iceberg because we're

2602
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:16,880
also in the system and

2603
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:18,639
those kinds of systems don't just arise

2604
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:20,080
out of nowhere so

2605
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:22,719
sarah and then scott in our last couple

2606
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:23,440
of minutes

2607
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:24,960
but thanks everyone for this really

2608
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:26,719
awesome discussion

2609
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:29,840
maybe sarah yeah good god

2610
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:33,040
yeah um so am i to understand that we

2611
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:34,400
have another one of these because i i

2612
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:35,520
would love to ask chris

2613
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:36,800
you know these other questions but

2614
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:38,080
obviously not now there's just not

2615
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:39,360
enough time

2616
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:41,600
we will be discussing the paper next

2617
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:43,520
week but um we did not plan without

2618
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,000
totally

2619
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,320
no pressure but we're doing the same

2620
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:48,239
time next week but

2621
01:44:48,239 --> 01:44:52,239
no expectation okay no prior okay um

2622
01:44:52,239 --> 01:44:54,480
yeah in some ways this is like a media

2623
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:56,719
um just rephrasing what's already been

2624
01:44:56,719 --> 01:44:58,400
said but it's actually right up right up

2625
01:44:58,400 --> 01:44:59,679
your alley steven

2626
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:03,520
um i was actually just in writing in my

2627
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:05,600
paper you know about well

2628
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:07,440
what methods you choose depend on what

2629
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:09,520
met what questions you ask

2630
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:12,080
um related to reductionism related to

2631
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:13,199
this whole theme

2632
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:16,560
um but i i wonder this is like super

2633
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:18,080
abstract

2634
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:21,920
um but like i wonder about

2635
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:25,520
the the role of play because i was

2636
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:27,119
thinking about you know like

2637
01:45:27,119 --> 01:45:30,400
i was thinking about um there's so many

2638
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:32,000
situations in science where you're not

2639
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:32,800
you know like

2640
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:34,320
when you look at the paper you're like

2641
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:36,000
oh yeah they're doing science but in

2642
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,040
reality they're just

2643
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:40,400
poking at right like so it's just

2644
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:42,239
this way of being with the world where

2645
01:45:42,239 --> 01:45:44,080
you're like oh i wonder what happens if

2646
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:45,199
i you know but they're not really

2647
01:45:45,199 --> 01:45:46,159
reducing

2648
01:45:46,159 --> 01:45:48,960
they're just it's like so it's like play

2649
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:50,639
and so i've really wondered about

2650
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:53,280
about how to bring that to the

2651
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:55,360
foreground about what that what that is

2652
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:56,239
in science

2653
01:45:56,239 --> 01:45:59,440
you know and so i again i apologize but

2654
01:45:59,440 --> 01:45:59,840
you're

2655
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:01,600
you always have a way of coming up with

2656
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:03,119
a comment so hopefully you'll have a

2657
01:46:03,119 --> 01:46:05,679
thought on this

2658
01:46:07,170 --> 01:46:10,080
[Music]

2659
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:13,840
oh yeah

2660
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:17,679
if it's not fun you're probably doing it

2661
01:46:17,679 --> 01:46:20,000
wrong

2662
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:24,159
i was just thinking of like an antidote

2663
01:46:24,159 --> 01:46:26,239
to reductionism like play seems like a

2664
01:46:26,239 --> 01:46:27,360
way that you're not

2665
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:30,000
taking things apart you're just kind of

2666
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:30,960
you're with it

2667
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:33,600
in some way

2668
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:37,360
well i to take this back to active

2669
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:38,880
inference and to

2670
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:42,560
to think of it uh

2671
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:46,080
almost in in robotics terms right

2672
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:48,719
how what the people in robotic and

2673
01:46:48,719 --> 01:46:50,320
developmental robotics are

2674
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:54,159
are trying to do is understand

2675
01:46:54,159 --> 01:46:58,000
what motivates a system

2676
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,239
to

2677
01:47:01,119 --> 01:47:03,920
engage with the world with this kind of

2678
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:05,840
innocence that i think you're referring

2679
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:06,960
to

2680
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:10,159
to to just explore and

2681
01:47:10,159 --> 01:47:13,440
and see what's learnable

2682
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:17,199
right the uh one of the one of the key

2683
01:47:17,199 --> 01:47:18,159
questions is

2684
01:47:18,159 --> 01:47:22,480
is um

2685
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:25,040
and pierre etier is is the one who i

2686
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:26,400
think in the literature has

2687
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:30,639
emphasized this more than anyone else is

2688
01:47:30,639 --> 01:47:33,920
how do how do you learn what

2689
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:37,760
parts of the world are learnable

2690
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:41,760
with the resources that you have

2691
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:44,320
so that you can avoid spending all of

2692
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:45,920
your resources

2693
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:48,000
trying to learn things that you're not

2694
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,320
capable of learning

2695
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:52,320
so how do you how do you how do you

2696
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:55,679
focus your exploratory behavior

2697
01:47:55,679 --> 01:47:57,440
in the parts of the world where it can

2698
01:47:57,440 --> 01:48:00,320
actually be productive

2699
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:02,320
this is sort of a meta question on top

2700
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:03,520
of active inference

2701
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:06,000
and it has to do with bayesian precision

2702
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,560
and things like that

2703
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:11,280
but it's your expectations about

2704
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:13,119
learnability

2705
01:48:13,119 --> 01:48:15,440
and then there's a flip side of this in

2706
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:17,440
evolutionary theory right the whole

2707
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:20,639
idea that that what organisms are doing

2708
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:22,080
in evolution

2709
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:26,719
is trying to improve their evolvability

2710
01:48:26,719 --> 01:48:29,440
uh so they're they're they're trying to

2711
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:31,600
increase if you will the flexibility of

2712
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:32,880
their lineage

2713
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:35,440
to cope with with whatever the

2714
01:48:35,440 --> 01:48:37,280
environment can throw at them

2715
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:40,639
and this is very much i think what

2716
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:43,440
what's happening in play as you put it

2717
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:43,840
you're

2718
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:45,600
you're trying to to engage with the

2719
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:47,760
world in a way that

2720
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:50,880
is wanting to know

2721
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:52,880
what the possibilities for further

2722
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:55,920
engagement are

2723
01:48:57,760 --> 01:48:59,679
thanks for the answer and speaking to

2724
01:48:59,679 --> 01:49:01,199
play it's almost like you start with

2725
01:49:01,199 --> 01:49:02,639
what you have the rubber band

2726
01:49:02,639 --> 01:49:04,000
the tin foil so you start with the

2727
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
actual but then you you think about what

2728
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:06,320
if

2729
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:08,000
and you think about adjacencies even

2730
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,480
categorical adjacencies

2731
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:14,159
um so that was a pretty interesting

2732
01:49:14,159 --> 01:49:15,760
so and then also a comment on what you

2733
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:17,119
said about the expectations of

2734
01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:18,159
learnability

2735
01:49:18,159 --> 01:49:20,960
in active inference lab we would hope to

2736
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:23,280
learn by doing and applying

2737
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:26,719
and update people's expectations to

2738
01:49:26,719 --> 01:49:30,000
increase their um

2739
01:49:30,159 --> 01:49:32,239
understanding of they can learn active

2740
01:49:32,239 --> 01:49:33,440
inference basically

2741
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:35,520
we'll figure out other ways to say it

2742
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:36,560
more directly but

2743
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:39,280
will manifest through observations on

2744
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:40,400
people's screens

2745
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:42,320
that they can learn active inference and

2746
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:44,000
then it's almost like in the cognitive

2747
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:44,880
dimension

2748
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:46,880
our collective and our individual

2749
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:48,960
cognitive evolution will

2750
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:50,800
undertake another inflection point when

2751
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:52,320
we believe that we can learn

2752
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:56,320
so that will be really powerful so scott

2753
01:49:56,320 --> 01:49:58,080
yeah along those lines just in terms of

2754
01:49:58,080 --> 01:49:59,679
further leverage i want to talk a little

2755
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:00,560
bit about the buy

2756
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:02,719
or build decision that every organism

2757
01:50:02,719 --> 01:50:04,800
makes and the idea is do you do you

2758
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,320
develop it internally or do you get it

2759
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:07,520
outside right

2760
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:10,400
and so it seems like one of the things

2761
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:11,840
that struck me is we've talked about the

2762
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:12,480
brain

2763
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:15,360
being tied to language one of the things

2764
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:15,840
i've been

2765
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:17,440
fussing with lately and i've this is the

2766
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:19,119
question i've been

2767
01:50:19,119 --> 01:50:20,719
fussing with the idea that the mind

2768
01:50:20,719 --> 01:50:22,480
resides in language and the brain is

2769
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:22,880
just an

2770
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:26,000
antenna tuned to the mind

2771
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,599
now the antenna would be the markov

2772
01:50:27,599 --> 01:50:29,040
blanket right or the

2773
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:30,560
the action of the markov blanket is a

2774
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:32,880
continuous dynamic tuning

2775
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:35,280
and the so that you're if you're born

2776
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:36,000
into a

2777
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,400
cultural context in my place very

2778
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:39,760
quickly my sister adopted a

2779
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:41,119
five-month-old chinese baby she was

2780
01:50:41,119 --> 01:50:42,560
raised in central pennsylvania she looks

2781
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:43,280
chinese she

2782
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:44,400
doesn't speak chinese doesn't like

2783
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:46,400
chinese food she's not chinese right

2784
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:48,800
so her mind is a creature of her

2785
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:49,440
environment

2786
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:52,400
in body so one of the things in terms of

2787
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:53,679
affordances you know we talk about

2788
01:50:53,679 --> 01:50:55,440
resources internally to develop the

2789
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:56,560
markov like it

2790
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:58,880
you know you can really shortcut that if

2791
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:00,159
you say hey

2792
01:51:00,159 --> 01:51:02,000
i know that my resource internally is i

2793
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,280
should time myself to

2794
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:05,920
to daniel because he's awesome and he

2795
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:07,199
knows all the stuff i don't have to know

2796
01:51:07,199 --> 01:51:08,320
it i just have to know if i have a

2797
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:09,840
question i'll go ask him

2798
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:11,119
right so you start to have something

2799
01:51:11,119 --> 01:51:13,360
like it's like eukaryotic revolution and

2800
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:14,719
multicellularity

2801
01:51:14,719 --> 01:51:16,800
you start to have this de-risking and

2802
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:18,480
leverage at

2803
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:22,000
larger scales made possible by the fact

2804
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:25,119
of synthesis of multiple markov blankets

2805
01:51:25,119 --> 01:51:25,440
now

2806
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:27,119
they can be synthesized around common

2807
01:51:27,119 --> 01:51:29,520
ideas or common problems

2808
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:32,239
so the the question is in terms of that

2809
01:51:32,239 --> 01:51:33,840
again

2810
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:35,920
separateness we see ourselves and our

2811
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:37,440
markov blankets and our minds as

2812
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:38,639
separate

2813
01:51:38,639 --> 01:51:40,719
but it seems like maybe they're not

2814
01:51:40,719 --> 01:51:42,719
maybe maybe the mind is

2815
01:51:42,719 --> 01:51:45,520
all one thing and we have these

2816
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:47,119
instantiations of it that we call

2817
01:51:47,119 --> 01:51:48,000
different

2818
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,840
there are different iterations of that

2819
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:51,760
markov language can you comment on that

2820
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:54,880
kind of macro and micro level uh notion

2821
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:59,360
briefly um

2822
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:03,520
i'll try i think this is all good

2823
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:04,000
thinking

2824
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:08,239
i i view this in the language of

2825
01:52:08,239 --> 01:52:10,400
in a sense extended organism thinking

2826
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:13,440
and evolutionary theory

2827
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:16,560
which is very closely connected to

2828
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:18,719
to multicellularity and evolutionary

2829
01:52:18,719 --> 01:52:19,760
theory

2830
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:23,679
uh which is closely connected to

2831
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:27,360
the sorts of of

2832
01:52:28,239 --> 01:52:30,480
faculty multicellularity you see in

2833
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:33,199
microbial communities

2834
01:52:33,199 --> 01:52:36,719
um i think from the

2835
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:39,599
from i think we see examples of this

2836
01:52:39,599 --> 01:52:42,560
throughout biology

2837
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:45,920
and um so the question becomes how do

2838
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:47,599
how do we take this into the human

2839
01:52:47,599 --> 01:52:49,679
sphere or

2840
01:52:49,679 --> 01:52:53,280
as i think you posed it very clearly uh

2841
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:55,760
how do we realize that it's already been

2842
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:57,440
taken into the human sphere

2843
01:52:57,440 --> 01:53:00,800
we just don't quite get it yet

2844
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:04,080
and and i suspect that you're right

2845
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:07,360
uh that we just don't quite get it yet

2846
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:09,679
and you know i i remember in graduate

2847
01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:11,040
school someone said

2848
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:12,480
you're what you're learning is how to

2849
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:14,400
read the literature yes

2850
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:17,839
you don't need to learn any facts

2851
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,920
and that has to do with security right

2852
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:21,520
and in new forms of

2853
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:24,080
threat and integrity and privacy issues

2854
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:25,360
all these new allergic

2855
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:28,480
problems are not necessarily

2856
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:30,480
new problems okay and that's why i

2857
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:31,599
wondered about the

2858
01:53:31,599 --> 01:53:34,400
biology and the biomimicry you see that
