00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,160
hello

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,800
welcome to active inference lab and

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,440
active inference live stream 17.2

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,480
it's march 16th 2021

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,000
welcome to the active inference lab

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,920
everyone we're a participatory

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,160
online lab that is communicating

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,000
learning and practicing applied active

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,960
inference

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,960
you can find us at our links on this

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,000
slide

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,080
this is recorded in an archived live

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,519
stream so please provide us with

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,000
feedback

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,558
so that we can be improving on our work

16
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,000
all backgrounds and perspectives are

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,800
welcome here

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,559
and we'll be following video etiquette

19
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,239
for live streams

20
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,960
at this shortened link you'll find our

21
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,480
calendar for active inference live

22
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,719
streams for 2021 and here we are

23
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,160
in the follow up to 17.1

24
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,640
in the same paper and uh definitely

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,680
recommended to check out 17.0 and 17.1

26
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,920
if you haven't but this will hopefully

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,480
be a cool discussion either way

28
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,680
and you can also see the future

29
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,760
live streams cool well today in

30
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,760
17.2 we are going to be just continuing

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,799
to discuss

32
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,520
and learn this really interesting paper

33
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,080
and

34
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,840
it will be fun to speak with whoever

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,680
joins or doesn't for this stream and

36
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,119
also hopefully to

37
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,040
get some questions from the live chat

38
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,479
but we're just going to introduce

39
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,799
ourselves go over some general

40
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,360
questions and i think uh seeing as it's

41
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,479
a dot two

42
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,479
and we had a lot of the background and

43
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,799
dot zero and then we had um

44
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,759
chris fields the author come on for dot

45
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,720
one

46
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,280
let's just think about where we can take

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,159
this fun

48
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,360
discussion okay so here

49
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,759
um especially for our first time

50
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,920
participants we can introduce ourselves

51
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,320
and just warm up so first we can just

52
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,360
introduce ourselves

53
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,000
i'm daniel i'm in northern california

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,360
and i'll pass it to

55
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,840
stephen hello there i'm stephen i'm in

56
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,399
toronto canada

57
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,200
and yeah i'm interested in a number of

58
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,000
areas

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,598
that relate to active inference

60
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,560
particularly those that can inform

61
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,120
community-based development and the way

62
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,920
that we

63
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,799
make meaning in complex contexts

64
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,920
and i'll pass it over to

65
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,040
is that alex there dean

66
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,760
dean sorry

67
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,040
hi um i'm dean uh i don't know how to

68
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,160
pass things yet

69
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,200
i'm pretty new to this um i'm in

70
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,640
calgary so hi steven in toronto

71
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,800
and uh i decided to s

72
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,720
to step into this because of

73
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,480
uh reach out to daniel did on

74
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,879
researchgate and

75
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,640
a follow-up and then the opportunity to

76
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,519
look at last week's 17.1

77
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,280
presentation and for about two hours i

78
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,000
was completely

79
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,800
absorbed in the conversation and thought

80
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,200
this is really interesting so i

81
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,800
took the next step and decided that i

82
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,720
would try and uh

83
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,400
integrate myself more with what's going

84
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,800
on here

85
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,400
cool well let's maybe learn more about

86
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:20,800
your

87
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,120
perspective as we walk through some of

88
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,560
these warm-up questions

89
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,680
and just go through at whatever

90
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,879
pace we want just sort of the topics in

91
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,040
the paper as well so the warm-up

92
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,720
questions are what is something you're

93
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,159
excited about today

94
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,920
what's something you liked or remembered

95
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,080
about the paper or

96
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,599
also the discussion 17.0 or one

97
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,200
and what's something you're wondering

98
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,680
about or would like to have resolved

99
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,480
so maybe since we all listened to it and

100
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,239
hopefully those listening will have two

101
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,599
what was something about 17.1 that sort

102
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,159
of

103
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,959
stood out in people's mind or something

104
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,480
that changed how they thought about

105
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,799
active inference or how they thought

106
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:03,840
about

107
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,200
something that wasn't active inference

108
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,680
yep stephen

109
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,920
yeah well one of the things that was

110
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,439
quite interesting was that

111
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,880
there are other ways of

112
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,279
people looking at the math side of it

113
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,079
which

114
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,080
some of you know the math itself is

115
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,759
normally quite a challenging area

116
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,199
to get your head down but to realize

117
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,680
there's also some other thoughts

118
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,240
happening

119
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,040
at some foundational level so that um

120
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,720
was interesting i didn't know about that

121
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,600
particularly

122
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,520
um or to the extent that was happening

123
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,280
so that that was particularly one area

124
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:39,840
and

125
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,080
that tied into this idea of quantum

126
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,320
contextuality

127
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,960
which i hadn't heard of actually and

128
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,840
really

129
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,880
was very interesting

130
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,400
dean what do you think um i guess the

131
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,560
biggest thing for me was and i and i use

132
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,600
terms that may not you you might have to

133
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,720
unpack them but

134
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,120
one of the things that i was really

135
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,039
interested in listening to was the fact

136
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,639
that um

137
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,280
that pers the perspective piece and how

138
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,320
you

139
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,759
every time you're observing something

140
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,919
the perspective that you hold

141
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,960
um you may not be aware of

142
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,080
how important that is but the fact that

143
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,240
chris sort of brought that out again and

144
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,280
again

145
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,080
um well that really that really

146
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,680
resonated with me because it's something

147
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,280
that i've been working with

148
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,039
with people for a long time cool

149
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,639
so a few thoughts that i had from 17.1

150
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,160
and also what you just said

151
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,280
so this quantum contextuality and then

152
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,120
the part that was really novel and

153
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,320
exciting to me

154
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,280
was thinking about quantum not as just

155
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,800
simply about

156
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,960
electrons and protons and okay you got

157
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,319
strong force weak force

158
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,880
electrons protons maxwell's you know

159
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,800
just throw the regular physics particle

160
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,000
physics or something

161
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,600
and then it's just equations that have

162
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
different efficacy

163
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,280
over different spatial scales that's one

164
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,199
presentation of quantum

165
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,199
and so then it's like well if you were

166
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,600
that size or there's something about

167
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,080
uh the system about that specific system

168
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,919
or that size of system that makes it

169
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,360
quote quantum

170
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,400
and this just expanded the definition of

171
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,759
quantum to me to this kind of

172
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,600
measurement communication

173
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,440
encryption encoding and ultimately also

174
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,160
bidirectional meaning and semantic

175
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,880
information

176
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,639
all the way down so that was a very

177
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,160
different way to think about

178
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,160
the relationship of like the molecule to

179
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,440
the electron orbital

180
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,199
it's like it's quantum it's not the way

181
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,199
that the electrons would be behaving by

182
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,880
themselves but maybe that's not just

183
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,080
because they're

184
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,400
electrons maybe that's something about

185
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,199
structure

186
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,800
in general so that was pretty cool and

187
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,560
then also you mentioned

188
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,080
and chris did dean observation is always

189
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,840
coming from a perspective

190
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,919
and that was something that we talked a

191
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,360
lot about with the projective

192
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,800
consciousness model

193
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,280
from an earlier discussion and so that

194
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,000
was saying

195
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,960
yes um you get all these cybernetic

196
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,919
functions

197
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,080
and all these functional attributes of

198
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,120
consciousness

199
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,599
from a projective geometry where the

200
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,440
observer is at this the center at this

201
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,880
actual special point

202
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,960
and then things are projecting out in a

203
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,919
certain way

204
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,039
so that's like kind of physical analog

205
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,080
it's geometric

206
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,639
and then um stephen you said there was a

207
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,160
different sort of math that they were

208
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,039
presenting

209
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,639
they didn't use projection of geometry

210
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,000
this was from like a different branch of

211
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,800
the game with the category theory and

212
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,520
with these other

213
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,960
theories that we just were barely

214
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,560
scratching the surface on

215
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,639
so that you know what does that mean

216
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,960
that those different branches can re-uh

217
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,520
integrate in a certain way and then

218
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,879
potentially not just through

219
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,240
an equation but through a process

220
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,599
theory so that was some interesting

221
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:02,240
stuff

222
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,960
any other thoughts or i mean really yeah

223
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,840
we're just we're just

224
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,080
yeah go ahead just now that's some

225
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,440
really that's really interesting

226
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,960
i'm just letting it sit because it takes

227
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,840
this idea of the perspective and this

228
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,599
idea that you know the idea that this

229
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,599
quantum idea can be much more across

230
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,199
scale and he did talk about i think he

231
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,800
called it quantum noise or

232
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,680
there was the use of noise which then

233
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,280
gives a rationale

234
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,880
i think for how this quantum processes

235
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,880
could permeate through everything

236
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,360
even if you don't see quantum

237
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,360
transitions in the simple

238
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,120
sense like you said with electrons and

239
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,399
stuff then there's

240
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,200
this this is permeating and that that

241
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,080
then comes

242
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,760
to that idea of the the the

243
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,160
contextuality

244
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,160
as well as perspective when we think we

245
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,000
take a bit different perspective

246
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,040
in a very okay i can see i've moved

247
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,560
from here to here and i've taken a

248
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,440
perspective but perspective

249
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,920
at this kind of phenomenological deep

250
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,720
level

251
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,200
is kind of happening happening at um

252
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,040
um all scales like the the context is

253
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,320
changing

254
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,720
um beyond what we can take a perspective

255
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,160
on if that makes sense except we use the

256
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,000
word perspective because

257
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,519
that's what we can get a handle on but

258
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,680
it's it's changing in so many ways of

259
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,200
which some of which we just can't

260
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,880
know so i thought that was really

261
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,240
interesting

262
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,640
um and maybe that's something that our

263
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,680
biology

264
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,800
is knowing but a deeper level you know

265
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,240
it may be these

266
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,040
nested levels there's ways of which that

267
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,279
sort of knowing is being

268
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,560
harvested once for a better term um

269
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,599
so yeah thanks

270
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,320
the body knowing which is something we

271
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,320
hear about and something you just said

272
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,240
it's almost like well if the body knows

273
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,480
through action like the tendon knows to

274
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,200
do this because of its biomechanical

275
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,040
properties but that's it's

276
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,640
how the knowledge it's not a turing

277
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,880
computer it's not doing

278
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,959
some trigonometry but it involves angles

279
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,000
but it's because of

280
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,040
how it's embodied so that's a it's an

281
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,519
it's not the knowledge on a hard drive

282
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,279
so that's sort of why some of these

283
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,000
information science approaches are

284
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,120
probably

285
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,120
on the cutting edge of what information

286
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,480
means because

287
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,959
we're having to think about how there is

288
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,079
information like

289
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,839
in the body of the insect that helps it

290
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,120
walk or

291
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,120
in the nervous system of the insect

292
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,720
there's some pattern generators for

293
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,440
example that

294
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,959
that's where the knowledge of walking is

295
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,279
so it can't do every walking pattern

296
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,440
but it is like this attractor for

297
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,480
walking

298
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,240
and then that's where the knowledge is

299
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,760
but it's not all knowledge and it's not

300
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,880
a text file

301
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,240
or script that is implemented on

302
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,240
how to walk or not even really an

303
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,519
algorithm

304
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,480
so it's kind of like

305
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,360
good and also yeah knowing is on the

306
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,000
inference

307
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,360
side and then what is the other side of

308
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,079
that

309
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,640
with action

310
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,930
[Laughter]

311
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,120
so i use sometimes use

312
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,320
the frame of of prisms and prismatics

313
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,959
and you got energy in and then you got a

314
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,800
rainbow on the other side daniel are you

315
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,839
kind of talking about

316
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,120
seeing both at once

317
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,839
like knowing what both are are doing i

318
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:38,720
mean it's going to go

319
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,040
through this triangle right but i mean

320
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,800
just being aware

321
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,720
that what what what we see on one side

322
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,640
is not necessarily what we see on the

323
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,320
other side and that doesn't make

324
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,480
one more important than the other it's

325
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,399
what's important is knowing

326
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,320
how things are are

327
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,240
looking to the person who's got this

328
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,120
perspective now

329
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,399
okay i'll try to address it yeah i seem

330
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,120
to remember

331
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,279
shauna saying the word prismatic or

332
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,959
chromatic or something about

333
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,000
yeah i use that all the time yeah okay

334
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,120
it probably has an interesting

335
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,720
technical definition so it's interesting

336
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,200
just that it's like a vivid sensory

337
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,920
representation of all the opportunities

338
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,519
all the possibilities all the colors the

339
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,399
rainbow

340
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,480
and even beyond with the electromagnetic

341
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,600
spectrum

342
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,519
greetings blue welcome um

343
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,320
and then there's like um yes the prism

344
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,160
focusing different rays of light or just

345
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,120
optics like

346
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,040
the rays of light are focusing at the

347
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,320
center point

348
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,360
and then um that's where the focus is

349
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:45,839
that's

350
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,480
where the regime of photons is and then

351
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,399
that's what enables the function

352
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,880
um greetings blue do you want to say hi

353
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,000
and give any

354
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,760
um thoughts while i just resize some

355
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,240
stuff yeah sure

356
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,839
good morning everyone my name is blue

357
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,440
knight i am an

358
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,360
independent research consultant based

359
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,160
out of new mexico

360
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,240
and yeah this paper was i don't know it

361
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,600
was like really difficult

362
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,680
to work through i thought and also

363
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,639
really well written

364
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,880
for like i'm not like want to sit and

365
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,079
read like math

366
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,160
lemma this and theorem that and like

367
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,360
that's always like not

368
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,120
my thing i mean i always find it just

369
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,440
difficult to digest i like to do math

370
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,399
as problems but not read it as like

371
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,440
reading material

372
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,279
but i thought that for like the amount

373
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,560
of information that was contained in

374
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,839
this paper it was like really

375
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,880
well written and easy to relate to

376
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,120
um i did think that it could have used

377
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,959
some additional like practical

378
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,199
examples of stuff but then like

379
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,880
considering the length of the paper i

380
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,639
was like man if they like put practical

381
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,160
examples for all of these different

382
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,160
things it would have been like a 70 page

383
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,279
paper

384
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,079
so um those are my thoughts on the paper

385
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,519
and it was great having chris

386
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,000
here with us uh last week to answer all

387
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,120
of our questions

388
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,320
and definitely something i um really

389
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,040
enjoyed

390
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,639
so cool

391
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,920
um yeah i wonder if we can

392
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,560
keep that question about examples of

393
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,199
this

394
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,880
in mind as we maybe look through

395
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,240
the keywords or look through the

396
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,959
roadmap let's just re-acquaint with the

397
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,079
paper

398
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,399
so this is the information flow in

399
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,160
context-dependent hierarchical

400
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,240
bayesian inference by fields and

401
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,160
glazebrook one of their

402
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,160
papers and collaborations together and

403
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,600
they basically lay out that there's two

404
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,000
goals they're kind of a twin purpose

405
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,600
with this paper

406
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,360
so one piece is related to

407
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,160
what stephen was bringing up earlier

408
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:48,800
with

409
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,800
taking this quantum contextuality

410
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,320
approach

411
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,800
and then generalizing it in a scale-free

412
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,120
aka multi-scale way

413
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,360
using techniques that are scale free

414
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,360
apparently such as two spaces and

415
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,480
channel theory

416
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,320
although also say like a linear

417
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,600
regression is scale free

418
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,839
there's no a priori scale for a linear

419
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,120
regression it could be over little

420
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,079
things it could be over big

421
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,880
things so in a way just saying scale

422
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,399
free is almost like saying we

423
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,880
made it about how the modeler approaches

424
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,920
the system

425
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,320
so that we didn't get tied down in

426
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,839
attributes of the system that we don't

427
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,199
want to be

428
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,959
um making skill-free and then the second

429
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,000
side of this scale-free approach to

430
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,600
contextuality

431
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,480
is they're going to demonstrate a

432
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,240
connection between that

433
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,320
and a lot of recent work in bayesian

434
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,399
statistics and hierarchical bayesian

435
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,839
models which is also

436
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,880
where the most direct connection to

437
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,720
active inference comes into play

438
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,639
because we've also seen hierarchical

439
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,480
bayesian models as

440
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,800
implementing active inference and then

441
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,519
that's being tied to something that's

442
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,320
at a different or a higher level of

443
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,759
mathematical

444
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,639
generality which potentially could allow

445
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,079
an active inference model

446
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,560
that you make for this specific task if

447
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,680
you make it within

448
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,519
that framework you might be able to lift

449
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,880
it out and put it somewhere totally

450
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,600
different

451
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,040
like you might be able to use it to

452
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,959
describe systems and fit parameters

453
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,279
or generate data that's something that

454
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,720
not all models can do

455
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,639
but there's probably other modeling

456
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,800
maneuvers that will be possible

457
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,000
and so it's kind of like if you have

458
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,240
gaussian assumptions certain things and

459
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,160
statistics work really well together

460
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,759
like you know certain relationships

461
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,279
between multiplying things and adding

462
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,560
variances

463
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,320
so this is kind of like a higher level

464
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,920
statistical

465
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,959
um relationship

466
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,320
that and i think that has to do with the

467
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,600
matu the commuting of the cones

468
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,320
or the cocons but who knows

469
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,959
um okay on the road map were there any

470
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,480
sections that like sprung

471
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,199
to mind or anything somebody wants to

472
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,839
say on this

473
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,319
all right let's go to why it matters and

474
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,280
think about the

475
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,839
examples so yeah stephen

476
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,760
um yeah okay and good points you just

477
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,160
made

478
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,120
um i think that the um

479
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,720
that example that was just given

480
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,559
actually about the prism

481
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,760
i think it was a good one i think that

482
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,600
might even itself be something that

483
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,760
could even be a a topic of discussions i

484
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,760
think that opens up things but it also

485
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,480
uh

486
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,960
it gets some other stuff because one

487
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,200
thing that's going on here is

488
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,039
the the bayesian inference you're kind

489
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,640
of inside

490
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,760
the the situation that's at play

491
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,000
and what i think that if we're going to

492
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,760
say why this matters i think it might

493
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,640
relate

494
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,200
interestingly to a paper that's going to

495
00:17:59,200 --> 00:17:59,919
be actually coming

496
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,960
up over the next week which talks about

497
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,160
um the way that we understand the global

498
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,960
workspace

499
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,600
or theory of the brain and the idea that

500
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
we have this phenomenological

501
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,360
consciousness which is somehow

502
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,960
attuned to the flux of sensory data

503
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,039
and then we have what we're actually

504
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,799
often modeling which is what we're

505
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,240
able to consciously be aware of

506
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,640
so this flux that's at the you know

507
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,360
which

508
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,120
sort of it starts to get into the

509
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,880
markovian monism

510
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,080
theories of of um fristen

511
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,240
this seems to sort of give another way

512
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,679
to go from the flux

513
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,799
up uh maybe this you know

514
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,640
in the way that david bone talks about

515
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,640
the um implicit order

516
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,280
of nature and um and i got a message

517
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,240
from tim as well

518
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,000
just through saying about to think that

519
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,760
you know we've got this idea of quantum

520
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,600
noise and classical noise

521
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,240
you know and you know this non-linear

522
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,320
dynamical systems are kind of working

523
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,160
with what could be mean as noise

524
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,760
or changes in noise so um

525
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,799
so i think that that part of the

526
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,200
that part of the the story is um

527
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,000
is sort of important across all of

528
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,679
active imprints in a way

529
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,799
because at some level there has to be a

530
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:21,440
way to

531
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,720
extract meaning from

532
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,080
uncertainty and so it seems that this

533
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,840
gives some other way into that

534
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,840
blue or dean

535
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,200
here's a thought okay go ahead dean i'm

536
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,240
just going to say that

537
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,320
i so back to the perspective thing

538
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,320
um so one of the hardest things that

539
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,760
when i was working with

540
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,120
with people trying to find themselves in

541
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,280
in new situations was you

542
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,000
you you're either inside of the box or

543
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,600
you're outside of it and i like the word

544
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,960
that stephen used their

545
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,440
extraction because i think that that

546
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,240
i think what this work does is it maybe

547
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,280
enables that

548
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,840
extraction piece a little easier if

549
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,960
people

550
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,720
know what you're talking about in terms

551
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,400
of stepping back

552
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,360
we have a tendency to step into things

553
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,760
and analyze things from a from an

554
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,360
inside out perspective and i think

555
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,039
how this how this could potentially work

556
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,320
is as a way of of gaining

557
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,360
a sense of removal which is actually

558
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,440
advantageous at times i mean if you're

559
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,559
looking at

560
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,880
something that's complex it's it's very

561
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,720
difficult sometimes not to get

562
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,840
caught up in the in the moment i was

563
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,480
speaking

564
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,400
just before the live stream started

565
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,159
about

566
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,320
white water rafting when you're when

567
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,520
you're going down the river and you're

568
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,720
in a class

569
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,000
three uh rapid you're thinking about

570
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,360
that you're not thinking about

571
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,159
the perspective of being up on the cliff

572
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,159
watching the raft go down the river i

573
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,760
think this allows people

574
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,400
to get outside of that moment i think

575
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:10,960
that's my

576
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,320
one of my hopefully why this matters

577
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,120
contributions

578
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,320
even well just sort of

579
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,280
with with that i think in some ways i i

580
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,640
agree what you're saying but i would

581
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,200
also

582
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,880
say what's interesting is maybe it

583
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,200
allows you to remove yourself

584
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,320
more than we normally can because but

585
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,520
also show that actually when you think

586
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,880
you're immersed in it

587
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,559
you aren't as immersed as you think you

588
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,320
are right because there's these other

589
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,600
levels of

590
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,960
immersion um which are you're

591
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,159
beyond your conscious awareness and

592
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,760
there's probably even other levels which

593
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,840
even beyond your phenomenological and

594
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,120
biological

595
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,720
systems ability to tap into so there's a

596
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,640
maybe it's both ends if that makes sense

597
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,799
you go you can go further in if the word

598
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,159
in is meant that way and

599
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,159
further out if the word out is meant

600
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,559
that way

601
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,960
so on this why it matters um

602
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,520
here's one thought and then anyone else

603
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,120
or i could go for a second so

604
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,760
stephen when you said extraction um and

605
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,880
i know you have a background in

606
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,840
chemistry

607
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,760
so that's sort of like it's separating

608
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,840
into the different fractions

609
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,120
so it's it's um not just extracting like

610
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,080
you know the lithium from the ore it's

611
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:34,960
actually

612
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,640
like we can have a discussion what are

613
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,880
the affordances what is on the table

614
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,320
what are we just going to just say is

615
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,559
our option space for policy

616
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,720
and then what are our preferences and

617
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,480
what kind of uncertainties are we each

618
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,600
bringing to the table from our

619
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,720
perspective

620
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,360
so it is um not like we're extracting

621
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,960
the essence of the conflict and then

622
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,760
we're gonna

623
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,000
fix the essence or the reduction of the

624
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,520
conflict or one dimension of the

625
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,440
conflict perceived

626
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,679
and then that will propagate through the

627
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:02,559
other

628
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,880
aspects of the situation it's kind of

629
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,559
like we're gonna come with uncertainty

630
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,080
to a minimal model

631
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,000
and then if one person has one narrative

632
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,360
for the policy and somebody else has a

633
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,480
different narrative

634
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,600
that's off the table so that is a

635
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,799
way where people can bring their

636
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,200
different ways of seeing

637
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,840
a common model differently like in the

638
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,360
quantum measurement case

639
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,120
if both people are measuring the quantum

640
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,159
particle and they're both fine with it

641
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:33,200
that's one type of experiment steven

642
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,840
yeah i like the point you picked up

643
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,280
there on extraction it was interesting

644
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:37,919
because

645
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,000
uh that that sort of came up so strongly

646
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,200
and i think um

647
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,039
the other thing that's interesting is

648
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,960
the idea even in chemistry is the idea

649
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,919
that still you extract

650
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,320
something right it's quite thin like but

651
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,840
the idea that you're extracting

652
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,279
something from noise

653
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,120
because in chemistry it's normally like

654
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,960
basically you you calculate everything

655
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,960
down and then say what is

656
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,760
negligible what can you say is beyond

657
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,000
concern so you just say it's beyond

658
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,760
worries you know it's it's within

659
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,360
tolerance so to speak and then you just

660
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,799
work within that whereas in this case

661
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:07,840
it's like well

662
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,440
all that noise so to speak is what we're

663
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,480
extracting

664
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,799
the information from it it feels to us

665
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,159
like the stuff's out there and we're

666
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,200
getting

667
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,440
thinness so to speak but we're actually

668
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,640
getting

669
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,159
signals and supposed extracting enough

670
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,559
variational free energy changes in the

671
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,520
noise

672
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,440
to then perceive it as you know

673
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,600
knowledge but it actually it has to

674
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,360
start out as

675
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,360
fluctuations in i don't know if the word

676
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,679
noise is maybe the wrong word but

677
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,400
certainly fluctuations in non-linear

678
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,360
dynamics

679
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,600
so that's that's that changes a lot of

680
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,520
things about how we understand knowing

681
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,918
the world

682
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,279
interesting here's kind of another point

683
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,200
on the signal to noise

684
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,200
so we're thinking in the shannon

685
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,559
information aka shannon disinfo theory

686
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,120
nothing against it framework it's about

687
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,320
the telegraph

688
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,440
and the wire and getting the exact

689
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,440
recapitulation of the signal on one end

690
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,279
of the wire as the other end of the wire

691
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,360
that was the second paragraph of the

692
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,520
1948 paper by shannon

693
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,279
we talked about it in the dot zero video

694
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,720
he said the question of communication is

695
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,600
about perfectly reconstituting a signal

696
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,320
and so in that framework if you have if

697
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,760
you're doing a chemical synthesis

698
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,760
and there's one product you want then

699
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,159
you can calculate like the yield of that

700
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,120
product

701
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,640
and then similarly if there's one thing

702
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,240
that you know that you want you know you

703
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,120
can calculate

704
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,760
really exact statistics like information

705
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,480
um

706
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,200
and then once you open it up to the

707
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,720
semantics

708
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,320
um then this the noise has a different

709
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,720
perspective just like you are

710
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,919
highlighting cure i think there's a lot

711
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:54,400
of

712
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,760
richness in what you already said but

713
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,320
yes noise is richer than just

714
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,600
decay in the copper wire because we're

715
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,120
not trying to

716
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,240
recapitulate anything in the person's

717
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,960
mind it's not a bit wise transfer

718
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,000
through speech

719
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,360
it's actually like the differences in

720
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,279
the way that we speak are

721
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,520
conveying meaning so it's not just error

722
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,279
from some perceived

723
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,320
um pattern of speech it's like just

724
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,600
the meaning that the person is conveying

725
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,679
through their action so that i think is

726
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:24,000
also

727
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,039
something that really matters when we

728
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,799
think about differences in how people

729
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:27,760
are going to be learning or

730
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,600
communicating or something like that

731
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,360
stephen yeah and

732
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,799
the the interesting thing is that while

733
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,880
to some extent you heat up a liquid or

734
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,039
something it expands and you sort of

735
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,120
the energy put in shows itself as the

736
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,600
work you particularly see say when water

737
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,480
freezes

738
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,400
but there's this whole question of

739
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,679
entropy

740
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,760
and how it somehow tied to some

741
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,240
rearrangement

742
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,360
which is not shown as work in the system

743
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:57,919
you know

744
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,919
that you try and heat up ice it hits a

745
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,919
point there's something going on there

746
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,679
and we can't quite

747
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,039
know what it is and it's energy hungry

748
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,240
in some instances or energy yielding

749
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,000
but um that that process is is beyond

750
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,919
our direct

751
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,360
perception so you just have to build it

752
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,960
in with gibbs free energy

753
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,559
and the entropy and enthalpy terms

754
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,320
to see what will happen with reactions

755
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,600
so that

756
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,000
that actually then actually ties into

757
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,039
fristen's work

758
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,360
um in in actually it's the sort of

759
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,679
foundation of his work in a way

760
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,120
so i i'm not sure how entropy

761
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,120
was named in this paper maybe i don't

762
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,799
think that's directly part of this math

763
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,799
this is another way to come in without

764
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,880
maybe coming in with the word entropy

765
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,600
but um it's interesting

766
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,760
thanks dean i just

767
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,279
again just try to draw from examples

768
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,799
when i would talk about this

769
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,520
with people and there's a privilege

770
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,799
always given over to gap

771
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,039
closing like we want to close the gap we

772
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,200
want to understand we want to find the

773
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,120
signal within the noise

774
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,480
and i think what this does is it sort of

775
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,919
gives over a certain amount of

776
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,480
credibility just a gap respecting

777
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,880
just leaving the thingness out of it for

778
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,000
a bit

779
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,559
so that you can actually take in more

780
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,120
information back to what stephen was

781
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,159
and what you're both alluding to how do

782
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,399
how do we

783
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,760
how do we give ourselves um

784
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,000
cut ourselves a little bit of slack by

785
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,840
saying gap respecting is just as

786
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,720
important

787
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,880
as gap closing and if we give ourselves

788
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,360
that it's a kind of a privilege to do

789
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,679
that because it's twice as much effort

790
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,720
as just gap closing i think the benefits

791
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,000
can be really

792
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,440
quite profound nice

793
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,279
point thank you so sarah oh stephen

794
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,279
do you have anything to add here well

795
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,880
just one last point on that is that

796
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,520
could then

797
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,159
where you start to get into abductive

798
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,520
growth based

799
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,120
knowing um where is maybe

800
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,520
um we're used to because humans have got

801
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,279
this capacity for deductive

802
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,399
and rapid you know exclusion of what's

803
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:17,440
out there

804
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,000
an inductive trying to narrow the gap

805
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,679
between us and a goal

806
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,760
but when we're growing when we think

807
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,360
about sometimes i need to just sit back

808
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,240
and heal

809
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,520
you know there's certain situations in

810
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,919
the world which i can never process

811
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,480
psychologically from a i can't close the

812
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,399
gap on certain things right i just have

813
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:35,360
to sit back

814
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,159
and heal right because they're hard and

815
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:38,880
so that

816
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,480
that same piece you're talking about

817
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,960
there then starts to tap into well

818
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,880
that's the main game in town for

819
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,559
organisms

820
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,600
yeah the gaming town of closing gaps and

821
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,480
is is um is a nice add-on that we have

822
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,480
but it isn't the main game and

823
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,039
blue

824
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,840
so that just brings up to mine's like

825
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,240
time as a gap closer right like when you

826
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,840
just sit back and heal

827
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,159
and and ultimately like time as a gap

828
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:13,840
closer like if you think about like the

829
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,240
time

830
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,679
value of money and i mean like time is

831
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,840
ultimately the thing that will you know

832
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,880
close the gap on

833
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,720
all prediction and and like we don't

834
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,240
really see that in

835
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,880
the models or in the math at all um it'd

836
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,880
be interesting to see like the temporal

837
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,919
dimension and how that plays in or

838
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,919
people have thought about that or i mean

839
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,520
time like can it flow forward and

840
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,000
backward

841
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,360
and i think that was something that was

842
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,600
brought up maybe in the last live stream

843
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,679
that's just interesting yeah nice dean

844
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,760
just just one last thing i i i

845
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,679
completely agree with you because

846
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,480
again the privilege goes on on to time

847
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,760
on task

848
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,960
instead of task or or task on time

849
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,320
instead of just seeing time in and of

850
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,720
itself i

851
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,039
have this crazy theory that that time is

852
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,000
learning

853
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,039
not just a way of measuring learning

854
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,679
and i don't you can't get there unless

855
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,440
you can get off that

856
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,720
treadmill so thank you that's a great

857
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,080
point

858
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,120
and dean what you said about learning as

859
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,279
time it's like the difference between

860
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,120
kairos and kronos

861
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,000
so kronos the chronometer the decimal

862
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,840
time and it's about the wall

863
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,039
time the clock time and then action is

864
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:31,760
happening

865
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,960
in a space of meaning of act it's time

866
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,960
for dinner and that's an action

867
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,559
affordance and so that is something

868
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,279
that's we can bring in the uncultured

869
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,840
component whereas the other approach is

870
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,120
no the wall time is just

871
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,159
simply how it is and we're going to like

872
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:49,360
pro trustees

873
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,880
shrink expand use heuristics

874
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,519
use coarse graining to get around this

875
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,120
sort of fundamental

876
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,159
um linearizing from our perspective

877
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,760
just at the scale we're at which makes

878
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,279
it not scale-free

879
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,960
which is why perhaps quantum only

880
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,039
applies to certain so-called spatial

881
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,080
levels of what

882
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:15,360
we measure steven

883
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,279
yeah sorry give me a sec i had it and

884
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,080
then i just went for a sec there so

885
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,919
let me ask sarah's question because it's

886
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,480
really nice point in chat

887
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,080
so sarah wrote um could we look at chew

888
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,880
space

889
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,919
slide and get a broader perspectival

890
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,279
view to maximize

891
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,399
signal to noise sort of

892
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,360
speak so maybe i didn't perfectly read

893
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,240
it but i think

894
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,600
it was two spaces can we enter into here

895
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,279
a little bit and connect that to some of

896
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:45,919
the bigger

897
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,080
discussion points and maybe even the

898
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,679
other um

899
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,799
useful points so stephen you want to

900
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,320
give a thought or is there anyone who

901
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,519
wants to give a thought on the two space

902
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,000
piece here

903
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,960
yeah does it this directly i'm not sure

904
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,080
exactly how but

905
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,039
um this gives a way that um things can

906
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,200
transform from one space to another

907
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,200
so it gives you that capacity i mean

908
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,120
sort of keep it tightness to the the

909
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,360
idea of time i mean with

910
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,960
and i know this paper is not specific

911
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,559
active inference with active influence

912
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:19,120
you know

913
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,960
without time you're not able to make

914
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,960
inferences from

915
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,039
noise so to speak or changes in

916
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,399
information content

917
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:29,519
in random fluctuations you only get that

918
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:30,880
because you've got time because then you

919
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,480
can tell if there's been a fluctuation

920
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,760
so one snapshot can't do that now

921
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,640
this seems to maybe give away to okay

922
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,080
you've now got a shape of the

923
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,080
information space

924
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,440
what happens once it has a shape

925
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,600
um now but beyond that it's uh

926
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,120
i'm not entirely sure

927
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,880
yeah um blue anything you'd say on this

928
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,240
um topic otherwise i think walking

929
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:00,640
through

930
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,399
kind of just the way they laid it out in

931
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,240
the definitions could be helpful in some

932
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,519
of the examples they gave

933
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,320
because like steven you you mentioned

934
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,440
this morph

935
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,040
ism right and it seemed like there's the

936
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,359
true space

937
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,239
and that's like a matrix but one that

938
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,440
can be various

939
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,918
kinds of things it's a matrix but just

940
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:22,960
like we can represent

941
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,599
a network with a matrix so we can think

942
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,679
about like the space of all the networks

943
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,960
all the social networks of five people

944
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,879
it's like a five by five matrix and ones

945
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,800
and zeros or weighted numbers

946
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,639
so that's the matrix representation of

947
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,000
the network

948
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,480
and then that is one type of meaning of

949
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,599
the matrix

950
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,879
but also this can describe probability

951
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:45,918
and it can describe

952
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:49,440
programming languages bayesian

953
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,320
networks like if each cell had

954
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,760
information about a conditional

955
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,879
dependence or not

956
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,680
so that's like a a chew space is the

957
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,280
space of the possible

958
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,480
of these things and then

959
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,599
this is the part where maybe we'll just

960
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,200
say it's beyond the experience on this

961
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,800
conversation but

962
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,640
the wikipedia has like understood

963
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,000
statically

964
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,920
it's a relation and then understood

965
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,000
dynamically and then it has another

966
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,520
definition so it gets interesting has a

967
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,280
static or a dynamic

968
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,480
interpretation so i think it's

969
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,960
yeah unless anyone in the um chat wants

970
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,480
to jump in and help or somebody with

971
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,839
expertise wants to come on later

972
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:32,560
um how can we connect that to some of

973
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,599
these use

974
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,920
cases blue or that on anything else go

975
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,920
ahead

976
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,599
so i think like the um the dynamic

977
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,480
aspect of the two space and the the two

978
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,480
morphisms is that like

979
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,240
you know any um if you have like a set

980
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,800
a matrix right so if you have a matrix

981
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,280
and

982
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,599
it's like any series of transformations

983
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,119
that can be done to form

984
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,599
a new matrix so that that in my mind is

985
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:00,800
like the dynamism

986
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,520
of it all like if i take you know set a

987
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,400
and i do

988
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,640
this that this that this that in this

989
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,839
specific order

990
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,359
so again like here here's like the

991
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:12,079
temporal like we're alluding to like

992
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:13,680
time as a variable or

993
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,839
time as a gap closer but like the

994
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,760
temporal sequence is important because

995
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,800
you know if you do

996
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,320
you know if you multiply before you

997
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,760
subtract or if you get your order of

998
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,040
operations wrong it's going to be

999
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,720
different right so the temporal order of

1000
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,440
things

1001
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,920
is the the morphism to to make the the

1002
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,720
next

1003
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,040
set

1004
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,400
thanks for that another interesting

1005
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,920
sentence

1006
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,280
is that um it's like the true transform

1007
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,560
or the morphism

1008
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,640
is a pair it kind of comes into

1009
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,920
existence

1010
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,800
as two spaces and a mapping between them

1011
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,520
or a map

1012
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,079
between them and so that is what ties it

1013
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,079
really broadly to functions and

1014
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,440
computation

1015
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,480
and these sort of transformation

1016
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,760
transmutation or input output seeming

1017
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,760
communication seeming processes

1018
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,800
measurement like

1019
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,760
processes because it's about sum space

1020
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,359
and some other space

1021
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,359
and so when we think about the active

1022
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:12,800
inference model

1023
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,280
and then we have hidden states that

1024
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,880
inference is being done on

1025
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,760
and then we have observations and it's

1026
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,720
almost like

1027
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,640
there's a matrix that connects the two

1028
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,560
of them i'm not saying that that's going

1029
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,520
to be

1030
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,079
all at this level of two space but it's

1031
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:28,640
kind of like

1032
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,480
there's a mapping where you can run the

1033
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,560
model from the sense data

1034
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,240
to the state and do inference or you can

1035
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,280
generate from the state

1036
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,760
likely sensory data so that is a

1037
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,839
bi-directional it's like a two-way

1038
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,960
bayesian machine because it can take in

1039
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,560
observations and update

1040
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,040
expectations of hidden state variables

1041
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,160
or it can generate

1042
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,760
so that generative and receptive element

1043
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,200
of bayesian computation is i think just

1044
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,760
it's like whatever is the topic that

1045
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,800
includes that

1046
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,400
and that network matrix and a few other

1047
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,520
things

1048
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,680
that's kind of where this topic can go

1049
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,200
which is why i think it's a

1050
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,680
really rich area and that's why the

1051
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,800
papers are written in

1052
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,839
2020 and that's that's

1053
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:21,040
yeah stephen and then dean

1054
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,119
i think this this idea of moving between

1055
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,960
spaces is also really

1056
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,800
valuable because as you know i'm very

1057
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,079
interested in

1058
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,480
um understanding how we can look at

1059
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,520
awareness

1060
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,599
and sort of indigeneity is very much

1061
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,200
about awareness

1062
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,200
and a lot of the active infant work work

1063
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,200
is tends to be at whatness what's this

1064
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,880
what's that how can we understand what

1065
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,320
this is understood to do

1066
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,359
and think about but this when you start

1067
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,680
to get to this broader

1068
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,240
um understanding of how we can make

1069
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,359
meaning

1070
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:55,040
um and taking that idea a very broad

1071
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,000
level

1072
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,720
is the ability to transform between

1073
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,000
spaces and engage

1074
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,960
with spaces and that might extend up to

1075
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,640
our conscious awareness space

1076
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,200
but some of these spaces are well below

1077
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,800
the level of consciousness you know down

1078
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,119
to the level of cells you know but

1079
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,320
it's it seems to have and play out the

1080
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,640
importance of

1081
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,480
spatial transformation over whatness

1082
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,839
thank you steven dean yeah

1083
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:27,520
what i took away from this was that

1084
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,240
when we when we discriminate when we

1085
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,440
separate

1086
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,880
um this sort of gives you a sense of

1087
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,400
why we might do that um i think of

1088
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,599
some of the stuff that we looked at um

1089
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,200
in some of the work that i did we would

1090
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,720
ask people to

1091
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,400
watch something maybe a youtube clip

1092
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,720
and instead of trying to take all the

1093
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,920
information in as

1094
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,000
is is classically recorded through notes

1095
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,200
we'd ask them to columnize and row

1096
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,720
in under three headings tools

1097
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,440
and rules and pools now that was the

1098
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,480
mnemonic but

1099
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,680
pools basically where the gradient is

1100
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,079
what's

1101
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,720
aggregating and so we'd ask people to

1102
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,400
classify

1103
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,280
something and what people found was

1104
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,960
something could fit into

1105
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,079
two categories something could be a tool

1106
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,040
and a rule sometimes it could go across

1107
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,720
all three it could be a tool

1108
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,520
and a rule and a pool like there was a

1109
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,400
way of

1110
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,160
being able to see um relationship

1111
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,000
and i think that's what this two spaces

1112
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,200
does it says

1113
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,920
we can discriminate we can separate but

1114
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,960
sometimes

1115
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,520
things fit into multiple categories and

1116
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,720
that's

1117
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,240
that's something we need to be aware of

1118
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,160
our minds are able to sort of

1119
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,640
pull apart and then reorganize that's

1120
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,359
what i took away from that

1121
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:58,079
nice very nice dean and i think that's

1122
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,440
sort of reflected by

1123
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,000
this cone and potentially even your

1124
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,359
prism

1125
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:06,240
topic because it's like yes there's a

1126
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,599
unity of

1127
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,319
c in this case but it is going to be

1128
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:11,839
manifest in these different

1129
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,800
spaces and this is a really informative

1130
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,599
slide

1131
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,440
so it's talking again about these pair

1132
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,880
of two

1133
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,359
spaces that are related through a

1134
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:22,880
transform

1135
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,720
the transform a to b can't and this is

1136
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,000
from section or example 2 7 in the paper

1137
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
the transform a to b in this case can be

1138
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,319
viewed as transporting the information

1139
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:34,400
encoded in valid flow formulas from a to

1140
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,200
b and can thus be thought of informally

1141
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,839
as a channel from a to b implicitly

1142
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,200
providing a sense of spatial

1143
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,880
and or temporal separation between a and

1144
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,720
b so i thought like

1145
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,800
there's the maps of meaning and so

1146
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,000
there's my

1147
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,800
internal map just so to speak just using

1148
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,319
it instrumentally and then

1149
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,680
there's person b and then if

1150
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,520
we're playing 20 questions it's like

1151
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,839
okay is the house bigger or smaller than

1152
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:01,440
a bread box

1153
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,599
there's some semantic mapping internal

1154
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,920
to me and then there's a channel

1155
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,119
with this with the sense data and then

1156
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,760
there's a semantic flow related to

1157
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,200
whether they're going to give me a yes

1158
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,160
no

1159
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,400
which is like chris said that's quanta

1160
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,240
because we're quantizing the response

1161
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,319
is it bigger or not we're making a

1162
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:21,440
measurement of the response now

1163
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,760
they could be lying or they could be

1164
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,040
wrong or

1165
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,640
they could you know we couldn't hear

1166
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,839
them or something but it's a binary

1167
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:30,640
question and then

1168
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,560
there's a semantic flow and then there's

1169
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,240
a back and forth

1170
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,079
potentially otherwise you're talking

1171
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,839
about different things and so

1172
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:39,920
if somebody is thinking maybe i was

1173
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,599
thinking of a little toy house

1174
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,839
smaller than a bread box so if you have

1175
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,880
a different

1176
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,760
frame of reference then even the

1177
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,560
communication is not going to

1178
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,400
work because the holograph is going to

1179
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,920
be read

1180
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,800
too differently by the people even with

1181
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,839
the same information

1182
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,640
so that's like the separation of

1183
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,640
cognition across

1184
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,119
participants in a conversation and then

1185
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:12,800
that's happening

1186
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,839
implicitly through time but then it

1187
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,520
seems like also

1188
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,520
things can be just more abstractly

1189
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,200
described as being separated through

1190
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,000
time

1191
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,760
and so something that's separated in

1192
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,240
time but not in space

1193
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,960
is like memory which is where this whole

1194
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,040
discussion of memory comes into play

1195
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,200
because it's it's a communication

1196
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,040
through time at that spot like a time

1197
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:35,760
capsule

1198
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,760
it's like 50-year message out

1199
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,359
you debate whether you're the absolute

1200
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:42,720
position of the time capsule is the same

1201
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,720
but it's like relative to it

1202
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,720
it's a message through time blue

1203
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,520
so it's funny that you bring up a time

1204
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,119
capsule like i've been really thinking

1205
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:54,400
about um

1206
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,040
you know at scale carrying information

1207
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:57,599
forward

1208
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,880
and backward like from you know cells to

1209
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,520
person

1210
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,240
to like a group of people and and it's

1211
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:04,880
like you know

1212
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,359
when we what do we carry forward and

1213
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:08,000
when we like

1214
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,760
used to make time capsules like every 10

1215
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,960
years i don't know if we still do but

1216
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,480
then we would dig them up and

1217
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,560
like you know dig them up every 20 or 30

1218
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,760
years or whatever and like

1219
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,240
what do we put into a time capsule and

1220
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,200
does that like

1221
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,319
effectively capture like the culture of

1222
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,640
the society at that time like a cd

1223
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,560
or like you know these different things

1224
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,079
that go into the time capsules like this

1225
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,440
is actually like what we're carrying

1226
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,880
forward and sometimes it's like dumb

1227
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,920
stuff like

1228
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,839
i don't know it's just funny to think

1229
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,520
about what goes forward

1230
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,599
right in time and and why that and

1231
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,079
like how the selection process works and

1232
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:42,800
if it's

1233
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,839
like a systemic or generalized thing or

1234
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,280
um i don't know it's just something that

1235
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,520
i've been thinking about how that is

1236
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,240
transmitted

1237
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,520
across time great question

1238
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,359
and very prescient of course with so

1239
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,520
much digital information

1240
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,760
and a potentially fluctuating cost of

1241
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,800
storage

1242
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,040
wildly cheap but then wildly expensive

1243
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,599
and that could lead to some very

1244
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:09,520
unfortunate information flows

1245
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,000
evolution has sort of an answer to that

1246
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:12,720
which is like

1247
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,520
what's passed forward is what is fit to

1248
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,319
its niche

1249
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:19,280
not biggest bench press strongest

1250
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,240
fittest

1251
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,760
but fit to the niche adapt skilled

1252
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,319
to the niche so we don't need to go too

1253
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:27,920
semantic on that but i think the term

1254
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,880
actually does

1255
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,839
fit and where evolution by natural

1256
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:33,280
selection

1257
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,599
as well as active inference come into

1258
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:36,480
play

1259
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,400
is by formalizing a process theory

1260
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,480
you kind of step away or at least you

1261
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,880
can maybe get some distance or some

1262
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,599
model ability of these complex processes

1263
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,440
so in evolution the process theory is

1264
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,240
basically

1265
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,920
you have heritable variation in

1266
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,599
phenotype that's found

1267
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,359
in a population where there's heritable

1268
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:56,720
variation in fitness

1269
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,640
and if those are all linked up in the

1270
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,640
right way at least locally

1271
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,160
that's the way that the phenotype and

1272
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,240
the population moves and so active

1273
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:04,960
inference

1274
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,240
it's similar but kind of like with

1275
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,319
information just saying okay sense data

1276
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:08,880
comes in

1277
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,119
action goes out from a generative model

1278
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:12,079
into the niche

1279
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,079
back into the sense something happens

1280
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:15,599
with the generative model integrates the

1281
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:16,319
information

1282
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,200
engages in policy so it's like if

1283
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,400
somebody listens to a lecture and they

1284
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,839
only write the notes

1285
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,440
of five sentences and then they pass

1286
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,760
that off the process theory

1287
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,440
explained why there was an information

1288
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,359
bottleneck there because we just modeled

1289
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:30,720
the situation and we don't need to go

1290
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,400
into oh it's tragic there was only five

1291
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,119
sentences

1292
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,119
or there was more than you know it was

1293
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,560
five deep sentences though or something

1294
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,040
like that

1295
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,720
we just say what it was that was the

1296
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,960
actual transmission

1297
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,040
and then that is a starting point for

1298
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,800
the kinds of value-oriented analyses

1299
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,240
that you might want to do afterwards

1300
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,760
dean yeah i'm just curious what other

1301
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:50,480
people's

1302
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,000
thinking is on this because typically

1303
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,359
between the inference and the model we

1304
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:00,240
not necessarily the people here but

1305
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,000
oftentimes what's parked in between

1306
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:02,720
those

1307
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,200
two things is a plan and what you just

1308
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,160
described

1309
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,720
is not a plan so i'm curious what other

1310
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,079
people think

1311
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,920
is between the inference and the model i

1312
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,680
have my ideas but i'm

1313
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,280
because i'm trying to get to know you

1314
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,040
folks i'd like to know what you guys

1315
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:17,680
think

1316
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:21,279
is between the entrance and the model

1317
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:24,079
stephen

1318
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,079
yeah well this is that's the six million

1319
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:27,200
dollar question they

1320
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,640
um i i think that

1321
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,200
the the the introduction of the quantum

1322
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,160
approach

1323
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,559
at certain scales does yield something

1324
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:37,440
very

1325
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,119
plausible and and and chris's work with

1326
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:42,800
mike levin would tie into that because

1327
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,280
he does a lot of work with bioelectrics

1328
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,359
on cells membranes so i could see

1329
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:52,960
that the this question where it's more

1330
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,319
directly attributed to to

1331
00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:00,000
quantum fluctuations and what that means

1332
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,800
you know at the level of the cell and

1333
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:03,839
then the bio

1334
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,839
electrical or the other chemical

1335
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:08,559
electrics or the bioelectrics of the

1336
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:09,839
membrane

1337
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:12,559
and then you the next level that i can

1338
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,559
kind of see it more plausible is brain

1339
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:15,440
waves you know

1340
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,599
and you've got this overlap then maybe

1341
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,440
there's some quantum effect

1342
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,079
but then in between that i i'm it's

1343
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:23,359
probably more

1344
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,760
action is more classical in terms of how

1345
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,599
you pick things up it's literally like

1346
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:30,240
i just keep doing it and in a very rough

1347
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,680
and ready way i extract

1348
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,400
some sense of how it is to pick up an

1349
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:34,880
apple

1350
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,920
or something you know and i'm inferring

1351
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,880
things in a more classical way so there

1352
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,960
that i think there's a mixture of a

1353
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,240
classical and not only

1354
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,520
past partially knowable set of

1355
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,440
information transfer and maybe some more

1356
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,079
quantifiable stuff which maybe is

1357
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:55,520
i don't know if it gives you more

1358
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,839
accuracy at that level but

1359
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:01,040
um might be more quantum like but i i'm

1360
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:01,440
not

1361
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,559
that's that's my thoughts

1362
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,559
um okay uh so just to dean the question

1363
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:09,280
was

1364
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,880
what's in between the model and the

1365
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,400
inference okay

1366
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,599
is that what you asked yeah so

1367
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,000
let's just kind of go into that so what

1368
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:18,720
by model

1369
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,079
you mean the actual code as you wrote it

1370
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:23,680
on the computer or the actual

1371
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,079
systems diagram like the model you mean

1372
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:27,839
what's on the computer or what's on the

1373
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:28,960
paper is that what you

1374
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,640
mean that's the product of the model

1375
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,839
and then the inference is um the

1376
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,800
computation that the model does or is it

1377
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:39,599
is the

1378
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,079
inference how we then look at that model

1379
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:45,359
and then decide how we should do policy

1380
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:48,240
because yeah it's it's literally in it's

1381
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,119
it's moment

1382
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:52,400
by moment it's that it's the smallest

1383
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,599
time smallest of time frames relative to

1384
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,040
the

1385
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,440
the end the endgame or the end product

1386
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,960
how do people

1387
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,880
typically they put a plan in between

1388
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,079
those two bookends

1389
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:06,640
that's how they parameterize and so what

1390
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,119
i'm curious is what other people think

1391
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,599
actually is in there because i know we

1392
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:13,359
see a plan

1393
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:16,480
where we're given a plan but

1394
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,880
i'm not sure that that's exactly what's

1395
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,319
going on so i was just curious what

1396
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:21,359
other people

1397
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:25,119
thought is going on blue

1398
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,720
so like i'm not sure that i'm

1399
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,800
also like understanding the questions so

1400
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,240
there's like the generative

1401
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:36,319
model and the predictive model

1402
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:39,040
right so there's these two models and so

1403
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,160
the generative model

1404
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,440
is like the model that you like have

1405
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,440
um daniel probably have a better way to

1406
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,760
say that and then the predictive model

1407
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,200
is in my mind that's the plan like i

1408
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,319
predict

1409
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:55,520
that if i invest in crypto

1410
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,079
i will have 10 more money at the end of

1411
00:50:58,079 --> 00:50:59,680
the year or whatever right like so

1412
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,720
that's my prediction

1413
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,720
that's my predictive model that's my my

1414
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,480
my plan so in my mind

1415
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,599
those two things are are synonymous but

1416
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:08,800
but maybe daniel can

1417
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,440
can clarify or speak to that in a better

1418
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,319
way

1419
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,160
thank you blue um i think i try to just

1420
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,680
take what you wrote

1421
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,280
annotated a little bit the internal

1422
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,040
states is a generative

1423
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:22,079
model of the niche and

1424
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,480
that includes the agent's action in the

1425
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,119
niche

1426
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:28,079
like i can see myself going on a walk

1427
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:28,960
every morning

1428
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,400
that's like a combination of a

1429
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,640
trajectory of action

1430
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,119
and affordances and a niche and other

1431
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:36,480
regularities and other

1432
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,480
availabilities shoes or something like

1433
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,480
that and then there's the actual

1434
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,760
generative process

1435
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,880
and the generic process is like the part

1436
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,319
that is the play and also where

1437
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,960
cybernetics theories like the quote good

1438
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:51,680
regulator

1439
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,160
theory come into play because the

1440
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,839
cybernetics is like well you have to be

1441
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:57,440
effective you have to have all the

1442
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,160
variables

1443
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,040
in your um environment but then we can

1444
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:01,599
look at

1445
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:04,240
for example alternate understandings of

1446
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,440
astronomy

1447
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,559
and there might be evolutionarily

1448
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:11,280
adequate different understandings of

1449
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,720
astronomy

1450
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,720
that allow individuals to deal with

1451
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,880
irregularities in their environments

1452
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,800
for the niche that they're in given

1453
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,240
their affordances

1454
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,520
so the gen but the sort of realism take

1455
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,440
would be that it's the same moon

1456
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,960
and sun at the chart you know the

1457
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,880
fibonacci spiral all these things you

1458
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,000
can do

1459
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,119
but it's about the narrative of policy

1460
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:34,640
under that generative model the niche

1461
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,319
but it's the same market that it gives

1462
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:36,800
me an

1463
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,839
ability to act in a non

1464
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:42,640
a surprised way as opposed to using

1465
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:43,920
surprise all

1466
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,559
which is this kind of metric which i can

1467
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,640
kind of use both in my retina and my

1468
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,559
nerves and everything is this kind of

1469
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,760
general awareness

1470
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,800
of how much of a variation has been

1471
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,760
but surprise and you know something can

1472
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,520
happen to me once

1473
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,240
and i make big decisions on that and

1474
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,520
that is

1475
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,440
sort of basically sitting on top of all

1476
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,119
this activity sort of need to know

1477
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,559
as an animal because and and um there's

1478
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,319
a there's a great presentation on this

1479
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,839
and i can't

1480
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:15,839
at one point in history basically we

1481
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:17,119
have to add in

1482
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:19,839
who into our environment so up to then

1483
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:20,720
it was just like

1484
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,880
how apart and sometimes things fit

1485
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,559
multiple categories so

1486
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:26,800
how do we explain that with a plan no

1487
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,400
because that's fluid

1488
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,319
that's just dependent upon how you're

1489
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:31,440
looking at it

1490
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,839
and sometimes you'll you'll talk to the

1491
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,359
person beside you and say do you see

1492
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,160
what i see

1493
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,559
which then you you've you've already

1494
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:40,559
pointed that out a couple of times

1495
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:42,800
in this conversation so i'm just trying

1496
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:43,599
to figure out

1497
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:44,960
what's in there is i think it's more

1498
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,760
than a plan and i'd hate to default just

1499
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:48,400
to that

1500
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,480
or over reduce just to that because i

1501
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,480
think that's part of the problem

1502
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,839
when we're trying to figure this stuff

1503
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:56,240
out

1504
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:59,919
dean and um blue

1505
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,720
so definitely there is a who and i think

1506
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,000
that that really

1507
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,319
like loops us back around to the point

1508
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:07,119
of this uh

1509
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,920
fields and glaze book paper that there's

1510
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:10,559
this

1511
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:13,599
intrinsic contextuality and and so you

1512
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:14,400
can't really

1513
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,839
effectively model contextuality

1514
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:20,720
unless it's you can remove the intrinsic

1515
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:21,440
component

1516
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,359
right like so when you can when you can

1517
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:26,640
remove the the subjective aspect like

1518
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,240
i mean we had a conversation i don't

1519
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,280
remember if it was last week or two

1520
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,319
weeks ago about like

1521
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:32,559
at a dinner party like how was the food

1522
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:33,760
did you have a good time like

1523
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,200
or not did you have like how was the

1524
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,280
food was it fun and so all of this

1525
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,000
is like you know there's no objective

1526
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:40,799
answer

1527
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:43,040
to these questions it's going to be

1528
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,720
different for all the 15 people that

1529
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,160
were at the dinner party right like

1530
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,760
some person liked the food some person

1531
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,839
had fun one person didn't one person

1532
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:51,280
you know thought the food was cold or

1533
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,720
didn't like the dessert or whatever

1534
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:53,359
right there's

1535
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:55,359
the subjective experience so it's really

1536
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:57,040
difficult to separate

1537
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,799
the who from contextuality

1538
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:05,359
nice questions and uh answer stephen

1539
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,920
yeah this is very this is very important

1540
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,040
actually what you're saying

1541
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,680
i mean i think this also ties into this

1542
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,160
idea

1543
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,720
of what it means when we do planning and

1544
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,400
also how we think of

1545
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,400
planning and start to extrapolate that

1546
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,280
so generally speaking in the

1547
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,119
in the everyday sense of planning we

1548
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:25,119
have like some sort of shared

1549
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:27,440
something in the niche like we have a

1550
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,359
plan we often make plans

1551
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,839
if not it's somehow there in some verbal

1552
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,680
semantic thing which isn't just in my

1553
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,440
head it is in the niche it's sort of in

1554
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,079
this

1555
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:39,680
semantic niche and but the the idea for

1556
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:40,559
instance of

1557
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:43,839
how does my body know the plan for

1558
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:45,920
getting on a street car

1559
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,440
right when the doors open right i i know

1560
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,960
how to do that

1561
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,559
um and it's not but that kind of plan

1562
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,400
has to come from somewhere and it's much

1563
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:56,960
more

1564
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,520
there you know i mean so they get all

1565
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,200
merged together but the

1566
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,240
um and that maybe is partly in our niche

1567
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,440
in the way that we have the right sort

1568
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,640
of shoes on we

1569
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,559
we set up the design you know because we

1570
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:10,400
have some control

1571
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,079
but then even when you get into other

1572
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:13,599
areas of the niche okay i

1573
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:16,160
come across a particular cliff in a

1574
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:16,960
mountain

1575
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,119
and i i'm you know i'm not from the

1576
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:20,640
modern world so i haven't got all the

1577
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,559
technology

1578
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:25,599
right but you can reinterpret the past

1579
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:28,839
right yeah that's uh not within our

1580
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:30,559
affordances

1581
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:34,160
it's we can only infer on certain things

1582
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,880
but we have causal agency and actually

1583
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:37,839
in the spm

1584
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:40,799
textbook there are some integrals that

1585
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:41,599
are like from

1586
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:43,440
all of the time series together just

1587
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,640
like sort of matches all the time

1588
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:45,359
together

1589
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:46,400
and there's other ones that are

1590
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,960
calculated like up to that moment

1591
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,359
in a sliding window and then it says

1592
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,119
that's what makes it causal

1593
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:55,200
is we've restricted the analysis to only

1594
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,000
the previous states

1595
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,760
that's kind of how mathematically

1596
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,839
causality is defined as is like well if

1597
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:03,680
it's lagged in time

1598
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:07,040
or if you slide a window as the

1599
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,599
arrow of time you know changes but then

1600
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:10,880
that's not the same thing as the arrow

1601
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,960
of time or the experience of time or

1602
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:13,760
anything like that

1603
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,920
so yep but then this local logic slide

1604
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,520
was just to say that um

1605
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,520
and to also continue this discussion on

1606
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,040
contextuality

1607
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,480
it's the local settings so how can i

1608
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,480
where does this matter and how does this

1609
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,520
expand the discussion

1610
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,839
hopefully lead to more powerful models

1611
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:33,200
is um

1612
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,720
if you're not playing with the local

1613
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,559
rules

1614
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:40,160
then you're not playing the game and so

1615
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,480
you're going to semantically lose

1616
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,760
against nature if there's organization

1617
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,280
in a way that attempts to violate

1618
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,200
local logic like if there's some

1619
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,640
equivalence between heat

1620
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,200
and computation in our current

1621
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,400
understanding

1622
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,520
and you design a machine that just

1623
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,440
violates those rules like you don't plan

1624
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,960
to dissipate a certain amount of heat

1625
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,559
given how much computation

1626
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:06,000
it's like you're not designing within

1627
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,359
the rules of the system you're just

1628
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:09,359
making a poor computer

1629
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:11,680
and so we're talking about communication

1630
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:12,880
though and

1631
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,200
information transfer that's meaningful

1632
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,079
so

1633
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:18,160
what are the local logics for

1634
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,520
communication

1635
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:20,640
what are the local logics that are

1636
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,920
shared by people who speak the same

1637
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,680
language versus all languages

1638
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,559
versus all ages and things like that

1639
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:28,160
what's the shared

1640
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,880
context that lets us communicate what we

1641
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:37,839
need or how we should act together

1642
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,160
what else what would be a fun slide to

1643
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:46,720
go to

1644
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:51,839
or just topic to go to

1645
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,680
it mentions ergodicity there that might

1646
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,599
just be interesting to see his take on

1647
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:58,400
that

1648
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,920
yeah you know

1649
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,960
blue do you remember but um i feel like

1650
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,599
arrogancy wasn't

1651
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:09,599
we can look actually in the paper itself

1652
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:11,119
let's just see if it's used

1653
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:14,400
there we go not used in the paper itself

1654
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,520
but uh we put it in there for some

1655
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,880
reason

1656
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,880
partially related to these um kind of

1657
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,160
what we're talking about now

1658
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,400
in a way like as you're bringing up it's

1659
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,400
relevant

1660
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,599
um of a term but yeah it might be

1661
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,119
there's a question about

1662
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:32,640
it raises that question because it's

1663
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,119
such a big part of active inference

1664
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:38,880
how those two things relate

1665
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,559
because it seems to be able to get at

1666
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:42,240
some of the questions

1667
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,680
without the need necessarily for

1668
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,520
ergodicity in the same way

1669
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:51,200
but maybe i'm not reading into it

1670
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,440
um but i've got a feeling that it may

1671
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,880
not require it because you have these

1672
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,000
spaces

1673
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,359
that maybe have inherent

1674
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:02,559
ways of obtaining knowledge or

1675
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:04,799
information between these different

1676
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:05,680
types of

1677
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:09,759
you know morphological transformations

1678
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,440
okay i think here is where we asked it

1679
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,880
so this is

1680
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,000
the quote um in the paper

1681
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,200
um they're talking about contextuality

1682
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,319
by default

1683
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,559
and they say the criterion effectively

1684
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:25,440
generalizes

1685
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,599
the intrinsic contextuality of quantum

1686
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:28,480
theory

1687
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,079
so the one that we know of with the wave

1688
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,920
in the particle and the entanglement

1689
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,799
spooky action stuff to the case in which

1690
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:36,799
other properties of a context e.g the

1691
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,280
order in which questions are asked

1692
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,880
also affect the distribution of a

1693
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,400
variable of interest

1694
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,440
so it's like 20 questions

1695
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,280
if you go down one branch first

1696
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,160
it's going to be like a bifurcation with

1697
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,000
a question and communication is like a

1698
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,200
bifurcation

1699
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,680
whereas in the telegraph in the shannon

1700
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,040
info theory

1701
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:02,079
it's like if a signal is garbled and it

1702
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,280
doesn't come through it's like it's a

1703
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:03,680
lost

1704
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,400
transmission but semantically it it

1705
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,599
might ruin the file

1706
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:09,200
but at the level of the message it just

1707
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,680
wasn't transmitted accurately

1708
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:14,400
but um so it bifurcates the meaning of

1709
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:15,440
the file

1710
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,599
but from a signal to noise it didn't

1711
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:19,520
have a categorical bifurcation

1712
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,680
maybe only one bit in a million was

1713
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:22,720
actually flipped

1714
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,880
and that was just a stochastic thing but

1715
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,880
when we think about semantic information

1716
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:27,680
flow

1717
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,720
the order in which the information flows

1718
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,359
especially in a dialectical or in an

1719
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:35,119
ecological context

1720
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:39,040
is like the whole topic information flow

1721
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,440
is improvised or at the very least it's

1722
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:42,960
it's engaging

1723
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,280
so it's not just letters on the page

1724
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,799
re-capitulated but it's something

1725
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:50,839
informational

1726
01:01:50,839 --> 01:01:52,880
stephen yeah that that

1727
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,280
that's important and that ties into the

1728
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,480
idea of

1729
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:59,440
um how much there's like with shannon

1730
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,039
entropy or there's the idea of a signal

1731
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:02,480
there's something in the signal

1732
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,160
and you're losing some of it now with um

1733
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,480
kristen's work it's the idea but it's

1734
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,799
it's it's all non-linear and you're you

1735
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:12,799
need the action

1736
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:16,000
so that you can compare um

1737
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,799
the um the way that the the signal

1738
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:20,160
changes are happening

1739
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,799
to infer something from the noise so to

1740
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:24,640
speak you need the action but in this

1741
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,000
case

1742
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,400
it's like there's another way to sort of

1743
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,559
say there's an inherent

1744
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:32,559
something out there so to speak there's

1745
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:35,280
sort of something in the signal

1746
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,559
um it's not just only the action needed

1747
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:39,920
which is probably why then this can be

1748
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,400
applied to bayesian inference and not

1749
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,400
only active inference because

1750
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,760
the saying there's something inherent

1751
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,200
you don't only need the action and

1752
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,559
you're getting it

1753
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:51,200
because of the order in which the

1754
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,880
questions are asked

1755
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,640
um and that order

1756
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,160
actually that's interesting then that

1757
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,520
that isn't often how i thought of

1758
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,599
contextuality i just think about

1759
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:03,680
contextuality is where am i you know

1760
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,280
what i mean and what's happening

1761
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:09,920
but what order did what happened happen

1762
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,960
give me something is new for me

1763
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,559
no yep when are we

1764
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,720
and when were we there all those

1765
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,759
questions blue

1766
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:24,160
so i have a comment on ergodicity but

1767
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,039
can you back up

1768
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:27,680
to the uh cone cocoon diagram because i

1769
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,520
think that this is why we brought it up

1770
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:32,640
yes so here

1771
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,359
in this cone cocoon diagram the one on

1772
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:36,480
the top

1773
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,200
right like so so you see this um

1774
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,000
information

1775
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,799
channel c right that that relates all

1776
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:44,319
these classifiers a1

1777
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:47,280
a2 all the classifiers are linked to

1778
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,480
this

1779
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,799
core information channel and that that

1780
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:52,240
kind of um

1781
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,640
doesn't really imply like a a

1782
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,079
distributed system

1783
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:58,799
it applies like a centralized control

1784
01:03:58,799 --> 01:03:59,119
but

1785
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:02,240
um we brought up ergodicity because

1786
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,599
if if you look down in the second

1787
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:06,400
picture here from c to d

1788
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,319
there's this commuted commutative

1789
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:09,680
property that is

1790
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,520
or i guess it's even in the top picture

1791
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,520
so it's this the g's right like the

1792
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,559
commutative

1793
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:17,680
um aspect of the cone cocoon

1794
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,839
um diagram and so i think that that's

1795
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:21,440
where where the ergodicity

1796
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,960
um came into this paper

1797
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,200
right like the fact that that all uh

1798
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,319
properties are

1799
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:30,240
available to all points in the in the

1800
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,079
cone cocoon

1801
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:35,039
cool and also you know these topics can

1802
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:36,160
go

1803
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,079
expand beyond the narrow and the

1804
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:39,200
technical but

1805
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,200
let's think about a technical definition

1806
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,520
of sampling ergodicity so not taking on

1807
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:44,240
all the

1808
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:47,680
um experiential elements per se but a

1809
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:50,400
remember is a classifier so it's a two

1810
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:50,880
space

1811
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,880
scarlet letter a that's what's being

1812
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,559
represented with the

1813
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:57,599
and it itself is a classifier

1814
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,960
because when we were talking about the

1815
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,200
two spaces there was like it could be

1816
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,599
the um types of a computer language and

1817
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:05,280
then what their descriptions are

1818
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,760
so this is like cats are small you know

1819
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:08,880
horses are big

1820
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,559
this is my classifier you know big and

1821
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:12,240
small and then horse and cat

1822
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,599
and then just which one's big which one

1823
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:15,839
is small so it's a two space

1824
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:19,359
informally um and then here is

1825
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:22,400
a different true space a2 at a different

1826
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,920
time maybe it's time point two

1827
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,319
maybe it's person two maybe it's all the

1828
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:28,079
people so here's me

1829
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:30,640
a sub k all the k people or all the k

1830
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:31,760
moments

1831
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,599
and whether it's one person through time

1832
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:35,280
if you ask the question you get the same

1833
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,400
quantized response

1834
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,799
yes the cat is smaller than the horse

1835
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:40,720
because cat's small horse big

1836
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,359
if you always get that response back

1837
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:44,640
semantically

1838
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,880
then you're sampling from ergodicity

1839
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,640
with respect to

1840
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:51,760
that question so there's it's a big

1841
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,359
topic with like what it means in physics

1842
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:54,640
and everything like that but just from a

1843
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,079
sampling perspective if there's

1844
01:05:56,079 --> 01:05:58,640
k people in the room and you sample in

1845
01:05:58,640 --> 01:05:59,760
all 100 of them

1846
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,760
or every time you sample 70 out of 100

1847
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,200
give you an answer

1848
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:06,640
that's the sampling ergadicity and then

1849
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,480
here are c and d which are like two

1850
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,079
observers

1851
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:13,039
and they're kind of co-sampling but they

1852
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:15,200
can only see the raw data

1853
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,520
so they're able to see all just what we

1854
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,119
were getting at with the top part

1855
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:21,039
just like this is like sampling across

1856
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:23,520
informally population or through time

1857
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:25,200
and then it's ergodic if there is a

1858
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,559
stationarity there

1859
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:28,640
here that is the same scenario but now

1860
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,079
there's two observers

1861
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:32,559
and then if they are related in this

1862
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:34,640
very specific way

1863
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,359
then it opens up a lot of connections

1864
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:38,720
semantically between c

1865
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:46,160
and d

1866
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:48,400
also sarah added in the chat that

1867
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:51,680
salience is a time dependent phenomena

1868
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:54,319
and uh that's extremely true so

1869
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:55,359
everything that we talk about with

1870
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:56,480
attention

1871
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,559
and salience and surprise those are like

1872
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:00,799
almost explicitly time-bound

1873
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:02,559
processes and even in machine learning

1874
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:04,400
when people talk about oh it's a neural

1875
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,079
network with attention

1876
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:08,319
or with recurrence they're kind of

1877
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:10,079
talking about a time

1878
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:13,119
element but anything that's

1879
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:14,559
where it's not just a snapshot that

1880
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,839
moves state to state but there's

1881
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,520
something that's captured across

1882
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:20,640
time steps and that's called attention

1883
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:24,799
sometimes so it's kind of like

1884
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:27,440
it's actually a similar way to how it's

1885
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:31,119
used in a modeling framework here

1886
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:37,200
this was one question that we had in

1887
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,200
0 and beyond and hopefully got to ask

1888
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,839
chris a little bit but

1889
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:43,359
like what

1890
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:46,960
um are examples or how can we

1891
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,039
you know what's the next question to ask

1892
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:50,640
or what's the next

1893
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:53,760
system to explore this way that was one

1894
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,119
set of questions also if anyone in live

1895
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:59,440
chat has any questions we can definitely

1896
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,000
look at those

1897
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,799
what else would be interesting i mean

1898
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:07,920
there's a few more slides that we

1899
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,039
haven't

1900
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:13,920
looked at that we could kind of explore

1901
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,799
so maybe one element here is oh yeah go

1902
01:08:18,799 --> 01:08:21,040
ahead steven sorry well just just once

1903
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,799
he talked about and maybe this is

1904
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:24,319
something he brought up as a

1905
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:26,799
as a slightly new advancement he talked

1906
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:29,040
about separability

1907
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,319
separability um as a sort of

1908
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:34,479
he positioned that sort of center stage

1909
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:37,120
during his slides when he did his

1910
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:41,198
introduction um as maybe a way to

1911
01:08:41,198 --> 01:08:44,479
i don't know think about contextuality

1912
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:48,479
um in a more tractable way um

1913
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:51,279
yeah i wondered if that was you know was

1914
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:51,600
that

1915
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,198
how did that come up was that something

1916
01:08:53,198 --> 01:08:54,640
oh that's interesting was that a little

1917
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,399
bit surprising that he

1918
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:59,679
when he did that um yeah great

1919
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:01,839
question and point so i just searched in

1920
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:02,719
the

1921
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:04,839
document there's two spots where it's

1922
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:06,080
mentioned

1923
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,920
they write we have previously shown how

1924
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,520
inference can be represented using the

1925
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,198
formalism of this paper

1926
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:12,880
employing only the quantum theory of

1927
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,960
separable systems and the thermodynamics

1928
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,960
of measurement interactions

1929
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,960
so there's the citation to fields and

1930
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,960
glazebrook to explore that more but i

1931
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,158
think

1932
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:24,319
from what we're talking about here's an

1933
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:25,600
interesting part

1934
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,880
that um is related to two spaces it is

1935
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,080
often the case

1936
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:33,120
that two spaces may be separable or

1937
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,040
other types but let's just

1938
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:38,158
focus on the separable element um

1939
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:39,679
i.e both separable so it could be

1940
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:40,799
separable it's almost like you could

1941
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:42,158
have another two space you know which

1942
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:43,040
two spaces

1943
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:46,080
a through z are separable or not so

1944
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,560
there's separables equality and then it

1945
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,080
says separable

1946
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:53,198
means all rows are distinct extensional

1947
01:09:53,198 --> 01:09:54,800
means all columns are distinct so

1948
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,400
actually the transform that goes between

1949
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,320
them is probably the transpose

1950
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:01,679
the t in r

1951
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:03,520
and then if it's separable on columns

1952
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:04,960
and you transpose it it's separable on

1953
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:05,679
rows

1954
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:07,520
so that's like a relationship that's

1955
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,040
kind of a high level but it's

1956
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,880
maintained when you transform it back

1957
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,080
and forth like blue is saying

1958
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:14,400
add subtract add subtract you can

1959
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:15,360
transpose

1960
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:18,480
the matrix back and forth um

1961
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,159
so separable meaning the rows are

1962
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:22,320
distinct so let's just think about

1963
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:25,040
the case of the chew space as a

1964
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,320
descriptor

1965
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,560
just which was one of the uh ways that

1966
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,000
they used it so like the

1967
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,040
types as types of processes kind of so

1968
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:34,000
if it's separable

1969
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,239
it's like they're distinguishable types

1970
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:38,080
sometimes that's also called a full rank

1971
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,560
matrix where it's like every row and

1972
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:41,120
column

1973
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,760
matters uniquely and informationally

1974
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:45,120
there's no doubled rows

1975
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,960
where you could condense the matrix by

1976
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,719
saying actually there's five of this row

1977
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:50,719
and so this or this row is a linear

1978
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:52,719
combination of this other row

1979
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:56,159
stephen yeah that

1980
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:58,880
that um this this is good to bring it

1981
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,960
back here that because it's uh

1982
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,880
this is sort of the applications of it

1983
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,679
and um the separability

1984
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:08,239
um i think there's more that can be

1985
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:09,840
looked at with this over time

1986
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:10,880
i think this is obviously something

1987
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,960
that's going to be quite

1988
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:15,760
appliable and it also relates to you

1989
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:18,159
know this idea of self-organization

1990
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:21,520
and planned organization so you you know

1991
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:24,640
how much are things um

1992
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:28,239
uh able to to to

1993
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:31,440
infer things because of the

1994
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:34,719
um the separability um

1995
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:37,840
that in itself um

1996
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:41,600
maybe changes what's possible um

1997
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:44,320
yeah actually here's a quote we haven't

1998
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:45,280
looked at

1999
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,880
this is really interesting though in

2000
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,719
working set theoretically so

2001
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:51,360
with this sort of set approach to choose

2002
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,480
basis

2003
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,400
there's considerable scope for the

2004
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,159
choice of arguments in the choose space

2005
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,360
as well as the choice of the

2006
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,640
corresponding relation

2007
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,880
r because we get to choose the spaces

2008
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:01,679
and the map

2009
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:04,080
so we can you know map from various

2010
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,120
things to various things

2011
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:08,000
different ways these and so what kinds

2012
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:08,400
of

2013
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,640
things can we do probabilistic in

2014
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:12,960
particular conditional relationships

2015
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,800
so that's like all of computation and

2016
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,400
stats bayesian

2017
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:19,600
fuzzy type relationships fuzzy logic

2018
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,040
fuzzy math

2019
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:24,560
um spatial observations

2020
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,960
object identification and merological

2021
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:28,719
reasoning this isn't a paper to look

2022
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:30,560
into that means parts and holes

2023
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,640
how they're related to each other and

2024
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,320
dual process theories of cognition

2025
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:38,159
so that's bringing it to the cognitive

2026
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:41,120
neuro and to even the neuro scientific

2027
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,960
numerous examples are discussed in the

2028
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,239
paper and they are

2029
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:46,159
it's um it's a double paper but it's

2030
01:12:46,159 --> 01:12:48,159
very informative

2031
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:51,120
and so all these kinds of things are

2032
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:51,920
kind of what

2033
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,960
is adjacencies for the two space dean

2034
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,480
and then anyone else dave if you have

2035
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,159
any thoughts after dean otherwise no

2036
01:12:58,159 --> 01:12:59,679
worries

2037
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:02,320
i just could you go back to that cocoon

2038
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,559
thing

2039
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:09,280
yeah that one there the bottom one it's

2040
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:10,400
interesting because

2041
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:13,199
when i read looked at that in the paper

2042
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:14,800
it took me back to some

2043
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:18,080
stuff i did about um that diamond

2044
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:20,560
shape and how that symbolically relates

2045
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:21,600
to opening up

2046
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,239
which you mentioned daniel and and self

2047
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:26,320
organization which stephen

2048
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:29,520
mentioned um we see that when we see a

2049
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:30,159
diamond

2050
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:33,120
uh designating a high occupancy vehicle

2051
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,080
lane

2052
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,320
and the sort of way that that frees you

2053
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:37,440
up as long as you

2054
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,600
meet a minima in terms of the number of

2055
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,520
people in your in your vehicle

2056
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,880
and we used to talk about that idea

2057
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:50,080
of how these spaces

2058
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,000
are there even though you may not be

2059
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,360
necessarily

2060
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:56,800
noticing that um

2061
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,760
yeah that's that's even if we don't

2062
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:01,520
formally look at it that way

2063
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,360
there's all sorts of examples around us

2064
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,040
of when that's actually occurring

2065
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,360
so i just thought i'd point that out it

2066
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:08,920
may not have

2067
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,480
necessarily do those kind of

2068
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,239
associations but again if you're

2069
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:13,920
trying to bring this kind of information

2070
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:16,000
to people and go well here's an example

2071
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:16,560
of

2072
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,640
where we're actually doing this stuff we

2073
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,480
may not be aware of it

2074
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:24,239
but it's it's going on this that's

2075
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:25,920
as soon as i saw that that's what kind

2076
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:29,199
of made me smile

2077
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:32,159
cool thanks for that association there

2078
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:34,400
dave

2079
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,880
this is not addressing any specific

2080
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:37,920
point

2081
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:41,040
but gregory bates and a number of times

2082
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:44,159
observe the cyberneticians getting

2083
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:47,600
stuck by talking about random inputs

2084
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,600
random inputs he says look stop thinking

2085
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,360
about random i want you to think about

2086
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:53,920
noise we're now going to talk about

2087
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:54,880
organization

2088
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:58,400
from noise and i think part of the point

2089
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:58,800
is

2090
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:01,760
noise is more clearly relative to your

2091
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:04,960
values and your plans

2092
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:08,320
yes very nice and also affordances which

2093
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:08,640
are

2094
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:12,159
semantic like even years ago when i was

2095
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:13,760
learning about shannon information

2096
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:15,600
theory i thought i can be

2097
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,920
symbolically surprised by the characters

2098
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,120
on a page but if i don't speak the

2099
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,320
language

2100
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,080
who's to say whether the information is

2101
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,360
really there so there has to be

2102
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:25,120
something else here

2103
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,960
that's helping address the situations

2104
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,480
that are meaningful or not

2105
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:30,800
because it's not just about how rare the

2106
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,480
character is

2107
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:35,040
in a world where just one word can mean

2108
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:35,840
a lot

2109
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:38,560
at the right time in the right context

2110
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,960
stephen

2111
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:45,280
yeah the the idea that you're

2112
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:48,480
you're you you need to constrain certain

2113
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:49,199
times

2114
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:51,040
or separate i mean i suppose in a funny

2115
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,719
way the car lane i

2116
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:55,280
uh example is quite interesting is you

2117
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:56,000
know you've got

2118
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,840
the the movement of traffic and at some

2119
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:00,159
point the high occupancy vehicle

2120
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:02,480
lane becomes different in terms of

2121
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:03,520
what's on it

2122
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:06,800
as long as you can enforce a rule

2123
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:10,159
oh and you know and communicate it but

2124
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:12,480
and enforce it and that that kind of

2125
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:13,600
idea that you can

2126
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,719
create separability otherwise um

2127
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:20,560
and maybe that that sort of principle of

2128
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:24,320
uh there's some constraints um

2129
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:27,600
implicitly out there i suppose on

2130
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:30,080
what things are gonna do with each other

2131
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:30,960
i suppose

2132
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:34,000
um just like the way water behaves

2133
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
in certain contexts at certain scales

2134
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,400
within our gravitational field

2135
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:42,400
but there's also and i'm not sure how

2136
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:46,000
if i'm over extrapolating but how

2137
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,719
biologically you know you know different

2138
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:49,840
ways we have to

2139
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,600
there has to be some point where you

2140
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,400
have to impose a separability

2141
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:57,120
you know you might need to form an organ

2142
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:57,600
from

2143
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,159
cells to be able to do the next thing

2144
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:01,120
you know to

2145
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,040
to create insulin or something it's not

2146
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,400
just enough to have

2147
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,640
some insulin cells dotted all around the

2148
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:09,120
body you need to have a pancreas

2149
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,360
you know so there needs to be that

2150
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,880
constraint

2151
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,480
you know so that you're in the high

2152
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:16,080
occupancy lane and

2153
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:19,920
that's what's happening so it's um

2154
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,400
you're in the high insulin-producing

2155
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:23,440
cell type

2156
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:24,960
and then at a bigger level you're in the

2157
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,560
high insulin-producing

2158
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:29,120
organ sub-component in the organ and so

2159
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,320
it's this nesting

2160
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:32,400
and there's um uh maybe even an

2161
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:33,440
extraction of

2162
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:34,880
function using what you were talking

2163
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:37,440
about earlier so then sarah wrote in the

2164
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:40,000
chat also about the uh

2165
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,480
definition of the two spaces here saying

2166
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:43,199
that this is

2167
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:46,080
another way in which the ergodicity is

2168
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,440
going to come into play

2169
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:50,239
because uh sarah writes separable is

2170
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:52,000
saying that the event space for a given

2171
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,920
time frame cannot be compressed

2172
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,199
i'm not sure if that implies the

2173
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:57,040
aggregate matrix itself cannot be

2174
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:58,719
compressed reduced in some way

2175
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:01,360
and then here this this by extensional

2176
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:02,320
collapse

2177
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,159
so if you can't collapse the rows and

2178
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:05,600
you can't collapse the columns and you

2179
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,199
can transform it and that still is going

2180
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:08,560
to be like true it's just like it

2181
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:12,239
it's informationally rich

2182
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:14,480
then any repetitions in the rows of

2183
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,159
objects and columns of attributes are

2184
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:17,120
factored out

2185
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:19,600
and also the reason why attributes are

2186
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:20,320
at

2187
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:21,920
time is an attribute if you think about

2188
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:23,840
the object as existing through time

2189
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,520
just like you could measure the color

2190
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,760
every inch of the ruler

2191
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,520
you could measure the length of the

2192
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,199
ruler at every

2193
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:34,239
measurement in 10 time points in

2194
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:35,840
practice this removes unnecessary

2195
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,280
repetitions in the content of

2196
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:38,239
information

2197
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:39,840
hence minimizes the amount of processing

2198
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,280
required by a given algorithm

2199
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:44,719
so if you do 100 measurements of exactly

2200
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:47,920
one meter because the time was

2201
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:50,560
unique that's still 100 measurements so

2202
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,400
the classical approach would be like

2203
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,239
well sounds like we got an answer i mean

2204
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:56,560
look at the p-value it's one meter

2205
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,960
but then here when we retain this rich

2206
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:00,400
contextuality

2207
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:03,840
we actually don't pool even though we

2208
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:06,640
were sampling from erodicity of length

2209
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:09,920
we don't need to pool all of those

2210
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:12,320
measurements together in the same way

2211
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,080
perhaps

2212
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:16,159
and so that is definitely related um

2213
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:17,280
sarah's point that

2214
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:19,920
this matrix the rows or the columns can

2215
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:22,000
be thought of as being temporal

2216
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,760
so when we think about the matrix having

2217
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,760
structure on like a top to bottom or

2218
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,280
left to right way

2219
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:30,800
that can represent structure in time

2220
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,040
like just like you have an eigenvector

2221
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:34,800
you could have an eigenvalue

2222
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:38,239
through time stephen so

2223
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:41,040
if i'm understanding you you could have

2224
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,480
a relatively

2225
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:46,400
um say a small number of

2226
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:49,520
uh observation types but build out

2227
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:52,480
a space because over time you can still

2228
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:52,880
you

2229
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:55,679
the time variable gives you the ability

2230
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:57,360
to

2231
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,840
make that into some sort of space some

2232
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:01,760
sort of topological space it's not

2233
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,440
just a space of different measurements

2234
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:05,199
of different things it's

2235
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:08,239
sort of certain things over time

2236
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:11,360
is that right yep here's an example that

2237
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:12,320
kind of came to mind

2238
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:15,360
um it relates to insect vision so a lot

2239
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,320
of times

2240
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,000
people think about insect vision like oh

2241
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,360
they must see like a bunch of versions

2242
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:20,000
of the world

2243
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,600
but then we think okay well we have two

2244
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,440
eyes and we see one version of the world

2245
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:24,560
so it's probably

2246
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,560
a little more integrated than buggy

2247
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:27,840
putting that aside

2248
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:31,520
what's the resolution of the bugs site

2249
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:32,880
and it turns out that there's some

2250
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,800
insects that only have like one

2251
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:35,840
omittidia

2252
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:38,000
cone so it's like kind of like a one

2253
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:38,960
pixel

2254
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:41,600
camera it's like almost light dark so

2255
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:42,560
you would think

2256
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,320
and if it were on the wall all it could

2257
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:46,800
do is inference light dark in the room

2258
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,679
but because the insect has a body is a

2259
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:50,560
body

2260
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:53,040
it can move so even if it's just light

2261
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:55,120
dark or gradients of

2262
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,520
it's getting like a bit string we can

2263
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,600
think about continuous variables or

2264
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:02,560
just zero one and so can a bit string

2265
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:03,120
encode

2266
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,440
information that's rich like yes like

2267
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:06,800
sports casting

2268
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:09,679
of a sports ball game you say now

2269
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:10,960
they're running from the 30 and they're

2270
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,000
at the 20

2271
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,520
there's a person and they're at the 10

2272
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:14,800
and so that's a string but it

2273
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,159
conveys

2274
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:19,760
action and context so they don't need to

2275
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:20,480
take

2276
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:23,760
the 4k video in order to know whether to

2277
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:24,239
run

2278
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:26,560
or walk and that's actually really

2279
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:27,440
related to

2280
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:30,719
carl fristin's woodlice example which he

2281
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:33,520
claims is the origins of some of the

2282
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:43,840
free energy principle kind of

2283
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:48,560
any other um slides we want to go to or

2284
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:50,400
we can just look at the last ones

2285
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,639
otherwise i think it's

2286
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:55,199
been a great conversation and it was

2287
01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:57,199
definitely a

2288
01:21:57,199 --> 01:22:00,320
educational paper and several weeks like

2289
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,840
for the lab we're always happy to have

2290
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,440
new participants

2291
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:05,360
such as yourself dean so thanks a lot

2292
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:07,040
for joining

2293
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:10,400
and yeah this was an interesting

2294
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,320
set of discussions also thanks a lot

2295
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:13,920
sarah for helping on

2296
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:17,760
and and blue 4.0 for 17 because that

2297
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:21,760
that was kind of like how we started

2298
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,679
the conversation in a way in a way that

2299
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:25,840
helped us structure it because there's

2300
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:28,159
a lot to get lost in here blue what do

2301
01:22:28,159 --> 01:22:31,280
you think and then dean

2302
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,840
so you're on the markov blanket side can

2303
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,800
you go back to it yep

2304
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:39,199
so i was really thinking about like i

2305
01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:40,400
have this note in the paper

2306
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,639
so hold on let me find it so in like you

2307
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:44,639
know when we have this markov blanket

2308
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:46,560
it's like the things that we're not

2309
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,800
privy to the information that we like

2310
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,719
don't necessarily

2311
01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:53,600
know about right and so we make a

2312
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:54,480
decision

2313
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,000
we have all of the information that we

2314
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,360
need to make a decision but i was

2315
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:58,080
thinking like

2316
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:01,679
in a system where the markov blanket is

2317
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:04,159
like too big like if there's too many

2318
01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:06,000
things under the markov blanket that we

2319
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,199
don't have access to like how does that

2320
01:23:09,199 --> 01:23:09,600
like

2321
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:13,840
impact our um like ability to act

2322
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:16,560
within the constraints of the system so

2323
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:16,880
like

2324
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:18,800
here it's where they talk about the

2325
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,320
frame problem right like so

2326
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:23,199
where um you know you kind of can't

2327
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:24,880
solve a problem until it's been solved

2328
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,320
already until you know how to solve the

2329
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:27,679
problem like you can't determine the

2330
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:29,360
answer and i think that that's like the

2331
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:30,960
the gist of the frame problem feel free

2332
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:33,040
to like elaborate or or correct me on

2333
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:33,600
that

2334
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:37,600
but um you know i think that that's like

2335
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,960
one of the things that is so difficult

2336
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,320
about a problem like

2337
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:45,280
climate change right like so we can't

2338
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,360
solve the problem like climate change

2339
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:48,800
because we don't know

2340
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:50,719
how many factors are potentially

2341
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:52,719
influencing like we don't necessarily

2342
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:54,800
have the entire context

2343
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:57,920
for the climate change situation

2344
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:59,520
so like i know what i'm doing i know

2345
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:01,199
what my carbon output is

2346
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:02,800
and and like i can research the

2347
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,560
companies that i buy products from etc

2348
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:06,239
but like i don't know what all of the

2349
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:07,920
other nine billion agents in the world

2350
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:08,800
are doing

2351
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,960
and so like we can't you know make

2352
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:13,040
predictions based on our actions

2353
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:14,800
right so like is the markov blanket like

2354
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,120
too big in that situation to

2355
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,800
be able to solve the problem like

2356
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,639
because we're not able to see

2357
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:23,520
directly the uh outcome of our actions

2358
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,199
or like even the actions of our group of

2359
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:26,960
people that are in our network

2360
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:30,320
i was thinking about that

2361
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:33,840
interesting dean and then dave

2362
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:36,960
um just a couple a couple of things

2363
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,840
first of all um thank you for being so

2364
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:41,199
welcoming

2365
01:24:41,199 --> 01:24:43,440
i really appreciate that and the second

2366
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:44,500
thing is is that

2367
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:46,960
[Music]

2368
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:50,639
when i watched last week's um

2369
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:51,920
broadcast because i watched it on

2370
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,320
youtube i felt like i was

2371
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,880
i was a spectator and now that i've been

2372
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,400
a participant but i've been

2373
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:01,360
a participant of a debriefing exercise

2374
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:03,679
so i've actually been a participant

2375
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:06,159
of something that's been separated out

2376
01:25:06,159 --> 01:25:08,080
from what originally happened

2377
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:12,239
and i think that this paper is the same

2378
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:14,800
this is real time what this paper was

2379
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,080
discussing

2380
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:19,199
um so if you want to i don't know if you

2381
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:22,080
could find a better example of where

2382
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,239
that idea of what perspective is and

2383
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:25,760
what

2384
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,679
potentially prismatics are even if we're

2385
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:29,040
not talking about them

2386
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:32,320
we're still playing by their rules um

2387
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,320
again thank you for allowing me to be

2388
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:35,920
one of the

2389
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:37,679
the people in the tile today i just

2390
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:40,000
really really appreciate that

2391
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,880
cool and it's like the paper is the tent

2392
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:43,520
pole

2393
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:46,000
in some ways because it's actually north

2394
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,679
star the reference point but we're

2395
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:48,800
giving our perspective

2396
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:50,880
on it but we shouldn't be disagreeing

2397
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,400
about what the paper is or says we're

2398
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,239
looking at the same slides but then

2399
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:56,719
the richness is actually everyone's

2400
01:25:56,719 --> 01:25:58,080
understanding and contribution just

2401
01:25:58,080 --> 01:25:58,800
wherever

2402
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,560
it is coming from whenever it's coming

2403
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:03,199
from there because what else could

2404
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:08,239
that context provide dave

2405
01:26:08,239 --> 01:26:11,199
yeah i don't want to uh go too far off

2406
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:12,560
track but i noticed the

2407
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:16,000
paper references donald hoffman

2408
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,480
and i don't want to do an injustice to

2409
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:19,600
the good doctor

2410
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:22,639
it may be that um i see him

2411
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:24,800
stepping into it when he didn't really

2412
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,120
with his one

2413
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:31,280
video about the interface is

2414
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:33,760
anywhere you want it to be it doesn't

2415
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:35,440
make any difference

2416
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:38,400
the interface is totally arbitrary maybe

2417
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,320
that's just his billions and billions

2418
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:41,120
moment but

2419
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:42,960
did donald hoffman go down the rabbit

2420
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:44,960
hole a couple of years ago or is he

2421
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:45,679
still doing

2422
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:49,040
good solid work that i can read and not

2423
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:51,440
get my inexpert self thrown down a

2424
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,040
rabbit hole

2425
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:56,159
can't speak to uh the body of work don't

2426
01:26:56,159 --> 01:26:57,440
know it that much but just

2427
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:59,600
i pulled up the citation from the fields

2428
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,120
in glace brook paper

2429
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:03,040
it's a 2015 paper of the interface

2430
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:04,639
theory of perception

2431
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:06,639
and so the way that they that fields and

2432
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:08,000
glazebrook use it in the paper

2433
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,120
is basically to um actually in a way

2434
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,239
that's related

2435
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:15,679
uh to the interfaces

2436
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:17,120
it says equivalently an interface and

2437
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:18,880
that's the citation so the markov

2438
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:20,000
blanket

2439
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:24,000
here is being connected to

2440
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,400
their approach so it's kind of probably

2441
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:27,199
a yes

2442
01:27:27,199 --> 01:27:30,320
and it probably is great insights about

2443
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,800
the interface and then it probably does

2444
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:33,679
matter

2445
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:35,280
where it is or what it is or how it's

2446
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:36,719
modeled so yeah nice

2447
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:40,080
point though stephen

2448
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:42,480
yeah the good good good observation

2449
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:44,000
there i mean there's probably a you know

2450
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,280
there's a reason why chris

2451
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:48,239
fields has got involved in active

2452
01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:50,080
influence because

2453
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:52,320
let's be honest as from my understanding

2454
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,239
of my observations over the last 30 40

2455
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:56,000
years consciousness and

2456
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,719
physicist physicist physicists have kind

2457
01:27:58,719 --> 01:28:00,000
of run the show

2458
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,440
around consciousness and there's been

2459
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:04,000
more and more sort of

2460
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,120
big claims um about uh you know

2461
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:09,440
consciousness which is great and

2462
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:12,480
um this is seen as um

2463
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:14,320
you know and a quant there's a there's a

2464
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:16,080
thing called um

2465
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:18,560
mindell the mindells do the process

2466
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:20,400
orientated psychology

2467
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:23,440
and um some good work but i always

2468
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:25,520
used to like have a bit of a sigh when

2469
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:27,280
quantum got mentioned because i knew

2470
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:28,080
that it was going to be

2471
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:30,960
like even though i knew physics i just

2472
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:32,800
felt and maybe i was wrong but i just

2473
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,840
felt it was being used in a very

2474
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:37,280
trans-personal

2475
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:40,080
slightly hand-wavy way but maybe that

2476
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:40,719
and

2477
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:43,840
now we actually bring it into like

2478
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:45,600
it's not all about the physics it's

2479
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:47,520
about the biology

2480
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:49,679
which is kind of like taking the

2481
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:51,360
physicist physics

2482
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:55,040
area down a peg or two um although now

2483
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,719
kristen could say it takes up a peg or

2484
01:28:56,719 --> 01:28:58,639
two because it's all based on physics it

2485
01:28:58,639 --> 01:28:59,920
depends which way you want to look at it

2486
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:01,360
but um

2487
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:03,120
interesting world let's let's put it

2488
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:04,639
like um thanks

2489
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:07,920
yep in this quote um this is the authors

2490
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:10,560
they're saying that this marco blanket

2491
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:12,719
concept which is map the interface and

2492
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:14,159
all these other ideas like communication

2493
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:16,480
channels it's doing

2494
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:19,760
a double role in these models

2495
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:22,840
which is that it's where free energy is

2496
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:24,960
minimized so it's sort of

2497
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,719
what is going into the function that's

2498
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:28,239
getting minimized if you're

2499
01:29:28,239 --> 01:29:30,159
you might be reducing your water usage

2500
01:29:30,159 --> 01:29:31,679
but what's going into your

2501
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:33,280
actual function that's deciding your

2502
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:34,880
policy that's what's getting minimized

2503
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,080
and then something else might also be

2504
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:36,719
affected

2505
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:38,239
but what's getting minimized are the

2506
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:40,560
blanket states and

2507
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:43,360
it is that epistemic barrier that's

2508
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:44,400
keeping

2509
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:47,440
context what isn't directly measured

2510
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:48,800
that information is hidden from the

2511
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,040
observer so

2512
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:52,719
there's probably a bunch of questions

2513
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:54,800
about this and a lot to say about it but

2514
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:57,920
one big question that i have is um we

2515
01:29:57,920 --> 01:29:58,400
know

2516
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,800
from previous papers that one of

2517
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,719
fristen's innovations

2518
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:05,920
was to separate separability perhaps

2519
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:06,719
separate

2520
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:09,040
the blanket states into outgoing action

2521
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:11,440
states in incoming sense states

2522
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:13,199
now it's possible that there are certain

2523
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:14,480
kinds of models that play

2524
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:17,440
nice in the uh sort of undirected

2525
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:18,239
bayesian

2526
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:21,760
conditional relationship neutral

2527
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:23,520
way because it's sort of like a built-in

2528
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:25,760
bi-directional road it's sort of like

2529
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:28,080
cars going both ways in the same lane

2530
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:29,600
but when we really

2531
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:32,320
make that separation clear and we really

2532
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,600
have some states that have an

2533
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,040
asymmetrical relationship in other

2534
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:35,600
states that

2535
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:38,480
have an asymmetrical relationship it

2536
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:39,600
could be simpler

2537
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:42,400
it could be more difficult so there

2538
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:43,440
might be new

2539
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:44,960
relationships that are enabled by the

2540
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:46,960
separation there might be relationships

2541
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:48,719
that are um put off

2542
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:51,440
for now because it complicates it in a

2543
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:52,320
different way

2544
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:54,400
so i don't know what those would be but

2545
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:55,679
those are just like what could happen

2546
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:57,040
when you split the states or maybe

2547
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:57,840
nothing happens

2548
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:00,320
and it's already been dealt with but

2549
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:01,600
yeah

2550
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:04,320
and then sarah's uh perpetual slide on

2551
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:05,520
the reservoir

2552
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:09,040
computing um

2553
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,960
we had a little oh the next steps were

2554
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:12,080
just from their

2555
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:14,320
words they had three areas and next

2556
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:15,600
steps kind of we'll

2557
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,040
go through this then we'll kind of give

2558
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:19,600
anyone else give a last thought but

2559
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,120
here's the areas where they're taking it

2560
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:23,040
next or where they want to signal

2561
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:26,080
for everyone to take it next so one is

2562
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:28,159
exploring intrinsic contextuality in

2563
01:31:28,159 --> 01:31:29,520
humans it's like

2564
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:32,239
short and sweet apply it to humans so

2565
01:31:32,239 --> 01:31:33,760
we're asking about applied active

2566
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,280
inference about what is the applications

2567
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:36,159
this paper

2568
01:31:36,159 --> 01:31:37,760
they are asking that too they don't need

2569
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:39,600
to go into any more detail

2570
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:42,480
the second question is about how context

2571
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:43,719
switching is implemented

2572
01:31:43,719 --> 01:31:45,920
neurocognitively so like you're talking

2573
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:46,719
to two people

2574
01:31:46,719 --> 01:31:48,080
and you're bilingual and they say

2575
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:49,280
something in one language and the other

2576
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:50,239
person says something a different

2577
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:50,960
language

2578
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:53,840
but semantically you're might not even

2579
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:54,320
be

2580
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:56,800
aware of that difference it might just

2581
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,400
be associated with that person's voice

2582
01:31:58,400 --> 01:31:59,120
or with the

2583
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:01,360
situation so how is that happening in

2584
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:02,639
the brain or

2585
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:04,800
in the body or different animals and

2586
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:06,560
then the third question their broader

2587
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:08,239
question so this is the real you know

2588
01:32:08,239 --> 01:32:09,679
that's the specula no

2589
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:11,679
the third question is whether that

2590
01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:13,440
intrinsic contextuality

2591
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:16,159
can be detected and characterized at

2592
01:32:16,159 --> 01:32:18,400
multiple scales in complex systems

2593
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,719
so this is where it's kind of getting to

2594
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:22,560
the collective intelligence or

2595
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:25,600
distributed computational systems like

2596
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,360
what if there were a signal that we

2597
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:29,040
thought were uninformative but it were

2598
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:32,400
actually reflective of this just immense

2599
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:35,280
wisdom or processing power cognitive uh

2600
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:36,080
dimension

2601
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:37,040
so we might think that we're

2602
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:38,719
communicating with all intelligent life

2603
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:41,199
when we send out the golden

2604
01:32:41,199 --> 01:32:43,280
you know phonograph with the etching of

2605
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:45,520
the fibonacci sequence or a tetrahedra

2606
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:47,600
or our body or something like that

2607
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:49,679
but there could be a whole dimension of

2608
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:51,040
information that's just

2609
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:53,120
at a resolution we're not even

2610
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,320
perceiving

2611
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:56,800
so that would be big of course how would

2612
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:00,880
we detect that a priori with minimal

2613
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:05,199
scale and system dependent assumptions

2614
01:33:05,199 --> 01:33:08,000
which are equivalent to throwing out the

2615
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,880
noise and the signal together

2616
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:13,840
in this way of thinking

2617
01:33:17,199 --> 01:33:19,360
well it would be great to learn more

2618
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:21,199
about these

2619
01:33:21,199 --> 01:33:26,400
topics uh i hope that we can continue to

2620
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:29,840
just have experts on

2621
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:33,600
have all learners and participants on

2622
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,199
because it's kind of

2623
01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:37,760
fun especially when we're talking about

2624
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,280
stuff like this

2625
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:44,800
so um any last yep steven

2626
01:33:48,239 --> 01:33:51,600
you're muted steven yeah just mention

2627
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:52,719
you've got a bit of other

2628
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:54,400
you know the next couple of events that

2629
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,080
are coming up just so that people know

2630
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:58,320
if they're interested um that you're

2631
01:33:58,320 --> 01:33:59,760
going to be talking with um

2632
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:01,840
we're going to be doing the other live

2633
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:04,880
stream oh yes

2634
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:08,239
um let's look at the calendar

2635
01:34:08,239 --> 01:34:12,320
yep so we will

2636
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:16,080
um yep we'll have 18

2637
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:18,639
in the coming two weeks on the

2638
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:21,040
predictive global neuronal workspace

2639
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:23,760
with ryan smith and christopher white uh

2640
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:25,440
hopefully joining for march 23rd and

2641
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:26,800
30th but then also

2642
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:29,199
march 18th in two days we'll have

2643
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:30,560
demetrius bolas

2644
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:33,840
so yeah that will be pretty cool

2645
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:37,120
um thanks everyone for participating

2646
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:42,880
great discussion so fun times
