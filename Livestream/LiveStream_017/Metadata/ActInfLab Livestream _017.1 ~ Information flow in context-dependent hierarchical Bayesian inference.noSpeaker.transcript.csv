"Unknown","00;00;07;08","00;00;36;15","Hello and welcome everyone to Active Inference live to the active inference livestream. Today is March 9th 2021 and we are in live stream 17.1. The Active Inference Lab is an experiment in online team communication, learning and practice related to active inference. You can find us at the links and the contact mechanisms here. This is a recorded and an archived live stream, so please provide us with feedback so that we can be improving on our work."
"Unknown","00;00;37;03","00;01;03;19","All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and we'll be using good video etiquette for livestreams muting. If we're not talking, raising our hands so that we can hear from everyone on the stack and using respectful speech behavior. Here we are today in 17.1 coming fresh off of our fun quarterly roundtable, number one and the first of two weeks discussing this paper with the author Chris Fields."
"Unknown","00;01;03;19","00;01;30;05","And we're going to have a ton of time to get into it today and a follow up discussion next week. Today, our goal is to discuss and learn this awesome paper and area some areas that are probably new to everybody. And today in 17.1, we're just going to introduce ourselves. Say hello, then Chris is going to give a presentation and then we'll be able to ask questions and continue the discussion from there."
"Unknown","00;01;30;20","00;02;11;03","So without further ado, we can get into the introductions and warmups so everybody can just go round, will introduce herself, say hello, and then we can also consider these warm up questions. So after introductions, and anyone wanting to say something on a warm up question, we'll go to Chris's presentation. So I'm Daniel. I'm a post-doc in California, and I'm excited today just to hear all of the things that we missed or missed in 17.0 and learn and recalibrate and correct and I'll pass it to Alex thanks."
"Unknown","00;02;11;22","00;02;49;28","Hi, everyone. My name is Alex Strauss-Kahn. I'm in Moscow, Russia. I'm a researcher in Systems Management School and also co-organizer of Active Conference Club. And I pass it to Scott thank you, Alex. My name is Scott David. I'm the director of the Information Risk Research Initiative at the University of Washington Applied Physics Lab. I'm super excited about the discussion today about information flows we deal in as name sounds and risk flows and information and risk are really hand in hand."
"Unknown","00;02;49;28","00;03;12;03","So this is going to be super exciting today. And I'll pass it to Siri. Hi, my name is Sarah Davis. I'm a science artist and actually current grad student in Philosophy of Science at University of Leipzig. And I'm really looking forward to this talk today. Who else do we have trying to impress? So maybe Shannon first and then."
"Unknown","00;03;12;14","00;03;24;06","Right. Introduce yourself and enjoy. Hi, my name is Shana and I'm a mathematician and grad student in the fall, but I've been doing all this stuff and is now working on a couple of cool things and I support him anyway."
"Unknown","00;03;26;25","00;03;38;09","Cool. So Chris, welcome. Thanks for joining us. And we are looking at Hello Stephen. So Chris, feel free to just introduce yourself and take it away with the presentation."
"Unknown","00;03;40;24","00;04;25;01","OK, thanks, Danielle. Thanks for inviting me to suggest a paper and joining you for this discussion session today. I wanted to start with just a quick presentation to provide some background context on this paper, which is about context written by myself. And Jim Glazebrook, who is a mathematician. We've been working together several years. We actually connected and started working together because we were both interested in the perceptual and attentional phenotypes of one finds on the autism spectrum."
"Unknown","00;04;26;09","00;04;43;28","And that's where we encountered Co-efficient actually, and the whole active inference framework in some of his papers on autism so let me just start this little presentation and that'll give some background for discussion."
"Unknown","00;04;47;25","00;05;11;09","OK, here we go. OK, as I said, just some some context for this paper about context and let's see. OK, so I so get on, on vision and hearing and all that looks perfect then, you know, OK, cool."
"Unknown","00;05;15;22","00;05;57;26","So here's a standard picture from Karl Forster on the theory of active inference Oh, it describes the interaction between some system that has internal states and some system that has external states. And the interaction is mediated by sensory states and active state. So the form are called blanket and when I first encountered this it seemed like a very nice modern statement of ideas that I would trace back to robotics."
"Unknown","00;05;57;26","00;07;01;14","Initially, in terms of the the learned slash explore distinction that one finds in developmental robotics especially. And, and even from there back to the basic theory and ethology where you have the approach avoid distinction of approach of being very similar to explore to acting on the world in order to learn something and avoiding a state in which the organism backs off and tries to figure out what it did wrong so the the theory has a very rich history and I think what it's got its crude formulation due to first he had his colleagues brains to it is a large body of applicable formalism and in fact I would characterize the theory of active inference as"
"Unknown","00;07;01;14","00;07;43;14","it's been presented as perception and cognition from a physics perspective. And the presentation of the theory thus far has been primarily in the language of classical physics and I think that the language of classical physics is actually seriously unsuitable for talking about active inference. It's complicated and messy. And so what I'm going to do today is provide a little bit of background for the from a more quantum theory perspective."
"Unknown","00;07;44;15","00;08;10;13","Know, I consider today just starting with an introductory talk about quantum theory, but that will give us quite the background that we need for this. So I won't be quite so straightforward about quantum theory, but I am I'm happy to answer any questions about it and can go on and on about it as astronomy nerds."
"Unknown","00;08;12;27","00;08;54;21","So what I really wanted to to do is give you another way of looking at active inference, which I would characterize as physics from the perspective of perception and cognition. So taking the idea of observation and reformulating physics, using that idea and you're recognized in the paper, there's a diagram that's sitting next to something that looks a lot like a mark of gold, but so a cocooned diagram represents the internal state of some system, and the external state is completely unspecified."
"Unknown","00;08;54;28","00;09;21;20","All that's happening out there is some dynamics and the job of System A is to learn as much about System Day as it can in order to make good prediction. So this is still active inference just from a different point of view. And looking at it this way, it gets us into a cloud of issues that are all related."
"Unknown","00;09;22;01","00;09;47;25","And I hope by this little introduction to show you how they're related or at least somewhat give you a sense of other related. And also, I'll start this the cycle with system identification, which is the old problem from engineering and cybernetics of figuring out what system you're working with and in physics, this is typically just taken for granted."
"Unknown","00;09;48;12","00;10;27;08","And in biology it's often just taken for granted of but in computing theory, for example, and in what are called device independent protocols in physics now it's not taken for granted system identify creation is up for grabs, intrinsic, contextual. It is the topic of the paper and it has to do with the unavoidable uncollectible effects of unknown contextual variables on measurements being made that clearly related to the question of reference frames, how am I making my measurements?"
"Unknown","00;10;28;09","00;10;59;01","And in fact the first formulation of contextual and physics by cooking inspector was about making measurements with different kinds of apparatus and showing that experimental results could vary even for the same observable based on how what other things were measured the same time this connects to the frame problem for me, which is the problem of of predicting side effects of your actions."
"Unknown","00;10;59;09","00;11;38;09","So side effects of making the measurement in a particular way would be an example. This gets to the problem of memory. If you're going to predict side effects, you have to remember what you've done. And so you have to ask about what are the side effects of recording your memories on plates, because that's a physical action And finally, we get to the question of ensemble sampling and the question of what probability actually means by prior probability is fundamental to Bayesian decision theory, but it becomes problematic to say what does prior probability actually mean?"
"Unknown","00;11;39;09","00;12;05;28","And all of these issues swirl around, at least in my view, one issue, which is the issue of severability. What does it mean to separate the world into a set of systems that then interact? And severability has a very precise meaning in quantum theory. So this is one reason for diving immediately to the quantum theory."
"Unknown","00;12;08;00","00;12;43;13","In quantum theory, the notion of severability is defined in terms of whether a quantum state factors into two quantum states. So if I have a system and I can draw a boundary somewhere in it that divides it into two compartments, A and B, then if the joint state, the state of the entire system maybe factors into a state of A, in a state of B, then this system is separable."
"Unknown","00;12;43;19","00;13;25;07","In other words, it's entangled and entanglement is kind of the natural state of systems in quantum theory, whereas severability is the only state of systems in classical physics. So any has a state and B has a state. And we can specify those two states independently of each other. If this joint system is separate, that means ab of identities and we can talk about their interaction so I want to go back in history to the 18th century and and just mention how strange an idea this is."
"Unknown","00;13;25;28","00;14;02;08","If you think about physics at the time of the plots he was mixing the kind of atom ism of Democritus, the kind of hard sphere, irreducible particle atom ism with the dynamics of Newton and solar plants. His world was a bunch of atoms, each of which was a hard sphere, a monad and they were moving around according to Newton's laws, and Newton's laws act instantaneously."
"Unknown","00;14;02;26","00;14;27;03","So there's no sense in Newton of forces being communicated. The forces are just there. And this is something that Newton was aware of. And here's a quote from Nicholas Dyson, who's been very concerned about this issue of locality in physics. And he, in fact, very beautiful people pointing out that the passion for locality and physics is very recent."
"Unknown","00;14;27;13","00;15;21;22","It comes from Einstein. Einstein invented this idea that information travels at a finite speed. Before that, everything happens instantaneously. So Newton understood that if you go to the moon and move a rock, then everybody's weight on earth changes instantly. Now, that's contextually that's a change here that happens unpreventable due to completely unknown events happening somewhere else. So intrinsic contextual it is closely linked to non locality now in other places."
"Unknown","00;15;21;22","00;16;09;08","World of all these items obey Newton's laws there aren't any boundaries. The no boundaries around systems like the Earth or you or me or a Cannonball. So where do those boundaries come from in the policy in world? They have to be imposed from the outside so we impose a boundary. We slice this picture in two and we say there are two different systems now if you think about that in classical physics, that means that you've created an infinite potential that separates the particles from each other and prevents the Newtonian dynamics from mixing them up."
"Unknown","00;16;10;06","00;16;34;28","And Frank Templar several years ago wrote a beautiful paper published in PNAS showing that if you just start with a class in physics and you remove these singularities the boundaries around objects, you get quantum theory, automatic quote. So the past, in a sense had a theory very much like quantum theory, and he had a notion of the universe very much like entanglement."
"Unknown","00;16;34;28","00;16;58;22","He was full of what Einstein would later call spooky action. The distance OK, so in this picture where we start with the system and we slice it down the middle and call the two parts A and B, we assuming that there's a boundary there, it's not given to us by the physics, and we're assuming that it stays constant over time."
"Unknown","00;16;59;26","00;17;37;14","And in quantum theory, unlike classical physics, the dynamics will automatically erase this boundary. So called dynamics of an isolated system is unitary, and so it mixes everything together into a superposition. So if we say that A and B can be separated out, we'll be effectively assuming is a weak local interaction. That's only well defined for a short period of time, because eventually the dynamics of the joint system will erase the boundary that we've put there."
"Unknown","00;17;40;14","00;18;10;29","OK, but if we have a separable system and if it's finite dimensional we have a perfectly general way of talking about the interaction. We can always write the interaction in this simple summation form. Of the the whole system interaction, which I'll call h d with parentheses, is the sum of what he is doing and what B is doing, and then how they're interacting."
"Unknown","00;18;12;09","00;18;49;14","And this interaction can always be written in the form that I give that I've given below, which is basically a bunch of thermodynamics, members of Degrees of Freedom and Katie and some measure of efficiency times a set of operators and those operators. We can choose a basis where those operators have binary outcomes. So the question they they correspond to ask a yes no questions, which is what John Wheeler postulated, the very foundation of physics was just answers to yes, no questions."
"Unknown","00;18;49;26","00;19;46;23","But we can always do this in quantum theory, and that's why quantum theory is so nice. It allows us to write down a formalism that explicitly describes the interaction between two systems in terms of exchanging information. And this depends on an insight that Boltzmann had in the 1870s and it's really this insight that gives us quantum theory. Boltzmann realized that information always costs energy and what this did was rule out of the way of thinking about measurement that one finds in classical physics, which is that the observer is completely detached from the system and information flows through the system to the observer."
"Unknown","00;19;47;17","00;20;19;29","But but that process of observation doesn't affect the system. And Boltzmann realized that this simply wasn't true. Observers aren't gods if I want to get information, I need to spend some energy and that energy flows back into the world. So by getting some information always affecting what's going on. So from a thermal point of view, these operators of the K implement both perception and action."
"Unknown","00;20;20;04","00;21;03;01","And that becomes key, of course, to understanding active inference, because active inference is about getting information and giving information by active OK, so to sum this up, whenever I have a bipartite system that's finite and it's separable I can write the interaction. Is there anything and X times questions and that looks just like classical communication. I can think of my two systems as agents Alice and Bob, they're always called and they exchange bits, strings, finite bits, strings, so let's think of a specific model."
"Unknown","00;21;03;09","00;21;37;22","Let's suppose that Alice and Bob are each of alternately preparing and then measuring the states of a bunch of independent qubits quantum bits. And we can think of those as electron spins or something like that. So of Alice in some time prepares in electron spins and she hands those to Bob and Bob measures them. And then Bob writes a message by preparing the electron spins in some way and hands over to Alice and Alice measures them."
"Unknown","00;21;37;24","00;22;20;16","So they've now exchanged some bits, but there's no requirement that they use the same Z axis to measure the spins. So if they use exactly the same Z axis to measure their spins, then if Alice writes 1001 Bob is going to measure 1001. But if I also bother using different Z axes to measure their spins, Alice will write 1001 using her Z axis and Bob will get some probability distributions over one and zero for each cubit, measuring it with his axis."
"Unknown","00;22;20;29","00;22;59;13","And the way those probabilities will look will depend on how tilted his Z axis is with respect to Alice's. So this is now an interesting situation and this gets to Daniel's question about Shannon information versus other kinds information with semantics. This is a purely quantum of system. There's nothing to introduce any classical noise. So the information exchanges perfectly symmetrical and completely free of classical noise."
"Unknown","00;23;00;13","00;23;29;00","But by using different reference frames, they introduce quantum noise and specifically what they lose is the message. They lose the semantics from the message. So Alison, codes for this. Bob gets four bits, but the code may have been lost and the code resides in the Z axis if they're using the same Z axis, they share a code. If they're not, they don't."
"Unknown","00;23;29;26","00;24;00;17","So semantics depends on shared reference frames and that's what Shannon, information theory is missing. It's missing the idea of the reference frame that's used to decode the message. It's just counting bits of shading. Theory is just a quantitative theory of bits, a way of counting bits. And what we're really interested in is decoding, encoding and decoding. So we're really interested in reference rates and that will be a central theme."
"Unknown","00;24;00;17","00;24;28;04","That is a central theme in the paper. OK, so sum up, every interaction between finite systems and inseparable joints can be represented in this way. Oh, two agents. And there's separated by a set of bits, set of cubits. That sort of qubits can be thought of as a holographic screen. It functions as a Markov blanket, and the information that encodes is completely specified."
"Unknown","00;24;28;04","00;24;32;24","It's the eigenvalues of the interaction written in its Hamiltonian form."
"Unknown","00;24;34;24","00;25;09;05","So we know everything there is to know about an interaction in terms of a picture like this and this pictures are everywhere in biology. Everyone is now using the market. Markov blanket concept. It's very common in computer science. Exactly the same concept is called an application programing interface, and it can be down between two virtual machines and regulate their communication in cosmology."
"Unknown","00;25;09;05","00;25;38;03","The holographic principle was originally invented to deal with stretch horizons of black holes, so it separates the exterior from the interior, and it specifies exactly how much information can be obtained. If you're an observer on the exterior about the interior and it's symmetrical. So it also specifies exactly what the interior can learn about the exterior. But you also see this concept in particle physics."
"Unknown","00;25;38;13","00;26;15;12","If you're thinking about a scattering interaction, for example, that's mediated by the vector boson, a photon or something like that, say it's electromagnetic scattering, then all of the information is on that vector boson. There's no information about say, entanglement on one side that's communicated to the other side. It's it's just a single value a moment of transfer, for example, that's encoded by this holographic screen OK, so where do we take this?"
"Unknown","00;26;16;14","00;26;40;12","So if you have an observer and she's got a holographic screen and she's interacting with the rest of the universe, Bob, then by looking at her bits string, ours can learn very little. She doesn't know what Xaxis Bob is using. So she gets a message, but she doesn't know what code Bob used. She doesn't know how Big Bob's state space is."
"Unknown","00;26;40;24","00;26;43;29","So Bob could be a small system, could be an enormous system."
"Unknown","00;26;45;29","00;27;16;02","Since she doesn't know the state space, she can't possibly know Bob's state. She doesn't she doesn't know whether Bob State is separable or entangle. So whether there are any divisions in Bob that she has to worry about, she doesn't know the dynamics on the other side, so she can't predict what Bob will do next. And all of this is in principle of looking out at the world I actually don't know that there are any separate objects of it."
"Unknown","00;27;16;17","00;27;50;21","I can't, based on the information that I can get at my boundary, which is just a set of interaction, eigenvalues, and so these questions have to be answered some other way. They can't be answered by observation. They have to be answered by a generative model. So hence active inference is based on what models predict. And what quantum theory tells us about generative models is that there heuristic by definition, they can't be constructed based on the data."
"Unknown","00;27;51;08","00;28;32;10","They're only heuristics. So where do they come from? And here, when we look back at a picture or visual picture of a joint system being divided, I recall that this boundary is arbitrary and it doesn't last very long. So this joint still isn't separable for very long. And the only asymptotic dynamics, the only dynamics that's long lasting is the joint dynamics so else's generative model, which is implemented by herd dynamics, is effectively a sample of the joint dynamics."
"Unknown","00;28;32;23","00;28;57;17","It's just a temporary sample of what would be going on anyway if there was no division. So it makes sense that Alice's generative model contains information about the world, but that information did not come from observation. It came from the time before the boundary was imposed. And it will still be there after the boundary goes away."
"Unknown","00;29;01;09","00;29;46;08","OK, and another thing that quantum theory adds to the active inference picture is that it recognizes that all of the energy that's required to run the calculations also has to come through the Markov blanket. So if you think about the states on a holographic screen, a workable blanket of any information encoding, if that interface is the only interface between the two systems, which is how we defined it here, then some fraction of those bits can't be informative because they have to be burned as fuel."
"Unknown","00;29;47;05","00;30;16;20","So by definition, they're meaningless those tells us again, something very deep, which is that the context of a measurement can never be specified completely and that again is in principle because some of the information on the blanket has to be Burgess fuel, and we see this on the output side too, of course, of some of my output on the world."
"Unknown","00;30;16;20","00;30;50;05","So by action on the world is just dissipating what for me is waste heat, and I have no control over that. It's part of my metabolism of that side effect in the world all the time by dissipating this waste heat, which I don't think of as an action that which is an action from the point of view of the physics so here again, we have an addition to the theory that we get from thinking about the dynamics from a quantum physics point of view."
"Unknown","00;30;50;05","00;31;27;01","It's sort of a classical physics for event. OK, so this is the picture I showed before the set of cubits is the called blanket of the general model is represented by this kind of diagram and it becomes clear what the generative model is. It's a combination of a reference frame and some combination some computation. And it's clear that it does it specifies the options space for both perception and action."
"Unknown","00;31;27;03","00;32;06;20","It encodes everything that's detectable and everything that's actionable about B for X. So here just a couple of cartoons, for example, if palace looks out on the world and what she sees is a red rectangle interacting with a green diamond by some interaction then she must have reference frames for seeing rectangles and diamonds, and she must have a state observe rules for red and green, and she must have a memory so that she can keep track of what's going on with those state observables long enough to construct this picture of an interaction."
"Unknown","00;32;07;11","00;32;25;25","So all of this semantics is inside the observer. It has to be provided by these structures inside the observable observer. So the semantics that's imposed on the world is imposed. It comes from the generative model. It's not out there in any sense."
"Unknown","00;32;32;11","00;33;02;27","Part of of what the observer has to do is write memories. If the observer is going to see change. And since memories are classical data, those memories are effectively written back in the blank because the blanket is the only place where the classical data live. So we can we can infer from this that if a memory looks internal to a system that system has to have inner compartmental boundaries inside it to to write those memories."
"Unknown","00;33;02;27","00;33;54;01","OK, so this actually tells us something gives us an expectation about physiology in organisms or in any sort of artificial structure that memories have to be written on boundaries of some sort so again, here's this this swirl of issues that all surround this question of severability of the world being separated into distinct pieces. And I've mentioned all of them now except the frame problem, which is the problem of predicting side effects and clearly, if you don't have access to the dynamics outside you and you don't have access to all of your actions because some of them are just heat dissipation, you can't possibly predict side effects, all side effects."
"Unknown","00;33;54;05","00;34;29;23","So the frame problem is unsolvable. In principle in this setting, so in this paper, what Jim and I set out to do was to construct a general representation of these reference frames. And because they're physically implemented, they're quantum reference frames, they're not just abstract and these things specify both what the agent can expect and what the agent could do."
"Unknown","00;34;30;06","00;34;54;05","So they complete they define the options space for active inference for the agent. So by having a general representation of the agents reference frames we know in the sense everything interesting to know about the agent there. We wanted to distinguish the reference frames that can be used simultaneously. And these are the co deployable reference rates from those that can't."
"Unknown","00;34;54;25","00;35;23;18","And the distinction again is given to us by quantum theory. It's just operator Competitivity. So for example, I can't deploy position and momentum at the same time because those operators don't commute they side effect each other. The other way to think of it and physics is full of operators that don't commit, so oh my, my action space is, is not unitary."
"Unknown","00;35;23;18","00;35;43;25","It's segmented into sets of things that I can't do at the same time without introducing contextually of. So we showed that this non code deployability of reference rooms actually induces intrinsic intellectuality as it's defined in the literature."
"Unknown","00;35;46;12","00;36;19;00","What that means is that it creates undefined joint probability distributions of not just probability distributions that are difficult to make sense of or that need some information added to them, but probability distributions that actually can't be consistently defined. Why not? Because there's the information that would have to be specified to make them well behaved is information that you can't have, that you can't get even in principle."
"Unknown","00;36;20;09","00;36;54;16","And then our final objective is to tie this explicitly to the frame problem, which is a canonical problem that artificial intelligence discovered by McCarthy and Heinz back in 1969, the unpredictability of side effects. So that's, that's it for my introduction kind of context setting and I'm happy to as soon as I can get to this button again, switch to discussion Chris."
"Unknown","00;36;54;25","00;37;26;00","Thank you. So is it fair that there it is. Yep. We got it now. Thanks so much for that really amazing presentation. I'm sure everybody was having some pretty interesting thoughts from what you were communicating really though. Thanks again for coming on the stream. So for those who are here please write down your questions. And then when you ask your question, let's stop after the questions so that we can get a response to that question and not continue on with the question and then we'll raise our hands to hear from everyone."
"Unknown","00;37;26;17","00;37;46;17","So I'm going to first ask a question from the chat. And then, Stephen, I saw you raise your hand so anyone else raise your hand. Otherwise there's a couple questions from the chat. So here's the first question from the chat and the context based paradigm, especially quantum contextual help to answer, how does spontaneously generated thought arise in the brain?"
"Unknown","00;37;46;27","00;37;50;24","If yes, how how do you see this relate to the brain?"
"Unknown","00;37;54;08","00;37;55;02","Good question."
"Unknown","00;37;58;17","00;38;59;10","I actually suspect that all cells are quantum computers and that too, to really get a handle on information processing and cells will eventually have to use quantum information theory and the reason for that is that cellular energy budgets are really small and in place of pretty strict, strict upper limit on how much classical information cells encode. And that upper limit is much, much smaller than the information required to encode things like protein confirmation so I think that that cells are in fact devices where contextual and entanglement play a role now."
"Unknown","00;39;00;10","00;39;39;27","So what spontaneous start means, I'm not sure oh, I'm very sympathetic to the idea that thoughts are and emotions and and everything else that we experience just the experience tip of a very large iceberg that we don't experience. So I think our experiential access to what our minds are doing is extremely limited."
"Unknown","00;39;42;18","00;39;56;00","And so how how what we actually experience as a as it were, rises to the surface is how a good question."
"Unknown","00;39;58;04","00;40;03;22","I tend to think that global workspace type theories are a good classical answer to that."
"Unknown","00;40;06;02","00;40;34;13","But all of those ideas, I think will eventually need to be put in a much better mathematical framework thank you for the answer. That's a long way of saying I don't know what it's what spontaneously came to mind. So how could we ask for anything else? Stephen and then anyone else who wants to raise their hand. Yeah, thank you."
"Unknown","00;40;35;11","00;41;06;03","I was just curious, you mentioned sort of the quantum noise and the the way that if you have the Z axis, the you if you don't have the Z axis, you can't decode back the information. And often with quantum effects, it's like it's when you have very low degrees of freedom. So like a molecule or something that you particularly can see it compared to when it's in the middle of many degrees of freedom."
"Unknown","00;41;06;03","00;41;33;08","So I'm wondering if there's like a certain scales where like the interactions are in the cell or molecules are very quantum like and then it becomes more contextual, a bit more blurry, and then another scale it becomes a bit more quantum. Like maybe once you start to get to brainwaves interacting and is the context reality, he's losing it in a way."
"Unknown","00;41;33;08","00;42;13;05","It's another way of moving in and out of a more classical kind of noisy space. So it's like where it's got more noise and it's less easy to see sort of more distinct quantum effects so I was wondering like is there particular scales at which we see the quantum effect being more like you, a traditional quantum like switching in between states and is this other scales where it's much more like Fiston talks about this kind of non-linear great yeah, that's that's a very good question."
"Unknown","00;42;13;05","00;43;02;05","Is the question about is there a quantum to classical transition and if so, where? And of that? That question is typically posed in terms of decoherence and in in biological systems estimates of decoherence times or anywhere from femtosecond down of there's the famous paper by TEGMARK from 2000 criticizing the Hammer of Penrose theory where his argument against Namaroff and Penrose is basically the decoherence happened many orders of magnitude faster than than any cognitive processes or any neuronal processes."
"Unknown","00;43;03;26","00;43;54;13","So based on that type of reasoning of biology, biochemistry is thought of as being classical somewhere above the say, femtosecond type of timescale. So molecular dynamics calculations are basically classical like femtosecond types of tiny steps and that introduces the question of what is noise, but what does it mean to say that there's thermal noise in a system when we think about all the noise classically, for example, we might think about a protein that's sitting in a bath of water and the water molecules are thermally excited."
"Unknown","00;43;54;13","00;44;01;26","So they're banging into the protein like little billiard balls and that's in fact one way of thinking about a decoherence model."
"Unknown","00;44;04;03","00;44;40;29","So what we've introduced here is this idea of a temporal sample that we're looking at the protein molecule for a long enough period that the water molecules have get a chance to bang into it for many different directions. And we're somehow averaging over that temporal sample. So that gets to this question of who got density that came up in the earlier discussion of and it makes us ask, how am I implementing this, this temporal sample?"
"Unknown","00;44;42;08","00;45;10;07","And the obvious answer is I'm implementing this temporal temporal sample by measuring the state of the protein in a particular way. So I'm using an enzyme so to to measure the state of the protein. And the somatic reaction has some particular time constant. So it takes a certain amount of time for the enzymatic reaction to take place. And during that time, the protein maybe we're going around."
"Unknown","00;45;11;10","00;46;04;18","So I think that that all of these questions about classic reality in the end come down to questions about measurement and the temporal resolution of measurements implemented by something, an instrument or another part of the biological system, or how an observer of some kind so this is a this is kind of a long way of saying that. I suspect that this question of classical and is always a question of observation and the the sort of quantum picture that I that I outlined implies that the classical information only exists on the mark of both, that there's no classical information anywhere else in the system."
"Unknown","00;46;05;24","00;46;43;21","So classical information may not be ontological at all. There may be no on to logical classical if this kind of communication and picture is correct. Now, if that's the case, noise is of epistemological noise as a as an artifact of making the observations in a certain way, with a certain reference for an instrument is just a reference for thank you for the answer, Chris."
"Unknown","00;46;44;00","00;47;19;18","We're going to go blue, Scott. And then a question from the chat and Chris, thanks for the contextualization talk. That was really nice. So I just was wondering, you just mentioned earlier like the prospect of each cell being a quantum computer. And I'm also like I have a similar kind of thought or theory. And I just was wondering if you've heard of like quantum cognition and the positive molecule with the idea of these entangled pyrophosphate as holding kind of quantum cognition."
"Unknown","00;47;19;18","00;48;07;29","So you literally have you heard this theory and do you think it's credible or do you have other suppositions as to where this quantum cognition could occur? Intracellular leap I've certainly heard and seen various studies of localized quantum effects, in particular molecular structures so stacked PI domains and so on. And there's the whole story about is there a quantum coherence in oh goodness, I've just dropped the word light harvesting molecules or electron transport or something."
"Unknown","00;48;07;29","00;49;20;07","Like that. And now there's the mouse theory that there is that there's quantum processing and microtubules and all of these approaches. One is thinking about a quantum process happening in a background of a classical cell. Once one's thinking of the rest of the of the biochemical situation as being classical, a classical environment of some kind in which this single quantum process is happening and as I sort of expressed and in answering the last question, I, I suspect that that entire way of thinking is probably wrong, that we, we can't actually think of bulk biochemistry as being classical so I'm trying to think of a particular event as being a quantum event against a classical background"
"Unknown","00;49;21;28","00;49;57;28","may just be misleading us about what's how information processing has actually occurred. And if we think of of the interior of a cell, say in the entire interior of something like a bacterial cell as being in one coherent state, then it's not that that there particular quantum molecular states is, it's that the entire interior is one big entangled mess that demands a very different way of thinking about biochemistry."
"Unknown","00;49;57;28","00;50;32;17","And I don't even know how to formulate that way of thinking about biochemistry. But I suspect that approaching it as a as a quantum information problem, where we're extremely explicit about where measurements are made would be what would have to be done thanks, Chris. Really amazing about the relational and the semantic biochemistry. That's not how we got it in one, two or three so Scott."
"Unknown","00;50;32;24","00;50;57;28","And then a question from the chat Chris, thank you. There's absolutely fascinating presentation on a number of questions, but I'll just ask one or 21 of the challenges of quantum physics, challenges to quantum physics being applied in the macro level is that, you know, I don't think people have said don't take the concepts and apply them to social constructions and things like that."
"Unknown","00;50;58;15","00;51;47;16","But here the origin of the active inference notions or the relationship to the academic processes suggests to me the opportunity to look at phenomena in a much larger system of larger scale social scale. And so I wonder about your acceptance or enthusiasm for that notion of applying these ideas to social systems, political systems, economic systems, other systems that have interactions that can be described with active inference and this feels to me like a nice way to say, hey, we're talking about quantum politics going to markets."
"Unknown","00;51;47;28","00;52;11;16","We're talking about prebiotic governance with conformational changes of narratives. And so a lot of the work that we've been doing on the information side is going to is I've been saying without knowing, you've explained to me what I've been trying to say for years now in this book, and I've been saying without knowing why that data plus meaning equals information."
"Unknown","00;52;12;13","00;52;32;04","And the meaning part is what you just explain to me what I meant by meaning. And I always thought of it. I was a lawyer for 30 years, so I always thought of it as the meaning, like a contract with an enforceable narrative, which is meaning. But you've just given me a new way of looking at that meaning from a quantum perspective, which is extremely robust and scale independent."
"Unknown","00;52;32;17","00;52;41;26","I just wonder about your comments on that and your enthusiasm for that kind of application. Thanks. Oh, thank you. That's that's a very interesting observation."
"Unknown","00;52;46;23","00;53;23;17","I think the experiments are going to be very difficult but I think if we can figure out how to do the experiments, we're going to find out contextually in entanglement kinds of effects all over the place. And I would I would point you to the work of towards that for us and his colleagues some of which is referenced in the paper and in their formulation called contextual ready by default."
"Unknown","00;53;24;25","00;54;05;08","What they've done is translate the kind of most standard model of quantum contextually into classical probability theory and and given this criterion of if a classical probability, a consistent classical probability distribution cannot be defined over a set of data, then it displays contextually and they they published a series of papers in the past four or five years on this approach."
"Unknown","00;54;05;08","00;55;02;04","And one of them deconstructs a large number of claims of quantum effects in psychological data which have been reported now by numerous groups around the world with various kinds of experimental protocols. And there's active controversy between members of these different groups about what is and is not evidence of quantum behavior. So it's an enormous literature now, but using the contextually by default approach of Zephyr of and colleagues, his students are volunteers as one of the lead people who's done this work have constructed extremely careful experiments where under their their test criteria there are robust intrinsic contextual effects."
"Unknown","00;55;03;02","00;55;38;27","And interestingly, they have to do with meaning. So one that we referred to in the in the paper is called the Snow Queen Experiment, and it's based on interpretations of the Hans Christian Andersen story so I think that as far as the tools and techniques for developing these these kinds of experimental protocols are improved we're going to see more and more effects that are very, very difficult to challenge from a statistical point of view."
"Unknown","00;55;39;27","00;56;05;26","And the problem is, is therefore often and I'll point out is that in physics, if I'm doing something like a bell experiment, I can put my two observers far enough apart that they can't communicate just due to the speed of light and the time it takes to do the experiment. And you can't do that in biologic systems. So you always have this communication loophole to deal with."
"Unknown","00;56;06;15","00;56;41;22","And what lots ourselves or colleagues are really trying to do is develop the statistical analysis techniques, how to get around the communication loophole in an arbitrary experiment carried out with college undergraduates. As the and I think we've been successful thanks for the response. So we're going to go to a question in the chat. And then if anyone here who hasn't raise their hand yet raises their hand, otherwise we'll go back to someone who has."
"Unknown","00;56;42;02","00;57;07;01","So this is from pseudocode in the chart. How will an agents acquire information for their generative model? You've said that there has to be some higher risk to infer the information even from the joint world. And you said that the object semantics have to be inside the observer but how does the Observer learn that in the first place for their generative model that's that's an excellent question."
"Unknown","00;57;07;01","00;57;51;11","And again, the only answer I can give is I don't know, but I think that I think that biology gives us hints of if you look at the process of cell division, which is one of the best examples of of separation that we have to deal with, that we can really manipulate in the laboratory then. And if you ask how much information is is shared between the daughter cells, well, clearly the genomes are shared but the genome is only a very tiny part of the shared information."
"Unknown","00;57;53;23","00;58;07;12","They also share information that's encoded in their cell skeletons. They share information that's encoded in the cell membrane. They share information that's encoded in the cytoplasm itself."
"Unknown","00;58;09;23","00;58;49;25","They may share aspects of their bio electric states so there's a lot of information that is inherited, if you will, across cell division and most of it has not been quantitate it in any reasonable way. I mean, it's easy to quantitate the information in data protein, but it's extremely difficult to quantitate. And so the information and I'll just give you one example of that's from my colleague Mike Levin's lab at Tufts."
"Unknown","00;58;50;00","00;59;24;20","They work on a regeneration area and they've been able to show experimentally that it's been done. It's been done for quite some time, that if you alter the the ability of cells to communicate by electrically, then you can get an area to regenerate with two heads instead of one but Mike's lab was able to show is that this is epigenetically heritable."
"Unknown","00;59;25;17","01;00;08;25","So when there was perfectly normal, they have inherited the tendency to regenerate with two heads after injury and this happens without changing DNA, without changing RNA, without changing protein content, without changing any of the obviously heritable factors and they've been able to show experimentally that the bio electric effect happens first before any observable changes in gene expression so here's a case where a completely unlooked for kind of information is epigenetically inheritable."
"Unknown","01;00;08;25","01;00;26;29","It makes a huge difference to what the animal does with this, with its physiology of its anatomy. I mean, the two headed plant area have two perfectly good operational brains that are independently able to direct behavior. So they're pretty weird creatures."
"Unknown","01;00;30;06","01;00;51;03","Thanks for the response. And just briefly, that's one reason why the information is in the genome kind of Zoolander take doesn't work well because that's assuming there's this map between the source code and the program. But then there's these alternate stable states that exist because the semantic or the epigenetic or the environmental frame. So it's not quite as simple as just this one mapping that you made."
"Unknown","01;00;51;16","01;01;29;23","So that's a really nice point. All right. We're going to have Sarah and then Seana and then a question from Chat. Thank you. Go ahead, sir. Yeah, yeah. I have almost like two different questions or directions, and I'm not sure how they're going to match. So I'll just start with one and see where it goes. One. It seems to me like the way you frame the quantum set up, you know, you have A, you have B, you can actually kind of do this with any prob it's probabilistic type notation that you're using, but you know you have A, you have B that you have the joint distribution of the two and it seems like I"
"Unknown","01;01;29;23","01;01;58;03","guess the question that comes to my mind is like what happens when we don't if, if we were hypothetic because I know our world is constructed around reductionism, but if we were hypothetically able to separate out or to not think of things as reductionist and so like for example, how would our how could our math possibly be different if we were looking at things as only spanning sets rather than eigenvalues and eigenvectors?"
"Unknown","01;01;59;12","01;02;50;25","Yeah. So this is kind of where my mind goes is like is there a is there even a kind of a way to approach a problem purely through context, duality rather than then reductionism of any kind? That's yeah, hmm. Of I don't know. On the math set, I may actually defer to Seana here because she, she does more budget work category theory than I do, and I suspect the answer is a category theoretic type of answer, but I'll make one comment, which is that wow, reductionism is one of these complicated words that has different meanings for many different people."
"Unknown","01;02;51;09","01;03;35;25","But when we would think about what we're doing in quantum theory is really labeling and we're, we're labeling things for convenience with the full understanding that our labels in a sense don't have any physical meaning they they only have meaning in the context of particular observational outcomes that we've made by measuring things in a certain way but then in itself is a problematic statement."
"Unknown","01;03;36;01","01;04;34;04","Right? And this is this is in a sense the core of the Copenhagen interpretation. It's, it's what Baugher talked about in his paper in Nature in 1928. He basically said at the end of the day we have to talk about apparatus and we have to talk about colleagues and we have to talk about classical communication. And in a sense quantum theory tells us that all of that is on the poor approximation but it's the only language that we've got so I think this, this question of how far can we go without redefining separation is a very good question."
"Unknown","01;04;35;26","01;04;59;05","And as usual, my answer is I don't know Awesome. Thanks for the response. Yeah, it's good to shine on me at times. I wonder if I should ask my two. Yeah, category theories is really powerful. And when says there's only one logic? No, no, no. He and I are trying to find another one, something called like chromatic types."
"Unknown","01;04;59;05","01;05;19;29","And I was actually going to ask the question, do you think you know the phenomena? Regeneration I think could actually be model of. I mean, we're trying to do that chromatic filtration, right? It seems like regeneration seems to be some kind of morph ism equivalent of when the stop mechanism ends. What does it mean to start? Maybe that means stop means not making more morph isms."
"Unknown","01;05;20;12","01;05;45;14","And the two had an era actually has a two category structure, right. That has a one more prism and a to morph. Isn't that I think that's what's controlling the central nervous system, right? That if you can have two more prisons and you could have this double head kind of thing. And so whatever the stop mechanism is, I think it's almost like when I was showing you this filtration, how you can actually make more equivalencies and more equivalencies using that useful localization."
"Unknown","01;05;46;03","01;06;14;26","So I think, you know, there's another one called the top a logical localization where the objects in the categories are reflections. And that might be what might help Sarah a little bit is that there's different categorical models for interaction and anything interaction based should be immediately category here. I think the tensor network stuff fails because like a node is just a point, but in category theory, you can add space to that point by making the point something else."
"Unknown","01;06;14;26","01;06;38;20","So then you're working in this module like space. So that was my thought that about like fun. And you know, when you were talking about spontaneous thoughts or about question about that. And I also think that like our work on that for a finite condition, Chris could also account for like thought whatever that is, right? Because the thought doesn't really last right vote speech doesn't last the speech faith based on the composition of the molecules in the air."
"Unknown","01;06;38;27","01;07;11;14","But something remains I mean, we all continue and it seems to be that holographic copy of the finite meaning right in the diamonds and stuff so I just want so for Syria you know I think a bunch of this category theory can really help you with that. You know you know it's like you have this object in topology called a ship which is this very, very complex structure, but it attaches to a topological space and it's like a little bag and it keeps track of all the data, you know, and so each space has the structures attached to it that keep track of what happens locally."
"Unknown","01;07;11;14","01;07;32;17","You can look at the modulus space and the isomorphism classes of the little bags. So what's happening in the Isomorphism space of the little bags probably seems to do with this like global consciousness thing is so you can upgrade that one dimension using category here and you can work in a stack and a stack is going to be achieved that doesn't take values and sets anymore."
"Unknown","01;07;32;25","01;07;56;05","All the quantum theory is taking place in sense, and I think it needs to be a little bulldozed like it needs to go up. If you can take values and category is, then in each point you have so much more space to move around, right? So then if you actually have this object that takes values and categories and steps, then you allowed yourself more space so that you could have these phenomena with the plane era and stuff like that."
"Unknown","01;07;56;15","01;08;16;23","But if you're just working in like, like points, like dots and like nodes connecting, I think it's just not enough. But you can do all these other things, but I'm not sure if I anything but yeah, I think that I was going to ask if you felt like are which we need to pick back up the chromatic, you know, our chromatic type over for a logic."
"Unknown","01;08;17;06","01;08;41;27","If that could actually work with this. Yeah, I'm fascinated by the regeneration and the stop mechanism, which is weird, you know. Yeah, I, I'll just quote like love and telling, telling me over and over again and everyone else who will listen that the most important question of biology is when to stop. Yes. Now how, how, how does, how does the embryo know that it's done?"
"Unknown","01;08;42;06","01;09;14;17","Now I can stop. I'm an adult. No one knows that. The question isn't even asked that way. But when you think about it, it it is a key question because it's it's related. When you said like our experiential phenomenon capacity is just the you know, the tip of the non experience. So it's almost like if the stop is the iceberg of everything else, I'd like to see what's the everything else, you know, thanks for these points."
"Unknown","01;09;14;17","01;09;35;13","It's really an amazing mapping that is rigorous and something that we should be learning more about how the point can be just the tip of the iceberg and kind of where it's piercing something that's a lower dimensionality. And so what do we do with that? So I'm going to go to a question from chat and then can I ask can I ask a second part of the question I was working with?"
"Unknown","01;09;35;19","01;10;01;28","Go for it. It's this is it. Feel free to just be like if it's not great, just, just not answer it. If it's but I can't help but analogize something that I just yeah, I cannot ever let go, which is in electrical engineering or in electronics essentially. You know, you have this there well in anything, but I really like electronics because it's very tangible."
"Unknown","01;10;01;28","01;10;29;03","You have the real component in the imaginary component of, of, of signal that goes across an interface. And so I'm always really fascinated by that. Because it always seems like a really good analogy to this thing that we can look at through math or quantum mechanics. But with electronics, you actually have a thing that you could put on your desk because you could think of this, this, this, this phase change that happens that interfaces as the context."
"Unknown","01;10;29;14","01;10;48;27","And so I've always been interested in trying to look at that thing that gets lost without looking at the at the current or the voltage, like measuring at a point. But actually just keeping track of the context as things move across interfaces in a circuit, it's not even a question. I apologize for that, but if it brings up any thoughts, great."
"Unknown","01;10;51;28","01;11;13;29","Either of you two, if you'd like to give a thought otherwise, it stands and I love how many ideas people are bringing up. This will definitely be an episode for people to relisten to and make some knowledge network stuff. So all I'll say is phase is extremely important is important. It's a very it's like phase according to him."
"Unknown","01;11;14;05","01;11;32;26","So Chris and I have really torn apart this reference frame idea. Like according to him at what point if phase was like non-local, then everything would be the same thing. But so at what point do you actually have, you know, electronics? You assume that you know that you're like low Paul and stuff. But electronics are fascinating. It's still like kind of tangible."
"Unknown","01;11;32;26","01;11;51;28","But if you work on that, that space that's pre actualization, I think it's very just like this present, it's very, very difficult to say who you are, what the boundary actually is. And if the boundary, like a boundary in mathematics is like an asymptote or something, right? So it's like a horizon or a koshi horizon or something like that."
"Unknown","01;11;52;10","01;12;13;08","So inside that very notion of a boundary, you already have causality. And then this, you know, sensor product and there's all kinds of other tensor. There's wedge products. And, you know, it's, it's I think it's really hard to say what a phase is without bringing into play all these other reference frames that are so for us all. So cool."
"Unknown","01;12;13;25","01;12;40;05","I'm going to do a question from the chat and then I have a simple question. So a question from the chat is do you think a reformulation of quantum mechanics is necessary in order to tackle the problem of consciousness or life from a full mathematical generality? I'm mainly thinking of the notion of intrinsic information from tissues, paper information, theory of decisions and actions, but also maybe other approaches like self-organized criticality more generally."
"Unknown","01;12;40;05","01;13;40;00","I'm curious, how necessary is it to bridge our understanding of thermodynamics, information theory and biology or control theory to have a good understanding? How far along are we and are there any concrete problems for a mathematician agree with that? You know, that's that's an omnibus question is I, I guess my, my first answer would be, yes, we do need to bridge all those, all those disciplines in order to make progress of whether it will tell us something deep about what experience is in some ontological sense, I have my doubts about of whether it will tell us something interesting about what the experience in a sense does, how it works."
"Unknown","01;13;41;26","01;14;05;09","I think it may tell us something very important about that, but yes, I, I do think that these disciplines need to be bridged. I think we're at a bit of an impasse that's been imposed on us by the disciplinary structure of science thanks for the answer. I'm going to ask my simple question and then we're going to go to Stephen and Blue."
"Unknown","01;14;05;09","01;14;24;28","And also, sir, I know you had some other kinds of questions that were a little bit less about the math. But here's my simple question. Where does active inference come into play? Or for those who are just learning about active inference and curious to how it might be the bridge for all these different areas, what do you think active inference is doing here?"
"Unknown","01;14;27;10","01;14;57;27","Well, as I said at the very beginning, I, I think of active inference in terms of this fundamental decision that that every system has to make all the time between, oh, do I explore, do I act of or do I retreat and, and, and try to do a kind of postmortem on just what just happened and learn something?"
"Unknown","01;14;58;18","01;15;42;12","So do I modify my priors or do I try to modify both my experience and I think thinking of active inference in terms of what reference frames are being deployed it just allows us to pose that question a little bit differently. It allows us to think of the question in the form of, of do I make another measurement?"
"Unknown","01;15;42;12","01;15;43;21","Do I outrun the world?"
"Unknown","01;15;46;27","01;16;06;20","Or do I modify by reference frame that you can think of a reference frame like a category, like a cognitive category. So we have cognitive categories like this is a cat, that's a dog, and this is a table this is another person."
"Unknown","01;16;09;07","01;16;50;05","So modifying a reference frame can be thought of as going into your apparatus and changing the way it works. You can also think of it as modifying my category, modifying the things I'm capable of. See it. And I think you asked in the in the previous discussion last week of what does the theory say about the the capabilities of organisms and or does it does it put a limit of what organisms can do and I think in a sense, that's the question we're trying to answer to."
"Unknown","01;16;50;05","01;17;30;04","To what extent or do organisms have flexible capabilities? To what extent can they retool their cognitive systems, even if it's even if it's just E coli to what extent can can something like a microbial population retool what it's capable of? And again, biology gives us these beautiful examples in terms of things like lateral gene transfer of microbes that a community can pass around genes and so can can change very radically what they're capable of doing."
"Unknown","01;17;31;07","01;18;02;19","So I mean, from the active influence point of view, that's a question. Do I do I keep going with the capabilities that I've got or do I go shopping for some new DNA oh, it's like the active turn. We don't know how far or what else, what other stones are going to be turned when we actually start thinking and doing instead of just thinking about doing."
"Unknown","01;18;03;03","01;18;39;16","So, we have Stephen, then Blue, then Scott very excited to hear you talking about the work of my Mike Levin, because his works vary. When I saw the video of his work recent, it's like last year, it was like, Wow, it's started to bring the whole idea of swarm in and how swarming actually is underpinning a lot of what happens in the the work with bio electrics is really interesting, and I'd be interested in how is that bio electric aspect seems more maybe more closely tied to the sort of quantum transitions."
"Unknown","01;18;40;17","01;19;07;03","And I'm just maybe a little clarity on a couple of things because often if the decision splits, just ask the question, then clarify it. OK, so the question is when you have these quantum effects, you know, normally they may be just two things split in between one state and another state in more sort of basic chemistry like energy levels or something like that."
"Unknown","01;19;07;03","01;19;49;28","But you have many levels potentially. So is it a case that you are able to still evolve from the noise, what's going on with quantum states? And therefore, this gives us a way to not have to just go for like the attractor theory and complexity or catastrophe theory or phase theory that we use at the moment. But you are able to still extract quantum state information in ways it's not just classical like one energy level to another energy level, but you get this more higher information context yeah, good question."
"Unknown","01;19;49;28","01;20;46;20","I think what you really are asking is where are the experimental tools that members of probe this domain and I wish I knew, and this is something that Mike and I talk about, for example, of how could we go about looking for contextual of the effects. For example, in things like bio electric effects in one regeneration of and I don't know, I think I think there's a huge opportunity space here for for people to think about, oh, ways of doing experiments that we can't experiments that we can't do now or never thought about being able to do that."
"Unknown","01;20;47;12","01;21;30;19","Of probing a domain of correlation that is non classical or super determined or however, however you want to think about it. And I think that the, the more we can think of biological systems in, in communication theoretic terms, the better prepared will be to design experiments, to look for what are really communication theoretic effects in quantum theory is really about communication Thank you."
"Unknown","01;21;30;26","01;21;53;23","Blue, blue. And then Scott. So first because Shana dropped off, I don't know if she's gone or if she's going to rejoin. And it's kind of a follow up to some of the stuff that she was saying, but I can still ask it. But let me pass to Scotland and I'll go we'll go to Scott and hopefully we can have some future category streams to really learn more about this area."
"Unknown","01;21;54;00","01;22;19;00","So yeah. Scott And then back to Blue Great. Thank you. This is my smile is hurting my face. And so it's a great discussion. The two things I want to talk about, embodiment and then related, and one is social level experiments. So the first one is embodiment. It seems like we have these internal states are embodiments of prior external states or their learned states."
"Unknown","01;22;19;14","01;22;54;12","And so it's kind of interesting because the external states and the individual states have various significant relationships through time, not just through that individual organisms, Marco Blanket, but by the inherited and other factors that are become the priors. Right. And so it's kind of interesting because you have embodiment externally and internally maybe that's extremely fluid, right? Because we talk about systems at different levels, the different types of systems, cell systems, social systems, organisms, organizations, they all have different affordances and their embodiments are not necessarily they can be they're not necessarily inconsistent when they're different."
"Unknown","01;22;54;16","01;23;12;27","Right. You can have an embodiment of something. If I eat a lot of fatty food, I become fat. But that doesn't you know, anyway, that's one thing is the embodiment. We talk a little bit about that for me from my perspective, if you're looking at risk and change when information being shifted around as a lawyer, it's lawyer. I look at risk and risk being moved around."
"Unknown","01;23;13;09","01;23;44;27","And so one of the things that seems to be when you have the embodiment question is that among the relationships, then you get the question since entropy or disorder is going to increase universally, what we're doing is we're managing local neg entropy in these system, right? We're sharing local entropy. And so the question is is that dynamic something that tends to dissipate the Markov blanket as a standalone thing, maybe Markov blankets or 03?"
"Unknown","01;23;44;28","01;24;31;22","That's one question. OK, let's get that. Let's try to do one question because it's really in a body domain. Let's just try it. Yeah. Thanks for the really great question. Go ahead. Yes, OK, this is a wonderful question. I'll make two comments. One is in terms of, of reference frames, do I always come back to how I think what quantum theory contributed to the to the notion of a reference frame is it insisted that we regard reference frames as embodied as physically implemented and stop thinking of them as merely abstractions."
"Unknown","01;24;33;04","01;24;49;26","And we can we can go back, for example, to the idea of of cognitive categories. You know, my my idea of a table is not an abstraction. It's a it's something that's implemented in my brain."
"Unknown","01;24;52;00","01;25;28;28","And it can be changed by operating on my brain and I can change it that way. We don't know how it works. Right. But, but what the, what the, the embodied movement or the full framework whatever. What that forces cognitive science to think about is these are not abstractions. We're talking about things that have been implemented. So I think that's an incredibly important point of the second point I want to make is about boundaries."
"Unknown","01;25;29;15","01;25;47;03","And I showed that picture of of. Oh, right. I was looking at her at her holographic screen and listed the things that she doesn't know that I could have added to that, that Alice doesn't know where her boundary is."
"Unknown","01;25;50;04","01;26;20;15","If if I'm a system and I'm, I'm looking out at the world through my Markov blanket or through my my encoded screen, then what I'm seeing is this array of information that's painted on my screen. Right. This array of bits and impressions point. And the point of the holographic principle is I don't see what's on the other side but you can flip that around."
"Unknown","01;26;20;15","01;26;53;24","It's always symmetrical. I don't see what's on my side either. And that's that's why I tried to make this point very briefly about memory, how if we think of memory as classical, then it's got to be written on the screen because that's the only focus of any classical information. So if I'm looking at my screen, the thing that I don't see is my self and since I don't see myself and I don't see the other side, I just see the screen."
"Unknown","01;26;54;03","01;26;55;20","I have no idea who it is."
"Unknown","01;26;58;20","01;27;32;10","So would you when you raise this question of a social system or any other kind of complex system of we as as observers of that system are using our reference frames or our cognitive categories or our health, we want to describe them to draw a boundary around that thing. That boundary is our imposition it's not the system's imposition."
"Unknown","01;27;32;26","01;27;35;04","The system doesn't know where its boundary is."
"Unknown","01;27;37;15","01;27;57;10","Is there a thought there as well? Yeah. Is there a tautology in there, though? Because that's interesting because we're using our system. We're drawing the system within our boundary. It seems like that's an intrinsic quality of the thing. That system can tell a system know itself, some kind of system, no others. And you can only know it through the boundary but you."
"Unknown","01;27;57;10","01;28;37;00","So you can't know yourself because you're not written on the boundary. So it's kind of. Well, let me let me get to the next question because it relates to that. But the quick answer to that question is yes. Yeah, I like that's a good question. It's generally the binary answer. It's still the next question was the I was wondering if we can if the for experimentation this is the question of answering experimentation if and to the extent that this is their scale independence in active inference and so that it applies to cell levels and social level, etc. why can't we look at the social level to run experiments and then apply those what we come"
"Unknown","01;28;37;00","01;28;56;13","out with at other levels? So it's similar to when you do a qubit at a macro, you know, they do qubit qubits that are manifested in different ways in different kinds of systems, you know, ionic qubits and things like that. So you can measure them in different ways. So we could be observers of the system to at the social level to identify some qualities."
"Unknown","01;28;56;13","01;29;16;27","And the reason I'm asserting that as a lawyer, even though the social has a lot of variables, what we do as as lawyers is create fewer variables, right? We take a meaning thing. We say, hey, everyone in this area of the statute has to behave this way. And so then internally, everyone can absorb and embody the idea that I know everyone's going to stop at a red light."
"Unknown","01;29;17;17","01;29;38;13","I know I'm going to stop at a red light. That's the story of the red light. Red means stop. You started as a kid, so it becomes instantiated and kind of axiomatic. So one of the things about the law is that I'm going at it from a slightly different way of effectively going in and trying to create non variables in the Markov blanket that are shared."
"Unknown","01;29;39;03","01;30;26;03","Right. And so and so I wonder about the embodiment relates in a way I think to the experimentation question because can we do, let's call them artificial embodiments into the internal states through things like law or folkways is or shared meaning or norms or things like that, that we can then experiment against is what I'm wearing cross cultural experiments, things like that, that then may have application at other levels I think that's I think that's a fascinating thing to try to follow up on and I would say one of my one of the things that seems most mysterious to me is language is is the very possibility of classical communication of what what you're talking"
"Unknown","01;30;26;03","01;31;07;11","about a physicist would call super determinism and super determinism is essentially the same thing as entanglement if if I don't have a choice about what reference frames to deploy, if there's a correlation in advance, super determined by the past between the reference frames I use and the reference frames years then. And in an important sense, we're not independent systems and we're we're entangled."
"Unknown","01;31;07;25","01;32;01;20","But that's what language is in some sense. And so I, I agree with you. We should be able to redescribe communication generally in these terms of, of reference frame sharing, reference frame choice super determinism, and apply some of this math that's been worked out in other places to reinterpret of communication and I'll mention a paper by, again, Alexi Greenbaum, the philosopher of science that saw clay, and it's a paper on divisive, dependent methods in quantum communication."
"Unknown","01;32;02;08","01;32;33;23","But the very last I see Sarah, you're nodding your head, you probably read this paper one of the very last sentences in the paper is of he says this redefines what physics is about. Physics is about languages and I think that's a phenomenally profound statement. I think he's right nice. Let's continue. So we got blue and then Stephen and then Sarah."
"Unknown","01;32;37;18","01;33;02;08","So Shana here, I think she said in the chat that she had to run. But I want to touch back on what she said. Like when a thought passes that there's still something there. And also to what you were saying earlier about memory and what Sarah was saying of keeping track of what gets lost. And so something that I gleaned from this paper now I have no background in category theory at all."
"Unknown","01;33;03;00","01;33;28;20","As you may have been able to tell from the introduction video. Right. So the so it seems like that there's this hierarchical nature of some mathematical summation that is like able to occur like via these methods. And I just was wondering if you're familiar with Eric Powell's work. He put out a paper last year on a puzzle geometry and like he's done some poor screening stuff."
"Unknown","01;33;28;20","01;33;53;06","And so so is there some relationship between like that kind of screening or like dimension reduction and this category theory work? Or is the category theory somehow able to encompass the entirety of the mathematical problem in a better way or a different way than, say, screening? Oh, yeah. Good, good question."
"Unknown","01;33;56;07","01;34;34;05","Yes, I do know Eric's work and I talk to him almost every week because he's also part of Mike Levin's lab. And so we we have discussed this question of of of course, grading and causal emergence and effective information. All of these concepts that that Eric has been working with I think are very closely related to the concepts that Jim and I have been working with."
"Unknown","01;34;35;10","01;35;53;18","And we're we're coming at them from such different starting points that it's not clear, at least to me, exactly how they fit together. But what a what a Kolko diagram does is, of course, great it it represents a an abstraction of a set of logical relationships, or it represents a abstractions of a set of criteria into a of course grain, larger scale, if you will, criterion that covers all of the cases below it, but in which information is both lost and gained and I think the the best example, at least for me to thinking about it, is, is again, going back to cognitive categories if you think about, you know, your category for a table"
"Unknown","01;35;53;18","01;36;38;19","or another person or whatever, you you lose information in that abstraction process. But you also gain information by tying all of those exemplars together. And each exemplar is then in some sense encoding through the rest of the network of its consistency in some sense with other exemplars that may have different detail characteristics. So at the token level, they look inconsistent, but at the type level, they're consistent."
"Unknown","01;36;39;17","01;37;44;01","And the the of the cocom diagram represents that that very complex relationship so when one is doing a core screening and it works out, the the information in the core screen state is capturing just this kind of abstract information. It's the it's the abstract information that's actually useful and that captures what is consistent between the the the fine grained exemplars of and by organizing them that way, it allows each of them to represent of the fact of its consistency with this larger set well, thanks."
"Unknown","01;37;44;01","01;38;09;08","I also like I'm curious to see because I do think that it's going to like you guys, it will lock together eventually at some point maybe in ten years. But I'm curious to see how that kind of dynamic interplay unfolds. Yeah. We'll also I also like living will be on Active Inference Live stream on July 13th. So we can talk before then or after then."
"Unknown","01;38;09;19","01;38;36;26","All right. Awesome. So we have a little bit less than 20 minutes left, so we'll just do no questions and try to get a few more questions in from the chat as well. Stephen And then Sir thank you. Yeah, deep breath. There's a lot, a lot to go through here. I was going to sort of build on that course grain question and maybe just stepping back as some of the bigger implications of context utility and how that is thought about."
"Unknown","01;38;36;26","01;39;04;28","So you know the principles that you talked about with a paradigm and so I'm curious about how you see this maybe impacting context you Aditi and way people think about that and the reason I address that and then continue to Stephen but just to get one question and one answer, I think a OK, I guess I didn't I didn't actually hear that as a question."
"Unknown","01;39;05;19","01;39;33;00","Sorry. OK, yeah. Sorry. Stephen. Yeah, I'll just I'll just finish that thought basically just in terms of contextual reality and course grain in and you know, how much granular varieties thought about and how that has a bigger that that general idea of how to think about sexuality. I be interested in your thought about that as how that sort of has a bigger set of legs."
"Unknown","01;39;33;00","01;39;56;21","And one of the reason I say that is because when people often talk about quantum theory in a sort of broader world out there, they often think about this trans person or it's all the same and it's unifying and it's actually decontextualized and in some ways you know, it's almost in some ways this is quite revolutionary to me to really see quantum effects as being contextual."
"Unknown","01;39;57;06","01;40;25;13","You know, being in that way. So, you know, that may be ties in with David Bowman's work on implicit order and awareness of things so rather than always been about the what and going up indigenous approach, is it very much about where you are and how you are? What's your embeddedness in your niche? So in some ways it's like quantum that when I first heard about your paper, I was thinking, Oh, this is you hear quantum, you think abstract."
"Unknown","01;40;25;13","01;41;09;06","Actually, it's doing something very different. So I just wondered how that might have impact in other senses. OK, so, so I heard a number of different ideas here that that are parts of questions one has to do with, with course going to and contextually and you put your finger very precisely on the danger, of course, grading of and this this you can also say this in terms of the frame problem of it's it's often the little details that come back to bite you."
"Unknown","01;41;10;17","01;41;45;04","And when you course grain you're specifically getting rid of those little details so this is of goodness it's it's like the metaphor of the hammer and the nail, right? Oh, if any choice of reference frame is effectively a choice, of course, grading and choosing a reference frame, choosing a course grading determines what you could see, but that also determines what you can't see."
"Unknown","01;41;46;29","01;42;21;09","And it's what you can't see. That is responsible for the contextual effects that you can't avoid by, by, by you know, learning more about the context if you if you've arranged your measurement procedures in a way that prevents you from seeing them, then you can never take them into account when you're building your probability distribution. So so course grading is something that we're stuck with."
"Unknown","01;42;23;00","01;42;45;00","But it's it's very much a double edged sword, right? It allows us to get around in the world. It allows us to see these similarities. It allows us to learn things, but it forces us to ignore things that may turn out to be important or may turn out to have been important."
"Unknown","01;42;48;17","01;43;25;14","Thanks for the interesting answer there. So so with respect to your other question about, if you will, embeddedness of. Yes, I think that's crucially important let's go to Sarah and this will continue. Stephen. Sorry, I'm just going to say that that whole embeddedness is huge for the inactive ecological cognition work. And so there's the pragmatic turn in psychology."
"Unknown","01;43;25;14","01;43;56;22","So this is there's a lot of implications of that. So I just think that's very exciting. So thanks. Yeah. Yeah, I'm very attracted to this sort of notion that ecosystems are in a sense, extended organisms, et cetera. The whole way of thinking in biology is, I think, very important. And also to connect that, it's like there's this embedded practice and then we're talking about the physical electronic circuits."
"Unknown","01;43;57;04","01;44;19;10","So it's almost like across domains we're taking an action oriented and a realist manifested focus, but then seeing the what is actually manifest as the tip of the iceberg in another sense. But it's totally real for what it really is, which is our measurement. And then also it's a tip of an iceberg because we're also in the system and those kinds of systems don't just arise out of nowhere."
"Unknown","01;44;19;18","01;44;43;28","So Sarah and then Scott, in our last couple of minutes, but thanks everyone for this really awesome discussion. Maybe Syria, your God. Yeah. So am I to understand that we have another one of these because I would love to ask Chris these other questions, but obviously not now. There's just not enough time. We will be discussing the paper next week, but we did not play without Chris."
"Unknown","01;44;44;03","01;45;09;03","No pressure, but we're doing it same time next week. But OK, expectations, OK, no prior. OK, I'm yeah. In some ways this is like a media just rephrasing what's already been said, but it's actually right up right up your alley. Stephen I was actually just in writing in my paper about, well, what methods you choose and on what math, what questions you ask."
"Unknown","01;45;10;08","01;45;35;24","It related to reductionism related to this whole thing. But I wonder, this is like super abstract, but like I wonder about the, the role of play because I was thinking about, you know, like I was thinking about there's so many situations in science where you're not, you know, like when you look at the paper, you're like, oh, yeah, they're doing science."
"Unknown","01;45;35;24","01;45;56;22","But in reality they're just poking at shit right like so it's just this way of being with the world where you're like, Oh, I wonder what happens if I, you know, but they're not really reducing. They're just it's like, so it's like, play and so I've really wondered about, about how to bring that to the foreground about what that, what that is in science, you know?"
"Unknown","01;45;57;04","01;46;31;23","And so again, I apologize, but you're you always have a way of coming up with a comment, so hopefully you'll have a follow on this lot of your if it's not saying you're probably doing it wrong, I was just thinking of like an antidote to reductionism. Like play seems like a way that you're not taking things apart. You're just kind of you're with it in some way."
"Unknown","01;46;35;17","01;47;13;23","Well, to take the spirituality of inference and to to think of it, of it's almost in robotics terms of what the people in robot, in developmental robotics are are trying to do is understand what motivates a system to engage with the world with this kind of innocence that I think you're referring to. To to just explore and see what's learnable right."
"Unknown","01;47;14;00","01;48;07;01","The world. One of the key questions is, is and pretty yours is the one too, I think in the literature is emphasize this more than anyone else is how do how do you learn what parts of the world are learnable with the resources that you have so that you can avoid spending all of your resources trying to learn things that you're not capable of learning so how do you how do you how do you focus your exploratory behavior in the parts of the world where it can actually be productive this is sort of a meta question on top of active inference, and it has to do with Bayesian precision and things like that."
"Unknown","01;48;08;23","01;48;36;19","But it's your expectations about learning ability. And then there's a flip side of this in evolutionary theory, right? The whole idea that that's what organisms are doing in evolution is trying to improve their evolved ability so that they're trying to increase, if you will, the flexibility of their lineage to cope with with whatever the environment can throw out."
"Unknown","01;48;37;09","01;48;54;03","And this is very much, I think, what what's happening in play, as you put it, you're trying to to engage with the world in a way that is wanting to know what the possibilities for further engagement are."
"Unknown","01;48;57;26","01;49;19;20","Thanks for the answer. And speaking to play, it's almost like you start with what you have the rubber band, the tin foil, so you start with the actual. But then you you think about what if and you think about adjacencies, even categorical adjacencies. So that was pretty interesting. So and then also a comment on what you said about the expectations of learning ability in active inference love."
"Unknown","01;49;20;02","01;49;52;01","We would hope to learn by doing and applying and update people's expectations and to increase their understanding of they can learn active inference. Basically, we'll figure out other ways to say it more directly, but will manifest through observations on people's screens that they can learn active inference. And then it's almost like in the cognitive dimension, our collective and our individual cognitive evolution will undertake yet another inflection point when we believe that we can learn."
"Unknown","01;49;52;15","01;50;14;09","So that will be really powerful. So, Scott. Yeah, along those lines, just in terms of further leverage, I want to talk a little bit about the buy or build decision that every organism makes. And the idea is do you build it early or do you get it outside? Right. And so it seems like one of the things that struck me is we talked about the brain being tied to language."
"Unknown","01;50;14;19","01;50;37;02","One of the things I've been discussing with lately and this is the question I've been fussing with, the idea that the mind resides in language and the brain is just an antenna tuned to the mind. Now, the antenna would be the Marco blanket right or the the action of the Marco going into a continuous dynamic tuning and the so that you're if you're born into a cultural context."
"Unknown","01;50;37;15","01;50;55;27","But it could be my sister adopted a five month old Chinese baby who was raised in central Pennsylvania. He looks Chinese. He doesn't speak Chinese like Chinese food. She's not Chinese. Right. So her mind is a creature of her environment and body. So one of the things in terms of affordances, you know, we talk about resources internally to develop the market."
"Unknown","01;50;55;27","01;51;14;15","Like, you know, you can really shortcut that if you say, hey, I know that my resource internally is I should tie myself to to Daniel because he's awesome and he knows all the stuff. I don't have to know it. I just have to know if I have a question, I'll go ask him. Right. You start to think like it's like eukaryotic revolution of multicellularity."
"Unknown","01;51;14;26","01;51;40;04","You start to have this de-risking and leverage at larger scales made possible by the fact of synthesis of multiple Markov blankets. Now they can be synthesized around common ideas or common problems. So the question is, in terms of that, again, that separateness we see ourselves and our market blanket in our minds as separate, but it seems like maybe they're not."
"Unknown","01;51;40;23","01;52;46;06","Maybe maybe the mind is all one thing. And we have these instantiations of it that we call different. They're different iterations of that markup. Like if you comment on that kind of macro and micro level notion briefly of the I'll try not I think this is all good thinking. I, I view this in the language of in a sense extended organism thinking and evolutionary theory of which is very closely connected to, to multicellularity and evolutionary theory which is closely connected to the sorts of, of facultative multicellularity you see in microbial communities of I think from a, from a I think we see examples of this throughout biology and so the question becomes how do, how"
"Unknown","01;52;46;06","01;53;13;14","do we take this into the human sphere? Or as I think you posed it very clearly of how do we realize that it's already been taken into the human sphere? We just don't quite get it yet. And and I suspect that you're right that we just don't quite get it yet. And I remember in graduate school someone said what you're what you're learning is how to read the literature."
"Unknown","01;53;14;04","01;53;46;23","Yeah. You don't need to learn any facts that has to do with security. Right. And new forms of threat and integrity and privacy. All these or problems are not this is Sarily new problem. And that's why I wondered about the biology with biomimicry. You see that we can how can we actively pursue biochemistry? You start to think Oh, sorry, you're a little quiet the other stuff."
"Unknown","01;53;46;23","01;54;14;26","But with this close the our Chris really thanks so much and also to Shauna for joining with your expertize. But really this was a special event for us. We would always welcome the opportunity to speak with you or colleagues to learn more. And any other final thoughts that you'd like to give in closing? Chris, you'll feel free to send me email."
"Unknown","01;54;16;11","01;54;41;08","My address is on my website because field of research dot com. All the papers I publish recently are there. But yeah, I'd love to continue discussing. Awesome. Well, thanks a lot. And next week we're going to be having a follow up discussion to really digest this, definitely relisten to it and go from there. So thanks everyone for joining and we'll see you another time and we'll see you another time."
"Unknown","01;54;41;10","01;54;55;23","And we'll see you another time. And we'll see you another time. And we'll see you another time. And we'll see you another time. And we'll see you another time. And we'll see you another time. And we'll see you another time. And we'll see you another time. And we'll see you another time. And we'll see you in a."
