"Unknown","00;00;05;19","00;00;31;29","Hello. Welcome to Active Inference Lab and Active Inference Live Stream 17.2. It's March 16th, 2021. Welcome to the Active Inference Lab, everyone. We're a participatory online lab that is communicating and learning and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at our links on this slide. This is a recorded and an archived live stream, so please provide us with feedback so that we can be improving on our work."
"Unknown","00;00;32;20","00;01;02;11","All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here, and we'll be following video etiquette for streams at this shortened link you'll find our calendar for active inference live streams for 2021. And here we are in the follow up to 17.1 in the same paper and definitely recommended to check out 17.0 and 17.1 if you haven't. But this will hopefully be a cool discussion either way and you can also see the future lectures."
"Unknown","00;01;02;27","00;01;38;08","Cool. Well, today in 17.2, we are going to be just continuing to discuss and learn this really interesting paper and it will be fun to speak with whoever joins or doesn't it, for this stream. And also hopefully to get some questions from the live chat. But we're just going to introduce ourselves, go over some general questions and I think seeing as it's talked to and we had a lot of the background and dot zero and then we had Chris Fields, the author, come on for one."
"Unknown","00;01;38;25","00;02;14;02","Let's just think about where we can take this fun discussion. OK, so here, especially for our first time participants, we can introduce ourselves and just warm up. So first we can just introduce yourself. I'm Daniel, I'm in Northern California and I'll pass it to Steven Mean. Hello there. I'm Steven. I'm in Toronto, Canada, and I'm interested in a number of areas that relate to active infants, particularly those that can form community based development."
"Unknown","00;02;14;16","00;03;08;01","And the way that we make meaning in complex contexts, and I'll pass it over to is that Alex then Dean Dean. So hi, I'm Dean. I don't know how to pass things yet. I'm pretty new to this. I'm in Calgary, so. Hi, Steven in Toronto. And I decided just to step into this because of a reach out to Daniel did on ResearchGate and a follow up and then the opportunity to look at last week 17.1 presentation and for about 2 hours I was completely absorbed in the conversation and thought this is really interesting."
"Unknown","00;03;08;01","00;03;14;28","So I took the next step and decided that I would try and integrate myself more with what's going on here."
"Unknown","00;03;17;06","00;03;43;03","Oh, well, let's maybe learn more about your perspective as we walk through some of these warm up questions and just go through whatever pace you want, just sort of the topics in the paper as well. So the warm up questions are, what is something you're excited about today? What's something you liked or remembered about the paper or also the discussion, 17.0 or one?"
"Unknown","00;03;43;21","00;04;09;13","And what's something you're wondering about or would like to have resolved? So maybe since we all listen to it and hopefully those listening will have to. What was something about 17.1 that sort of stood out in people's mind or something that changed how they thought about active inference or how they thought about something that wasn't active inference yep."
"Unknown","00;04;09;13","00;04;33;24","Stephen Yeah. Well, one of the things that was quite interesting was that there are other ways of people looking at the math side of it. Which some of you know, the math itself is normally quite a challenging area to get your head down, but to realize there's also some other thoughts happening, some foundational level. So that was interesting."
"Unknown","00;04;33;24","00;05;26;05","I didn't know about that, particularly the extent that was happening. So that was particularly one area and that tied into this idea of quantum context reality, which I hadn't heard of actually, and really was very interested Dean, what do you think I guess the biggest thing for me was and I use terms that may not you might have to unpack them, but one of the things that I was really interested in listening to was the fact that that the perspective piece and how are you every time you're observing something, the perspective that you hold you may not be aware of how important that is, but the fact that Chris sort of brought that out again"
"Unknown","00;05;26;05","00;05;35;07","and again well, that really, really resonated with me because it's something that I've been working with with people for a long time."
"Unknown","00;05;38;00","00;06;09;00","Cool. So a few thoughts that I had from 17.1 and also what you just said. So this quantum contextually and then the part that was really novel and exciting to me was thinking about quantum not as just simply about electrons and protons and OK, you got strong force, weak force, electrons, protons, Maxwell's, you know, just throw the regular physics, particle physics or something and then it's just equations that have different efficacy over different spatial scales."
"Unknown","00;06;09;00","00;06;41;10","That's one presentation of quantum. And so then it's like, well, if you were that size or there's something about the system, about that specific system or that size of system that makes it quote quantum. And this just expanded the definition of quantum to me, to this kind of measurement, communication, encryption, encoding, and ultimately also bidirectional meaning and semantic information all the way down so that was a very different way to think about the relationship of like the molecule to the electron orbital."
"Unknown","00;06;41;18","00;07;06;16","It's like it's quantum. It's not the way that the electrons would be behaving by themself. But maybe that's not just because they're electrons. Maybe that's something about structure in general. So that's pretty cool. And also you mentioned and Chris did Dean observation as always coming from a perspective, and that was something that we talked a lot about with the projective consciousness model from an earlier discussion."
"Unknown","00;07;07;00","00;07;32;21","And so that was saying, yes, you get all these cybernetic functions and all these functional attributes of consciousness from a projective geometry where the observer is at the center at this actual special point, and then things are projecting out in a certain way. So that's like kind of physical, analog, it's geometric. And then Steven, you said there was a different sort of math that they were presenting."
"Unknown","00;07;33;05","00;07;58;20","They didn't used projection of geometry. This was from like a different branch of the game with the category theory and with these other theories that we just we're barely scratching the surface on so that, you know, what does that mean? That those different branches can re integrate in a certain way and then potentially not just through an equation, but through a process theory."
"Unknown","00;07;59;17","00;08;22;07","So that was some interesting stuff. Any other thoughts or I mean, really yeah, we're just we're just. Yeah, go ahead. Just ask somebody that's really interesting. Just let it sit land. I thought I hear what you're saying. I like that this idea of perspective and this idea that, you know, the idea that this quantum idea can be much more of scale."
"Unknown","00;08;22;07","00;08;51;19","And he did talk about we call it quantum noise. There was the use of noise, which then gives a rationale, I think, for how this quantum processes could permeate through everything, even if you don't see quantum transitions in the simple sense, like you said, with electrons and stuff, there's this this is permeating and that that then comes to that idea of the context reality as well as perspective."
"Unknown","00;08;51;19","00;09;21;15","When we think we take a different perspective in a very OK, I can see I've moved from here to here and I've taken a perspective, but perspective at this kind of phenomenological deep level is kind of happening at some all scales, like the context is changing beyond what we can take a perspective on, if that makes sense, except we use the word perspective because that's what we can get a handle on."
"Unknown","00;09;21;15","00;10;03;26","But it's changing in so many ways, of which some of which we just can't know. So I thought that was really interesting and maybe that's something that our biology is now in a deeper level. You know, it may be these nested levels. There's ways of which that sort of notion is being harvested. One's for a better term. So yeah, thanks the body knowing which is something we hear about and something you just said, it's almost like if the body knows through action like the tendon knows to do this because of its biomechanical properties."
"Unknown","00;10;03;26","00;10;35;06","But that's it's how the knowledge it's not a Turing computer it's not doing some trigonometry, but it involves angles, but it's because of how it's embodied. So that's it. It's, it's not the knowledge on a hard drive so that's sort of why some of these information science approaches are probably on the cutting edge of what information means because we're having to think about how there is information like in the body of the insect that helps it walk or in the nervous system of the insect."
"Unknown","00;10;35;06","00;10;54;25","There's some pattern generators for example, that that's where the knowledge of walking is. So it can't do every walking pattern, but it is like this attractor for walking. And then that's where the knowledge is but it's not all knowledge, and it's not a text file or a script that is implemented on how to walk or not even really an algorithm."
"Unknown","00;10;55;16","00;11;14;28","So it's kind of like good. And also, yeah, knowing is on the inference side. And then what is the other side of that? With action interesting. Yeah."
"Unknown","00;11;17;17","00;11;51;26","Well, good question. So I use sometimes uses the frame of, of prisms and prismatic and you got energy in and then you got a rainbow on the other side. Daniel, are you kind of talking about seeing both at once like knowing what both are are doing? I mean, it's going to go through this triangle, right? But I mean, just being aware that what, what what we see on one side is not necessarily what we see on the other side and that doesn't make one more important than the other."
"Unknown","00;11;52;02","00;12;29;04","It's what's important is knowing how things are are looking to the person who's got this perspective. Now, OK, I'll try to address it. Yeah. I seem to remember Shauna saying the word prismatic or chromatic or something about. Yeah, I use that all the time. Yeah. OK, it probably has an interesting technical definition. So it's interesting just that it's like a vivid sensory representation of all the opportunities, all the possibilities, all the colors, the rainbow and even beyond with the electromagnetic spectrum."
"Unknown","00;12;29;22","00;12;56;04","Greetings, blue. Welcome and then there's like, yes, the prism focusing different rays of light or just optics. Like the rays of light are focusing at the center point and then that's where the focus is. That's where the regime of photons is. And then that's what enables the function greetings blue. Do you want to say hi and give any thoughts while I just resize some stuff?"
"Unknown","00;12;56;26","00;13;18;01","Yeah, sure. Good morning, everyone. My name is Blue Knight. I am an independent research consultant based out of New Mexico. And yeah, this paper was, I don't know, it was like really difficult to work through. I thought and also really well written for like I'm not like one to sit and read like Max Lemon this and theorem that."
"Unknown","00;13;18;01","00;13;40;04","And that's always like not my thing. I mean, I always find it just difficult to digest. I like to do math as problems, but not read it as like reading material. But I thought that for like, the amount of information that was contained in this paper, it was like really well-written and easy to relate to. I did think that it could give you some additional, like practical examples of stuff."
"Unknown","00;13;40;12","00;14;00;26","But then like considering the length of the paper, I was like, man, if they, like, put practical examples for all of these different things, it would have been like a 70 page paper so those are my thoughts on the paper. And it was great having Chris here with us last week to answer all of our questions and definitely something I really enjoyed."
"Unknown","00;14;01;02","00;14;41;00","So cool yeah. I wonder if we can keep that question about examples of this in mind as we maybe look through the keywords or look through the roadmap. Let's just reacquaint with the paper. So this is the information flow in context dependent hierarchical Bayesian inference by fields in Glazebrook, one of their papers and collaborations together and they basically lay out that there's two goals there, kind of a twin purpose with this paper."
"Unknown","00;14;41;19","00;15;10;12","So one piece is related to what Steven was bringing up earlier with taking this quantum contextual approach and then generalizing it in a scale free a.k.a multi scale way using techniques that are scale free, apparently such as choose basis and channel theory, although also say like a linear regression is scale free. There's no a priori scale for a linear regression."
"Unknown","00;15;10;12","00;15;56;06","It could be over little things that could be ever big things. So in a way, just saying scale free is almost like saying we made it about how the modeler approaches the system so that we didn't get tied down in attributes the system that we don't want to be making scale free. And then the second side of this scale free approach to contextual i.t is they're going to demonstrate a connection between that and a lot of recent work in Bayesian statistics and hierarchical Bayesian models, which is also where the most direct connection to active inference comes into play because we've also seen hierarchical Bayesian models as implementing active inference."
"Unknown","00;15;56;19","00;16;20;07","And then that's being tied to something that's at a different or a higher level of mathematical generality, which potentially could allow like an active inference model that you make for this specific task. If you make it within that framework, you might be able to lift it out and put it somewhere totally different. Like you might be able to use it to describe systems and fit parameters or generate data."
"Unknown","00;16;20;19","00;16;54;27","That's something that not all models can do, but there's probably other modeling maneuvers that will be possible. And so it's kind of like if you have Gaussian assumptions, certain things and statistics work really well together, like, you know, certain relationships between multiplying things and adding variances. So this is kind of like a higher level statistical relationship. And I think that has to do with the commitment that commuting of the cones or the cow cones, but who knows um, OK."
"Unknown","00;16;55;09","00;17;33;17","On the roadmap, were there any sections that like sprung to mind or anything somebody wants to say on this all right. Let's go to why it matters and think about the examples. So yeah, Steven yeah, OK. And good point you just made. I think that the that example that was just given actually about the prison, I think was a good one."
"Unknown","00;17;33;17","00;18;18;22","I think that might even itself be something that could even be a topic of discussion. I think that opens up things, but it also it gets some other stuff because one thing that's going on here is the Bayesian inference. You're kind of inside the situation that's at play. And what I think that if we're going to say why this matters, I think it might relate interest in the to a paper that's going to be actually coming up in the next week, which talks about the way that we understand global workspace and theory of the brain and the idea that we have this phenomenological consciousness which is somehow attuned to the flux of sensory data."
"Unknown","00;18;19;02","00;18;55;11","And then we have what we're actually often modeling, which is what we're able to be aware of. So this flux that the, you know, which sort of starts to get into the Mark Colvin Monism theories of, of Fiston, this seems to sort of give another way to go from the flux up. Maybe this the, you know, in the way that David Bowen talks about the implicit order of nature and and I got a message from him as well just through saying about to think that you know we've got this idea of quantum noise and classical noise."
"Unknown","00;18;55;21","00;19;25;22","You know and you know this nonlinear dynamical systems are kind of working with what could be seen as noise or changes in noise. So so I think that that part of the, that part of the, the story itself is sort of important across all of that in some way, because at some level there has to be a way to extract meaning from this and see."
"Unknown","00;19;26;02","00;20;00;29","And so it seems that this gives some other way into that blue or here's a thought. OK, go ahead. I just going to say that. So back to the perspective thing so one of the hardest things that when I was working was with people trying to find themselves in new situations was you you you go either inside of the box or you're outside of it."
"Unknown","00;20;00;29","00;20;25;02","And I like the word that Steve and use their extraction because I think that that I think what this work does is it maybe enables that extraction piece a little easier if if people know what you're talking about in terms of stepping back. We have a tendency to step into things and analyze things from a from an inside out perspective."
"Unknown","00;20;25;02","00;21;00;13","And I think how this how this could potentially work is is a way of of gaining a sense of removal, which is actually advantageous at times. I mean, if you're looking at something that's complex, it's very difficult sometimes not to get caught up in the in the moment. I was speaking just before the livestream started about white water rafting when you're when you're going down the river and you're in a class three rapid, you're thinking about that."
"Unknown","00;21;00;13","00;21;42;27","You're not thinking about the perspective of being up on the cliff, watching the raft go down the river. I think this allows people to get outside of that moment, think that's my one of my hopefully why this matters. Contributions even well, just sort of with that, I think in some ways I agree what you're saying. But I would also say what's interesting is maybe it allows you to remove yourself more than we normally can because but also show that actually when you think you immersed in it, you aren't as immersed as you think you are."
"Unknown","00;21;43;06","00;22;18;21","Right. Because there's these other levels of immersion which you're beyond your conscious awareness, and there's probably even other levels which are even beyond your phenomenological and biological systems ability to tap into. So there's a maybe it's both ends, if that makes sense. You go you can go further in if the word in is meant that way and further out if the word out is meant that way, so on this, why it matters, here's one thought and anyone else or could go for second."
"Unknown","00;22;18;21","00;22;42;04","So Stephen, when you said extraction and I know you have a background in chemistry, so that's sort of like it's separating into the different fractions. So it's it's not just extracting like, you know, the lithium from the ore. It's actually like we can have a discussion. What are the affordances? What is on the table? What are we just going to just say is our option space for policy?"
"Unknown","00;22;42;19","00;23;04;01","And then what are our preferences and what kind of uncertainties are we each bringing to the table from our perspective? So it is not like we're extracting the essence of the conflict and then we're going to fix the essence or the reduction of the conflict or one dimension of the conflict perceived. And then that will propagate through the other aspects of the situation."
"Unknown","00;23;04;13","00;23;36;23","It's kind of like we're going to come with uncertainty to a minimal model. And then if one person has one narrative for the policy and somebody else has a different narrative, that's off the table. So that is a way where people can bring their different ways of seeing a common model differently. Like in the quantum measurement case, if those people are measuring the quantum particle and they're both fine with it, that's one type of experiment Stephen Yeah, I like the point you picked up though, in extraction."
"Unknown","00;23;36;23","00;23;57;17","It was interesting because that sort of came up so strongly. And I think the other thing that's interesting is the idea that even in chemistry, there's the idea that still you extract some thing, right? It's quite thing like, but the idea that you extract in something from noise is in chemistry. It's normally like basically you calculate everything down and then say, what is negligible?"
"Unknown","00;23;57;17","00;24;18;29","What can you say is beyond concern? So you just say it's beyond worry. You know, it's it's within tolerance, so to speak. And then you just work within. That was in this case, it's like, well, all that noise, so to speak, is what we extract in information from it. It feels to us like the stuff's out there and we're getting things nice, so to speak."
"Unknown","00;24;18;29","00;24;53;13","We're actually getting signals and I suppose extracting enough variation, free energy changes in the noise to then perceive it as, you know, knowledge. But it actually has to start out as fluctuations in I don't know if the word noise is maybe the wrong word, but certainly fluctuations in non-linear dynamics. So that's that's that changes a lot of things about how we understand now in the world interesting."
"Unknown","00;24;53;28","00;25;17;10","Here's kind of another point on the signal to noise. So we're thinking in the Shannon information a.k.a Shannon disinfo theory, nothing against it framework. It's about the telegraph and the wire and getting the exact recapitulate ation of the signal on one end of the wire as the other end of the wire. That was the second paragraph of the 1948 paper by Shannon."
"Unknown","00;25;17;20","00;25;41;05","We talked about it in the zero video he said the question of communication is about perfectly reconstituting a signal. And so in that framework if you have, if you're doing a chemical synthesis and there's one product you want, then you can calculate like the yield of that product. And then similarly if there's one thing that you know that you want, you know, you can calculate really exact statistics like information."
"Unknown","00;25;42;16","00;26;14;06","And then once you open it up to the semantics, then this the noise has a different perspective, just like you're highlighting here. I think there's a lot of richness what you already said, but yes, noise is richer than just decay in the copper wire. Because we're not trying to recapitulate anything in the person's mind. It's not a bitwise transfer through speech it's actually like the differences in the way that we speak are conveying meaning."
"Unknown","00;26;14;20","00;26;57;14","So it's not just error from some perceived pattern of speech. It's like just the meaning that the person is conveying through their action. So that, I think, is also something that really matters when we think about differences in how people are going to be learning or communicating or something like that. Stephen Yeah. And the interesting thing is that while to some extent you heat up the liquid or something expands and you sort of the energy put in shows itself as the work you particularly see, say, when water freezes, but there's this whole question of entropy and how it somehow tied to some rearrangement which is not shown as work in the system."
"Unknown","00;26;57;14","00;27;26;11","You know, that you try and heat up ice. It hits a point. There's something going on there and we can't quite know what it is. And it's energy hungry in some instances or energy yields. But that that process is beyond our direct perception. So you just have to build it in with gives free energy and the entropy in and self terms to see what will happen with reaction."
"Unknown","00;27;26;11","00;27;48;26","So that that actually then actually ties into Kristen's work it actually is the sort of foundation of his work in a way. So I'm not sure how entropy was named in this paper. Maybe. I don't think that's directly part of this math. This is another way to come in without maybe coming in it with the word entropy. But that's interesting."
"Unknown","00;27;49;22","00;28;19;13","Thanks Dean. I just again, just try to draw from examples when I would talk about this with people and there's a privilege always given over to gap closing. Like we want to close the gap, we want to understand and want to find the signal within the noise. And I think what this does is it sort of gives over a certain amount of credibility just to gap respecting, just leaving the thing mass out of it for a bit."
"Unknown","00;28;20;03","00;28;47;03","So that you can actually take in more information. Back to what Stephen was and what you're both alluding to. How do how do we how do we give ourselves cut ourselves a little bit of slack by saying gap prospecting is just as important as gap closing? And if we give ourselves that, it's a kind of a privilege to do that because it's twice as much effort as just gap closing."
"Unknown","00;28;48;01","00;28;50;27","I think the benefits can be really quite profound."
"Unknown","00;28;53;00","00;29;26;04","Nice point. Thank you. So, Sarah. Oh, Stephen, do you have anything to add here? Well, just one last point on that is that could then where you start to get into abducted growth based knowing where is maybe we're used to because humans have got this capacity for deductive and rapid, you know, exclusion of what's out there and inductive trying to narrow the gap between us and the goal but when we're growing, when we think about sometimes I need to just sit back and heal."
"Unknown","00;29;26;14","00;29;45;27","You know, there are certain situations in the world which I can never process psychologically from a I can't close the gap on certain things. I just have to sit back and heal. Right. Because they're hard. And so that that same piece you're talking about there, then starts to tap into, well, that's the main game in town for organisms."
"Unknown","00;29;46;19","00;30;21;23","Yeah. The game in town of closing gaps and isn't is a nice add on that we have, but it isn't the main game and full blue so that just brings up to mind like time as a gap closer, right? Like when you just sit back and heal and the ultimately like time as a gap closer. Like if you think about like the time value of money and I mean like time is ultimately the thing that will close the gap on a prediction."
"Unknown","00;30;21;23","00;30;40;21","And like we don't really see that in the models or in math at all. It'd be interesting to see like the temporal dimension and how that plays in or if people have thought about that or I mean time, like can it flow forward and backward? And I think that was something that was brought up maybe in the last livestream that's just interesting."
"Unknown","00;30;41;14","00;31;12;01","Yeah. Nice. Dean is just one last thing. I completely agree with you because again, that privilege goes on to time on task instead of task or task on time instead of just seeing time in and of itself. I have this crazy theory that that time is learning, not just a way of measuring learning. And I don't you can't get there unless you can get off that treadmill."
"Unknown","00;31;12;11","00;31;37;22","So thank you. That's a great point. And Dean, what you said about learning us time, it's like the difference between Kairos and Kronos. So Kronos, the chronometer, the decimal time, and it's about the wall time. The clock time. And then action is happening in a space of meaning of arc. It's time for dinner, and that's an action affordance."
"Unknown","00;31;37;22","00;32;10;29","And so that is something that's we can bring in the in culture component, whereas the other approaches know the wall. Time is just simply how it is. And we're going to like procrastinate, shrink, expand use here. Mystics use core training to get around this sort of fundamental linear izing from our perspective, just at the scale we're at, which makes it not scale free, which is why perhaps quantum only applies to certain so-called spatial levels of what we measure."
"Unknown","00;32;11;22","00;32;41;28","Stephen Yeah. So give me a sec. I had it and then what just went for segment. So let me ask Sarah's question because it's really nice point and chat. So Sarah wrote, Could we look at Q Space Slide and get a broader perspective of you to maximize signal to noise sort of speak? So maybe I didn't perfectly read it, but I think it was two spaces."
"Unknown","00;32;41;28","00;32;58;03","Can we enter into here a little bit and connect that to some of the bigger discussion points and maybe even the other useful points? So Stephen, you want to give a thought or is there anyone who wants to give a thought on the to space piece here?"
"Unknown","00;33;00;25","00;33;28;19","Yeah. Does this directly. I'm not sure exactly how this gives a way that things can transform from one space to another. So it gives you that capacity. I mean, sort of keep tying this to the idea of time and with and I know this paper is not specific active infants with active infants, you know, without time, you're not able to make inferences from noise, so to speak, or changes in information content, in random fluctuations."
"Unknown","00;33;28;29","00;33;58;10","You only get that because you got time because then you can tell if there's been a fluctuation. So one snapshot can't do that. Now, this seems to maybe give away, too. OK, you've now got a shape of the information space. What happens once it has a shape now? Beyond that, it's I'm not entirely sure yeah. Blue anything you'd say on this topic."
"Unknown","00;33;58;10","00;34;24;29","Otherwise, I think walking through kind of just the way they laid it out in the definitions could be helpful. And some of the examples they gave because like Stephen, you you mentioned this morph is a right and it seemed like there's the Chu space and that's like a matrix but one that can be various kinds of things. It's a matrix but just like we can represent a network with a matrix."
"Unknown","00;34;25;07","00;34;54;22","So we can think about like the space of all the networks, all the social networks of five people. It's like a five by five matrix and ones and zeros or weighted numbers. So that's the matrix representation of the network. And then that is one type of meaning of the matrix but also this can describe probability and it can describe programing languages, Bayesian networks, like if each cell had information about a conditional dependance or not."
"Unknown","00;34;55;02","00;35;35;26","So that's like a to space is the space of the possible of these things. And then this is the part where maybe we'll just say it's beyond experience on this conversation. But the Wikipedia has understood statically it's a relation and then understood dynamically and then it has another definition. So as it gets interesting, it has a static or a dynamic interpretation so I think it's yeah, unless anyone in the chat wants to jump in and help or somebody with Expertize wants to come on later how how can we connect that to some of these use cases, blue or that or anything else?"
"Unknown","00;35;35;26","00;36;15;06","Go ahead. So I think like the the dynamic aspect of the two space and the two Morph isms is that like, you know, any if you have like a set matrix, right? If you have a matrix and it's like any series of transformations that can be done to form a new matrix so that that in my mind, just like the dynamism of it all, like if I take a set A and I do this that this, that this, that in this specific order so again, like here here's like the temporal like where we're alluding to like time as a variable or time as a gap closer."
"Unknown","00;36;15;13","00;36;43;11","But like the temporal sequence is important because you know, if you do, you know, if you multiply before you subtract, as you get your order of operations wrong, it's going to be different. Right? So the temporal order of things is the more visible to to make the next set thanks for that. Another interesting sentence is that it's like the choo transform or the morph ism is a pair."
"Unknown","00;36;43;19","00;37;23;02","It kind of comes into existence as two spaces and a mapping between them or a map between them. And so that is what ties it really broadly to functions and computation and these sort of transformation, transmutation or input output seeming communication, seeming processes, measurement like processes because it's about some space and some other space. And so when we think about the active inference model and then we have hidden states, that inference is being done on and then we have observations and it's almost like there's a matrix that connects the two of them."
"Unknown","00;37;23;17","00;38;10;02","I'm not saying that that's going to be all at this level of Q space, but it's kind of like there's a mapping where you can run the model from the sense data to the state and do inference or you can generate from the state likely sensory data. So that is a bi directional, it's like a two way Bayesian machine because it can take in observations and update expectation issues of hidden state variables or it can generate so that generative and receptive elements of Bayesian computation is, I think, just it's like whatever is the topic that includes that and that network matrix and a few other things, that's kind of where this topic can go, which"
"Unknown","00;38;10;02","00;38;38;05","is why I think it's a really rich area and that's why the papers are written in 20, 20, and that's us. Yeah. Steven and Andy, I think this, this idea of moving between spaces is also really valuable because as you know, I'm very interested in understanding how we can look at weirdness and sort of indigeneity is very much about when this and a lot of the active income work work is tends to be out."
"Unknown","00;38;38;05","00;39;04;20","What this, what's this, what's that. How can we understand what this is understood to do and think about. But this when you start to get to this broader understanding of how we can make meaning and taking that idea at a very broad level is the ability to transform between spaces and engage with spaces. And that may extend up to our conscious awareness space."
"Unknown","00;39;04;26","00;39;42;29","But some of these spaces are well below the level of consciousness, you know, down to the level of cells, you know, but it's it seems to have and play out the importance of space shall transformation over what and this. Thank you, Stephen Dean. Yeah but I took away from this was that when we when we discriminate when we separate this sort of gives you a sense of why we might do that I think of some of the stuff that we looked at in some of the work that I did."
"Unknown","00;39;42;29","00;40;17;00","We would ask people to watch something maybe a YouTube clip and instead of trying to take all the information in as is is classically recorded through notes we'd ask them to columns and row in under three headings, tools and rules and pools. Now that was the moment, but rules basically where the gradient is what's aggregating. And so we'd ask people to classify something."
"Unknown","00;40;17;00","00;40;48;09","And what people found was something could fit into two categories. Something could be a tool and a rule. Sometimes it could go across all three. It could be a tool and a rule and a pool. Like there was a way of being able to see relationship and I think that's what this two spaces does. It says We can discriminate, we can separate, but sometimes things fit into multiple categories, and that's that's something we need to be aware of."
"Unknown","00;40;48;09","00;41;12;16","Our minds are able to sort of pull apart and then reorganize. That's what I took away from that nice very nice design. And I think that's sort of reflected by this cone and potentially even your prism topic because it's like, yes, there's a unity of C in this case, but it is going to be manifest in these different spaces."
"Unknown","00;41;13;01","00;41;43;04","And this is a really informative slide so let's talking again about these pair of choose spaces that are related through A Transform the Transform A to B, and this is from section, for example, to seven in the paper, they transform A to B in this case can be viewed as transporting the information encoded invalid flow formulas from A to B and can thus be thought of informally as a channel from A to B implicitly providing a sense of spatial and or temporal separation between A and B."
"Unknown","00;41;43;20","00;42;18;10","So I thought like there's the maps of meeting, and so there's my internal map, just so to speak, just using it instrumentally. And then there's person B and then if we're playing 20 questions and it's like, OK, is the house bigger or smaller than a breadbox? There's some semantic mapping, internal to me, and then there's a channel with this with the census data, and then there's a semantic flow related to whether they're going to give me a yes no which is like Chris said, that's Quanta because we're quantized the response."
"Unknown","00;42;18;10","00;42;46;05","Is it bigger or not? We're making a measurement of the response and they could be lying or they could be wrong, or they could, you know, we couldn't hear them or something, but it's a binary question. And then there's a semantic flow and then there's a back and forth potentially. Otherwise you're talking about different things. And so if somebody is thinking, OK, maybe I was thinking of a little toy house smaller than a breadbox so you have a different frame of reference."
"Unknown","00;42;46;26","00;43;21;19","Then even the communication is not going to work because the holograph is going to be read to differently by the people. Even with the same information so that's like the separation of cognition across participants in a conversation. And then that's happening implicitly through time. But then it seems like also things can be just more abstractly described as being separated through time."
"Unknown","00;43;22;04","00;43;52;03","And so something that's separated in time but not in space is like memory, which is where this whole discussion of memory comes into play because it's, it's a communication through time at that spot, like a time capsule. It's like 50 year message now debate whether the absolute position of the time capsule is the same, but it's like relative to it, it's a message through time blip so it's funny that you bring up a time capsule."
"Unknown","00;43;52;03","00;44;15;13","Like I've been really thinking about, you know, at scale, carrying information forward and backward, like from cells to person to like a group of people. And it's like, you know, when we what do we carry forward and when we used to make time capsules like every ten years, I don't know if we still do them, we would dig them up and like, you know, dig them up every 20 or 30 years or whatever."
"Unknown","00;44;15;13","00;44;51;02","And like what do we put into a time capsule? And does that effectively capture like the culture of the society at that time, like a CD or like, you know, these different things that go into the time capsule is like, this is actually like what we're carrying forward. And sometimes it's like dumb stuff. Like, I don't know, it's just funny to think about what goes forward in time and and why that and like how the selection process works and if it's like a systemic or generalized thing or I don't know, it's just something that I've been thinking about how that is transmitted across time."
"Unknown","00;44;52;09","00;45;24;19","Great question and very prescient, of course, with so much digital information and a potentially fluctuating cost of storage, wildly cheaper than wildly expensive. And that could lead to some very unfortunate information flows. Evolution has sort of an answer to that, which is like what's passed forward is what is fit to its niche not biggest bench press, strongest fittest, but fit to the niche, adapt skilled to the niche."
"Unknown","00;45;24;28","00;45;56;13","So we don't need to go to semantic on that, but I think the term actually does fit and where evolution by natural selection as well as active inference come into play is by formalizing a process theory, you kind of step away, or at least you can maybe get some distance or some model ability of these complex processes. So in evolution, the process theory is basically you have heritable variation in phenotype that's found in a population where there's heritable variation in fitness."
"Unknown","00;45;56;25","00;46;17;14","And if those are all linked up in the right way, at least locally, that's the way that the phenotype and the population moves. And so active inference, it's similar, but kind of like with information just saying, OK, since data comes in, action goes out from a generative model into the niche back in the sense something happens with the generative model, integrates the information, engages in policy."
"Unknown","00;46;17;28","00;46;37;02","So it's like if somebody listened to a lecture and they only write the notes of five sentences and then they passed that off the process theory explained why there was an information bottleneck there because we just model the situation and we don't need to go into it's tragic. There was only five sentences or there was more than, you know, it was five deep sentences though, or something like that."
"Unknown","00;46;37;05","00;47;07;04","We just say what it was that was the actual transmission. And then that is a starting point for the kinds of value oriented analysis that you might want to do afterwards. Dean. Yeah, I'm just curious what other people's thinking is on this, because typically between the inference and the model, we not necessarily to people here, but oftentimes what's parked in between those two things is a plan and what you just described is not a plan."
"Unknown","00;47;07;23","00;47;38;15","So I'm curious what other people think is between the inference and the model. I have my ideas, but I'm because I'm trying to get to know you folks. I'd like to know what you guys think is between the inference and the model. Stephen Yeah. Well, that's the $6 million question. I think that the the introduction of the quantum approach at certain scales does yield something very usable."
"Unknown","00;47;38;29","00;48;09;15","And and Chris's work with Mike Levin would tie into that because he does a lot of work with bio electrics on cells membranes. So I could see that this question where it's more directly attributed to two to quantum fluctuations and what that means, you know, at the level of the cell and the bio electrical or the chemical electrics or the bio electorate's of the membrane."
"Unknown","00;48;09;28","00;48;39;14","And then you the next level that I can kind of see it more plausible is brainwaves, you know, and you've got this overlap there. Maybe there's some quantum effects. But then in between that, I'm is probably more action is more classical in terms of how you pick things up. It's literally like I just keep doing it and in a very rough and ready way, I extract some sense of how it is to pick up an apple or something, you know, and I mean throwing things in a more classical way."
"Unknown","00;48;39;14","00;49;11;18","So there's that. I think there's a mixture of a classical and not only past partially knowable set of information transfer and maybe some more quantifiable stuff, which maybe is I don't know if it gives you more accuracy at that level, but might be more quantum like. But I'm not that's, that's my thoughts OK, so just to Dean, the question was what's in between the model and the inference?"
"Unknown","00;49;12;06","00;49;32;17","OK, is that what you asked? Yeah, so let's just kind of go into that. So what by model you mean the actual code as you wrote it on the computer or the actual systems diagram? Like the model. You mean what's on the computer or what's on the paper? Is that what you mean? Or is product? That's the product of the model."
"Unknown","00;49;32;25","00;49;59;14","And then the inference is the computation that the model does, or is it is the inference how we then look at that model and then decide how we should do policy because it's literally in it's it's moment by moment. It's that it's the smallest time, smallest of time, frames relative to the the end the end game or the end product."
"Unknown","00;49;59;16","00;50;23;28","How do people typically they put a plan in between those two bookends that's how they parameter things. And so what I'm curious was what other people think actually is in there, because I know we see a plan where we're given a plan, but I'm not sure that that's exactly what's going on. So I was just curious what other people thought is going bloop."
"Unknown","00;50;25;04","00;50;50;15","So like I'm not sure that I'm also like understanding the question. So there's like the generative model and the predictive model, right? So there's these two models. And so the generative model is like the model that you like. How Daniel probably you have a better way to say that. And then the predictive model is in my mind, that's the plan."
"Unknown","00;50;50;22","00;51;11;22","Like I predict that if I invest in crypto, I will have 10% more money at the end of the year or whatever, right? Like that's my prediction. That's my predictive model, that's my, my my plan. So in my mind, those two things are, are synonymous. But, but maybe Daniel can, can clarify or speak to that in a better way."
"Unknown","00;51;11;24","00;51;38;26","I think you blew I think I try to just take what you wrote annotated a little bit the internal states is a generative model of the niche and that includes the Asians action in the niche. Like I can see myself going on a walk every morning. That's like a combination of a trajectory of action and affordances and a niche and other regularities and other availabilities, shoes or something like that."
"Unknown","00;51;39;13","00;52;19;25","And then there's the actual generative process and the general process is like the part that is the play. And also where cybernetics theory is like the, quote, good regulator theory come into play because the cybernetics is like, well, you have to be effective, you have to have all the variables in your environment. But then we can look at for example, alternate understandings of astronomy, and there might be evolutionarily adequate different understandings of astronomy that allow individuals to deal with the regularities in their environments for the niche that they're in, given their affordances."
"Unknown","00;52;20;11","00;52;41;10","So the but the sort of realism take would be that it's the same moon and suck at the chart, you know, the Fibonacci spiral, all these things you can do. But it's about the narrative of policy under that generative model, the niche. But it's the same market that I mean, it gives me an ability to act in a non surprised way."
"Unknown","00;52;41;22","00;53;19;03","As opposed to using surprise all, which is this kind of metric which I can kind of use both in my retina and my nerves and everything is this kind of general awareness of how much of a variation is applied but surprise. And you know, something can happen to me once and I make big decisions on that. And that is sort of basically sitting on top of all this activity sort of need to know as an animal because and, and there's a there's a great presentation on this where at one point in history, basically we have to add in into our environment."
"Unknown","00;53;19;09","00;53;41;22","So up to then it was just like how part and sometimes things fit multiple categories. So how do we explain that with a plan? No, because that's fluid, that's just dependent upon how you're looking at it. And sometimes you'll, you'll talk to the person beside you and say, do you see what I see, which you've you've already pointed that out a couple of times in this conversation."
"Unknown","00;53;41;22","00;54;12;08","So I'm just trying to figure out what's in there is I think it's more than a plan and I'd hate to default just to that. We're over reduced just to that because I think that's part of the problem when we're trying to figure this stuff out. Thanks, Dean and Blue so definitely there is a who. And I think that that really loops us back around to the point of this of fields and place for paper that there's this intrinsic contextual."
"Unknown","00;54;12;25","00;54;36;11","And so you can't really effectively model contextual ality unless it's you can remove the intrinsic component, right? So when you can you when you can remove the subjective aspects like I mean, we had a conversation, I remember just last week or two weeks ago about like at a dinner party, like how was the food? Did you have a good time like not to do like how was the food, was it fun?"
"Unknown","00;54;36;11","00;54;52;25","And so all of this is like you know, there's no objective answer to these questions. It's going to be different for all of the 15 people that were at the dinner party, right? Like some person liked the food, some person had fun. One person didn't. One person thought the food was cold or didn't like the dessert or whatever."
"Unknown","00;54;52;25","00;55;18;15","Right? There's the subjective experience, so it's really difficult to separate the WHO from contextually nice questions and answer. Stephen Yeah. This is very this is very important, actually, what you're saying. I mean, I think this also ties into this idea of what it means when we do planning and also how we think of planning and start to extrapolate that."
"Unknown","00;55;18;15","00;56;02;05","So generally speaking, in the, in the everyday sense of planning, we have like some sort of shared something in the niche. Like we have a plan. We often make plans. If not, it's somehow there in some verbal semantic thing, which isn't just in our head is in the neat sort of in this semantic niche. And but the the idea, for instance, of how does my body know the plan for getting on a street car right when the doors on I, I know how to do that and it's not but that kind of plan has to come from somewhere and it's much more there in I mean so they get all merged together but the and"
"Unknown","00;56;02;05","00;56;26;03","that maybe is partly in on the issue in the way that we have the right sort of shoes on. We, we set up the design, you know, because we have some control. But then even when you get into other areas of the network I come across a particular cliff in a mountain and I'm, you know, I'm not from the modern world, so I haven't got all the technology right but you can reinterpret the past, right?"
"Unknown","00;56;26;12","00;56;50;08","You can do. Yeah. That's not within our affordances. It's we can only infer on certain things, but we have causal agency. And actually in the SPM textbook, there's some integrals that are like from all of the time series together, just like sort of mashed all the time together. And there's other ones that are calculated, like up to that moment in a sliding window."
"Unknown","00;56;50;18","00;57;11;16","And then it says that's what makes it causal is we've restricted the analysis to only the previous states. That's kind of how mathematically causality is defined as is like, well, if it's lagged in time or if you slide a window as the arrow of time, you know, changes, but then that's not the same thing as the arrow of time."
"Unknown","00;57;12;02","00;57;39;11","Or the experience of time or anything like that. So yeah, but then this local logic slide was just to say that and to also continue this discussion on contextual city. It's the local settings. So how can I where does this matter and how does this expand the discussion and hopefully lead to more powerful models is if you're not playing with the local rules, then you're not playing the game."
"Unknown","00;57;39;29","00;58;08;23","And so you're going to semantically lose against nature. If there's organization in a way that attempts to violate local logic, like if there's some equivalence between heat and computation in our current understanding and you design a machine that just violates those rules, like you don't plan to dissipate a certain amount of heat given how much computation. It's like if you're not designing within the rules of the system, you're just making a poor computer."
"Unknown","00;58;09;16","00;58;32;21","And so we're talking about communication, though, and information transfer that's meaningful. So what are the local logics for communication? What are the local objects they are shared by people who speak the same language versus all languages versus all ages and things like that. What's the shared context that lets us communicate what we need or how we should act together?"
"Unknown","00;58;43;11","00;58;50;04","What else? What would be a fun slide to go to or just topic to go to?"
"Unknown","00;58;53;28","00;59;27;27","It mentions earlier. This is the idea that might just be interesting to see his take on that. Yeah, no you know, Blue, do you remember? But I feel like you're good to see wasn't. We can look actually in the paper itself but just see if it's used or not used in the paper itself. But we put it in there for some reason partially related to these kind of what we're talking about now in a way like as you're bringing up its relevance of a term."
"Unknown","00;59;27;27","01;00;12;29","But yeah, it might be there's a question about it raises that question because it's such a big part of act of inference how those two things relate because it seems to be that it gets at some of the questions without the need necessarily for that this is in the same way, but maybe I'm not reading into it, but I got a feeling that it may not requirement because you have these spaces that maybe have inherent ways of obtaining knowledge or information between these different types of you know, morphological transformations OK, I think here is where we asked it."
"Unknown","01;00;13;16","01;00;42;00","So this is the quote in the paper they're talking about contextually by default. And they say the criterion effectively generalizes the intrinsic contextual ity of quantum theory so the one that we know of with wave and the particle and the entanglement, spooky action stuff to the case in which other properties of a context, e.g. the order in which questions are asked also affect the distribution of a variable of interest."
"Unknown","01;00;42;15","01;01;10;29","So it's like 20 questions. If you go down to one branch first, it's going to be like a bifurcation with a question and communication is like a bifurcation. Whereas in the Telegraph in the Shannon info theory, it's like if a signal is garbled and it doesn't come through, it's like it's a lost transmission, but semantically it might ruin the file but at the level of the message, it just wasn't transmitted accurately."
"Unknown","01;01;11;22","01;01;42;15","But so it bifurcates the meaning of the file, but from a signal to noise, it didn't have a categorical bifurcation. Maybe only one bit in a million was actually flipped, and that was just a stochastic thing. But when we think about semantic information flow the order in which the information flows, especially in a dialectical or in an ecological context, is like the whole topic of information flow is improvised, or at the very least it's it's engaging."
"Unknown","01;01;43;01","01;02;23;07","So it's not just the letters on the page recapitulated but it's something informational. Stephen Yeah, that, that that's important. And that ties into the idea of how much this like with Shannon Entropy or this the idea of a signal as something in the signal and you're losing some of it. Now with Kristen's work, it's the idea of what it's all nonlinear and you need the action so that you can compare the the way that the signal changes are happening to infer something from the noise that is fake."
"Unknown","01;02;23;07","01;02;52;14","You need the action. But in this case, it's like there's another way to sort of say there's an inherent something out there so to speak. There's sort of something in the signal. It's not just only the action needed, which is probably why then this can be applied to Bayesian inference and not only active inference, because the saying there's something inherent, you don't only need the action and you're getting it because of the order in which the questions are asked."
"Unknown","01;02;54;12","01;03;27;17","And that order actually gets interesting. Then that isn't often how I've thought of contextualize. I just think of how contextual this is. Where am I? You know what I mean? And what's happening. But what order did what happened happen? Give me something is new and then. Yep. When are we and when? Where are we there? All those questions blew so I have a comment on Ergot City, but can you back up to the concoction diagram?"
"Unknown","01;03;27;17","01;03;58;04","Because I think that this is why we brought it up. Yes, so here in this connection diagram, the one on the top, right? So, so you see this information channels, see? Right. That relates all these classifiers A1 to all the classifiers are linked to this core information channel and that that kind of doesn't really imply like a distributed system and it applies like a centralized control."
"Unknown","01;03;58;25","01;04;25;14","But we brought up this city because if you look down in the second picture here from sea to 2D, there's this community, commutative property that is or I guess it's even in the top picture. So it's this the GS, right? Like the commutative aspect of the cone diagram and so I think that that's where the electricity came in to this paper, right?"
"Unknown","01;04;25;14","01;05;05;03","Like the fact that that all properties are available to all points in the cone to the pool. And also, you know, these topics can go expand beyond the narrow in the technical but let's think about the technical definition of sampling error. Goodness. So not taking on all the experiential elements per se, but a remember is a classifier. So it's a two space scarlet letter A, that's what's being represented with the and it itself is a classifier because when we were talking about the two spaces, there was like it could be the types of a computer language and then what their descriptions are."
"Unknown","01;05;05;14","01;05;26;23","So this is like cats are small, you know, horses are big. This is my classifier, you know, big and small and then horse and cat and then just which one's big, which one is small. So it's it's a true space informally. And then here is a different true space, a two at a different time. Maybe it's time point two, maybe it's person two, maybe it's all the people."
"Unknown","01;05;26;23","01;05;49;19","So here's me eight, a sub K, all the K people or all the K moments. And whether it's one person three time, if you ask the question, you get the same quantized response. Yes. The cat is smaller than the horse because cat small, horse big. If you always get that response back semantically, then you're sampling from air. Good Disti with respect to that question."
"Unknown","01;05;50;11","01;06;18;10","So there's it's a big topic with like what it means in physics and everything like that. But just from a sampling perspective, if there's K people in the room and you sample and all 100 of them or every time you sample 70 out of a hundred give you an answer, that's the sampling error. Get a city and then here are C and D, which are like two observers and they're kind of co sampling, but they can only see the raw data so they're able to see all just what we were getting out with."
"Unknown","01;06;18;10","01;06;54;07","The top part, just like this is like sampling across informally population or through time. And then it's ergodic. If there is a station already there here, that is the same scenario, but now there's two observers and then if they are related in this very specific way, then it opens up a lot of connections semantically between C and D also, Sarah added in the chart that salience is a time dependent phenomena and that's extremely true."
"Unknown","01;06;54;07","01;07;21;11","So everything that we talk about with attention and salience and surprise, those are like almost explicitly time bound processes. And even in machine learning, when people talk about, oh, it's a neural network with attention or with recurrence, they're kind of talking about a time elements, but anything. That's where it's not just a snapshot that moves state to state, but there's something that's captured across time steps and that's called attention sometimes."
"Unknown","01;07;22;07","01;07;29;08","So it's kind of like it's actually a similar way to how it's used in a modeling framework here."
"Unknown","01;07;34;10","01;08;06;22","This was one question that we had in Dozier and beyond, and I hope we got to ask Chris a little bit. But like what are examples or how can we, you know, what's the next question to ask or what's the next system to explore this way? That was one set of questions. Also, if anyone in LA has any questions, we can definitely look at those um, what else would be interesting?"
"Unknown","01;08;06;22","01;08;46;17","I mean, there's a few more slides that we haven't looked at that we could kind of explore so maybe one element here is. Oh, yeah, go ahead, Steven. Sorry. Well, just just once he talked about maybe this is something you brought up as a as a slightly new advancement. You talk about severability, severability as a sort of the position that sort of center stage during his slides, when he did his introduction as maybe a way to think about sexuality in a more tractable way."
"Unknown","01;08;48;17","01;09;16;12","Yeah. I wondered if that was, you know, how did that come up? Was that something? Oh, that's in there. Was that a little bit surprising that he when he did that yeah. Great question and point. So I just searched in the document. There's two spots where it's mentioned the right. We have previously shown how inference can be represented using the formalism of this paper, employing only the quantum theory of separable systems and the thermodynamics of measurement interactions."
"Unknown","01;09;17;03","01;09;40;12","So there's the citation to fields in Glazebrook to explore that more. But I think from what we're talking about here is an interesting part that is related to two spaces. It is often the case that two species may be separable or other types, but let's just focus on the separable elements i.e. both separable. So it could be separable."
"Unknown","01;09;40;12","01;10;05;15","It's almost like you can have another two space, you know, which two spaces either Z are separable or not. So there's separable equality. And then it says separable means all rows are distinct, extensional means all columns are distinct. So actually the transform that goes between them is probably the transpose the T in R, and then if it's separable in columns and you transpose it, it's separable in rows."
"Unknown","01;10;05;25","01;10;29;07","So that's like a relationship that's kind of a high level, but it's maintained when you transform it back and forth, like blue is, say, abstract, abstract. You can transpose the matrix back and forth. So separable meaning the rows are distinct. So let's just think about the case of the true space as a descriptor just which was one of the ways that they used it."
"Unknown","01;10;29;11","01;10;52;04","So like the types of types of processes kind of. So if it's separable, it's like they're distinguishable types sometimes that's also called a full rank matrix where it's like every road column matters uniquely in informationally, there's no doubled rows where you could condense the matrix by saying, actually there's five of this row. And so this or this row is a linear combination of this other row."
"Unknown","01;10;52;24","01;11;19;26","Steven Yeah, that, that this, this is good to bring it back here because it's this is sort of the applications of it and the ability to um, I think there's more that can be looked at with this over time. I think this is obviously something that's going to be quite pliable. And it also relates to, you know, this idea of self-organization and planned organization."
"Unknown","01;11;20;13","01;11;58;18","So, you know, how much are things able to see to infer things because of the, um, the separate military that in itself maybe changes what's possible and yeah, actually here's a quote we haven't looked at. This is really interesting though, in working set theoretically. So with this sort of set approach to choose spaces, there is considerable scope for the choice of arguments in the true space as well as the choice of the corresponding relation."
"Unknown","01;11;58;18","01;12;27;16","Ah, because we get to choose the spaces and the map so we can, you know, map from various things to various things different ways these. So what kinds of things can we do probabilistic in particular conditional relationships. So that's like all of computation and stats, Bayesian fuzzy type relationships, fuzzy logic, fuzzy math, spatial observations, object identification and macro logical reasoning."
"Unknown","01;12;27;16","01;12;55;29","This is a paper to look into that means parts and holes how they're related to each other and dual process theories of cognition. So that's bringing it to the cognitive neuro and to even the neuroscientific numerous examples are discussed in the paper and they are it's, it's a double paper, but it's very informative. And so all these kinds of things are kind of what is adjacencies for the Chou Space Deane and then anyone else."
"Unknown","01;12;55;29","01;13;26;29","Dave, if you have any thoughts after dying otherwise. No worries. I just could you go back to that cocooned thing up again, your diagram there. Yeah, that one there. The one, the bottom one. It's interesting because when I read looked at that in the paper, it took me back to some stuff I did about that diamond shape and how that symbolically relates to opening up, which you mentioned annual and and self-organization, which Stephen mentioned."
"Unknown","01;13;27;25","01;13;54;28","We see that when we see a diamond designating a high occupancy vehicle lane and the sort of way that that frees you up as long as you meet a minimum in terms of the number of people in your in your vehicle. And we used to talk about that idea of how these spaces are there, even though you may not be necessarily noticing that."
"Unknown","01;13;56;23","01;14;25;10","Yeah, that's that's even if we don't formally look at it that way. There's all sorts of examples around us of when that's actually occurring. So I just thought I'd point that out. It may not have and you may not necessarily do those kind of associations. But again, if you're trying to bring this kind of information to people and go, well, here's an example of where we're actually doing this stuff, we may not be aware of it, but it's, it's going on this that's as soon as I saw that."
"Unknown","01;14;25;10","01;14;32;17","That's what kind of made me smile Oh, thanks for that association there, Dave."
"Unknown","01;14;34;17","01;15;03;06","This is not addressing any specific point, but Gregory Bates and a number of times observed the cyber annotations getting stuck by talking about random inputs, random inputs. He says, Look, stop thinking about random. I want you to think about noise. We're now going to talk about organization from noise. And I think part of the point is noise is more clearly relative to your values and your plans."
"Unknown","01;15;05;04","01;15;38;00","Yes, very nice. And also affordances, which are semantic. Like even years ago when I was learning about Shannon Information Theory, I thought I can be symbolically surprised by the characters on a page. But if I don't speak the language, who's to say whether the information is really there? So there has to be something else here that's helping address the situations that are meaningful or not, because it's not just about how rare the character is in a world where just one word can mean a lot at the right time in the right context."
"Unknown","01;15;38;21","01;16;15;16","Stephen Yeah. The the idea that you your you need to constrain sentence volumes or separate, I mean, I suppose in a funny way, the car lane example is quite interesting is, you know, you've got the movement of traffic and at some point the high up vehicle lane becomes different in terms of what's on it. As long as you can enforce a rule and you know and communicate it but and enforce it and that kind of idea that you can create severability otherwise."
"Unknown","01;16;16;19","01;16;54;06","And maybe that that sort of principle of there's some constraints implicitly out there I suppose, on what things are going to do with each other. I suppose just like the way water behaves in certain contexts at certain scales within our gravitational field. But there's also and I'm not sure how if I'm over extrapolating, but how biologically, you know, you know, different ways we have to there has to be some point where you have to impose a separate velocity."
"Unknown","01;16;54;17","01;17;17;05","You know, you might need to form an organ from cells to be able to do the next thing, you know, to, to create insulin or something. It's not just enough to have some insulin cells dotted all around the body. You need to have a pancreas you know, so there needs to be that constraint, you know, so that you in the high occupancy lane and that's what's happening."
"Unknown","01;17;17;14","01;17;53;19","So it's in the high insulin producing cell type. And then at a bigger level, you're in the high insulin producing organ subcomponent in the organ. And so it's this nesting and there's maybe even extraction of function using what you were talking about earlier. So then Sarah wrote in the chart also about the definition of the two spaces here, saying that this is another way in which the air conditioning is going to come into play because Sarah Wright's Super Bowl is saying that the event space for a given time frame cannot be compressed."
"Unknown","01;17;54;01","01;18;33;18","I'm not sure if that implies the aggregate matrix itself cannot be compressed, reduced in some way. And then here this this by extensional collapse. So if you can't collapse throes and you can't collapse the columns and you can transform it, and that still is going to be like true. It just like it's informationally rich, then any repetitions in the rows of objects and columns of attributes are factored out and also the reason why attributes are at times an attribute, if you think about the object is existing through time, just like you could measure the color every inch of the ruler you could measure the length of the ruler at every measurement in ten time points."
"Unknown","01;18;34;06","01;18;55;10","In practice, this removes unnecessary repetitions in the content of information, hence minimizes the amount of processing required by an algorithm. So if you do a hundred measurements of exactly one meter because the time was unique, that's still 100 measurements. So the classical approach would be like, Well, sounds like we got an answer. I mean, look at the p value."
"Unknown","01;18;55;10","01;19;21;09","It's one meter, but then here when we retain this rich contextual ity, we actually don't cool. Even though we were sampling from a city of length we don't need to pool all of those measurements together in the same way perhaps. And so that is definitely related. Sara's point that this matrix, the rows or the columns can be thought of as being temporal."
"Unknown","01;19;22;05","01;19;54;16","So when we think about the matrix having structure on like a top to bottom or left to right way that can represent structure in time. Like just like you have a eigenvector, you can have an eigenvalue through time Stephen So if I'm understanding you, you could have a relatively safe, a small number of observation types, but build out a space because over time you can stop the time there."
"Unknown","01;19;54;16","01;20;19;28","Who gives you the ability to make that into some sort of space, some sort of typological space? It's not just a space of different measurements of different things. It's sort of certain things over time. Is that right? Yep. Here's an example that kind of came to mind. It relates to insect vision. So a lot of times people think about insect vision, like, Oh, they must see like a bunch of versions of the world."
"Unknown","01;20;20;07","01;20;39;16","But then we think, OK, well, we have two eyes and we see one version of the world. So it's probably a little more integrated than buggy. Putting that aside, what's the resolution of the bugs site? And it turns out that there are some insects that only have like one or materia cone. So it's like kind of like a one pixel camera."
"Unknown","01;20;39;16","01;21;13;20","It's like almost light dark. So you would think and if it were on the wall, all it could do is inference light dark in the room. But because the insect has a body is a body, it can move. So even if it's just light dark or gradients of it's getting like a bit string, we can think about continuous variables or just 01 and so can a bit string encode information that's rich like yes, like sportscasting of a sports ball game and say now they're running from the 30 and they're at the 20, there's a person and they're at the ten."
"Unknown","01;21;13;20","01;21;50;14","And so that's a bit strange, but it conveys action and context. So they don't need to take the four K video in order to know whether to run or walk. And that's actually really related to Carl, for instance, would like for example, which he claims is the origins of some of the free energy principle kind of any other slides we want to go to or we can just look at the last ones."
"Unknown","01;21;50;14","01;22;28;00","Otherwise I think it's been a great conversation. It was definitely a educational paper and several weeks like for the lab, we're always happy to have new participants such as yourself. Dean. So thanks a lot for joining. And yeah, this was an interesting set of discussions also. Thanks a lot Sarah for helping on and blue for dot zero for 17 because that that was kind of like how we started the conversation in a way, in a way that helped us structure it because there's a lot to get lost in here live."
"Unknown","01;22;28;03","01;22;51;10","What do you think then Dean so you're on the Marco Blanket side. Can you go back to it? Yep. Yeah. So I was really thinking about I was like, I have this note here. So I find it so in like, you know, when we have the smart blanket, it's like the things that we're not privy to, the information that we don't necessarily know about."
"Unknown","01;22;51;10","01;23;16;02","Right. And so we make a decision, we have all the information that we need to make a decision. But I was thinking like in a system where the Marco Blanket is like too big, like if there's too many things under the blanket, that we don't have access to, like, how does that impact our ability to act within the constraints of the system?"
"Unknown","01;23;16;11","01;23;33;11","So like here it's we're they talk about the frame problem, right? Like, so where you you kind of can't solve a problem until it's been solved already, until you know how to solve the problem. Like you can't determine the answer. And I think that that's like the, the gist of the frame problem. Feel free to elaborate or correct me on that."
"Unknown","01;23;33;22","01;24;04;22","But, you know, I think that that's like one of the things that is so difficult about a problem like climate change, right? So we can't solve the problem like climate change because we don't know how many factors are potentially influencing like we don't necessarily have the entire context for the climate change situation. So like I know what I'm doing, I know what my carbon output is and like I can research the companies that I buy products from, et cetera."
"Unknown","01;24;04;22","01;24;26;13","But like I don't know what all of the other 9 billion agents in the world are doing. And so like we can't make predictions based on our actions, right? So like is the markup blanket like too big in that situation to be able to solve the problem? Like because we were not able to see directly the outcome of our actions or like even the actions of our people that are in our network."
"Unknown","01;24;27;06","01;25;07;28","I was thinking about that. Very interesting. Dean and then Dave just a couple couple of things. First of all, thank you for being so welcoming. I really appreciate that. And the second thing is is that when I watched last week's broadcast, because I watched on YouTube, I felt like I was I was spectator. And now that I've been a participant, but I've been a participant of a debriefing exercise, so I've actually been a part just bit of something that's been separated out from what originally happened."
"Unknown","01;25;08;07","01;25;37;12","And I think that this paper is sense. This is real time what this paper was discussing. So if you want to I don't know if you could find a better example of where that idea of what perspective is and what potentially prismatic, sorry, even if we're not talking about them, we're still playing by their rules. Again, thank you for allowing me to be one of the the people in the title today."
"Unknown","01;25;37;12","01;25;58;01","I just really, really appreciate them. All. And it's like the paper is the tent pole in some ways because it's actually Northstar or the reference point. But we're giving our perspective on it. But we shouldn't be disagreeing about what the paper is or says. We're looking at the same slides, but then the richness is actually everyone's understanding and contribution."
"Unknown","01;25;58;01","01;26;47;23","Just wherever it is coming from, whenever it's coming from there. Because what else could that context provide? Dave Yeah, I don't want to go too far off track, but I notice the paper references Donald Hoffman, and I don't want to do an injustice to the good doctor. It may be that I see him stepping into a 20 didn't really with this one video about the interface is any where you want it to be it doesn't make any difference the interfaces to totally arbitrary maybe that's just his billions and billions moment but did Donald Hoffman go down the rabbit hole a couple of years ago or is he still doing good solid work that I can"
"Unknown","01;26;47;23","01;27;14;23","read and not get my inexpert self thrown down a rabbit hole. Can't speak to the body of work don't know that much but just I pulled up the citation from the Fields and Glazebrook paper. It's a 2015 paper of the interface theory of perception. And so the way that they that fields and Glazebrook use it in the paper is basically to actually in a way that's related to the interfaces."
"Unknown","01;27;15;27","01;27;42;22","It says equivalently an interface and that's the citation. So the mark blanket here is being connected to their approach. So it's kind of probably a yes and it probably is great insights about the interface. And then it probably does matter where it is or what it is or how it's modeled. So yeah, nice point though, Steven Yeah, good, good, good observation there."
"Unknown","01;27;42;22","01;28;22;10","I mean, there's probably a you know, there's a reason why Chris Fields got involved in active inference because let's be honest, this from my understanding and my observations over the last 30, 40 years, consciousness and physicist, there's this physicists kind of run the show around consciousness and there's been more and more sort of big claims about, you know, consciousness, which is great and this is seen as you know and there's a thing called Mendel the Mendel's to do the process orientation in psychology and good work."
"Unknown","01;28;22;23","01;28;43;14","But I always used to like have a bit of a sigh when Quantum got mentioned because I knew that it was going to be like in the new physics. I just felt and maybe I was wrong, but I just felt it was being used in a very transpersonal slightly hand-waving way. But maybe that and now we actually bring it into light."
"Unknown","01;28;43;28","01;29;04;16","It's not all about the physics, it's about the biology, which is kind of like taken. But this is, this is this area down a peg or two. Although now Christian could say it takes up a peg or two because it's all based on physics. It depends which way you want to look at it. But I'm interested in world and thanks."
"Unknown","01;29;04;22","01;29;35;01","Yep. In this quote, this is the authors they're saying that this Mark Blanket concept, which is Map, the interface and all these other ideas like communication channels, it's doing a double role in these models, which is that it's where free energy is minimized. So it's sort of what is going into the function that's getting minimized if you're you might be reducing your water usage, but what's going into your actual function that's deciding your policy, that's what's getting minimized."
"Unknown","01;29;35;01","01;30;11;01","And then something else might also be affected, but what's getting minimized are the blanket states, and it is that epistemic barrier that's keeping context. What isn't directly measured that information is hidden from the observer. So there's probably a bunch of questions about this and a lot to say about it. But one big question that I have is we know from previous papers that one of Christian's innovations was to separate severability, perhaps separate the blanket states into outgoing action states and incoming sense states."
"Unknown","01;30;11;17","01;30;41;25","Now, it's possible that there are certain kinds of models that play nice in the sort of undirected Bayesian conditional relationship neutral way, because it's sort of like a built in bi directional road. It's sort of like the cars going both ways in the same line. But when we really make that separation clear and we really have some states that have an asymmetrical relationship and other states that have an asymmetrical relationship, it could be simpler, it could be more difficult."
"Unknown","01;30;42;05","01;30;59;04","So there might be new relationships that are enabled by the separation there might be relationships that are put off for now because it complicates it in a different way. So I don't know what those would be, but those are just like what could happen when you split the States? Or maybe nothing happens and it's already been dealt with."
"Unknown","01;30;59;27","01;31;24;15","But yeah, then there is a perpetual slide on the reservoir computing we had a little oh, the next steps were just from their words. They had three areas and next steps kind of we'll go through this, then we'll kind of give any anywhere else give a last thought. But here's the areas where they're taking it next or where they want to signal for everyone to take it next."
"Unknown","01;31;24;23","01;31;50;25","So one is exploring intrinsic contextual in humans. It's like short and sweet, apply it to humans. So we're asking about applied active inference about what is the applications of this paper. They are asking that too. They don't need to go into any more detail. The second question is about how context switching is implemented neuro cognitively. So like you're talking to two people and you're bilingual and they say something in one language and the other person says something in a different language."
"Unknown","01;31;51;03","01;32;18;03","But semantically, you're might not even be aware of that difference. It might just be associated with that person's voice or with a situation. So how is that happening in the brain or in the body or different animals? And then the third question there, broader question so this is the real you know, that's the speculate. No, the third question is whether that intrinsic contextual ity can be detected and characterized as multiple scales in complex systems."
"Unknown","01;32;18;16","01;32;47;09","So this is where it's kind of getting to the collective intelligence or distributed computational systems. Like what if there were a signal that we thought were uninformative but were actually reflective of this just immense wisdom or processing power cognitive dimension. So we might think that we're communicating with all intelligent life when we send out the golden phonograph with the etching of the Fibonacci sequence or Tetrahedra or our body or something like that."
"Unknown","01;32;47;22","01;33;38;20","But there could be a whole dimension of information that's just at a resolution we're not even perceiving. So that would be big. Of course, how would we detect that a priori with minimal scale and system dependent assumptions, which are equivalent to throwing out the noise and the signal together? In this way of thinking well, it would be great to learn more about these topics I hope that we can continue to just have experts on have all learners and participants on because it's kind of fun, especially when we're talking about stuff like this."
"Unknown","01;33;39;09","01;34;03;11","So any last yet, Stephen you mean it's even just mentioned you've got the, you know, the next couple of events that are coming up just so that people know they're interested and that you're going to be talking with. We're going to be doing the other live stream. Oh, yes."
"Unknown","01;34;06;08","01;34;38;03","And to mainstream look at the calendar. Yep. So we will yep. We'll have 18 in the coming two weeks. On the predictive global neuronal workspace with Ryan Smith and Christopher White hopefully joining for March 23rd and 30th, but then also March 18th in two days we'll have Demetrius bullish. So yeah, that will be pretty cool thanks everyone for participating. Great discussion."
"Unknown","01;34;38;12","01;34;54;02","So fun times. So cool to cycling, to cycling, to cycling, to cycling, to cycling, cycling to cycling. Cycle to. Cycling to."
