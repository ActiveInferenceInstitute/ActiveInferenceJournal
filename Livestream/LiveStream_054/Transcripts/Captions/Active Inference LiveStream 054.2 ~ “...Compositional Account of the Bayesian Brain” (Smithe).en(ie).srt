00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,400
hello and welcome

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,599
it's June 15 2023 we're in active live

3
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,820
stream 54.2

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,279
so welcome to the active Institute

5
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,680
we're a participatory online Institute

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,720
that is communicating learning and

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,119
practicing applied active inference you

8
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:25,920
can find us at the links here

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,199
this is a recorded and an archived live

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,300
stream so please provide feedback so we

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,740
can improve our work

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,899
all backgrounds and perspectives are

13
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:36,000
welcome and will follow a video

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,579
etiquette for live streams

15
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,160
head over to

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,480
activeinference.org to learn more about

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,879
participating in live streams and other

18
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,500
projects

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,640
all right

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,360
we're in live stream 54.2 continuing

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,120
with our third discussion on the work

22
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,980
mathematical foundations for a

23
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,899
compositional account of the Bayesian

24
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,160
brain

25
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,899
we're back with Dean Ali and Toby so if

26
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,260
each want to say hello and

27
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,020
anything to begin with otherwise

28
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,920
Ali has some questions ready and we have

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,720
some questions that people have

30
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,619
submitted in the meantime as well so

31
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,540
shall we just proceed to the questions

32
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,820
as we have the same people as dot one

33
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,259
great

34
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,900
okay I'm gonna jump into some of the

35
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,720
pre-submitted questions so

36
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,380
would it be correct to call equation 4.2

37
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,240
compositional base theorem which is or

38
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,500
our basis theorem categorically

39
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,420
and we have the um

40
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,939
document ready or anything that you want

41
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,920
to share but what is what does it mean

42
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,920
for Bayes theorem to be categorified and

43
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,079
where is that in the dissertation

44
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,079
yeah okay so that's a nice question

45
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,259
um I would say that um

46
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,939
equation 4.2 is is like um

47
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,399
it's like it's a basic it's like a sort

48
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,720
of it's like it's like a basic

49
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,020
representation of the product law of

50
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,360
probability Theory

51
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,500
um and so I wouldn't say it's

52
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,720
particularly like inherently

53
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,459
compositional it's just something that

54
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:22,920
it's just like an axiom that is just

55
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,420
like a consequence of the sort of

56
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,280
standard axioms of probability Theory

57
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,200
the thing that makes it a little bit

58
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,599
different from um the way that it's

59
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,700
normally written

60
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,560
um in probability theory is that I've

61
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,739
kind of annotated those P symbols which

62
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,480
represent like the probability of a

63
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,620
certain event

64
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,260
um I've annotated them each with like

65
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,060
um a subscript and that subscript

66
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,060
represents like like where the

67
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,160
probability is coming from like the

68
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,680
probability according to whom well that

69
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,440
that's kind of how you can think of it

70
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,780
and so normally I find like this this

71
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,000
kind of like P notation to be a little

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,260
bit confusing

73
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,900
because people often write you know he

74
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,860
of B given a and they also write like P

75
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:13,200
of like x given y or like P or W comma a

76
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,440
comma Z and so like in each of those

77
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,680
cases like the the sort of content of

78
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,720
the p is kind of different like the A

79
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,260
and the B might be like events of it of

80
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,840
a different kind to X and Y and yeah

81
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,620
they're all like put into this P symbol

82
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,840
whereas in this case I've I've with the

83
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,480
annotations it says like as I say it

84
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,480
says according to according to what and

85
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,239
so here like the little subscript C

86
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,360
represents

87
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,700
what's typically called in um

88
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,739
in like compositional probability Theory

89
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:54,420
like um a Channel or like a a kernel but

90
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,879
that is like a kind of abstract way of

91
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,500
just saying conditional probability

92
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,620
distribution and so the little c means

93
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,760
it's a conditional probability

94
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,620
distribution from from like x a space X

95
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,099
to y a space Y and here I'm thinking of

96
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:15,959
like the B as being an event of type Y

97
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,839
and a is being an event of type A of

98
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,800
sorry of Type X and so the PC says it's

99
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,440
the probability of the event

100
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,620
um B of type y given the event at a of

101
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,880
Type X

102
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,740
and so that means that when you like

103
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,380
plug these like these kind of flows of

104
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,419
information together you make sure like

105
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:41,460
the types match it's kind of like

106
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,020
working with a strongly typed

107
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,940
programming language

108
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,860
so like that type of information is like

109
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,600
the main thing that's different between

110
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,880
this and the standard like

111
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,740
um product rule of probability and it's

112
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,240
from that product rule of probability

113
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,740
theory that you can just write down

114
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,460
Bayes theorem which is the equation 4.3

115
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,199
I would say

116
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,759
the

117
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,600
the the reason why I slightly hesitated

118
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,840
a cool equation 4.3 like a sort of

119
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,020
abstract or categorical version of Bayes

120
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,380
theorem even though it's annotated by

121
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,139
these channels

122
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:20,340
um it's because you have this like

123
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,039
Division and like that division isn't

124
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,479
something that's

125
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,479
like well defined in all categories in

126
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:29,580
all Con in all like situations that you

127
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,220
might want to consider like probability

128
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,340
theory for instance like you might have

129
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,900
this

130
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,100
um EFC dot Pi thing and that means the

131
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,220
kind of like y marginal of the joint

132
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,320
distribution or it's otherwise known as

133
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,280
the the push forward of this of the of

134
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,340
the of the distribution Pi through the

135
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,220
channel C like that that thing might

136
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,039
have what's known as measure zero which

137
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,720
means the probability might be zero and

138
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,340
so the division isn't very well defined

139
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,199
and so like that expression doesn't

140
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,539
always make sense

141
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:09,840
now the thing that does always make

142
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,360
sense on the other hand is that just

143
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,300
product law equation which which tells

144
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,060
you how the two ways you can write down

145
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,880
this joint distribution so if you have a

146
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,560
joint distribution

147
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,919
like on the Space X times y I've written

148
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,139
it there

149
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:31,560
then you can decompose it into like a

150
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,180
prior on X and a channel from X to Y so

151
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,180
that then if you like put you know the

152
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,419
information from the prior through the

153
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:45,180
channel you get the marginal on Y and

154
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,460
that's that push forward thing

155
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,259
or you could write the joint

156
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:52,080
distribution as

157
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,400
um a prior on why and a conditional

158
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,340
distribution from y to X and the thing

159
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,900
is obviously we're talking about the

160
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,819
same joint distribution in both places

161
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,400
so those two decompositions

162
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,020
they're sometimes called disintegrations

163
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,600
those two disintegrations need to be

164
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,680
equal

165
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,400
and that's what that equation is saying

166
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,020
um so that's kind of because it doesn't

167
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,319
have this um division in it and because

168
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,139
base law follows from it and because

169
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:24,120
it's something you can write down in all

170
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,120
settings it's kind of more fundamental

171
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,340
um but I quite like the kind of string

172
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,400
diagrammatic form of it

173
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,099
um which is something that is wrong it's

174
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:37,380
not it's not my invention it's I think I

175
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,539
originally saw it in a paper by Bart

176
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:43,020
Jacobs and um I think his student at the

177
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,280
time can to Cho so in um

178
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,500
let's see uh equation 4.5 so that's

179
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,319
section

180
00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:00,419
4.1.2 on abstract Bayesian inversion so

181
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:03,960
yeah if you scroll down a little it's on

182
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,380
like page 130

183
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,020
or uh 130 in my version which might be

184
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,880
hopefully around the same place in your

185
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,099
version

186
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:16,160
um

187
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,300
yeah a little further

188
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:24,180
oh man no maybe not let me let me let me

189
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,099
get up the version on because I've

190
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:28,319
realized I've opened the wrong version

191
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,759
um

192
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,500
and meanwhile see it

193
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,389
[Music]

194
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,659
so the the the thing I'm going for here

195
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,820
is the sort of as I say the string

196
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,839
diagrammatic depiction or uh yeah 4.1.2

197
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:53,480
it's page 120 sorry about that oh good

198
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,080
um

199
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,720
yeah so it it kind of shows you like how

200
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,959
the information flows

201
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,420
um and so this this like makes the two

202
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,420
the two like processes

203
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,940
like quite explicit like so here on the

204
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,459
left the prior of the joint distribution

205
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:12,959
is pi

206
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,660
and then you take the the sort of

207
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,180
probability the information from PI and

208
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,040
you copy it and you keep one of the

209
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,480
copies and that gives you your X

210
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,000
marginal and then you feed the other one

211
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,279
through the likelihood or the

212
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,860
conditional Channel C and that gives you

213
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,560
the other marginal and so like if you if

214
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,040
you throw away this x information you

215
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,660
get the Y marginal and that's what

216
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,459
marginalization is

217
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,860
and that's why the Y marginal if you

218
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,019
look on the right hand side the prior is

219
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:46,920
C after Pi you know that's that's the Y

220
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,320
marginal so like that's that's this is

221
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,380
this is like depicting that product law

222
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,959
and then you say you know

223
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,320
you can call something a Bayesian

224
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,040
inversion of C with respect to the prior

225
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,760
Pi if it is something that can go in the

226
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,660
Box

227
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,160
on the right hand side where I've

228
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,740
written C dagger pi and the reason I've

229
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,440
used this dagger symbol is because under

230
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,560
you know certain you know technical

231
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,140
conditions this this Bayesian inversion

232
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,240
thing gives you what's known in

233
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,600
um category Theory as a dagger functor

234
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,339
um and like that's something that like

235
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:29,640
swaps the direction of amorphism

236
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,560
and so here you've taken the thing that

237
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,480
goes from X to Y and you've stopped it

238
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,060
and it goes from y to X but it depends

239
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,620
on the prior and so everything that's a

240
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,779
little subscript and so for me this

241
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:42,360
picture is is a kind of

242
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,640
I mean it's kind of equivalent to that

243
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,459
product law equation 4.2

244
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:50,399
um but I I think it's it's kind of

245
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,079
although it's a kind of new kind of

246
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,300
language I think it's a kind of a more

247
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,860
intuitive one because you can sort of

248
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,019
see how the information flows through

249
00:10:58,019 --> 00:10:59,279
the system

250
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,560
um so that was a bit of a long answer

251
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,600
um but I think that's like I think

252
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,019
that's how I think of it great

253
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:09,600
okay

254
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,899
next question could be a short one I'm

255
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:14,880
mostly wondering about how chapter six

256
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,519
will be Rewritten yeah will it be major

257
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,620
and when we promised we didn't write

258
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,079
this question primarily to select the

259
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,899
best policy as to where to direct my

260
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:27,480
regime of attention like should I wait

261
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,940
to dig deeper into chapter six until the

262
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,640
updated observations arrive is

263
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,760
reflecting deeply uh up until chapter

264
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,560
five where I should focus for now or is

265
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,880
chapter six something that won't change

266
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,279
too much and I can still explore that

267
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,480
next week

268
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,380
so this is a great question and I would

269
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,519
and I'm sorry that it isn't like the the

270
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,440
Rewritten version isn't online yet but

271
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,899
it's really close I promise

272
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:56,940
um and I am kind of aiming for it to be

273
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,579
done like next week or maybe let's let's

274
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:01,620
not hold myself Hostage to Fortune so

275
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,380
let's call it the next couple of weeks

276
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,980
but it is a quite uh it's quite a change

277
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,620
in the sense that I've kind of both

278
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,240
it's kind of annoying because it's

279
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,019
simpler but also kind of more structured

280
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:17,940
and so that means that there's kind of

281
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,480
there were a lot of like Affinity

282
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,680
details that I didn't anticipate

283
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,200
uh needing to deal with that I had to

284
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,560
deal with even though fundamentally

285
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,339
the basic idea is kind of the same

286
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:38,399
but also Nita and simpler at the same

287
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,480
time

288
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,200
um and and if you I mean I I can go into

289
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,680
some details about the differences if

290
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,079
you'd like or I can just leave it at

291
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:51,600
that um like why would you rather let's

292
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,820
return to this in the dot three

293
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,980
okay yeah let's do that that's that's a

294
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,079
nice idea um so yeah I would say don't

295
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,540
you know dig too deeply into it because

296
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,420
basically the thing that I've managed to

297
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,339
do away with and sorry for all the

298
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:06,720
people who've kind of tried to bang

299
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,440
their heads on it already is the kind of

300
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,540
pro-functor like Optics kind of like the

301
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,100
sort of pro functor stuff with those

302
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,980
weird like co-end things

303
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,899
um the kind of

304
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,420
like integral symbols that I was using

305
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,980
to Define contexts for statistical games

306
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,079
um that whole thing

307
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,000
you it turns out you don't actually need

308
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,420
the complexity of that structure and

309
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,459
um the notion of context

310
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:37,560
is really given

311
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,779
um just by two things it's really just

312
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,399
the prior which we've already talked

313
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,360
about

314
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,579
and also like the observation you take

315
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:46,380
from the environment

316
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,980
and so before I thought you needed to

317
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,139
consider like not just the observation

318
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:55,980
but also like the stuff that might go on

319
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,740
in the environment around the

320
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,839
observation that like gives you

321
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,399
correlations

322
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,899
but it turns out actually you don't need

323
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:05,279
that at least not for the free energy

324
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,740
principle

325
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,300
um and so that that makes things a bit

326
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,740
simpler because you don't need that kind

327
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,880
of weird structure

328
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,320
[Music]

329
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:13,920
um

330
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,839
but there's like as I say like some

331
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,700
technical stuff which is very annoying

332
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,779
which made it also a little bit

333
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:24,540
like slightly annoying to write down

334
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,899
um and involve by categories and like

335
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:31,320
sorry about that but it's actually the

336
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,100
fundamental idea of a statistical game

337
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,260
being like a Bayesian lens which

338
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,519
describes

339
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:42,420
like the the inference process

340
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,579
um maybe like a parameterized Bayesian

341
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:47,220
lens that allows you to learn but a

342
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,740
Bayesian lens that like comes with a

343
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,720
loss function

344
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,000
that's still the same idea

345
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,180
um and it turns out that lost functions

346
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:01,320
like the relative entropy and the free

347
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,360
energy they actually have a really neat

348
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,160
categorical structure so the things I

349
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,320
was calling like free energy games

350
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,160
before or like um relative like basic

351
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,620
inference games those are actually now a

352
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,600
lot even neater still so that's that's

353
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,860
really nice

354
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,420
um

355
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,579
and and the way you get predictive

356
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:23,699
coding is still as like a functor from

357
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:26,639
some from these like statistical games

358
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,519
two dynamical systems so like that idea

359
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,079
is still the same

360
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:33,180
um it's just actually it turned out that

361
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,300
the statistical games themselves there

362
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,760
was actually a lot more nice stuff going

363
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,120
on there than I had realized before

364
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,660
awesome

365
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,480
all right

366
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:54,480
work on memory evolutive systems to what

367
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,160
extent have you used their work in the

368
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,959
thesis would it be correct to say that

369
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,699
there might exist a functor from that

370
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:03,120
book to your dissertation or indeed

371
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,579
to any of your citations is there work

372
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:07,980
someone could do to explore the

373
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,660
connection between the two

374
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:13,199
to me this is a question of one instance

375
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,360
if a learner or researcher performs

376
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,279
active inference on the interface

377
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,380
between a work and a citation more

378
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,899
generally great question yeah I think

379
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:23,579
it's a really nice question and actually

380
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:26,699
I so I I read

381
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:29,399
um the this work On by Aerosmith

382
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,100
November mesh on

383
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,820
um memory evaluative systems like a few

384
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,759
years ago and I found it very like

385
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,160
abstract and confusing and I was like

386
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,019
yeah this is this is all really nice but

387
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:45,540
like how does it actually connect to the

388
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,860
brain and how things like brains work

389
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,000
um

390
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,180
but I've I've kind of softened my stance

391
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,860
on it recently and I think actually

392
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,279
there's some really cool stuff

393
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:01,500
in that work

394
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,300
um some really great ideas about like

395
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,640
hierarchical complex systems and

396
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,579
emergence and like

397
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:11,579
um even things like neural coding

398
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,859
and and it's kind of I think like

399
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:16,319
slightly in danger I think of being

400
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,079
forgotten because people see it and

401
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,000
think okay well like how does it

402
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,919
actually make contact with things I know

403
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:25,079
about now

404
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,699
um things that like actually scientists

405
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:28,620
use

406
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,440
and so I think it would be great to

407
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,039
explore the connections like in a kind

408
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,860
of more detailed way I don't know

409
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,580
precisely what that would look like

410
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:46,500
um I I heard a talk actually by Andre uh

411
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,460
um

412
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,000
I think it it I don't know I don't there

413
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,100
may be some on YouTube I I don't I don't

414
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,820
know um this was in uh Consciousness

415
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,100
maths of Consciousness

416
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,000
um like workshop at the end of April

417
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,020
and she explains some of the more recent

418
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,760
stuff they've been doing and it seemed

419
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,740
sounded like actually they

420
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,799
um there is a proof I think that heavy

421
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:17,700
and learning does actually give you

422
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,480
um

423
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,260
sort of what she calls cat neurons

424
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:22,919
um

425
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:25,140
and so before I've been like okay well

426
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,240
it's a nice story but is it does it

427
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,260
actually

428
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,240
does it actually relate to things like

429
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,620
heavy learning or is it just like an

430
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,020
analogy

431
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,640
um but it sounds like it's actually a

432
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,799
bit more precise than I had thought and

433
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,000
obviously because of the connection

434
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,360
between things like heavy and learning

435
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,480
and predictive coding it sounds like you

436
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,640
know this there should be a way to

437
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,039
relate something like predictive coding

438
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:52,740
to memory evaluative systems and that

439
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,020
would be really nice because I I you

440
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,419
know sometimes think about this kind of

441
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:59,160
direction that I'm trying to go with so

442
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,320
but try to think about

443
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,720
um like Nest image active influence

444
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,419
systems like you know you might have a

445
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:08,220
little region of the brain and all the

446
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,100
cells are doing like active inference

447
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,980
and the circuits do predictive coding

448
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,380
and they make up a brain and brains make

449
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,320
up a you know Society or an organization

450
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,700
and that story of like hierarchical

451
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:28,020
complex systems is really the story that

452
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,020
um this work is trying to tell as well

453
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,179
just in a different kind of way and so I

454
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:34,980
think there's some really it's a really

455
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,080
fruitful area

456
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,820
um and I really hope yeah somebody does

457
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,200
dig into it

458
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,880
um because it will be because I think

459
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,380
it's I think it's great work and I think

460
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,059
it's just work that was kind of maybe

461
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,280
ahead of its time so it kind of got left

462
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,860
you know in by the wayside maybe a

463
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,360
little bit but I'm really glad to see

464
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,980
somebody

465
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,140
um ask about it now

466
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,020
cool just one short remark on this and

467
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,700
then all your Dean please it's almost

468
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,960
like when people draw associations like

469
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,720
a line of sight oh well emergence is

470
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,700
like this it's like they're surveying

471
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,160
and can have quite

472
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,700
far Vision but category theory is like

473
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,160
building the high-speed rail where it's

474
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,660
like locked in

475
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,000
and then we can say there really is a

476
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,400
relationship of this exact formal type

477
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,320
between heavy and learning and

478
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,600
predictive coding let's just say some

479
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,100
type so then that can be really relied

480
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,580
on as a as a foundational building block

481
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,840
and it kind of

482
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,640
um

483
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,460
brings those literatures and merges

484
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,039
those streams or at least adjoints the

485
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:46,200
streams or naturally transforms the

486
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,520
streams or whatever the appropriate

487
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,100
terminology would be but in a really

488
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,559
solid way that's not just like well one

489
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,780
person on a Mountaintop saw that these

490
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,640
two things could be connected it's more

491
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,380
like an engineering project that really

492
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,059
locks it in for everybody

493
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:03,419
yeah I think so and I I hope you know

494
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:05,880
some people are incentivized to do that

495
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,620
engineering I I think that would be

496
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,820
great

497
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,520
all right last to the pre-submitted uh

498
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,740
questions

499
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:18,059
so in the Park Zulo and friston 2022

500
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:20,520
active inference textbook

501
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,980
the first question in the recipe for

502
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,960
designing an active inference model this

503
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,440
is chapter six is which system

504
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,780
this entails three pieces of data one

505
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,240
the agent's generative model two the

506
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,340
interface sensory data and actions and

507
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,200
three the external environment the

508
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,940
generative process

509
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,600
so how do these relevant big chunks of

510
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,159
Notions

511
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,860
from the recipe for making an active

512
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,799
inference model in the

513
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:52,799
paradol textbook map to the sections of

514
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,960
what you've done in your dissertation

515
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,120
that's a nice question and it like takes

516
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,020
me on to like a question of like

517
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,720
action and active inference beyond the

518
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,700
approximate inference that I was talking

519
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,720
about in my thesis predominantly maybe

520
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,940
here I could like draw some stuff and so

521
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,440
I don't know how easy that is for you

522
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,100
you can share my screen yep um let's see

523
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,678
how this will work that of that

524
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,919
yeah okay sure

525
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,159
all right can you see my like cursor

526
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:30,780
thingy yeah

527
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:34,140
Okay cool so um

528
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,260
so I like to draw this picture and this

529
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,600
is like the little Channel C which does

530
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,159
prediction

531
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:44,280
and then and it goes like from here and

532
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,620
it goes like outwards

533
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,940
and this

534
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,880
is the inversion the like approximate

535
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,220
inversion and it takes in like a prior

536
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,100
which is comes from like here

537
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,340
and it takes in like an observation so

538
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,460
we could think of this as like

539
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,720
um

540
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,580
this is like high level

541
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,140
belief

542
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,820
and like lower level

543
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,480
and this is like

544
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,419
somehow you get something which gives

545
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:24,380
you an observation

546
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,520
and then this gives you like

547
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:33,020
new belief high level

548
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,500
foreign

549
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,740
lens so that's like what the base and

550
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,080
lenses are all about

551
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,480
um and like the thing that I was talking

552
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,580
about in my thesis is

553
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,320
um doing

554
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,059
you know turning this into like a

555
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:54,419
predictive coding dynamical system

556
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:55,919
um because you've got like neurons which

557
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,720
do this sort of prediction part and then

558
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,780
neurons let's do this like like

559
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,760
um passing back of error signals to do

560
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,380
this updating part and they have this

561
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,880
kind of like bi-directional form and

562
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,620
that's that's really neat and so like

563
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,659
you can like put in another one here

564
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:12,179
another one here or you can just start

565
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:14,220
with your prior which is like something

566
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,220
that I often writer's pie up here and

567
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,500
then this gives you like a new pie at

568
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,240
this point

569
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,460
and so you know this is going always

570
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,260
from like higher level beliefs to lower

571
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,820
level beliefs and down here you might

572
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,919
eventually get to like the lowest level

573
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:33,360
which is like you know if you're

574
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,320
thinking about visual systems then

575
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,559
this to be like you know the V1 visual

576
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,600
cortex stuff or like the stuff you get

577
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,159
in like the retina

578
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,580
and you get like prediction about

579
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:51,419
let's say visual signals

580
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:54,600
but then the world you know so you get

581
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,520
this predicted but then the world comes

582
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,039
back and it actually gives you

583
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,740
like actual

584
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,880
this is predicted

585
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:09,840
Because the actual signals and then the

586
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,820
brain uses that to update its beliefs up

587
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:15,360
here and so really like the interface

588
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,860
is

589
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:20,100
somehow like this

590
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,240
okay

591
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,880
and so this is this is like lens lens

592
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,240
world

593
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,979
and this is like external world

594
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,059
so that's where the like external

595
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:36,120
environment comes into the picture and

596
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,860
you could think of everything in here as

597
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,700
like

598
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,159
agent

599
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:43,260
but this doesn't really tell us much

600
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,580
about

601
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,440
um action and it doesn't tell us much

602
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,720
about like interaction

603
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,659
and so there's another kind of story for

604
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:53,760
that which is kind of similar in many

605
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,380
respects which is

606
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,500
the story that is told at least in

607
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,900
category Theory by what's known as um

608
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,480
categorical systems theory

609
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,539
and there you get pictures like this so

610
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:09,120
this is like your like world and there

611
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,919
you've got like a

612
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:14,340
some like system inside the world and

613
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,480
here you've got

614
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,900
another system inside the world

615
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,760
and so people will then draw like things

616
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,039
that are called wiring diagrams to kind

617
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,039
of represent how these things interact

618
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:31,260
so but let's call this a for a maybe

619
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,299
there's another system over here

620
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:36,059
and this is B and maybe that's C for a

621
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:38,880
its environment is like everything

622
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,740
but isn't a it's you know B and C

623
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,179
um

624
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:47,400
and so maybe like it's connected like

625
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,460
this I don't know

626
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,179
some like weird like wiring thing

627
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,159
um actually maybe that maybe that should

628
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,100
go like round to here and then this goes

629
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,900
like to that I don't know something like

630
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,159
this

631
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,900
so this is this is just what's known as

632
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,940
a wiring diagram it just tells you how

633
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,820
the systems are like tupled together

634
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,620
um and that would be like specifying

635
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,020
like how the information flows across

636
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,900
the mark of blankets of your systems and

637
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,260
so like this would be like the this box

638
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,539
is like the markup blanket of a and then

639
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,299
this like wiring is like the data of the

640
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:27,679
coupling of the blankets

641
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,360
um and so there's a whole Theory a whole

642
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,460
sort of story in category theory about

643
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,220
how to sort of compose if you've got

644
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,179
like

645
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:38,220
you know if you you know it has a

646
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,080
composed dynamical systems of this kind

647
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,720
and so you know what what we do is we

648
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,559
like say okay well we we write down like

649
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,860
the type of if we say if we cool

650
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,260
if we write I a to represent like the

651
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,900
interface like the the data of like this

652
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,700
is like X and this is like y or

653
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,100
something like that the types on on the

654
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,100
the kind of shape of the markup blank is

655
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,039
then what systems theory tells us is

656
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,039
that for each like interface we get a

657
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:09,480
whole category

658
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,580
of systems that you could put in that

659
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,919
box to like animate it to make it like a

660
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,320
living system

661
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,000
and then

662
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,460
you know this is like a closed box at

663
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,320
the moment and so maybe it just

664
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,940
represents like the whole universe which

665
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,919
doesn't have any like external

666
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,240
environment

667
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,279
but you might also have like you know

668
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,640
something like a company

669
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,419
um

670
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:35,700
so you call it like company X

671
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,919
and that has like you know some agent

672
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,320
which decides what the company does or

673
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,539
some agent here which like get takes in

674
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:44,940
information from the environment

675
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,400
and so this this this wiring is then

676
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,500
something that gives you

677
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:55,679
um amorphism from Like A and B and C to

678
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,240
X

679
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,460
and what this like

680
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:03,179
dynamical like systems theory tells you

681
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:05,400
is that there's a let's call that W for

682
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,919
wiring is that there's then you get this

683
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,419
functor

684
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:16,140
from din a and in B and in

685
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,000
C

686
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,899
to in X which tells you then how to wire

687
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:24,840
all these dynamical systems together to

688
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,760
give you one that fits into this outer

689
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,020
box

690
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,940
and so this is like tells you how to do

691
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,500
all this for

692
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,360
um just dynamical systems but of course

693
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,179
we're kind of interested in like active

694
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:38,220
inference systems and so here you don't

695
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,960
just have

696
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,440
like some like you know DX by DT thing

697
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,200
to go in here

698
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,840
you've got you know the data role of

699
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,380
prediction and you know plans and goals

700
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,600
and maybe the maybe then something about

701
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,419
how to like you know actually do the

702
00:29:57,419 --> 00:29:58,980
inference like the statistical game

703
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,659
stuff

704
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:03,000
but really the story is the same and so

705
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
if you have you know this these boxes

706
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,620
again

707
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,380
what we can do is if we have a box like

708
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,080
this x to y

709
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,500
is we can think of the like the

710
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:21,179
an agent as having as a part of it a way

711
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:23,460
of predicting say x we think of let's

712
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,020
let's go to be something else

713
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,539
I'm sorry let's call the let's call

714
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:28,740
these

715
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,500
s so this is like the fence data that

716
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,299
goes into the system and then let's call

717
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:35,100
this a and then this is maybe like the

718
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,440
actions that it takes let's let's now

719
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,620
call this box I don't know B

720
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:44,899
um oh no I don't like B let's call it y

721
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,260
um

722
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,840
so now let's think okay well part of

723
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,299
what an active inference agent is doing

724
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:54,299
is that they you know they're predicting

725
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:57,120
they've got some some like high-level

726
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,640
beliefs of type y

727
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,740
and then they make a prediction about

728
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,679
not just the sort of sentence data but

729
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:07,380
also about their actions and then you

730
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,840
know the their body like samples from

731
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,840
this belief about how they should act or

732
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,640
you've got these little cells these

733
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,620
little like mechanisms which try to

734
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,720
correct the prediction errors to like

735
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,840
make that those actions into reality and

736
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,340
then maybe that gets like coupled to

737
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,500
some other system which receives those

738
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,600
actions as inputs

739
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,000
and you know you might have another part

740
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,220
here which you know goes in the other

741
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,419
direction

742
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:36,779
which says okay given my actual sense

743
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:38,760
data

744
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,299
and you know my actual actions maybe my

745
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:43,919
body is still learning how to like play

746
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,620
tennis or something like what what are

747
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,899
my new high-level beliefs

748
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:50,820
and so you can do this whole like story

749
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,480
again of Bayesian lenses

750
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,539
um

751
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,039
and this goes like there and that's you

752
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,620
know and this is now just why why and

753
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,720
then this is like s times a and this is

754
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,299
s times a so you can tell the story and

755
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,860
you can build like hierarchical systems

756
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,679
but now you have like a way of filling

757
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:11,880
in

758
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,080
each box

759
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,000
and

760
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,919
in principle a way of coupling them

761
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,419
together to give like

762
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:23,760
you know composite active inference

763
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,159
systems like companies or like you know

764
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:27,980
colonies or cells or things like that

765
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,600
this isn't a story yet that I've written

766
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,399
down

767
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,039
um but I know it works and I'm in the

768
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,159
process of there slowly write it down

769
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,640
um so the kind of fundamental structures

770
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,440
that are in the thesis are like part of

771
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,460
the story

772
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,260
the thing that's the the main thing

773
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,820
that's missing is kind of like

774
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,640
reorienting

775
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,820
is this like reorienting this picture

776
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,980
so that it's not like

777
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:59,880
going from you know here from left to

778
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,580
right it's like sort of poking

779
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,200
down

780
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,140
into like the Box

781
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,840
you see what I mean and this is like

782
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,480
this is like the stuff you put in

783
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,419
so this is like your

784
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:18,360
your lens thing here and you sort of

785
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,720
fill in the box with your lens

786
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,620
um so I think I think that tells

787
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,080
I mean that tells you how like the the

788
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,720
tongues of the thesis gonna fit into the

789
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,179
Standard Act of inference story

790
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:34,860
um the main job at least as far as I'm

791
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,659
concerned now is to like

792
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:39,120
fill out the details

793
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,679
um and then start to talk about things

794
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:44,100
like what happens if like you know we've

795
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,380
got why and you've got Z here like what

796
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,539
if you know they're trying to form part

797
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:50,220
of an organization but like they

798
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,620
disagree about what to do like how how

799
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,179
does an organization resolve

800
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:56,880
disagreements like what if you've got

801
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,120
like two signals from your brain to your

802
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,559
muscles that tell you to do different

803
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:03,240
things like how do you resolve that kind

804
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,640
of that kind of like

805
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,799
you know how do you get like harmonious

806
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:10,500
active inference systems in some sense

807
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,359
um so I will I'll stop sharing my screen

808
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:13,739
now and then we can sort of return to

809
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:14,940
the

810
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,879
um the discussion but that that's like

811
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:20,879
again my kind of long-winded answer

812
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,159
awesome

813
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:25,918
um I can share the pictures I see um

814
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,719
thing you said you'd shared something

815
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:32,060
but I can share some more things

816
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:35,940
and then go for it and then Ali

817
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:39,540
no I I just shared something from

818
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:42,719
about nine years ago that I was doing in

819
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,099
my programming that everything you just

820
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:45,239
wrote out

821
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:48,060
was I just wanted to share one part of

822
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,699
it that confirms that

823
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:52,980
you could you could come from completely

824
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,940
different places and arrive at the same

825
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,560
destination the whole bi-directionality

826
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,920
the whole Paradox um predictive

827
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,980
parabolic yeah this you can bring this

828
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:08,400
into classrooms and have it make sense

829
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,800
it doesn't doesn't have to be esoteric

830
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,619
or too

831
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:17,280
too remote I guess yeah I mean that's

832
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,020
great to hear I'm really glad to hear

833
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:19,740
that

834
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:23,700
yeah it's really awesome thanks I mean

835
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,740
yeah as I say there's lots lots left to

836
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,980
do uh but I think an important part of

837
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,020
that is like

838
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,300
spreading the word so it's really great

839
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,420
but yeah that process is beginning

840
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,099
um thanks to you guys

841
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:39,480
um so yeah

842
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,520
that's that's good the rehearse play

843
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,160
reflex cycle actually begins when you

844
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,980
reverse the direction of thought

845
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:51,540
reading from Dean's email interesting

846
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:53,940
self-organized yeah

847
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,280
it's all about this whole cat but this

848
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,200
is the thing

849
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,200
sometimes the the like I love the

850
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,579
questions that we've had so far and I

851
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:04,800
want to hear Ali's questions

852
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,320
and then I want to be able to take it

853
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,320
and have people not be intimidated by it

854
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,500
because you can really find yourself

855
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:16,560
doing these things on a daily basis you

856
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,740
just don't necessarily identify them

857
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,440
the way that we are but that doesn't

858
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,180
mean that we

859
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,900
have somehow lost access to the things

860
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,579
that we're discussing today so that's

861
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:32,960
I'll just leave it at that for now

862
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,579
cool all right

863
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:40,020
um

864
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,720
in the rest of the time that we have

865
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,900
with you for the dot two Toby

866
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,560
um Ali

867
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:57,200
uh okay thank you

868
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,759
you can just turn it off

869
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,060
yeah go for it thank you

870
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,720
all right

871
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:17,880
in base basically Street

872
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,619
to redeem

873
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:22,220
ridiculous

874
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,520
sorry uh the notion of Mark okay I

875
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,599
notice in your thesis

876
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:32,940
sorry Ali there's just a lot of a lot of

877
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:36,440
lines yeah yeah

878
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,760
what would you say is the chapter six

879
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,380
equivalent

880
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:02,640
is there yet a recipe for Designing the

881
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,779
kind of categorical

882
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,760
um kind of compositional organization

883
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,400
that you alluded to

884
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,119
uh

885
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,700
I can answer that quickly yeah go for a

886
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,960
quick answer and then I think now it's

887
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,640
better Ali yeah

888
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,300
um so the quick answer well it's a quick

889
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,660
answer but it's not a quick thing to do

890
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,220
um but there's a great

891
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:33,720
book on categorical systems theory in

892
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,240
its kind of great generality

893
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,619
which doesn't

894
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:40,560
explicitly talk about active inference

895
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,200
like I've been but it does talk about

896
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,060
this kind of

897
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,460
imposing dynamical systems in this

898
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,980
hierarchical way idea

899
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,960
um and that's the book that's currently

900
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:56,160
being drafted by David Jazz Myers

901
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,460
um I can circulate a link to it

902
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,480
um

903
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,240
m-y-e-r-s

904
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,920
um

905
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,020
and um

906
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,240
yeah so that that's that sort of spells

907
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,420
out the kind of General structure

908
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,140
um

909
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,480
and I believe

910
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:20,400
um he and Matteo capucci have got a

911
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,720
paper upcoming

912
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:28,200
at um the upcoming act conference on

913
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,700
applied category Theory this year

914
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,440
talking about

915
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,780
um using that framework to do kind of

916
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:37,020
cybernetic like things

917
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,700
um and so what I've been thinking about

918
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,760
lately is trying to fit

919
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,800
um active inference and the stuff I've

920
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,800
been doing into that framework which has

921
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,680
been sort of developing in parallel

922
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,440
um and kind of fortunately and maybe

923
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,260
slightly unsurprisingly they fit very

924
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,760
nicely together

925
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,579
um and so the pictures I was sketching

926
00:39:58,579 --> 00:40:01,800
are kind of a fragment of that other

927
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,079
framework and as I say I think they go

928
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,180
quite well together

929
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:11,160
awesome okay Ollie go for it

930
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,700
okay sorry about that uh all right so I

931
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,339
notice in your thesis that you don't

932
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:19,380
rely too much on the notion of markup

933
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:22,260
blankets uh but instead

934
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:25,920
um you use this notion of polynomial

935
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,460
functors as it's uh more formal or

936
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,640
perhaps more rigorous replacement

937
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:36,020
uh with regard to that in your paper

938
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:39,359
polynomial life uh you say in the

939
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,640
literature and active inference

940
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,320
um sorry

941
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,440
uh and the free energy principle there's

942
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,180
much debate about the concept and role

943
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,220
of Market blankets which are sometimes

944
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,079
conceived to represent the boundary of

945
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,420
an Adaptive system we believe that the

946
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,339
algebra polynomials will help to make

947
00:40:56,339 --> 00:40:58,859
such thinking precise where it departs

948
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:00,540
from the established usage of markup

949
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,760
blankets and Bayesian networks so would

950
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,099
you care to elaborate a bit on that and

951
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:09,480
how do you see uh polynomial functors as

952
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,060
overcoming some of the limitations of

953
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:15,480
the notional markup blanket yeah okay

954
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,359
um so I will preface this by saying I

955
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:21,660
think some people might disagree with me

956
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:25,740
but as like I

957
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:29,460
there is a notion of Mark of blankets

958
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,460
um that for me is nicely defined that

959
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:35,400
exists in the sort of Bayesian

960
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,220
statistics literature

961
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,660
um and it says if you've got a Bayesian

962
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:42,599
Network you can consider the nodes in

963
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:43,740
that Network

964
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,180
and you can ask

965
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:48,780
um what are their Markov blankets and in

966
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,820
particular you can just Define the

967
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,820
markup blanket of a particular node to

968
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,560
be

969
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,680
um it's parents so

970
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,520
um

971
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,920
um the those nodes that it's

972
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,920
conditionally sort of dependent on

973
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,320
um it's children sort of those nodes

974
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,680
which are conditionally dependent on it

975
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,320
and what are known as it's co-parents so

976
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,599
the other parents of its children

977
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,800
um and that's a very nicely well-defined

978
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,680
notion but it's only nicely and it's

979
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:26,760
well defined in this context of

980
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,859
um Bayesian Networks

981
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:33,380
and so it's like so generalizing that to

982
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,880
kind of situations where you've got

983
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,060
interacting dynamical systems

984
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,440
um is something that that like

985
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,240
informally makes total sense you want to

986
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,339
say okay well I have this this thing in

987
00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:47,579
the world and it behaves so it changes

988
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:48,839
in time

989
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:51,780
and it's sort of a coherent unity in

990
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,579
some sense and so it has a kind of

991
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:55,140
boundary

992
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,660
and because it has a boundary like

993
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:01,160
information and energy

994
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,839
from the environment always have to flow

995
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,119
through this boundary in order to

996
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:07,859
interact with it

997
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:10,980
and that sort of boundary notion it

998
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,560
seems is like what is in other contexts

999
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,020
also called the Markov blanket

1000
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:19,200
and I think if you set up your Dynamics

1001
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,319
in a particular way you could or your

1002
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,480
definition of Bayesian Network in a

1003
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,980
particular way

1004
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,980
that the two ideas that you know might

1005
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,560
coincide but I don't think that's true

1006
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:35,640
in general and I think what people mean

1007
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,440
in the literature when they're talking

1008
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,900
about markup blankets but in this

1009
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,359
dynamical context I think all they

1010
00:43:42,359 --> 00:43:45,240
really mean is like boundary or

1011
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,380
interface

1012
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:52,079
so the the data of the systems like

1013
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,119
capacity for interaction or something

1014
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:56,940
like that the stuff that is on the edge

1015
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,880
of the system through which interactions

1016
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:04,460
with its environment are mediated

1017
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:09,599
um and and some that's a general idea is

1018
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,180
um something again that appears nicely

1019
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,140
in

1020
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:16,380
uh categorical systems theory but in a

1021
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,800
very general way and it doesn't require

1022
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,319
any of the Notions of

1023
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,720
Bayesian statistics and it doesn't

1024
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,160
require

1025
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,880
um you know conditional dependence or

1026
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:30,839
um

1027
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:33,119
like parents or children of a graph

1028
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,500
because you know you might have

1029
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,119
something more complicated than a graph

1030
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:38,880
like you might have like edges which are

1031
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,319
allowed to connect more than one node

1032
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,880
and that gives you a hyper graph and

1033
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,740
there of course the notion of Bayesian

1034
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:46,500
of Mark of blanket in the standard sense

1035
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,740
this doesn't make sense at all

1036
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,359
um but of course the notion of interface

1037
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,400
does and there's a certain like there

1038
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,520
are certain categories of interfaces and

1039
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,859
those wiring diagrams I was drawing

1040
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:03,480
before are an example of a category of

1041
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,819
interfaces like they don't have any data

1042
00:45:05,819 --> 00:45:08,579
of the systems themselves the category

1043
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:10,619
just tells you how to sort of plug

1044
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:13,260
interfaces together

1045
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:15,480
and so I think it's kind of neater to

1046
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,819
think about this connectivity and the

1047
00:45:17,819 --> 00:45:20,640
interfaces sort of separately from the

1048
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,940
stuff that fills the interfaces like the

1049
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:27,119
data of the dynamical systems or of the

1050
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,160
active inference like games that I've

1051
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,560
been talking about

1052
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,339
um

1053
00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:36,839
and so a a really nice kind of category

1054
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:38,940
that you can use to talk about

1055
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:41,520
interfaces

1056
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,900
um and indeed to talk about lots of

1057
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,460
other things but in particular to talk

1058
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,400
about interfaces is this category of

1059
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,040
polynomial functions

1060
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,160
and it it kind of generalizes these

1061
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,440
wiring diagrams that I was drawing

1062
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,339
earlier

1063
00:45:56,339 --> 00:45:58,520
and it it does so in a particularly

1064
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:03,180
useful way I think which is that

1065
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,940
if you think of if you sort of formalize

1066
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:09,660
the interface of a system using

1067
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:12,839
um this polynomial language you can

1068
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:15,119
start to talk about interfaces that

1069
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,640
themselves might change depending on the

1070
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,440
context

1071
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,339
so like when you get into the car to

1072
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:25,619
drive somewhere effectively you've sort

1073
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:27,960
of changed your interface because now

1074
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,819
you've got this like power around you

1075
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:32,220
and like you used and it behaves in a

1076
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:33,720
different way than if you're just on

1077
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,280
your own

1078
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,619
um or if you're like just you know a

1079
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:39,020
normal you know

1080
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:41,520
normally going about your life

1081
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,040
um you might you know blink right or you

1082
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,560
might close your eyes and that means

1083
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,599
that you're no longer receiving visual

1084
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:51,900
signals from the world and so like if

1085
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,940
you just say you know you're writing

1086
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,319
down your like active inference model

1087
00:46:55,319 --> 00:46:57,119
and part of the model is that it

1088
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,780
receives visual signals

1089
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,560
then

1090
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,680
you know talking about situations where

1091
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,800
those visual signals go away

1092
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,420
it kind of

1093
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,119
you you can do it right but it's not

1094
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:14,460
very neat and so it's sort of a account

1095
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,500
for interfaces that might change like

1096
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,020
this it's nicer to be able to say okay

1097
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:20,240
well

1098
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,619
my interface actually is allowed to

1099
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:24,960
depend on that on what I'm doing right

1100
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,880
now

1101
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,920
um so like you know I'm currently on a

1102
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,720
video call and it means I can do certain

1103
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,000
things but like I'm currently wired into

1104
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,220
the computer so I can't so easily go and

1105
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,720
walk around

1106
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,780
um like the set of like signals I

1107
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:41,940
receive or actions I might take might

1108
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,020
change

1109
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:45,000
and so I think

1110
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,839
it's easy to start by saying okay when

1111
00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:51,060
we're talking about Markov blankets and

1112
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:53,099
dynamical systems we just mean like

1113
00:47:53,099 --> 00:47:55,560
there is some set that is like the

1114
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,839
action set and subset which is the sort

1115
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,460
of sensory set

1116
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,140
that's just it for me it's just not

1117
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,760
enough because of the fact that the

1118
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,520
world is dynamical you know context

1119
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,880
change you know coupling might be

1120
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,920
dependent on like you might be in an

1121
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,140
organization and there's some executive

1122
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,640
who

1123
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,980
who's in charge of defining the team

1124
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:18,240
structure

1125
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,099
and that means the team structure is

1126
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:22,920
like the wiring of the agents in that

1127
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,740
organization but it depends like that

1128
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:28,140
how they behave depends on the decisions

1129
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,900
that that executive meets and so like

1130
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,000
their marker blankets but like

1131
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
conditional on those decisions and

1132
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,020
that's something you can talk about

1133
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:38,760
nicely in this polynomial language

1134
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,280
because you're allowed to have systems

1135
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,099
which like affect the wiring of other

1136
00:48:44,099 --> 00:48:46,079
systems but it's really not something

1137
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,960
that's easy to talk about in this like

1138
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,560
standard framework of of of like

1139
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,260
um interfaces and boundaries that is

1140
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,640
dominant in the active inference

1141
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,680
literature and I think that's because

1142
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,599
really in the art of Interest literature

1143
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:02,579
there isn't a framework for interfaces

1144
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:04,500
and wiring

1145
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,200
um and that framework is supplied by

1146
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,839
these categories of interfaces

1147
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:11,400
um and so you can just choose one and

1148
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,020
you can you know hope it does you know

1149
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,280
you choose one that's appropriate for

1150
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,380
your situation that you're trying to

1151
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:17,880
model

1152
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,380
um but it helps to actually have one

1153
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:21,660
that allows you to do this wiring

1154
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:22,800
um and that's something that using

1155
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,359
category Theory allows you to do because

1156
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:27,560
it's all about composition

1157
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,079
awesome

1158
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:33,780
the textbooks will be Rewritten Dean

1159
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:36,420
quick thing Toby does the timing of the

1160
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:40,440
choice in you in your experience

1161
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,339
really matter

1162
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:46,920
the timing in what respects just

1163
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,980
whenever whenever you do decide to make

1164
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:51,480
a choice

1165
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,940
doesn't the doesn't the effect of the

1166
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:57,780
timing the Oneness of activating that

1167
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,160
choice

1168
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:02,700
play a huge part in What what follows in

1169
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,400
terms of the category yeah so I do you

1170
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,440
mean like if you're choosing to use a

1171
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,300
particular kind of interface language

1172
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,440
say

1173
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,380
or describe a thing using a with a

1174
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,660
particular interface or like particular

1175
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,460
kind of boundary

1176
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:21,599
yeah so I I agree and that's why I kind

1177
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:24,060
of tend to work quite abstractly so

1178
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:26,579
rather than saying I'm working with a

1179
00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:29,520
particular kind of interface language

1180
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,760
I'm just saying I will assume my

1181
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,740
interface language allows me to do these

1182
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,420
certain things

1183
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,819
and so that's not so useful for like

1184
00:50:38,819 --> 00:50:42,200
actually implementing a particular model

1185
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:45,660
but if you're trying to think about like

1186
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:48,240
systems in general it's helpful to work

1187
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,480
like agnostically in that way

1188
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,819
and so the reason I sort of advocate

1189
00:50:53,819 --> 00:50:57,180
like this for polynomial functors is I

1190
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:58,680
think that they are

1191
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,300
they sort of

1192
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:03,059
sit in a nice sort of intermediate level

1193
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:05,460
of abstraction it's not it's not the

1194
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:07,319
same okay well there is a collection of

1195
00:51:07,319 --> 00:51:09,000
interfaces and some collection of wiring

1196
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,859
them together because that doesn't tell

1197
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:13,980
you like actually how that works

1198
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:16,400
um so it does it is slightly opinionated

1199
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,559
it's different from certain choices that

1200
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:21,420
people in other bits of Applied category

1201
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,460
Theory make

1202
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:26,640
um but it does generalize this simple

1203
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,220
case where you have just a single set of

1204
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,500
outputs and a single set of inputs or

1205
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,119
single set of actions within a single

1206
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:34,680
set of

1207
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,619
um like observation and so I think

1208
00:51:37,619 --> 00:51:39,480
because of that it's it's a kind of nice

1209
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,400
it's a nice sort of intermediate level I

1210
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,200
think it's it's one I've like tried to

1211
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,819
work with because I think it's quite you

1212
00:51:44,819 --> 00:51:46,500
know natural

1213
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,000
um but yeah you can sort of totally work

1214
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,940
at a very abstract level and that's what

1215
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:53,040
um David Jazz does with his systems

1216
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,440
theory he just he's just like talks

1217
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,900
about interfaces in general like they

1218
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,359
don't have they might not have you might

1219
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:02,760
not have like actions at all

1220
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,480
um

1221
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:07,220
you know it's completely agnostic

1222
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:13,700
awesome Ollie

1223
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,579
uh okay thank you so much so my second

1224
00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:20,099
question uh is about the relation

1225
00:52:20,099 --> 00:52:22,920
between uh your compositional account of

1226
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,740
active inference and the recent line of

1227
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:28,400
research uh done in Bayesian mechanics

1228
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,619
namely uh the discovery of The Duality

1229
00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:34,440
between fep and constraint maximum

1230
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:37,980
entropy principle so

1231
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:41,160
um as discovered primarily through the

1232
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,220
work of Dalton's active adebel uh in the

1233
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:47,460
last couple of years uh there's this uh

1234
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:50,760
nice Duality between uh The Observer

1235
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:54,119
dependent uh the uh I mean uh the

1236
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:56,880
Viewpoint from the inside Observer of

1237
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,160
the agent and the outside Observer So

1238
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:02,460
based uh respectively uh the perspective

1239
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:05,520
of fep as opposed to a constrained

1240
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:09,180
maximum entropy principle but uh Dalton

1241
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:12,300
has demonstrated that actually those two

1242
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:15,660
perspectives can be unified through

1243
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:17,940
showing the equivalence between the

1244
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:21,000
Bayesian optimality and James optimality

1245
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,760
so uh Bayesian optimality from Bayesian

1246
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,460
optimality we can obtain fep and from

1247
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:28,619
Jane's optimality we can

1248
00:53:28,619 --> 00:53:34,079
um we can acquire a cmap so given that

1249
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:38,119
uh the notion of Bayesian lens also

1250
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:41,880
comprise both uh Bayesian Bayesian

1251
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:46,200
inference and its inverse process uh do

1252
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:49,260
you think as it uh the Bayesian lens as

1253
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:52,680
providing a kind of

1254
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,140
um I don't know a tool to account for

1255
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:59,040
showing this kind of Duality between fpp

1256
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,099
and constraint maximum entropy principle

1257
00:54:02,099 --> 00:54:05,339
I think the answer is probably yes but I

1258
00:54:05,339 --> 00:54:06,540
think this is a really great question

1259
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:09,480
because I genuinely I don't know the

1260
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,420
story here like I mean I I know

1261
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:14,220
um a bit about Dalton's work and I think

1262
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:15,780
it's wonderful

1263
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:18,180
um but I really don't know yet how it

1264
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:20,339
connects to the stuff I've been doing

1265
00:54:20,339 --> 00:54:21,900
and it's it's really like an open

1266
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,700
question for me

1267
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,380
um but there are some like tantalizing

1268
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:27,599
signs that as I say I think the answer

1269
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,400
to your question is yes there is that

1270
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,559
kind of unification of the two kinds of

1271
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:33,420
story

1272
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:34,220
um

1273
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:37,319
and some of the ingredients of that

1274
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:39,720
story are kind of floating around out

1275
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:44,640
there so I know that there seems to be a

1276
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,680
connection or like I know there is a

1277
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,800
connection between quantities like

1278
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:53,940
um the relative entropy and like uh sort

1279
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:56,160
of information like energetic Concepts

1280
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,339
you get in physics and through that you

1281
00:54:59,339 --> 00:55:01,440
can make a link to the kinds of things

1282
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,420
that Dalton has been doing with Gauge

1283
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:06,900
Theory and I I feel like there

1284
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:10,319
there is a kind of geometrical structure

1285
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:12,480
that you can put on top of these

1286
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,040
statistical games that I've been working

1287
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,020
with because remember they are these

1288
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:19,260
lenses with these loss functions and

1289
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,119
these loss functions seem to have this

1290
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:22,559
kind of um

1291
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:24,359
as I say this kind of geometric thing

1292
00:55:24,359 --> 00:55:26,400
going on with them

1293
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,680
but really like

1294
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:31,559
re like explaining

1295
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:34,200
or like putting met constrained maximum

1296
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:38,400
entropy into statistical games language

1297
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,020
um is not something that I've done and

1298
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,300
it's something that you know you know

1299
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:43,800
um I've been thinking about doing and

1300
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,660
you know I'd be delighted to talk to

1301
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,099
people about more

1302
00:55:47,099 --> 00:55:49,800
um and so I don't know precisely the

1303
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,240
details

1304
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:54,119
um there is a kind of other Duality

1305
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:55,740
which I think is quite nice which is

1306
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,480
related to this

1307
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,700
um and I think

1308
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:03,180
and I think again at the Nexus of these

1309
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:07,920
is this like systems theoretic idea

1310
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,059
um

1311
00:56:09,059 --> 00:56:11,280
because of course all of this work of

1312
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,599
Dalton's lives in this kind of like

1313
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:15,180
dynamical systems world where you have

1314
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:17,640
like dynamical systems like that are

1315
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,680
interacting and information flowing

1316
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,839
between them

1317
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:23,280
um

1318
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,160
and there are some really tantalizing

1319
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,099
um connections again of course between

1320
00:56:28,099 --> 00:56:30,420
physics and information processing and I

1321
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:31,619
I learned the other day for instance

1322
00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:33,059
that there are

1323
00:56:33,059 --> 00:56:35,640
certain classes of

1324
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:39,000
um generative adversarial Networks

1325
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,920
um the sorry this is just a slight

1326
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,420
Township I think you might be interested

1327
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:44,040
to know certain classes of generative

1328
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,440
adversarial Networks that you can you

1329
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:50,099
can set them up and the two like

1330
00:56:50,099 --> 00:56:52,980
um the two like parts of the network

1331
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,839
tend to like instead of settling into

1332
00:56:54,839 --> 00:56:57,059
like an equilibrium they seem to like

1333
00:56:57,059 --> 00:56:59,160
exhibit some like orbits around each

1334
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,440
other so they don't like achieve some

1335
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,960
like equilibrium state in the game

1336
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,400
they're playing they kind of just like

1337
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,800
pop around

1338
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:08,880
um

1339
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:13,020
but somebody was telling me about

1340
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:14,040
um

1341
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,260
like if you have an orbit you could sort

1342
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:17,760
of and you're a physicist you think okay

1343
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,220
well like what what is that orbit like

1344
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:22,859
like conserving is there like a quantity

1345
00:57:22,859 --> 00:57:24,420
that it's conserving

1346
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:26,160
and in this case and I don't know the

1347
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,960
details but in this case

1348
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,300
um this person found that the quantity

1349
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:33,599
that was conserved in this orbit was the

1350
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:35,640
relative entropy and so like there's

1351
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,260
this weird thing going on look these

1352
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:38,579
things are playing a game but they're

1353
00:57:38,579 --> 00:57:40,500
still like at this kind of

1354
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,540
like somewhere like steady state or

1355
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:44,700
relative entropy

1356
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,680
um and so there seems to be this deep

1357
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:49,020
connection between these kinds of like

1358
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:51,480
game-like systems

1359
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:54,839
and like sort of information physics in

1360
00:57:54,839 --> 00:57:56,280
some sense

1361
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,140
um and I'm aware I need to head off at a

1362
00:57:58,140 --> 00:57:59,520
moment but I just want to draw one more

1363
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,380
picture and I'm sorry you probably had

1364
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:02,880
loads of questions but we kind of run

1365
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,700
out of that was perfect many of them but

1366
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,319
hopefully we'll we'll get to the rest of

1367
00:58:07,319 --> 00:58:08,579
them soon

1368
00:58:08,579 --> 00:58:12,660
um but if I just draw as I say one more

1369
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:13,500
um

1370
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:16,220
picture

1371
00:58:16,859 --> 00:58:19,140
um which is a kind of slightly uh

1372
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:21,720
different kind of Duality but a similar

1373
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:24,480
kind of similar kind of flavor

1374
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,520
so what we have in

1375
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:29,940
systems theory is this category you have

1376
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:32,220
in this category of interfaces and of

1377
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,920
systems and the morphisms tell you how

1378
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:38,760
to like wire these systems together

1379
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,500
to give like hierarchical or like

1380
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,920
composite systems

1381
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,540
and you can

1382
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:47,579
if you have if you have something like

1383
00:58:47,579 --> 00:58:50,160
this thing which I wrote before din

1384
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,859
which I said you know for each interface

1385
00:58:52,859 --> 00:58:56,040
I was like a a category

1386
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,140
then you can sort of think of this as a

1387
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:02,940
functor from int to like cat

1388
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,099
the category of categories

1389
00:59:05,099 --> 00:59:08,160
and one thing you can do with index

1390
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,319
categories of this kind is you can sort

1391
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:13,260
of turn them into what are called like

1392
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:15,240
vibrations using what's known as The

1393
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,859
Groton deconstruction and if you know

1394
00:59:16,859 --> 00:59:19,020
about physics you've probably heard of a

1395
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:21,660
concept called a fiber bundle

1396
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:23,640
um which is just like a collection of

1397
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:25,859
Spaces indexed by points of another

1398
00:59:25,859 --> 00:59:27,599
space

1399
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:30,119
and so what you can do is you can write

1400
00:59:30,119 --> 00:59:34,380
this vibration which says okay well for

1401
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,119
each interface I've got a category of

1402
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:38,160
inter of systems on that interface and

1403
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,140
they're all like glued together

1404
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:43,740
correspondingly with the the wirings of

1405
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:46,440
your interface category

1406
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,000
and so you write this as like another

1407
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,220
functor which kind of forgets about the

1408
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:52,079
dynamical systems and just Returns the

1409
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:53,280
interface again

1410
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,380
and so you have this vibration thing

1411
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:56,640
here

1412
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,079
and this is like where kind of like

1413
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,920
physics lives

1414
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,660
and so what I've been trying to tell

1415
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:06,119
this story about you know in this story

1416
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:08,160
about active inference is that you have

1417
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:11,819
a similar one where you have

1418
01:00:11,819 --> 01:00:15,119
um for each type of interface the

1419
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:18,359
category of agents that might be that

1420
01:00:18,359 --> 01:00:20,819
might have that interface like you know

1421
01:00:20,819 --> 01:00:23,280
we're all humans and so we're all like

1422
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,960
the type that might fit in like a

1423
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,819
human-shaped box

1424
01:00:26,819 --> 01:00:28,020
um and so we're all in that like

1425
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:29,760
particular category and you know we come

1426
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,500
together to form organizations and

1427
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,359
that's another object of this category

1428
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:35,280
of interfaces and another kind of agent

1429
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,920
category on those interfaces and so that

1430
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,000
gives you another one of these

1431
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,200
vibrations and the thing that something

1432
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,000
like predictive coding tells you is it

1433
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,059
says okay well given a certain

1434
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:46,619
story about

1435
01:00:46,619 --> 01:00:48,480
a type of agent

1436
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,579
can I turn that into a dynamical system

1437
01:00:50,579 --> 01:00:53,040
which like actually animates it and so

1438
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,020
that's like a function like okay for

1439
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:56,700
like this

1440
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,619
so maybe maybe what we could do is we

1441
01:00:58,619 --> 01:01:00,180
could think of this as like maybe like

1442
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:02,880
some version of biology

1443
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,740
or we could think of this as like you

1444
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:06,780
know we could think of this as like body

1445
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:08,579
and we could sort of think of this as

1446
01:01:08,579 --> 01:01:10,740
like mind

1447
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:12,540
and so like this is telling us how to go

1448
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:14,280
from like a description of like a mental

1449
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:16,579
system to like a sort of embodied system

1450
01:01:16,579 --> 01:01:19,380
and I think some of what the free energy

1451
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:21,480
principle is trying to say is that you

1452
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,819
know for certain kinds of system there's

1453
01:01:23,819 --> 01:01:25,920
a way to turn your description of a

1454
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,420
dynamical system into something that

1455
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:28,920
looks like an agent

1456
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,780
and so the thing I'm wondering is that

1457
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:33,480
whether there's like some like

1458
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:36,960
a junction or maybe maybe this is like I

1459
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:37,799
don't know

1460
01:01:37,799 --> 01:01:40,020
I don't know which way we might write

1461
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:42,059
labels on these but maybe there's like

1462
01:01:42,059 --> 01:01:44,880
some a junction here

1463
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,740
um that allows us to like compare these

1464
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:50,280
two processes of like you know turning a

1465
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,200
sort of mental system into a physical

1466
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,819
one and then going in the other

1467
01:01:53,819 --> 01:01:55,500
direction from a physical system into a

1468
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,059
mental one

1469
01:01:57,059 --> 01:01:58,859
um and so maybe this is also like where

1470
01:01:58,859 --> 01:02:03,078
like you know information comes in

1471
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:06,900
um and it's a kind of similar story in

1472
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:09,839
in category Theory

1473
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:12,599
um where there's a sort of Duality

1474
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:16,859
between geometry and logic

1475
01:02:16,859 --> 01:02:19,260
um that you that sort of sometimes

1476
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:21,059
written like this you have like truth

1477
01:02:21,059 --> 01:02:23,960
values down here and you have like

1478
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:27,180
logic over here and you have like space

1479
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:28,980
over here

1480
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:32,280
and like there's a way to sort of like

1481
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:34,380
draw a picture like this

1482
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:36,540
that says okay well

1483
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:39,720
logic is somehow like dual to space in

1484
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:42,000
some like sort of number jumbo-y way I

1485
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,799
mean again I've run out of time but I

1486
01:02:43,799 --> 01:02:46,500
think there's a story that people try to

1487
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:49,500
tell about like science in this kind of

1488
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,000
abstract world and I think it's a

1489
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,680
similar story to maybe something that's

1490
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:54,599
being told over here

1491
01:02:54,599 --> 01:02:57,180
um again lots of details and I don't

1492
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:58,500
know precisely the connection with

1493
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,900
Dalton's work but I think it's kind of

1494
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:04,040
pointy in this kind of Direction

1495
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:08,040
Thank You Toby after thank you you have

1496
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:11,700
revised and preceded

1497
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:12,540
um

1498
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:15,780
let's have 54.3 and talk more about

1499
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:18,540
action active inference so thank you

1500
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:20,099
yeah great thank you so much for having

1501
01:03:20,099 --> 01:03:21,720
me and I look forward to speaking again

1502
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:24,540
and answering your questions about it

1503
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:26,579
thank you so much maybe that was great

1504
01:03:26,579 --> 01:03:29,640
okay great bye guys

1505
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,759
bye

1506
01:03:31,859 --> 01:03:34,578
well

1507
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,660
wow

1508
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:44,819
Ollie please make a remark and then I

1509
01:03:44,819 --> 01:03:48,119
have a question sorry yeah uh you know

1510
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:51,720
uh I really think of Toby's work as uh

1511
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:54,660
really provocative as it's uh as it

1512
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:57,059
really opens up Pandora's box with many

1513
01:03:57,059 --> 01:04:01,619
many uh different fertile questions so

1514
01:04:01,619 --> 01:04:05,700
uh I'm I'm a firm believer of this old

1515
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:08,460
saying that a sign of a great book is

1516
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:10,980
not how many answers it provides but

1517
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:13,500
actually how many questions it gives

1518
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,960
rise to so uh I really wanted to

1519
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:20,119
congratulate Toby and writing such a

1520
01:04:20,119 --> 01:04:22,760
uh I mean

1521
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:29,099
it it looks as if uh he he he began uh

1522
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:31,980
from the perspective of trying to

1523
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:35,339
address uh some of the uh I don't know

1524
01:04:35,339 --> 01:04:38,940
some long-held questions but uh then it

1525
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:41,880
turned out to be much more deeper than

1526
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:44,760
that in terms of uh actually giving rise

1527
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:47,819
to many fertile questions so uh yeah

1528
01:04:47,819 --> 01:04:50,720
that's really great

1529
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:53,640
Dean

1530
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,460
I I'd like to ask what is the difference

1531
01:04:56,460 --> 01:05:00,059
or how can we think about being on time

1532
01:05:00,059 --> 01:05:04,280
in time and out of time

1533
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:07,440
because Toby said he was out of time

1534
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,359
with the answer

1535
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:11,819
and I I know that we've

1536
01:05:11,819 --> 01:05:13,680
spoken about this where we consider some

1537
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:16,500
of the time Consciousness and category

1538
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:19,140
Theory work previously

1539
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:22,020
so what is it to be out of time

1540
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:24,480
yeah that's a that's a great question

1541
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,079
all I can say at this point is that

1542
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:31,980
it's easier to discretize

1543
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:34,799
when you're in time

1544
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:38,579
and out of time as a as a comparator

1545
01:05:38,579 --> 01:05:42,960
than it is to say when you're on time

1546
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:48,200
versus those first two positions

1547
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,599
that's all I can say about that for now

1548
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:55,680
because I'm sure Toby from a from a

1549
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,319
diagrammatic perspective

1550
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:02,099
could probably tell us what is happening

1551
01:06:02,099 --> 01:06:06,680
when he's actually using his stylus

1552
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:09,859
versus not

1553
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,000
right like with the result of that

1554
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,720
leaves something in and out

1555
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:21,119
but well he's actually on

1556
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:23,359
on point

1557
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:27,059
he he's literally in a different place

1558
01:06:27,059 --> 01:06:28,200
so

1559
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,299
here's a here's a here's an interesting

1560
01:06:30,299 --> 01:06:32,880
thing back to the provocative

1561
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,039
Ali and the dot one was talking about

1562
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:37,380
virtual and actual models and was

1563
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:40,859
probably saying it in a in a way that's

1564
01:06:40,859 --> 01:06:43,380
completely different than how I

1565
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:46,319
use those those same I believe those

1566
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:50,520
same two models are in effect

1567
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,859
and so

1568
01:06:52,859 --> 01:06:54,920
um

1569
01:06:55,619 --> 01:06:58,740
if you if you for example

1570
01:06:58,740 --> 01:06:59,400
um

1571
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,500
draw up

1572
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:04,500
a play say in sports because we're we're

1573
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:06,780
talking a lot of strategy well Toby was

1574
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:10,020
on today and a lot of gaming gaming

1575
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:12,960
Theory and stuff you draw up a play

1576
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:18,780
then you confirm that you have all the

1577
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:21,059
elements of resources that you need in

1578
01:07:21,059 --> 01:07:24,240
order to be able to carry that out

1579
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,059
and then you're you're as a group

1580
01:07:27,059 --> 01:07:29,039
communicating with one another like we

1581
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:31,980
are doing on this on this live stream

1582
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:34,319
right like you're literally calling out

1583
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:37,140
to play in in North American football

1584
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:39,180
you'd huddle up

1585
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:41,700
I literally call out a sequence of code

1586
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:44,400
and then you'd have to literally

1587
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:48,119
reverse that and turn the inference

1588
01:07:48,119 --> 01:07:51,240
as as a the shortest

1589
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:55,260
time window into a prediction

1590
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:58,680
like you would literally line up

1591
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:01,339
and then you would carry out this the

1592
01:08:01,339 --> 01:08:05,039
simulation in actual terms

1593
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:08,099
this all of that

1594
01:08:08,099 --> 01:08:09,539
together

1595
01:08:09,539 --> 01:08:12,240
means that I believe that the virtual

1596
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,880
version of the model

1597
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,679
is as Toby was saying in the

1598
01:08:16,679 --> 01:08:18,839
bi-directional sense going in One

1599
01:08:18,839 --> 01:08:19,859
Direction

1600
01:08:19,859 --> 01:08:23,698
and the actual model is going in

1601
01:08:23,698 --> 01:08:27,960
180 degrees the opposite direction and

1602
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,939
that when he mentioned

1603
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:33,359
the dagger symbol today I was just like

1604
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:36,738
okay where does that fit in to this

1605
01:08:36,738 --> 01:08:38,939
bi-directionality and the difference

1606
01:08:38,939 --> 01:08:40,920
between

1607
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:45,299
the the Sim the digital the virtual and

1608
01:08:45,299 --> 01:08:48,179
the actual so these are the things that

1609
01:08:48,179 --> 01:08:49,560
literally

1610
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,120
pop up

1611
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:54,179
at at any given moment aren't

1612
01:08:54,179 --> 01:08:56,460
necessarily part of what you consider to

1613
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:57,779
be

1614
01:08:57,779 --> 01:09:00,660
the space that is inhabited by

1615
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:04,259
virtuality and actuality and yet there

1616
01:09:04,259 --> 01:09:07,799
it is it just appears and then you have

1617
01:09:07,799 --> 01:09:09,120
to sit down and figure out well where

1618
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:12,000
does that categorically fit

1619
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,198
so again don't want to go off on a on a

1620
01:09:16,198 --> 01:09:19,380
deep Rabbit Hole philosophical take on

1621
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:22,259
this but I just find that at any given

1622
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:23,160
moment

1623
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:27,120
there is again so much math in this

1624
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,460
philosophy that it's it's kind of

1625
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:31,380
Staggering and just to be able to have

1626
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:34,500
somebody who can explain that and draw

1627
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,299
it out

1628
01:09:36,299 --> 01:09:40,198
is pretty impressive so

1629
01:09:40,198 --> 01:09:42,719
I don't know if it's provocative what I

1630
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:45,660
just said I hope it isn't because man I

1631
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:50,279
did this work for almost a decade and

1632
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:52,759
it seemed like young people weren't

1633
01:09:52,759 --> 01:09:56,219
scared by it maybe older folks are but I

1634
01:09:56,219 --> 01:09:58,460
don't know

1635
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:03,840
uh so if I may add a brief comment on

1636
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:07,260
just what you said uh I was recently

1637
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:10,739
watching this talk by John Bays about

1638
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:13,640
the history of Applied category Theory

1639
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:18,600
uh so he had this nice diagram showing

1640
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:22,260
uh the relationship between the

1641
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:24,480
different areas of knowledge I mean

1642
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,960
going from business to pure mathematics

1643
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:31,260
and uh he he claimed that most people in

1644
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,060
category Theory or

1645
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:36,780
in those other areas uh consider

1646
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:41,100
category Theory as being on the top of

1647
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:43,679
top of the pyramid as being the purest

1648
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:47,460
of the pure so uh as being even a kind

1649
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:50,940
of uh being at a metal level than even

1650
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:54,960
the pure mathematics but then uh he said

1651
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,560
that I believe a category Theory can

1652
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,440
actually be seen as kind of permeating

1653
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:03,960
all of these levels so it's not

1654
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:07,739
something that sits on top of uh the uh

1655
01:11:07,739 --> 01:11:10,500
the hierarchy it's something that

1656
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,900
actually can be seen as influencing and

1657
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:16,800
permeating all the levels so that at

1658
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,719
least uh from the from the perspective

1659
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:22,020
of Applied category Theory uh it seems

1660
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:23,120
to be

1661
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:27,000
uh if not self-evident but something

1662
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:32,219
that uh gathers much I mean more

1663
01:11:32,219 --> 01:11:35,520
evidence as the research goes by so I'm

1664
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,860
really optimistic in the in the research

1665
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:40,320
reaction that applied category theory is

1666
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:43,260
going and hopefully in near future we

1667
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:45,960
can see it uh applied to many many

1668
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,360
different areas many many different

1669
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:51,480
unforeseen areas so

1670
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:52,560
yeah

1671
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:56,040
I think I'll just take on to that Ali if

1672
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:57,659
you

1673
01:11:57,659 --> 01:12:02,460
if you use an abductive logic lens then

1674
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:05,159
it's simply a question of when did you

1675
01:12:05,159 --> 01:12:08,880
enter at what point did you enter

1676
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:09,860
the

1677
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:11,580
abstracted

1678
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:15,300
timeline because if you see it that way

1679
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:19,320
it's not just top down and it's not just

1680
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:23,100
bottom up it's back to my question well

1681
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:25,199
to Toby was

1682
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:29,699
does the whimness of this really really

1683
01:12:29,699 --> 01:12:33,600
matter if you want to be able to take it

1684
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:36,719
off the shelf and use it and that of

1685
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:38,699
course his answer was

1686
01:12:38,699 --> 01:12:40,500
yeah if you if you want to deal with

1687
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:43,080
idiosyncrasies

1688
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,239
you're left with no choice

1689
01:12:45,239 --> 01:12:48,600
but actually to acknowledge

1690
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:51,300
that the the the point in the Continuum

1691
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,760
where you take this up

1692
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,860
but I I think that actually makes it

1693
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:57,239
quite easy

1694
01:12:57,239 --> 01:13:00,300
to see it permeating every level

1695
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:04,140
but again it's the it's the abduction

1696
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:07,440
the abductive piece of this back to last

1697
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,840
year in in August

1698
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,940
right we're coming up on one year since

1699
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:13,860
we talked about how important that is

1700
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:15,540
and yet

1701
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:17,640
here we are

1702
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:19,020
um what

1703
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:22,199
10 and 10 and a half months later and it

1704
01:13:22,199 --> 01:13:24,239
and it we're circling back we have

1705
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:26,520
another predictive parabolic on our

1706
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:28,940
heads

1707
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:34,620
a few few comments on that

1708
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:37,140
it's reminding me of

1709
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:40,080
Professor Mike Levin's work on basal

1710
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,400
cognition

1711
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:44,460
and the idea that intelligence isn't on

1712
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:47,100
the top of the pyramid either rather

1713
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:49,980
it's something that's distributed

1714
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:52,980
compositionally across levels and

1715
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:54,960
something that exists at all levels and

1716
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:57,960
so we can then still talk about higher

1717
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:00,780
order properties of systems or or

1718
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:03,360
properties of Composites or aggregate

1719
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,900
systems

1720
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:08,219
while also

1721
01:14:08,219 --> 01:14:10,080
grounding

1722
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:13,800
in the in the

1723
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:16,560
in the foundations

1724
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:17,100
[Music]

1725
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:19,100
um

1726
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:24,659
so yeah and that grounding and anchoring

1727
01:14:24,659 --> 01:14:28,679
and stabilizing that's by itself

1728
01:14:28,679 --> 01:14:30,600
is not a

1729
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:33,420
is nothing but a feature I think we also

1730
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:34,440
want to be able to though because

1731
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:37,500
there's a lot of talk today about

1732
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:41,880
being able to see this in in the dynamic

1733
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:45,320
in the way that things

1734
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:48,960
dynamically play out

1735
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,420
so again we're back to the what's the

1736
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:54,600
minimum two ways that we want to

1737
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:57,900
incorporate this observation both the

1738
01:14:57,900 --> 01:15:00,960
stabilized and as searching right if we

1739
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,840
can if we can have one eye on each at

1740
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:07,320
all times it does take a bit of

1741
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:10,199
rethinking

1742
01:15:10,199 --> 01:15:12,379
um

1743
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:15,540
there is a there is a there is an

1744
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:17,880
enteroceptive piece to this

1745
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:21,300
what we feel from that

1746
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:24,060
is different

1747
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:25,760
so

1748
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:29,000
that brings us to the Sensor Fusion

1749
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,820
aspects of the uh dissertation

1750
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:34,940
yeah

1751
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:40,759
7.1.1 Bayesian Sensor Fusion yeah

1752
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:42,600
a situation that is common natural

1753
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,640
embodied systems but which is not yet

1754
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,320
well treated by current statistical

1755
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,300
machine learning methods

1756
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:50,880
also Ali thanks so much for asking the

1757
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,500
Markov blankets

1758
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:53,880
question

1759
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:56,040
I think his response

1760
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:58,440
is worthy honestly to to review and

1761
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:01,560
unpack in in the time we have we can

1762
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,719
just sort of review a little bit and

1763
01:16:03,719 --> 01:16:05,940
think about what other questions we want

1764
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:10,280
to prepare for for DOT two

1765
01:16:11,159 --> 01:16:14,460
how would you Ali restate

1766
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:17,159
the

1767
01:16:17,159 --> 01:16:19,620
um limitations of the Markov blanket

1768
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:22,380
concept for all the positive things that

1769
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:24,120
we've said in the previous 300 live

1770
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,840
streams and and where category Theory

1771
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:30,480
can help address and and and move past

1772
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:33,019
some of that

1773
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:36,840
uh yeah you see uh so this notion

1774
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:41,100
obviously is one of the most uh or I

1775
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,540
don't know probably one of the most

1776
01:16:42,540 --> 01:16:46,080
controversial Concepts in whole fep

1777
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:49,380
literature because uh it has received a

1778
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:52,679
fair amount of criticism from uh many

1779
01:16:52,679 --> 01:16:54,380
various perspectives

1780
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:58,199
but some criticisms

1781
01:16:58,199 --> 01:17:02,640
at least as far as I know is they're

1782
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:04,980
they're basically directed toward the

1783
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:07,199
universality of Mark of blanket how

1784
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:09,300
Universal uh

1785
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:12,600
is this notion as uh as it's claims to

1786
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:15,840
be ranging from I don't know inert rocks

1787
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:20,219
to the brains right uh so does it apply

1788
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:23,880
equally for modeling uh inert rocks as

1789
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:27,780
well as uh the most complex system that

1790
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:29,460
we know of in the in the whole universe

1791
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:33,780
namely the brain uh so the response uh

1792
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:37,320
this line of criticism uh got from uh

1793
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,120
the researchers in the active inference

1794
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:42,659
area uh again to the best of my

1795
01:17:42,659 --> 01:17:45,300
understanding uh is to the uh to the

1796
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:49,440
effect that uh although theoretically it

1797
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:52,560
can be applied to many

1798
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,159
um

1799
01:17:53,159 --> 01:17:56,940
I mean different systems uh with many

1800
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:59,880
different levels of complexity but then

1801
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:04,140
again uh for simple linear systems such

1802
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:07,980
as I don't know many uh non non-complex

1803
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:11,820
systems uh it it doesn't have anything

1804
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:15,960
interesting to say so uh rather than

1805
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:19,199
being applicable to all of these systems

1806
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:23,280
the relevant questions should be uh if

1807
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:28,199
it I mean they're enough insights we can

1808
01:18:28,199 --> 01:18:32,760
gain from applying this notion to many

1809
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:35,300
different situations and

1810
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:39,260
systems so I believe uh

1811
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:40,980
Toby's

1812
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:45,060
um alternative for this problem uh by uh

1813
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:49,380
proposing the polynomial functor uh as a

1814
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:52,800
replacement for markup blanket uh can

1815
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,860
cover this line of criticism pretty

1816
01:18:55,860 --> 01:18:58,080
nicely it can address this criticism

1817
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:02,280
pretty nicely due to its uh abstractness

1818
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:06,060
and a kind of more rigorous way of

1819
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:10,440
talking about both the universality and

1820
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:15,480
the individuality of each system so uh I

1821
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:21,000
think that's an a nice way to at least a

1822
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,840
viable uh I mean answer to this question

1823
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:29,880
that needs a lot more consideration so

1824
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:31,980
that's my take on everything that's part

1825
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:34,159
of it

1826
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:35,640
okay

1827
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:38,760
and I'll I'll give my

1828
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:40,620
um take two

1829
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:42,719
which is

1830
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:45,600
the Markov blanket concept since the

1831
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:49,620
work of pearl in the 1990s is

1832
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:51,719
actually not doing that much

1833
01:19:51,719 --> 01:19:54,420
philosophical work in and of itself it

1834
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:56,820
just describes the parents the children

1835
01:19:56,820 --> 01:19:59,640
and the co-parents of Any Given node

1836
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:01,320
within a graph so first we're talking

1837
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:03,540
about maps not territories we're not

1838
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:04,800
talking about features of the world

1839
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,960
carving nature of the joints necessarily

1840
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:09,600
hashtag Mal Andrews we're talking about

1841
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:13,140
the Bayesian graph and secondly even on

1842
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:16,380
the graph it's not that a node is like

1843
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:19,020
by its Essence an internal state or a

1844
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:21,000
blanket state or an action state if you

1845
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,739
use the first blanket rather it's always

1846
01:20:22,739 --> 01:20:25,560
in relationship to others so the concept

1847
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:28,080
by itself does very little work however

1848
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,900
people have deployed the concept

1849
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:33,659
implicitly and explicitly

1850
01:20:33,659 --> 01:20:36,719
to describe interfaces of cybernetic

1851
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:39,600
entities the kinds of entities that it

1852
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,820
makes sense to describe as an active

1853
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:44,840
inference agent so we know from the

1854
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:48,480
particular physics and the strange kinds

1855
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:52,080
work the path integrals paper that we

1856
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:55,320
can describe using

1857
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:58,260
the formalism the Rocks the simple

1858
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:00,420
octave systems and the sophisticated

1859
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:03,380
active systems

1860
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:06,560
in order to have an interface concept

1861
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:10,679
that does Justice to on one hand the

1862
01:21:10,679 --> 01:21:14,159
relatively inert interfaces

1863
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:16,739
on the other hand potentially

1864
01:21:16,739 --> 01:21:19,080
extremely conditional or contextual

1865
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:22,040
interfaces

1866
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:26,159
just having

1867
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:29,940
some uh tagging system

1868
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:32,520
of nodes on a base graph is going to get

1869
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,920
extremely messy it's not that it

1870
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:36,600
couldn't be done but just in terms of

1871
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,820
actually doing the programming it's

1872
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:40,620
going to be extremely messy

1873
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:42,480
you're going to need to have a lot of

1874
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:45,600
accessory or auxiliary variables that

1875
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:46,980
indicate

1876
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:49,320
what the current interface is at this

1877
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:51,060
time or what it would be if this happens

1878
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:53,659
and all these kinds of conditionalities

1879
01:21:53,659 --> 01:21:57,840
would be like a less elegant way

1880
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:01,080
of describing what our category Theory

1881
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:02,580
colleagues have been developing

1882
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:05,219
explicitly with the wiring diagrams and

1883
01:22:05,219 --> 01:22:07,560
interfaces so just to kind of conclude

1884
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:10,080
there people draw the Bayesian graphs

1885
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,600
and the particular physics

1886
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:15,900
is using a Bayesian graph

1887
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:19,800
however Bayesian graphs don't naturally

1888
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:24,480
have a lot of these properties that were

1889
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,400
really

1890
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:29,400
um being conflated with interfaces more

1891
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:31,020
generally

1892
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:33,600
and by using an interface concept as

1893
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,340
Toby said at an intermediate level of

1894
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:37,739
abstraction that's slightly opinionated

1895
01:22:37,739 --> 01:22:39,860
but also really flexible

1896
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:42,780
that is kind of the right core screening

1897
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:45,060
the right optimal grasp

1898
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:47,760
on the interfaces that we actually want

1899
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,560
to talk about

1900
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:52,560
for active inference agents and again

1901
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:55,020
just trying to get down to the firmware

1902
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:57,719
with the Bayesian graph we're going to

1903
01:22:57,719 --> 01:22:59,460
get lost in the details and any

1904
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:01,560
accounting system that we develop is

1905
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,360
going to be ad hoc and certainly less

1906
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,699
principled or powerful than what the

1907
01:23:05,699 --> 01:23:09,199
category theorists are developing

1908
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:14,280
what you think of this

1909
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:15,900
if if we're talking about the

1910
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:19,739
relationship in in with the interface

1911
01:23:19,739 --> 01:23:21,000
could we

1912
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,880
could we see and I'm really asking this

1913
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:25,560
question I don't know I'm I'm

1914
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:28,800
spitballing could we see the mark off

1915
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:31,739
blanket as the more stabilized version

1916
01:23:31,739 --> 01:23:34,800
or form of the relationship and see the

1917
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,340
poly

1918
01:23:37,340 --> 01:23:41,400
no meal version of the of that is the

1919
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:43,739
search version of that relationship what

1920
01:23:43,739 --> 01:23:46,519
do you guys think of that

1921
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:52,800
I'm real and I'm really asking guess the

1922
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,900
first just listening to both of you talk

1923
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:57,600
here I'm just wondering if I'm having

1924
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,840
one of those unitary moments myself or

1925
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:05,600
if or if I'm way out to

1926
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:09,000
probably give a first first thought then

1927
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,179
I'll also give a speculative answer

1928
01:24:12,179 --> 01:24:15,659
uh yes so uh one thing that comes at

1929
01:24:15,659 --> 01:24:19,739
mind is you see sometimes

1930
01:24:19,739 --> 01:24:23,040
uh people consider markup blanket as

1931
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:26,520
being a kind of uh static boundary or

1932
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:30,600
interface uh that just separates uh the

1933
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:33,300
agent from its environment but uh

1934
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:35,940
actually what it really is is a kind of

1935
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:41,159
uh providing a really Dynamic uh

1936
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:43,860
interface between those two internal and

1937
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:46,920
external States so uh it's not a static

1938
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:50,280
or stabilized in any way but of course

1939
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:53,940
uh in some situations we treated uh as

1940
01:24:53,940 --> 01:24:56,699
if it's a stable or I don't know static

1941
01:24:56,699 --> 01:24:58,440
so

1942
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:02,820
um I mean coding Maxwell ramstead every

1943
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:05,520
theory of markup blanket is inherently

1944
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:08,940
perceptual so there isn't any I mean

1945
01:25:08,940 --> 01:25:11,940
static uh conception of markup blanket

1946
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:17,300
at all uh but on the other hand well

1947
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:20,640
obviously for the polynomial functor I

1948
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,800
mean not even not just polynomial

1949
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:27,060
functor but the whole area category

1950
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:31,440
Theory deals with objects not in their

1951
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:36,480
static sense but rather in their uh in

1952
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:38,460
the meaning they acquire through their

1953
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:41,520
relations through their morphisms and

1954
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:43,219
it's not about

1955
01:25:43,219 --> 01:25:45,960
so one of the main differences between

1956
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:49,080
category Theory and the set theory

1957
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:53,940
is exactly I mean hinges and that

1958
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:55,980
distinction between the static Viewpoint

1959
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:59,340
of mathematical or I don't know even

1960
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:02,760
non-mathematical objects and the the

1961
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:05,900
inherently dynamical or relational

1962
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:09,659
identity of the objects as defined in

1963
01:26:09,659 --> 01:26:12,719
categories so I believe polynomial

1964
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:17,600
functor functors uh Again by themselves

1965
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,280
are

1966
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:23,460
not are I mean inherently and

1967
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:27,199
intrinsically dynamical perceptual and

1968
01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:30,540
uh in in the terms of some Continental

1969
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:33,239
philosophers such as Alan Badu uh

1970
01:26:33,239 --> 01:26:36,960
they're they acquire existence through

1971
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:41,040
their imminent relations they don't uh

1972
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:45,120
they they don't need any uh I mean

1973
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:48,239
notion of pre-existence as uh some of

1974
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:50,880
the platonic Notions of mathematical

1975
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:55,139
objects and ideas uh so yes in this

1976
01:26:55,139 --> 01:27:00,900
sense I think a polynomial functors uh

1977
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:04,800
I'm not sure which one can be seen as I

1978
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:07,920
don't know more dynamic or perceptual

1979
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:11,940
than the other but uh at least to a

1980
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:14,400
degree both of those Concepts can be

1981
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:19,020
seen as sufficiently uh perceptual in my

1982
01:27:19,020 --> 01:27:21,179
view

1983
01:27:21,179 --> 01:27:23,639
awesome okay I'll just add with a few

1984
01:27:23,639 --> 01:27:26,880
other associative comments one is to

1985
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:28,800
blanket something is to dampen and

1986
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:32,040
stabilize it whereas polynomial seems to

1987
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:34,820
invoke like many names polynomos

1988
01:27:34,820 --> 01:27:37,920
polytopos so potentially there's a

1989
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,520
multiplicity in the polynomial

1990
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:44,699
that is not acknowledged uh so lexically

1991
01:27:44,699 --> 01:27:47,040
in the Markov blanket and then a more

1992
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:51,000
formal way to say that would be a Markov

1993
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,860
blanket might be like a specific

1994
01:27:52,860 --> 01:27:55,020
realization of some little neighborhood

1995
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:58,199
within the polynomial functor so the

1996
01:27:58,199 --> 01:27:59,940
polynomial functor is a generalization

1997
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:02,699
of the Markov blanket and so in that

1998
01:28:02,699 --> 01:28:05,340
sense it requires more searching

1999
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:08,280
and it is more abstract and it is more

2000
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:11,100
General but when you do stabilize it

2001
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:12,300
down

2002
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:13,800
then

2003
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:16,080
the Markov blanket formalism May

2004
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:18,120
absolutely apply

2005
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:20,340
but it will but wherever the Markov

2006
01:28:20,340 --> 01:28:22,920
blanket formalism does apply like let's

2007
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:24,600
just say that we stabilize down to a

2008
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:27,360
computer system and we have an API and

2009
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:28,560
we consider that that's one of our

2010
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:30,120
blanket States

2011
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:33,300
that would also be

2012
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:35,820
seen as an interface of course which is

2013
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:37,380
how people would talk about it and so it

2014
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:40,260
would be a polynomial functor

2015
01:28:40,260 --> 01:28:43,739
and so this helps us look back

2016
01:28:43,739 --> 01:28:46,260
at the literature

2017
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:50,100
and see as has been done many many times

2018
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:53,580
in fep and other literatures

2019
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:56,699
recent developments enable previous

2020
01:28:56,699 --> 01:28:59,040
developments not to be invalidated but

2021
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:01,580
understood as special cases or or

2022
01:29:01,580 --> 01:29:05,100
constrained or stabilized cases

2023
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:06,960
and it only makes sense that we would

2024
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:08,219
start

2025
01:29:08,219 --> 01:29:09,900
um

2026
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:11,639
well

2027
01:29:11,639 --> 01:29:14,280
putting aside what makes sense in active

2028
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:16,440
inference it seems that we are taking

2029
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:20,460
both paths in some cases leading with

2030
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:23,159
the stabilized and generalizing but in

2031
01:29:23,159 --> 01:29:25,860
other situations making unstable

2032
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:29,580
generalizations that then

2033
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:32,280
um precipitate stability

2034
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:35,360
inside of them

2035
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:39,620
so more bi-directionality

2036
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:45,780
great well

2037
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:47,880
we will have a

2038
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:50,880
54.3

2039
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:54,060
with the focus more on action are there

2040
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:56,580
any other topics

2041
01:29:56,580 --> 01:29:58,920
that you fellows would like to raise or

2042
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:00,840
if anyone in the chat wants to ask a

2043
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:03,480
question please go for it

2044
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:06,000
in our last bit here

2045
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,340
let's look back to the table of contents

2046
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:10,739
or Ali please go for it

2047
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:14,820
uh no just I wanted to ask Toby about uh

2048
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:16,199
the relation

2049
01:30:16,199 --> 01:30:18,080
um the relationship between

2050
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:21,540
uh his uh Theory or compositional

2051
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:24,860
account of uh statistical uh inference

2052
01:30:24,860 --> 01:30:29,460
as opposed to uh the uh the category

2053
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:33,179
theoretical account uh developed about I

2054
01:30:33,179 --> 01:30:35,280
don't know more than probably 10 years

2055
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:39,139
ago by people like Bob kirkey and others

2056
01:30:39,139 --> 01:30:42,420
uh specifically related to the

2057
01:30:42,420 --> 01:30:44,340
distinction between classical and

2058
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:48,300
non-classical uh Bayesian inference that

2059
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:52,560
that's been clearly uh distinguished in

2060
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:56,060
one of the papers from 20

2061
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:59,699
2011 I guess uh so yeah that's one

2062
01:30:59,699 --> 01:31:02,280
question I wanted to ask Toby and of

2063
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:05,400
course a subsequent question about the

2064
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:08,460
relation of this uh distinction slash

2065
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:12,060
non-distinction to the accounts of

2066
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:14,699
quantum fep because in Quantum fep

2067
01:31:14,699 --> 01:31:16,739
markup blanket

2068
01:31:16,739 --> 01:31:19,860
is kind of replace or rather blended

2069
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:23,340
with uh the notion of uh I mean

2070
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:27,300
holographic uh inner screen uh so how

2071
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:28,460
can we

2072
01:31:28,460 --> 01:31:32,340
how can we see uh Quantum fpp as

2073
01:31:32,340 --> 01:31:36,120
accounting as arising from uh Quantum

2074
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:40,440
bayesianism uh rather than from uh I

2075
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:42,960
don't know pretty predictive uh quantum

2076
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:45,960
theory and the relation between uh those

2077
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:49,219
two Frameworks of Bayesian inference to

2078
01:31:49,219 --> 01:31:52,940
to that topic

2079
01:31:53,639 --> 01:31:59,480
awesome yes the quantum category Theory

2080
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:04,080
active fep triangle

2081
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:08,760
um and also I think it's it's

2082
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:09,420
um

2083
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:12,960
the the question about reading the

2084
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:15,440
literature

2085
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:18,600
in terms of the interfaces between a

2086
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:20,580
work and the citations I think is

2087
01:32:20,580 --> 01:32:24,480
extremely rich it's a it's a really

2088
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:28,760
novel way to perform bibliographic

2089
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:32,060
meta-analysis but also just in our own

2090
01:32:32,060 --> 01:32:35,719
learning Journeys

2091
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:38,219
this um

2092
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:40,980
following this category Theory

2093
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:43,199
dictum of knowing a thing by its

2094
01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:45,420
relations

2095
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:47,940
understanding the paper within the web

2096
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:50,639
of the past papers which it cites all of

2097
01:32:50,639 --> 01:32:53,520
which are past and actual

2098
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:56,460
and then it's future time cone of

2099
01:32:56,460 --> 01:32:58,020
possible relationships to things that

2100
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:00,300
haven't happened yet the co-parents

2101
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:02,219
haven't even happened yet necessarily

2102
01:33:02,219 --> 01:33:05,040
but that becomes part of the evaluation

2103
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:07,560
of the significance in the moment

2104
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:09,960
and if we could

2105
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:11,940
have the right generative model and

2106
01:33:11,940 --> 01:33:13,860
understand how much attention to weight

2107
01:33:13,860 --> 01:33:15,600
onto different

2108
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:17,340
things in the moment

2109
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:19,199
that would be like being able to see the

2110
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:21,000
whole time cone

2111
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,219
at the right core screening but of

2112
01:33:23,219 --> 01:33:24,780
course it's limited in estimates we

2113
01:33:24,780 --> 01:33:28,020
can't do that but we have our rules our

2114
01:33:28,020 --> 01:33:30,300
heuristics and our approaches that that

2115
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:33,120
address that nonetheless

2116
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:34,860
um

2117
01:33:34,860 --> 01:33:37,500
anyone in the chat or Dean what would

2118
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:41,719
you like to explore in 54.3

2119
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:44,699
I'm just gonna

2120
01:33:44,699 --> 01:33:48,179
follow the two of you I got I got two

2121
01:33:48,179 --> 01:33:51,659
big uh workhorses here I just gotta get

2122
01:33:51,659 --> 01:33:55,040
out of the way so I don't get trampled

2123
01:33:56,659 --> 01:33:59,520
let's let's look at the the table of

2124
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:00,780
contents

2125
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:02,900
um

2126
01:34:03,179 --> 01:34:06,179
here we're just shifting to the um the

2127
01:34:06,179 --> 01:34:08,100
coda document the back end that we use

2128
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:11,820
to coordinate a lot of our work

2129
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:14,520
just so that it can all be seen in the

2130
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:17,000
in the video

2131
01:34:19,139 --> 01:34:22,520
chapter one is short

2132
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:27,120
chapter two if someone is looking for

2133
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:30,000
another account of like widest category

2134
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,340
Theory matter

2135
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:34,380
Toby begins chapter two with three

2136
01:34:34,380 --> 01:34:38,340
examples of situations neural circuits

2137
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:40,080
Bayesian networks and computations where

2138
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:42,120
people often just use a kind of

2139
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:44,100
schematic diagram

2140
01:34:44,100 --> 01:34:47,040
but it's not necessary or sufficient to

2141
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:50,219
really convey all of the

2142
01:34:50,219 --> 01:34:52,500
um richness that we can add on with

2143
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:55,460
category Theory

2144
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:01,080
chapter 3 starts getting into more

2145
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:03,780
detail with string diagrams

2146
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:06,360
and developing towards circuit diagrams

2147
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:10,199
in this rate coding neural setting

2148
01:35:10,199 --> 01:35:12,960
a lot more new vocabulary arising along

2149
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:15,239
the way

2150
01:35:15,239 --> 01:35:18,179
chapter four which the question the

2151
01:35:18,179 --> 01:35:20,940
beginning of this live stream brought a

2152
01:35:20,940 --> 01:35:24,719
focus to is on the compositional aspects

2153
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:26,699
of probability

2154
01:35:26,699 --> 01:35:30,060
the copy discard structure

2155
01:35:30,060 --> 01:35:32,639
is introduced which we saw in the

2156
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:34,620
diagram today that's when the piece of

2157
01:35:34,620 --> 01:35:36,179
information is duplicated and then one

2158
01:35:36,179 --> 01:35:39,020
of them can be thrown away

2159
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:42,300
Bayesian inversion the dagger

2160
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:44,460
Lady Macbeth stagger

2161
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:46,679
always just

2162
01:35:46,679 --> 01:35:48,480
dangling there

2163
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,760
then

2164
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:52,620
the growth in geek

2165
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:55,080
Construction

2166
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:58,260
bringing back strong

2167
01:35:58,260 --> 01:36:01,980
um recall of Shawna Dobson Chris Fields

2168
01:36:01,980 --> 01:36:03,480
math art

2169
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:07,280
and the complexity of the self

2170
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:09,500
foreign

2171
01:36:10,219 --> 01:36:14,699
went into dynamical systems

2172
01:36:14,699 --> 01:36:17,520
Markov chains

2173
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:18,960
um

2174
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:24,000
uh open and closed dynamical systems

2175
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,000
with this polynomial interface concept

2176
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,420
it's really built up in a

2177
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:34,380
extremely methodical way

2178
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:37,739
first the dynamical system is kept

2179
01:36:37,739 --> 01:36:39,679
within a nutshell

2180
01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:41,820
extremely bounded but then it's

2181
01:36:41,820 --> 01:36:44,280
progressively opened up and so even

2182
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:45,480
though it's

2183
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:46,620
um going to be a lot of new information

2184
01:36:46,620 --> 01:36:49,620
reading the dissertation it's done in a

2185
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:51,900
way that does also clearly build upon

2186
01:36:51,900 --> 01:36:53,159
itself

2187
01:36:53,159 --> 01:36:56,219
chapter six goes into the Bayesian

2188
01:36:56,219 --> 01:36:57,719
lenses

2189
01:36:57,719 --> 01:37:00,420
connects to several

2190
01:37:00,420 --> 01:37:03,420
more prevalent Concepts in statistics

2191
01:37:03,420 --> 01:37:04,980
maximum likelihood estimation

2192
01:37:04,980 --> 01:37:06,960
approximate Bayesian inference Auto

2193
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:08,940
encoders

2194
01:37:08,940 --> 01:37:12,000
um and connects this to the emerging

2195
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:15,179
concepts of Bayesian lenses and

2196
01:37:15,179 --> 01:37:16,800
statistical games

2197
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,960
in terms of the approximate inference

2198
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:21,960
doctrines in chapter seven yeah Ali

2199
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:22,920
please

2200
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:25,560
uh no I just wanted to mention uh this

2201
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:27,600
particular chapter is being Rewritten

2202
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:31,080
yet the moment so yeah that's the thank

2203
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:33,659
you absolutely yes as we discussed a

2204
01:37:33,659 --> 01:37:35,760
little earlier chapter six is gonna get

2205
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:37,500
simpler

2206
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:40,080
but better but it was tricky but it's

2207
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:42,179
simpler but it's better but it was

2208
01:37:42,179 --> 01:37:44,600
tricky

2209
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:47,580
and then chapter seven

2210
01:37:47,580 --> 01:37:49,980
closes it out but really opens it up

2211
01:37:49,980 --> 01:37:52,679
with the compositional cognitive

2212
01:37:52,679 --> 01:37:55,980
cartography sailing the three C's

2213
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:59,760
Society of systems more alliteration

2214
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:02,699
many many connections to

2215
01:38:02,699 --> 01:38:05,159
areas of interest for all system

2216
01:38:05,159 --> 01:38:08,520
scientists and complexity enthusiasts

2217
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:11,120
so

2218
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,699
what a tour de force

2219
01:38:14,699 --> 01:38:18,540
and a a journey and it it's going to be

2220
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:21,960
awesome that we'll get to see

2221
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:25,679
some of the next increments in the work

2222
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:29,639
talk more with Toby yes Dean

2223
01:38:29,639 --> 01:38:32,400
can I can I just throw this in and it's

2224
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:33,420
it's gonna

2225
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:37,080
indicate how old I am but

2226
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:40,440
a long time ago the first time a needle

2227
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:45,000
dropped on the first Van Halen album

2228
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,280
something changed about

2229
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:49,080
everything that we thought about guitar

2230
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:50,280
playing

2231
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:51,960
and if you weren't there in that moment

2232
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:53,159
you you

2233
01:38:53,159 --> 01:38:56,760
wouldn't know how everything changed I'm

2234
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:59,880
not sure what category Theory

2235
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:03,659
taken up on a mass scale will do if it

2236
01:39:03,659 --> 01:39:05,400
will be the equivalent

2237
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:08,460
moment for all

2238
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:11,340
people who use math

2239
01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:13,800
um in in all the different ways that

2240
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:17,400
they use it but I think

2241
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:19,260
that we are at the beginning of

2242
01:39:19,260 --> 01:39:20,699
something

2243
01:39:20,699 --> 01:39:24,360
that is it is going to change things and

2244
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:26,100
I don't know exactly how it's going to

2245
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:28,860
change things but there will always I

2246
01:39:28,860 --> 01:39:31,920
think this will always now

2247
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:37,620
be included as how we try to both figure

2248
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:41,460
things out and out the figures in that

2249
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:43,020
three-dimensional space I mean one of

2250
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:43,860
the things that I thought was

2251
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:45,960
interesting in the dot one was when Toby

2252
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:49,920
said well I work in in 2D space and I'm

2253
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:51,840
now I'm curious about I wonder what that

2254
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:55,139
would look like in in the 3D well we

2255
01:39:55,139 --> 01:39:57,600
exist in a 3D space and so the I think

2256
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:00,060
the applicability of it is going off at

2257
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:02,580
any given moment so but I do really

2258
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:05,639
think this is the start of something

2259
01:40:05,639 --> 01:40:08,639
um I'm not I'm not sure exactly what

2260
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:10,679
but I don't think it's I don't think

2261
01:40:10,679 --> 01:40:13,199
we'll be able to unlearn this I think

2262
01:40:13,199 --> 01:40:14,940
it's going to remain influential for a

2263
01:40:14,940 --> 01:40:16,020
long time

2264
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:17,639
so

2265
01:40:17,639 --> 01:40:20,760
For Those About to categorify We Salute

2266
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:22,400
You

2267
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:27,199
yeah right there we go thank you

2268
01:40:27,199 --> 01:40:31,159
you can always make it better

2269
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:38,360
any other thoughts on this otherwise

2270
01:40:41,699 --> 01:40:43,020
great

2271
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:46,800
yeah Ali please with any last thoughts

2272
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:48,780
uh no I just wanted to say I'm really

2273
01:40:48,780 --> 01:40:50,340
looking forward for the next

2274
01:40:50,340 --> 01:40:52,560
installments I hope it happens soon

2275
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:57,360
because uh again I have so many burning

2276
01:40:57,360 --> 01:41:01,320
questions I I try to uh I mean Whittle

2277
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:05,219
it down to some uh I don't know not too

2278
01:41:05,219 --> 01:41:08,100
much time consuming questions but uh

2279
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:10,260
yeah I'm really interested in

2280
01:41:10,260 --> 01:41:14,159
um I'm curious to know uh Toby's answers

2281
01:41:14,159 --> 01:41:16,739
to them so thank you so much for

2282
01:41:16,739 --> 01:41:18,600
everything for organizing this and

2283
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:20,159
inviting to me

2284
01:41:20,159 --> 01:41:22,800
oh absolutely

2285
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:26,460
all right thank you everybody see you in

2286
01:41:26,460 --> 01:41:29,420
54.3
