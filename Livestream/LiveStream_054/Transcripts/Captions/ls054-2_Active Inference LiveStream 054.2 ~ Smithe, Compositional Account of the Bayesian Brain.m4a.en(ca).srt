16
00:00:42,466 --> 00:00:44,892
participating in Live Streams and other

17
00:00:44,946 --> 00:00:48,492
projects. All right, we're in

18
00:00:48,626 --> 00:00:51,852
Live stream 54.2. Continuing with our

19
00:00:51,906 --> 00:00:54,240
third discussion on the work,

20
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,888
mathematical foundations for a

21
00:00:55,894 --> 00:00:57,804
compositional account of the Bayesian

22
00:00:57,852 --> 00:01:01,552
brain, we're back with Dean Ali and

23
00:01:01,606 --> 00:01:05,244
Toby. So if each want to

24
00:01:05,382 --> 00:01:08,580
say hello and anything to begin with

25
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:12,868
otherwise, Ali has some questions ready

26
00:01:13,034 --> 00:01:15,332
and we have some questions that people

27
00:01:15,386 --> 00:01:17,904
have submitted in the meantime as well.

28
00:01:18,042 --> 00:01:21,144
So shall we just proceed to the

29
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:23,144
questions as we have the same people as

30
00:01:23,182 --> 00:01:26,008
dot one? Great. Okay,

31
00:01:26,174 --> 00:01:27,832
I'm going to jump into some of the

32
00:01:27,886 --> 00:01:33,484
presubmitted questions. So would

33
00:01:33,522 --> 00:01:36,460
it be correct to call equation 4.2

34
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,244
compositional Bayes theorem, which is or

35
00:01:39,282 --> 00:01:42,700
are Bayes's theorem categorically?

36
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,072
And we have the document ready or

37
00:01:47,126 --> 00:01:49,024
anything that you want to share, but

38
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:51,088
what does it mean for Bayes theorem to

39
00:01:51,094 --> 00:01:53,648
be categorified? And where is that in

40
00:01:53,654 --> 00:01:56,428
the dissertation? Yeah, okay, so that's

41
00:01:56,444 --> 00:01:59,730
a nice question. I would say that

42
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:06,176
equation 4.2 is

43
00:02:06,198 --> 00:02:08,408
like a sort of basic is like a sort of

44
00:02:08,414 --> 00:02:11,592
it's like a basic representation of the

45
00:02:11,646 --> 00:02:14,440
product law of probability theory.

46
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,400
And so I wouldn't say it's particularly

47
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,784
inherently compositional. It's just

48
00:02:19,822 --> 00:02:22,004
something that is just like an axiom

49
00:02:22,052 --> 00:02:23,996
that is just like a consequence of the

50
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,720
sort of standard axioms of probability

51
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,044
theory. The thing that makes it a little

52
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:30,616
bit different from the way that it's

53
00:02:30,648 --> 00:02:33,964
normally written in probability theory

54
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:36,992
is that I've kind of annotated those P

55
00:02:37,046 --> 00:02:38,908
symbols which represent the probability

56
00:02:39,004 --> 00:02:41,536
of a certain event. I've annotated them

57
00:02:41,558 --> 00:02:44,544
each with a subscript, and that

58
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:47,924
subscript represents where the

59
00:02:47,962 --> 00:02:50,004
probability is coming from or the

60
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:52,976
probability according to whom. That's

61
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:56,068
kind of how you can think of it. And so

62
00:02:56,154 --> 00:02:58,472
normally I find this kind of like P

63
00:02:58,526 --> 00:03:01,076
notation to be a little bit confusing

64
00:03:01,268 --> 00:03:05,064
because people often write P of B

65
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:09,272
given A, and they also write like P of X

66
00:03:09,326 --> 00:03:12,664
given Y or like P of W comma

67
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:16,364
a comma z. And so in each of those

68
00:03:16,402 --> 00:03:20,364
cases, the sort of content of the P is

69
00:03:20,402 --> 00:03:22,300
kind of different. Like the A and the B

70
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:26,064
might be events of a different kind

71
00:03:26,182 --> 00:03:29,264
to X and Y, and yet they're all put into

72
00:03:29,302 --> 00:03:32,770
this P symbol, whereas in this case,

73
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,924
with the annotations, it says, like, as

74
00:03:35,962 --> 00:03:39,620
I say, it says according to what? And so

75
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,380
here the little subscript C represents

76
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,152
what's typically called in

77
00:03:48,206 --> 00:03:50,632
compositional probability theory like a

78
00:03:50,686 --> 00:03:54,792
channel or a kernel. But that

79
00:03:54,926 --> 00:03:56,984
is like a kind of abstract way of just

80
00:03:57,022 --> 00:03:58,596
saying conditional probability

81
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,480
distribution. And so the little C means

82
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,820
it's a conditional probability

83
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,180
distribution from space

84
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,364
X to Y, a space Y. And here

85
00:04:10,402 --> 00:04:14,176
I'm thinking of the B as being an

86
00:04:14,198 --> 00:04:17,504
event of type Y and A as being an event

87
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:20,944
of type A, sorry, of type x. And so the

88
00:04:20,982 --> 00:04:23,856
PC says it's the probability of the

89
00:04:23,878 --> 00:04:26,932
event B of

90
00:04:26,986 --> 00:04:31,204
type Y given the event A

91
00:04:31,242 --> 00:04:34,036
of type x. And so that means that when

92
00:04:34,058 --> 00:04:37,284
you plug these kind of flows of

93
00:04:37,322 --> 00:04:39,544
information together, you make sure the

94
00:04:39,582 --> 00:04:41,800
types match. It's kind of like working

95
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,316
with a strongly typed programming

96
00:04:43,348 --> 00:04:46,584
language. So that type information is

97
00:04:46,622 --> 00:04:48,296
like the main thing that's different

98
00:04:48,398 --> 00:04:51,192
between this and the standard product

99
00:04:51,246 --> 00:04:53,212
rule of probability and it's from that

100
00:04:53,266 --> 00:04:54,844
product rule of probability theory that

101
00:04:54,882 --> 00:04:56,584
you can just write down Bayes theorem,

102
00:04:56,632 --> 00:04:59,150
which is the equation 4.3.

103
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,904
I would say that the reason

104
00:05:04,022 --> 00:05:08,092
why I slightly hesitate to call equation

105
00:05:08,156 --> 00:05:10,672
4.3 like a sort of abstract or

106
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:13,468
categorical version of Bayes theorem,

107
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:16,640
even though it's annotated by these

108
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,924
channels, is because you have

109
00:05:19,962 --> 00:05:22,992
this division. And that division isn't

110
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:26,484
something that's well defined in all

111
00:05:26,522 --> 00:05:29,496
categories, in all situations that you

112
00:05:29,518 --> 00:05:32,196
might want to consider probability

113
00:05:32,308 --> 00:05:35,576
theory. For instance, you might have

114
00:05:35,758 --> 00:05:39,012
this P of C dot

115
00:05:39,076 --> 00:05:42,588
pi thing and that means the kind of Y

116
00:05:42,674 --> 00:05:45,260
marginal of the joint distribution or

117
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,110
it's otherwise known as the push forward

118
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,164
of the distribution pi through the

119
00:05:53,202 --> 00:05:57,036
channel C. That thing might have what's

120
00:05:57,068 --> 00:05:59,376
known as measure zero, which means the

121
00:05:59,398 --> 00:06:00,896
probability might be zero. And so the

122
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:02,864
division isn't very well defined and so

123
00:06:02,982 --> 00:06:04,752
that expression doesn't always make

124
00:06:04,806 --> 00:06:08,564
sense. Now the thing that

125
00:06:08,762 --> 00:06:11,220
does always make sense on the other hand

126
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:14,836
is that just product law equation which

127
00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:17,600
tells you how the two ways you can write

128
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,568
down this joint distribution. So if you

129
00:06:20,574 --> 00:06:23,816
have a joint distribution like on the

130
00:06:23,838 --> 00:06:26,810
space x times y, I've written it there,

131
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,168
then you can decompose it into a prior

132
00:06:32,344 --> 00:06:35,580
on x and a channel from x to y.

133
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:39,116
So that then if you put the

134
00:06:39,138 --> 00:06:42,284
information from the prior through the

135
00:06:42,322 --> 00:06:45,056
channel you get the marginal on y and

136
00:06:45,078 --> 00:06:48,304
that's that push forward thing. Or you

137
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:52,672
could write the joint distribution as a

138
00:06:52,726 --> 00:06:55,900
prior on Y and a

139
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,420
conditional distribution from Y to x.

140
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,208
And the thing is, obviously we're

141
00:07:00,224 --> 00:07:01,344
talking about the same joint

142
00:07:01,392 --> 00:07:03,604
distribution in both cases. So those two

143
00:07:03,642 --> 00:07:06,244
decompositions, they're sometimes called

144
00:07:06,282 --> 00:07:08,072
disintegrations, those two

145
00:07:08,126 --> 00:07:11,208
disintegrations need to be equal and

146
00:07:11,294 --> 00:07:13,530
that's what that equation is saying.

147
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,084
So that's kind of because it doesn't

148
00:07:16,132 --> 00:07:19,416
have this division in it and because

149
00:07:19,518 --> 00:07:22,092
Bayes'law follows from it and because

150
00:07:22,146 --> 00:07:24,044
it's something you can write down in all

151
00:07:24,082 --> 00:07:26,140
settings, it's kind of more fundamental.

152
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,224
But I quite like the kind of string

153
00:07:29,272 --> 00:07:32,844
diagrammatic form of it which

154
00:07:32,882 --> 00:07:35,872
is something that is drawn. It's not my

155
00:07:35,926 --> 00:07:38,016
invention. I think I originally saw it

156
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:41,616
in a paper by Bart Jakobs and I

157
00:07:41,638 --> 00:07:43,836
think his student at the time, Kenta

158
00:07:43,868 --> 00:07:45,910
Cho. So in,

159
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,556
let's see equation 4.5

160
00:07:51,658 --> 00:07:55,268
so that's section 4.1.2

161
00:07:55,354 --> 00:07:59,160
on abstract Bayesian inversion.

162
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,176
So yeah, if you scroll down a little,

163
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:07,944
it's on like page 130 or

164
00:08:08,062 --> 00:08:10,100
130 in my version, which might be

165
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,804
hopefully around the same place in your

166
00:08:11,842 --> 00:08:12,540
version.

167
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,460
Yeah, a little further.

168
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,536
Oh man, no, maybe not. Let me get up the

169
00:08:24,558 --> 00:08:26,436
version on because I've realized I've

170
00:08:26,468 --> 00:08:27,960
opened the wrong version.

171
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:40,252
Meanwhile, see it so

172
00:08:40,306 --> 00:08:42,864
so the the thing I'm going for here is

173
00:08:42,902 --> 00:08:44,684
the sort of, as I say, the string

174
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,552
diagrammatic depiction. Yes.

175
00:08:47,606 --> 00:08:51,170
4.1.2, it's page 120. Sorry about that.

176
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,796
Yeah, so it kind of shows you how the

177
00:08:57,818 --> 00:09:02,068
information flows. And so this

178
00:09:02,154 --> 00:09:06,040
makes the two processes

179
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,112
quite explicit. So here on the left,

180
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,784
the prior of the joint distribution is

181
00:09:11,822 --> 00:09:15,496
pi. And then you take the sort

182
00:09:15,518 --> 00:09:17,812
of probability, the information from pi

183
00:09:17,876 --> 00:09:19,988
and you copy it and you keep one of the

184
00:09:20,014 --> 00:09:21,484
copies and that gives you your X

185
00:09:21,522 --> 00:09:23,724
marginal. And then you feed the other

186
00:09:23,762 --> 00:09:26,156
one through the likelihood or the

187
00:09:26,178 --> 00:09:28,636
conditional channel C, and that gives

188
00:09:28,658 --> 00:09:31,616
you the other marginal. And so if you

189
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:35,104
throw away this X information, you get

190
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:36,624
the Y marginal. And that's what

191
00:09:36,662 --> 00:09:39,792
marginalization is. And that's why the Y

192
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:41,904
marginal, if you look on the right hand

193
00:09:41,942 --> 00:09:44,900
side, the prior is C after pi,

194
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,892
that's the Y marginal. So this is like

195
00:09:49,946 --> 00:09:53,364
depicting that Product Law. And then you

196
00:09:53,402 --> 00:09:57,416
say you can call something

197
00:09:57,518 --> 00:10:00,612
a Bayesian inversion of C with respect

198
00:10:00,676 --> 00:10:04,312
to the prior pi if it is

199
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:07,148
something that can go in the box on the

200
00:10:07,154 --> 00:10:08,604
right hand side where I've written C

201
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:11,004
dagger pi. And the reason I've used this

202
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:14,510
dagger symbol is because under certain

203
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,584
technical conditions, this Bayesian

204
00:10:18,632 --> 00:10:20,216
inversion thing gives you what's known

205
00:10:20,248 --> 00:10:23,390
in category theory as a dagger function.

206
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,056
And that's something that swaps the

207
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:30,256
direction of a morphism. And so here

208
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:32,096
you've taken the thing that goes from X

209
00:10:32,118 --> 00:10:33,636
to Y and you've swapped it and it goes

210
00:10:33,658 --> 00:10:36,276
from Y to X, but it depends on the

211
00:10:36,298 --> 00:10:37,764
prior. And so I've written this little

212
00:10:37,882 --> 00:10:40,420
subscript and so for me, this picture.

213
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,012
It'S. Kind of equivalent to that Product

214
00:10:45,066 --> 00:10:50,804
Law equation 4.2. But I think although

215
00:10:50,852 --> 00:10:52,536
it's a kind of new kind of language, I

216
00:10:52,558 --> 00:10:55,064
think it's a kind of more intuitive one

217
00:10:55,102 --> 00:10:56,376
because you can sort of see how the

218
00:10:56,398 --> 00:10:58,844
information flows through the system.

219
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:00,910
Sorry, that was a bit of a long answer,

220
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,116
but I think that's how I think of

221
00:11:05,138 --> 00:11:07,870
it. Great. Okay,

222
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,208
next question. Could be a short one.

223
00:11:12,374 --> 00:11:14,524
I'm mostly wondering about how chapter

224
00:11:14,572 --> 00:11:17,520
six will be rewritten. Will it be major?

225
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,824
And when we promise we didn't write this

226
00:11:19,862 --> 00:11:22,244
question primarily to select the best

227
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:25,104
policy as to where to direct my regime

228
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,844
of attention? Like, should I wait to dig

229
00:11:27,882 --> 00:11:29,844
deeper into chapter six until the

230
00:11:29,882 --> 00:11:32,564
updated observations arrive? Is

231
00:11:32,602 --> 00:11:35,956
reflecting deeply up until chapter five

232
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:37,464
where I should focus for now? Or is

233
00:11:37,502 --> 00:11:38,904
chapter six something that won't change

234
00:11:38,942 --> 00:11:41,240
too much? And I can still explore that

235
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,810
next week. So this is a great question.

236
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,756
And I'm sorry that the

237
00:11:49,778 --> 00:11:52,364
rewritten version isn't online yet, but

238
00:11:52,402 --> 00:11:55,660
it is really close, I promise. And I am

239
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,980
kind of aiming for it to be done like

240
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,312
next week or maybe let's not hold myself

241
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,176
hostage to fortune. So let's call it the

242
00:12:02,198 --> 00:12:07,036
next couple of weeks. But it's

243
00:12:07,068 --> 00:12:11,036
quite a change in the sense that it's

244
00:12:11,068 --> 00:12:12,624
kind of annoying because it's simpler

245
00:12:12,672 --> 00:12:15,140
but also kind of more structured.

246
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,108
And so that means that there were a

247
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:22,580
lot of finicky details that

248
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:26,548
I didn't anticipate needing

249
00:12:26,564 --> 00:12:28,728
to deal with, that I had to deal with,

250
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:32,452
even though fundamentally the basic

251
00:12:32,516 --> 00:12:35,752
idea is kind of the same but

252
00:12:35,806 --> 00:12:38,364
also neater and simpler at the same

253
00:12:38,402 --> 00:12:38,990
time.

254
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,484
I can go into some details about

255
00:12:45,602 --> 00:12:48,284
the differences if you'd like, or I can

256
00:12:48,322 --> 00:12:50,556
just leave it at that. What would you

257
00:12:50,578 --> 00:12:52,680
rather? Let's return to this in the

258
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,360
three. Okay, yeah, let's do that.

259
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,456
That's a nice idea. So, yeah, I would

260
00:12:57,478 --> 00:13:00,256
say don't dig too deeply into it,

261
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:02,844
because basically the thing that I've

262
00:13:02,892 --> 00:13:04,944
managed to do away with and sorry for

263
00:13:04,982 --> 00:13:06,436
all the people who've kind of tried to

264
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,884
bang their heads on it already, is. The

265
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:11,716
kind of pro functor, like optics. Kind

266
00:13:11,738 --> 00:13:13,572
of like the sort of pro functor stuff

267
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:17,496
with those weird coen things, the kind

268
00:13:17,518 --> 00:13:21,320
of integral symbols that I was using

269
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:25,160
to define context for statistical games,

270
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,288
that whole thing. It turns out you don't

271
00:13:29,304 --> 00:13:31,164
actually need the complexity of that

272
00:13:31,202 --> 00:13:35,100
structure. And the notion of context

273
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,780
is really given just by two things.

274
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,796
It's really just the prior, which we've

275
00:13:40,828 --> 00:13:43,584
already talked about, and also the

276
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:44,896
observation you take from the

277
00:13:44,918 --> 00:13:49,024
environment. And so before I thought you

278
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:51,424
needed to consider not just the

279
00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:54,964
observation, but also the stuff

280
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:57,248
that might go on in the environment

281
00:13:57,344 --> 00:14:00,884
around the observation that gives you

282
00:14:00,922 --> 00:14:03,364
correlations. But it turns out actually

283
00:14:03,402 --> 00:14:04,756
you don't need that, at least not for

284
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:08,376
the free energy principle. And so that

285
00:14:08,398 --> 00:14:09,928
makes things a bit simpler because you

286
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:12,200
don't need that kind of weird structure.

287
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,212
But there's, as I say, some technical

288
00:14:16,276 --> 00:14:18,444
stuff which is very annoying, which made

289
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:22,136
it also a little bit slightly

290
00:14:22,168 --> 00:14:26,124
annoying to write down and involved by

291
00:14:26,162 --> 00:14:29,592
categories and sorry about that. But

292
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:32,656
it's actually the fundamental idea of a

293
00:14:32,678 --> 00:14:36,176
statistical game being like a

294
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:39,584
Bayesian lens which describes the

295
00:14:39,622 --> 00:14:43,236
inference process, maybe like a

296
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:45,456
parameterized Bayesian lens that allows

297
00:14:45,488 --> 00:14:48,564
you to learn, but a Bayesian lens that

298
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:52,176
comes with a loss function that's

299
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:56,024
still the same idea. And it turns out

300
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,804
that loss functions like the relative

301
00:14:58,852 --> 00:15:02,056
entropy and the free energy, they

302
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:04,004
actually have a really neat categorical

303
00:15:04,052 --> 00:15:05,560
structure. So the things I was calling

304
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:09,050
like free energy games before or

305
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,556
Bayesian inference games, those are

306
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,748
actually now a lot even neater still.

307
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:16,510
So that's really nice.

308
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,152
And the way you get predictive coding is

309
00:15:21,206 --> 00:15:24,848
still as like a functor from these

310
00:15:24,934 --> 00:15:28,396
statistical games to dynamical systems.

311
00:15:28,508 --> 00:15:31,356
So that idea is still the same. It's

312
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,524
just actually it turned out that the

313
00:15:33,562 --> 00:15:36,404
statistical games themselves. There was

314
00:15:36,442 --> 00:15:38,884
actually a lot more nice stuff going on

315
00:15:38,922 --> 00:15:40,790
there than I had realized before.

316
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,830
Awesome. All right.

317
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,780
You cite Erisman and Van Bermesh work

318
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,376
on memory evolution systems. To what

319
00:15:54,398 --> 00:15:56,056
extent have you used their work in the

320
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:57,816
thesis? Would it be correct to say that

321
00:15:57,838 --> 00:15:59,724
there might exist a functor from that

322
00:15:59,762 --> 00:16:03,404
book to your dissertation or indeed to

323
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:05,532
any of your citations, is there work

324
00:16:05,586 --> 00:16:07,836
someone could do to explore the

325
00:16:07,858 --> 00:16:10,476
connection between the two? To me, this

326
00:16:10,498 --> 00:16:13,696
is a question of one instance if a

327
00:16:13,718 --> 00:16:15,916
learner or researcher performs active

328
00:16:15,948 --> 00:16:17,936
inference on the interface between a

329
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,868
work and a citation more generally?

330
00:16:19,964 --> 00:16:22,128
Great question. Yeah, I think it's a

331
00:16:22,134 --> 00:16:25,990
really nice so I I read

332
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,030
this work by Erisman of Rambamish on

333
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,476
memory reevoltative systems a

334
00:16:35,498 --> 00:16:37,624
few years ago, and I found it very

335
00:16:37,822 --> 00:16:41,048
abstract and confusing. And I was like,

336
00:16:41,054 --> 00:16:43,256
yeah, this is all really nice, but how

337
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:45,812
does it actually connect to the brain

338
00:16:45,876 --> 00:16:48,350
and how things like brains work?

339
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,316
But I've kind of softened my stance on

340
00:16:54,338 --> 00:16:55,820
it recently, and I think actually

341
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:59,480
there's some really cool stuff in that

342
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,088
work, some really great ideas about

343
00:17:03,174 --> 00:17:05,520
hierarchical complex systems and

344
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:09,264
emergence and even things

345
00:17:09,302 --> 00:17:12,816
like neural coding. It's kind

346
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:15,396
of, I think, slightly in danger, I

347
00:17:15,418 --> 00:17:18,292
think, of being forgotten because people

348
00:17:18,426 --> 00:17:20,724
see it and think, okay, well, how does

349
00:17:20,762 --> 00:17:22,756
it actually make contact with things I

350
00:17:22,778 --> 00:17:25,912
know about now, things that actually

351
00:17:25,966 --> 00:17:29,496
scientists use? And so I

352
00:17:29,518 --> 00:17:32,664
think it would be great to explore the

353
00:17:32,702 --> 00:17:35,764
connections in a kind of more detailed

354
00:17:35,812 --> 00:17:39,324
way. I don't know precisely what that

355
00:17:39,362 --> 00:17:43,228
would look like. I heard a talk,

356
00:17:43,314 --> 00:17:49,756
actually, by don't

357
00:17:49,788 --> 00:17:52,816
know. There may be some on YouTube, I

358
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:56,780
don't know. This was in Consciousness

359
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,928
Maths of Consciousness like workshop at

360
00:18:00,934 --> 00:18:04,848
the end of April, and she explained

361
00:18:04,944 --> 00:18:07,568
some of the more recent stuff they'd

362
00:18:07,584 --> 00:18:09,910
been doing, and it sounded like actually

363
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,712
there is a proof, I think, that Hebian

364
00:18:13,776 --> 00:18:18,776
learning does actually give you sort

365
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:21,160
of what she calls cat neurons.

366
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,792
And so before I've been like, okay,

367
00:18:24,846 --> 00:18:28,696
well, it's a nice story, but does

368
00:18:28,718 --> 00:18:30,528
it actually relate to things like heavy

369
00:18:30,564 --> 00:18:32,540
learning, or is it just like an analogy?

370
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,548
But it sounds like it's actually a bit

371
00:18:35,554 --> 00:18:37,644
more precise than I had thought. And

372
00:18:37,682 --> 00:18:39,192
obviously, because of the connection

373
00:18:39,256 --> 00:18:41,328
between things like heavy and learning

374
00:18:41,494 --> 00:18:44,672
and predictive coding, it sounds

375
00:18:44,726 --> 00:18:48,380
like there should be a way to relate

376
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,480
something like predictive coding to

377
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,736
memory evolutive systems. And that would

378
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:56,164
be really nice because I sometimes think

379
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:57,908
about this is kind of a direction that

380
00:18:57,914 --> 00:19:00,116
I'm trying to go in slightly, but try to

381
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:03,584
think about nested active inference

382
00:19:03,632 --> 00:19:06,504
systems. Like, you might have a little

383
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:08,484
region of the brain and all the cells

384
00:19:08,532 --> 00:19:12,120
are doing active inference, and the

385
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,184
circuits do predictive coding, and they

386
00:19:14,222 --> 00:19:16,804
make up a brain and the brains make up

387
00:19:16,942 --> 00:19:20,396
society and an organization. And that

388
00:19:20,578 --> 00:19:24,520
story of hierarchical complex systems

389
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,284
is really the story that this

390
00:19:28,322 --> 00:19:31,776
work is trying to tell as well. Just in

391
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:33,650
a different kind of way. And so I think

392
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,408
it's a really fruitful area, and I

393
00:19:37,414 --> 00:19:39,890
really hope somebody does dig into it,

394
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,216
because I think it's great work, and I

395
00:19:43,238 --> 00:19:44,916
think it's just work that was kind of

396
00:19:44,938 --> 00:19:46,516
maybe ahead of its time, so it kind of

397
00:19:46,538 --> 00:19:49,924
got left by the wayside maybe a little

398
00:19:49,962 --> 00:19:51,910
bit. But I'm really glad to see somebody

399
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,824
ask about it now. Cool. Just one

400
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,532
short remark on this, and then alir

401
00:19:58,596 --> 00:20:00,632
Dean, please. It's almost like when

402
00:20:00,686 --> 00:20:03,348
people draw associations,

403
00:20:03,524 --> 00:20:05,864
like a line of sight. Oh, well,

404
00:20:05,982 --> 00:20:07,740
emergence is like this. It's like

405
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:11,708
they're surveying and can have quite far

406
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:14,684
vision. But category theory is like

407
00:20:14,722 --> 00:20:17,096
building the high speed rail where it's,

408
00:20:17,128 --> 00:20:19,864
like, locked in. And then we can say

409
00:20:20,002 --> 00:20:21,904
there really is a relationship of this

410
00:20:21,942 --> 00:20:24,684
exact formal type between Hebian

411
00:20:24,732 --> 00:20:26,508
learning and predictive coding. Let's

412
00:20:26,524 --> 00:20:29,936
just say some type so then that

413
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:33,268
can be really relied on as a

414
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:35,796
foundational building block. And it kind

415
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:39,284
of brings those

416
00:20:39,402 --> 00:20:42,564
literatures and merges those streams or

417
00:20:42,602 --> 00:20:44,804
at least adjoins the streams or

418
00:20:44,922 --> 00:20:46,548
naturally transforms the streams, or

419
00:20:46,554 --> 00:20:48,240
whatever the appropriate terminology

420
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,096
would be, but in a really solid way

421
00:20:51,198 --> 00:20:52,664
that's not just like, well, one person

422
00:20:52,702 --> 00:20:54,776
on a mountaintop saw that these two

423
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:56,536
things could be connected. It's more

424
00:20:56,558 --> 00:20:58,284
like an engineering project that really

425
00:20:58,322 --> 00:21:01,244
locks it in for everybody. Yeah, I think

426
00:21:01,282 --> 00:21:04,604
so. And I hope people are

427
00:21:04,642 --> 00:21:06,876
incentivized to do that engineering. I

428
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:09,744
think that'd be great. All right, last

429
00:21:09,782 --> 00:21:12,130
of the presubmitted questions.

430
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:17,164
So, in the par, pazulo and Friston

431
00:21:17,212 --> 00:21:19,920
2022 active inference textbook,

432
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,964
the first question in the recipe for

433
00:21:23,002 --> 00:21:24,884
designing an active inference model this

434
00:21:24,922 --> 00:21:28,196
is chapter six is which system?

435
00:21:28,378 --> 00:21:30,820
This entails three pieces of data one,

436
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,188
the agent generative model, two, the

437
00:21:33,194 --> 00:21:35,304
interface sensory data and actions, and

438
00:21:35,342 --> 00:21:37,176
three, the external environment, the

439
00:21:37,198 --> 00:21:39,960
generative process. So how do these

440
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:44,920
relevant big chunks of notions from

441
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,756
the recipe for making an active

442
00:21:46,788 --> 00:21:50,396
inference model in the par at

443
00:21:50,418 --> 00:21:52,876
all textbook map to the sections of what

444
00:21:52,898 --> 00:21:54,620
you've done in your dissertation?

445
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,324
That's a nice question. And it takes me

446
00:21:57,362 --> 00:22:01,740
on to a question of action

447
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,808
and active inference beyond the sort of

448
00:22:03,814 --> 00:22:05,760
approximate inference that I was talking

449
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:08,800
about in my thesis, predominantly.

450
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,696
Maybe here I could draw some stuff, and

451
00:22:11,718 --> 00:22:13,236
so I don't know how easy that is for

452
00:22:13,258 --> 00:22:16,164
you, but I can share my screen. Yes.

453
00:22:16,362 --> 00:22:18,470
Let's see how this will work.

454
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,230
Yeah. Okay. Share.

455
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,508
All right. Can you see my cursor thingy?

456
00:22:29,604 --> 00:22:31,850
Yeah. Okay, cool.

457
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,276
So I like to draw this picture, and this

458
00:22:37,298 --> 00:22:39,324
is like, the little channel c, which

459
00:22:39,362 --> 00:22:42,796
does prediction, and it goes

460
00:22:42,898 --> 00:22:45,660
from here, and it goes outwards.

461
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,652
And this is the inversion,

462
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:52,032
the approximate inversion, and it takes

463
00:22:52,086 --> 00:22:54,928
in, like, a prior, which comes from

464
00:22:55,014 --> 00:22:58,780
here, and it takes in an observation.

465
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:04,036
So we could think of this as, like this

466
00:23:04,058 --> 00:23:09,220
is, like, high level belief

467
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,230
and, like, lower level.

468
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:19,466
And this is like somehow you

469
00:23:19,488 --> 00:23:21,706
get something which gives you an

470
00:23:21,728 --> 00:23:22,650
observation,

471
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:29,454
and then this gives you like new

472
00:23:29,652 --> 00:23:31,360
belief, high level.

473
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,400
And this thing is a Bayesian lens. So

474
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,376
that's what the Bayesian lenses are all

475
00:23:41,398 --> 00:23:44,996
about. And the thing that

476
00:23:45,018 --> 00:23:47,110
I was talking about in my thesis is

477
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,456
turning this into like a predictive

478
00:23:51,488 --> 00:23:54,816
coding dynamical system. Because you've

479
00:23:54,848 --> 00:23:56,596
got neurons which do this sort of

480
00:23:56,618 --> 00:23:58,128
prediction part and then neurons which

481
00:23:58,154 --> 00:24:01,576
do this passing back of

482
00:24:01,598 --> 00:24:03,544
error signals to do this updating part.

483
00:24:03,582 --> 00:24:04,696
And they have this kind of like bi

484
00:24:04,718 --> 00:24:06,676
directional form and that's really neat.

485
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:09,848
And so you can put in another one here,

486
00:24:10,014 --> 00:24:12,124
another one here, or you can just start

487
00:24:12,162 --> 00:24:14,316
with your prior which is like something

488
00:24:14,418 --> 00:24:17,036
that I often write as pi up here. And

489
00:24:17,058 --> 00:24:19,356
then this gives you like a new pi at

490
00:24:19,378 --> 00:24:23,152
this point. And so this is going

491
00:24:23,206 --> 00:24:24,944
always from higher level beliefs to

492
00:24:24,982 --> 00:24:26,576
lower level beliefs. And down here you

493
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:30,412
might eventually get to the lowest

494
00:24:30,476 --> 00:24:33,524
level, which is like if you're thinking

495
00:24:33,562 --> 00:24:37,684
about visual systems, then this

496
00:24:37,722 --> 00:24:40,864
would be like the V one visual cortex

497
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:42,916
stuff or like the stuff you get in the

498
00:24:42,938 --> 00:24:47,210
retina and you get prediction about

499
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,120
let's say visual signals.

500
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,824
But then the world, you get this

501
00:24:54,862 --> 00:24:56,664
predicted. But then the world comes back

502
00:24:56,702 --> 00:25:00,190
and it actually gives you actual

503
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,260
this is predicted,

504
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,736
gives you actual signals and then the

505
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,816
brain uses that to update its beliefs up

506
00:25:11,838 --> 00:25:16,190
here. And so really the interface is

507
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,510
somehow like this,

508
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,670
okay? And so this is like lens world

509
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,330
and this is like external world.

510
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,868
So that's where the external environment

511
00:25:33,964 --> 00:25:36,384
comes into the picture. And you could

512
00:25:36,422 --> 00:25:38,676
think of everything in here as like

513
00:25:38,858 --> 00:25:42,836
agent. But this doesn't really tell us

514
00:25:42,938 --> 00:25:46,244
much about action and it doesn't tell us

515
00:25:46,282 --> 00:25:49,764
much about interaction. And so

516
00:25:49,962 --> 00:25:51,832
there's another kind of story for that

517
00:25:51,886 --> 00:25:53,704
which is kind of similar in many

518
00:25:53,742 --> 00:25:56,904
respects, which is the story that

519
00:25:56,942 --> 00:25:59,336
is told at least in category theory by

520
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:02,196
what's known as categorical systems

521
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:05,372
theory. And there you get pictures like

522
00:26:05,426 --> 00:26:08,876
this. So this is like your world. And

523
00:26:08,898 --> 00:26:12,860
there you've got some system

524
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:15,230
inside the world and here you've got

525
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,730
another system inside the world.

526
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,976
And so people then draw like things that

527
00:26:20,998 --> 00:26:23,056
are called wiring diagrams to kind of

528
00:26:23,078 --> 00:26:26,850
represent how these things interact. So

529
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,456
let's call this a for a. Maybe there's

530
00:26:31,488 --> 00:26:34,292
another system over here and this is B.

531
00:26:34,346 --> 00:26:36,612
And maybe that's C for A. Its

532
00:26:36,666 --> 00:26:39,284
environment is like everything that

533
00:26:39,322 --> 00:26:42,890
isn't A, it's B and C.

534
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:48,376
So maybe it's connected like this, I

535
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:52,388
don't know, some weird wiring

536
00:26:52,484 --> 00:26:55,864
thing actually, maybe that

537
00:26:55,902 --> 00:26:58,684
should go round to here and then this

538
00:26:58,722 --> 00:27:00,364
goes like to that. I don't know,

539
00:27:00,402 --> 00:27:03,448
something like this. This is just what's

540
00:27:03,464 --> 00:27:05,336
known as a wiring diagram. It just tells

541
00:27:05,368 --> 00:27:07,196
you how the systems are coupled

542
00:27:07,228 --> 00:27:09,712
together. And that would be like

543
00:27:09,766 --> 00:27:12,380
specifying how the information flows

544
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,544
across the Markov blankets of your

545
00:27:14,582 --> 00:27:18,704
systems. And so this

546
00:27:18,822 --> 00:27:21,060
box is like the Markov blanket of A.

547
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,844
And then this wiring is like the data of

548
00:27:23,882 --> 00:27:25,940
the coupling of the blankets.

549
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,244
And so there's a whole theory, a whole

550
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:32,584
sort of story in category theory about

551
00:27:32,702 --> 00:27:35,224
how to sort of compose if you've got

552
00:27:35,262 --> 00:27:37,864
like, you know, if you you know, it has

553
00:27:37,902 --> 00:27:39,704
to compose dynamical systems of this

554
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:42,264
kind. And so, you know, what? What we do

555
00:27:42,302 --> 00:27:45,512
is we say, okay, well, we we write down

556
00:27:45,566 --> 00:27:50,156
like the type of if we say if we call if

557
00:27:50,178 --> 00:27:52,824
we write IA to represent the interface

558
00:27:52,872 --> 00:27:55,768
like the data of this is like X and this

559
00:27:55,794 --> 00:27:59,168
is like Y or something like that the

560
00:27:59,174 --> 00:28:01,280
kind of shape of the Markov blanket.

561
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,184
Then what system theory tells us is that

562
00:28:05,222 --> 00:28:08,124
for each interface we get a whole

563
00:28:08,182 --> 00:28:11,156
category of systems that you could put

564
00:28:11,178 --> 00:28:13,476
in that box to animate it to make it

565
00:28:13,498 --> 00:28:17,350
like a living system. And then

566
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,128
this is like a closed box at the moment.

567
00:28:21,294 --> 00:28:22,968
And so maybe it just represents the

568
00:28:22,974 --> 00:28:24,920
whole universe which doesn't have any

569
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:28,184
external environment. But you might also

570
00:28:28,222 --> 00:28:31,050
have something like a company,

571
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,236
so you call it like company X, and that

572
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:39,308
has some agent which decides what the

573
00:28:39,314 --> 00:28:41,788
company does, or some agent here which

574
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:43,564
takes in information from the

575
00:28:43,602 --> 00:28:47,216
environment. And so this wiring is

576
00:28:47,238 --> 00:28:50,336
then something that gives you a

577
00:28:50,358 --> 00:28:54,240
morphism from like A and B and

578
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,370
C to X.

579
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:02,144
And what this dynamical systems

580
00:29:02,192 --> 00:29:04,612
theory tells you is that let's call that

581
00:29:04,666 --> 00:29:07,812
W for wiring is that you get this

582
00:29:07,866 --> 00:29:12,416
functor from din A and din

583
00:29:12,608 --> 00:29:16,950
B and din C

584
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,096
to din X, which tells you

585
00:29:21,118 --> 00:29:23,444
then how to wire all these dynamical

586
00:29:23,492 --> 00:29:25,644
systems together to give you one that

587
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:28,796
fits into this outer box. And so this

588
00:29:28,898 --> 00:29:31,724
tells you how to do all this for just

589
00:29:31,762 --> 00:29:33,416
dynamical systems. But of course, we're

590
00:29:33,448 --> 00:29:36,524
kind of interested in active inference

591
00:29:36,572 --> 00:29:39,010
systems. And so here you don't just have

592
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:44,224
some DX by DT thing to

593
00:29:44,262 --> 00:29:47,776
go in here. You've got the

594
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:51,344
data of prediction and plans

595
00:29:51,392 --> 00:29:54,644
and goals and maybe then something about

596
00:29:54,682 --> 00:29:57,696
how to actually do the inference,

597
00:29:57,728 --> 00:30:00,936
like the statistical game stuff. But

598
00:30:00,958 --> 00:30:03,176
really the story is the same. And so if

599
00:30:03,198 --> 00:30:05,924
you have these boxes,

600
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:09,256
again, what we can do is if we

601
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:13,436
have a box like this x to Y is

602
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:16,924
we can think of an

603
00:30:16,962 --> 00:30:21,084
agent as having as a part of it a way

604
00:30:21,122 --> 00:30:23,688
of predicting, say, X. We think of let's

605
00:30:23,704 --> 00:30:26,030
call these something else, sorry,

606
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,496
let's call these S. So this is like the

607
00:30:30,518 --> 00:30:32,448
sense data that goes into the system.

608
00:30:32,534 --> 00:30:34,096
And then let's call this A, and then

609
00:30:34,118 --> 00:30:35,744
this is maybe like the actions that it

610
00:30:35,782 --> 00:30:38,548
takes. Let's now call this box, I don't

611
00:30:38,554 --> 00:30:42,016
know B. Oh, no, I don't like B. Let's

612
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,190
call it y.

613
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,092
So now let's think. Okay, well, part of

614
00:30:49,226 --> 00:30:51,352
what an active inference agent is doing

615
00:30:51,406 --> 00:30:54,708
is that they're predicting they've

616
00:30:54,724 --> 00:30:58,136
got some high level belief of

617
00:30:58,158 --> 00:31:01,268
type Y, and then they make a prediction

618
00:31:01,364 --> 00:31:04,268
about not just the sort of sense data,

619
00:31:04,354 --> 00:31:06,990
but also about their actions and then

620
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,664
their body samples from this belief

621
00:31:10,712 --> 00:31:13,116
about how they should act. Or you've got

622
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:15,020
these little cells, these little

623
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:17,104
mechanisms which try to correct the

624
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:20,524
prediction errors to make those actions

625
00:31:20,572 --> 00:31:22,720
into reality. And then maybe that gets

626
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,672
coupled to some other system which

627
00:31:24,726 --> 00:31:28,156
receives those actions as inputs. And

628
00:31:28,278 --> 00:31:30,964
you might have another part here which

629
00:31:31,082 --> 00:31:34,004
goes in the other direction which says,

630
00:31:34,042 --> 00:31:39,590
okay, given my actual sense data and

631
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,664
my actual actions, maybe my body is

632
00:31:42,702 --> 00:31:44,536
still learning how to play tennis or

633
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:47,384
something, what are my new high level

634
00:31:47,422 --> 00:31:50,328
beliefs? And so you can do this whole

635
00:31:50,414 --> 00:31:53,080
story again of Bayesian lenses.

636
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:00,024
And this goes like that, and this is now

637
00:32:00,062 --> 00:32:02,732
just why? And then this is like S times

638
00:32:02,786 --> 00:32:05,616
A. And this is s times a So you can tell

639
00:32:05,638 --> 00:32:06,816
this story and you can build like,

640
00:32:06,838 --> 00:32:09,776
hierarchical systems, but now you have a

641
00:32:09,798 --> 00:32:17,250
way of filling in each box and

642
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,824
in principle, a way of coupling them

643
00:32:19,862 --> 00:32:23,136
together to give composite active

644
00:32:23,168 --> 00:32:25,364
inference systems, like companies or

645
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:27,716
like colonies of cells or things like

646
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:30,256
that. This isn't a story yet that I've

647
00:32:30,288 --> 00:32:33,610
written down, but I know it works.

648
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,436
And I'm in the process of slowly writing

649
00:32:36,468 --> 00:32:39,832
it down. So the

650
00:32:39,886 --> 00:32:42,056
kind of fundamental structures that are

651
00:32:42,078 --> 00:32:43,496
in the thesis are like part of the

652
00:32:43,518 --> 00:32:47,164
story. The main thing that's missing is

653
00:32:47,202 --> 00:32:50,888
kind of like reorienting it's,

654
00:32:50,904 --> 00:32:54,076
just like reorienting this picture so

655
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:59,056
that it's not like going from here

656
00:32:59,158 --> 00:33:01,424
from left to right. It's like sort of

657
00:33:01,462 --> 00:33:05,504
poking down into the

658
00:33:05,542 --> 00:33:10,132
box, if you see what I mean. And this

659
00:33:10,186 --> 00:33:13,156
is like the stuff you put in. So this is

660
00:33:13,178 --> 00:33:16,688
like your lens

661
00:33:16,784 --> 00:33:18,836
thing here, and you sort of fill in the

662
00:33:18,858 --> 00:33:20,260
box with your lens.

663
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:25,848
So I think that tells I

664
00:33:25,854 --> 00:33:28,408
mean, that tells you how the chunks of

665
00:33:28,414 --> 00:33:30,872
the thesis kind of fit into the standard

666
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:33,912
act of inference story. The main job,

667
00:33:33,966 --> 00:33:35,436
at least as far as I'm concerned now,

668
00:33:35,458 --> 00:33:39,276
is to spell out the details and

669
00:33:39,298 --> 00:33:41,212
then start to talk about things like

670
00:33:41,346 --> 00:33:44,652
what happens if we've got Y

671
00:33:44,706 --> 00:33:47,116
and you've got Z's here? What if they're

672
00:33:47,148 --> 00:33:49,228
trying to form part of an organization,

673
00:33:49,324 --> 00:33:52,544
but they disagree about what to do? How

674
00:33:52,582 --> 00:33:54,076
does an organization resolve

675
00:33:54,108 --> 00:33:58,176
disagreements? What if you've got two

676
00:33:58,358 --> 00:34:00,396
signals from your brain to your muscles

677
00:34:00,428 --> 00:34:01,852
that tell you to do different things?

678
00:34:01,926 --> 00:34:03,140
How do you resolve?

679
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,096
How do you get harmonious active

680
00:34:08,128 --> 00:34:11,488
inference systems in some sense? So I'll

681
00:34:11,504 --> 00:34:12,856
stop sharing my screen now, and then we

682
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:16,264
could sort of return to the

683
00:34:16,302 --> 00:34:18,488
discussion. But that's, again, my kind

684
00:34:18,494 --> 00:34:21,690
of long winded answer. Awesome.

685
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,476
I can share the pictures I see. Dean you

686
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:29,068
said you shared something, but I can

687
00:34:29,154 --> 00:34:33,016
share some more things. Dina unmute

688
00:34:33,048 --> 00:34:36,556
and then go for it and then Ali no,

689
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:41,152
I just shared. Something from about nine

690
00:34:41,206 --> 00:34:42,736
years ago that I was doing in my

691
00:34:42,758 --> 00:34:44,016
programming that everything you just

692
00:34:44,038 --> 00:34:47,312
wrote out was I just wanted to share

693
00:34:47,366 --> 00:34:51,908
one part of it. That confirms that you

694
00:34:51,914 --> 00:34:53,476
could come from completely different

695
00:34:53,578 --> 00:34:56,052
places and arrive at the same

696
00:34:56,186 --> 00:34:57,604
destination. The whole bi

697
00:34:57,642 --> 00:35:01,756
directionality, the whole predictive

698
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:05,688
parabolic. Yeah. You can bring this into

699
00:35:05,774 --> 00:35:09,096
classrooms and have it make sense. It

700
00:35:09,278 --> 00:35:14,260
doesn't have to be esoteric or too

701
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:17,644
remote, I guess. Yeah, that's great to

702
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:19,596
hear. I'm really glad to hear that.

703
00:35:19,778 --> 00:35:22,110
Yeah, it's really awesome.

704
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,224
Thanks. Yeah, as I say, there's lots

705
00:35:25,272 --> 00:35:28,480
left to do, but I think an important

706
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:32,192
part of that is like spreading the word.

707
00:35:32,326 --> 00:35:35,264
It's really great that process is

708
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:38,224
beginning, thanks to you guys. So,

709
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:42,480
yeah, the rehearse play reflect cycle

710
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,756
actually begins when you reverse the

711
00:35:44,778 --> 00:35:48,144
direction of thought reading from Dean's

712
00:35:48,192 --> 00:35:49,430
email. Interesting.

713
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,708
Self organized. Yeah. It's all part of

714
00:35:54,714 --> 00:36:00,464
this whole cat. This is the like,

715
00:36:00,522 --> 00:36:02,136
I love the questions that we've had so

716
00:36:02,158 --> 00:36:04,010
far and I want to hear Ali's questions

717
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:07,292
and then I want to be able to take it

718
00:36:07,346 --> 00:36:10,428
and have people not be intimidated by it

719
00:36:10,514 --> 00:36:12,828
because you can really find yourself

720
00:36:12,994 --> 00:36:16,120
doing these things on a daily basis.

721
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,250
You just don't necessarily identify them

722
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,364
the way that we are. But that doesn't

723
00:36:22,412 --> 00:36:26,092
mean that we have somehow lost

724
00:36:26,156 --> 00:36:28,156
access to the things that we're

725
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:30,228
discussing today. So I'll just leave it

726
00:36:30,234 --> 00:36:33,030
at that for now. Yeah,

727
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,430
cool. All right,

728
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,744
in the rest of the time that we have

729
00:36:42,782 --> 00:36:44,920
with you for the two Toby.

730
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,840
Ali.

731
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,530
Okay, thank you.

732
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,196
Your video is frozen. Your video

733
00:37:01,218 --> 00:37:02,556
is frozen. Maybe you can just turn it

734
00:37:02,578 --> 00:37:03,150
off.

735
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:09,970
Yeah, go for it. Thank you. All right.

736
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:18,352
In basically three to

737
00:37:18,406 --> 00:37:20,850
ridiculously. Next.

738
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,996
Sorry, the notion of Marko, I noticed in

739
00:37:27,018 --> 00:37:27,940
your thesis.

740
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,544
Sorry, Ali there's just a lot of lag.

741
00:37:33,672 --> 00:37:34,350
Yeah.

742
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:56,798
What would you say is the chapter six

743
00:37:56,884 --> 00:38:01,178
equivalent? Is there yet a recipe

744
00:38:01,354 --> 00:38:04,110
for designing the kind of categorical,

745
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:09,106
kind of compositional organization that

746
00:38:09,128 --> 00:38:10,420
you alluded to?

747
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:17,538
I can answer that quickly. Yeah, go for

748
00:38:17,544 --> 00:38:18,978
a quick answer and then I think now it's

749
00:38:18,994 --> 00:38:23,254
better. Ali yeah, so the quick answer?

750
00:38:23,452 --> 00:38:25,206
Well, it's a quick answer, but it's not

751
00:38:25,228 --> 00:38:28,840
a quick thing to do. But there's a great

752
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:33,270
book on categorical systems theory

753
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:35,530
in its kind of great generality,

754
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,338
which doesn't explicitly talk about

755
00:38:39,504 --> 00:38:42,526
active inference like I've been, but it

756
00:38:42,548 --> 00:38:45,882
does talk about this kind of composing

757
00:38:45,946 --> 00:38:47,914
dynamical systems in this hierarchical

758
00:38:47,962 --> 00:38:51,626
way idea. And that's the book that's

759
00:38:51,658 --> 00:38:54,106
currently being drafted by David Jazz

760
00:38:54,138 --> 00:38:57,714
Myers. I can circulate a link

761
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:58,580
to it.

762
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:08,454
Myers that

763
00:39:08,492 --> 00:39:10,166
sort of spells out the kind of general

764
00:39:10,268 --> 00:39:13,814
structure and I

765
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:17,718
believe he and

766
00:39:17,884 --> 00:39:22,890
Mateo Capucci have got a paper upcoming

767
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:27,814
at the upcoming Act Conference

768
00:39:27,862 --> 00:39:29,786
on Applied Category Theory this year,

769
00:39:29,888 --> 00:39:33,134
talking about using that framework to

770
00:39:33,172 --> 00:39:35,520
do kind of cybernetic like things.

771
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,734
And so what I've been thinking about

772
00:39:38,772 --> 00:39:42,810
lately is trying to fit active inference

773
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:45,490
and the stuff I've been doing into that

774
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,186
framework, which has been sort of

775
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:50,946
developing in parallel and kind of

776
00:39:51,048 --> 00:39:52,766
fortunately and maybe slightly

777
00:39:52,798 --> 00:39:55,614
unsurprisingly, they fit very nicely

778
00:39:55,662 --> 00:39:57,974
together. And so the pictures I was

779
00:39:58,012 --> 00:40:01,526
sketching are kind of a fragment of that

780
00:40:01,548 --> 00:40:03,574
other framework. And as I say, I think

781
00:40:03,612 --> 00:40:07,000
they go quite well together. Awesome.

782
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:10,700
Okay, Ali, go for it.

783
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:14,554
Okay. Sorry about that. All right, so I

784
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:17,478
noticed in your thesis that you don't

785
00:40:17,574 --> 00:40:19,334
rely too much on the notion of markup

786
00:40:19,382 --> 00:40:23,440
blankets, but instead you use

787
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:27,374
this notion of polynomial functions as

788
00:40:27,412 --> 00:40:30,522
its more formal or perhaps more rigorous

789
00:40:30,586 --> 00:40:34,158
replacement. With regard to that

790
00:40:34,244 --> 00:40:37,700
in your paper Polynomial life,

791
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,206
you say in the literature on active

792
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:42,420
inference sorry.

793
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,386
And the free energy principle, there is

794
00:40:46,408 --> 00:40:47,966
much debate about the concept and role

795
00:40:47,998 --> 00:40:50,038
of markup blankets, which are sometimes

796
00:40:50,124 --> 00:40:51,926
conceived to represent the boundary of

797
00:40:51,948 --> 00:40:54,166
an adaptive system. We believe that the

798
00:40:54,188 --> 00:40:56,262
algebraic polynomials will help to make

799
00:40:56,316 --> 00:40:58,738
such thinking precise where it departs

800
00:40:58,754 --> 00:41:00,434
from the established usage of markup

801
00:41:00,482 --> 00:41:02,666
blankets and Bayesian networks. So would

802
00:41:02,688 --> 00:41:04,682
you care to elaborate a bit on that?

803
00:41:04,736 --> 00:41:08,570
And how do you see polynomial functions

804
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:11,994
as overcoming some of the limitations of

805
00:41:12,032 --> 00:41:14,350
the notion of markup blankets? Yeah,

806
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:17,870
okay. So I will preface this by saying

807
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:21,198
I think some people might disagree with

808
00:41:21,284 --> 00:41:26,206
me, but there

809
00:41:26,228 --> 00:41:29,778
is a notion of Markov blanket that

810
00:41:29,864 --> 00:41:33,714
for me is nicely defined, that exists in

811
00:41:33,912 --> 00:41:36,206
the sort of Bayesian statistics

812
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:39,238
literature. And it says if you've got a

813
00:41:39,244 --> 00:41:42,006
Bayesian network, you can consider the

814
00:41:42,028 --> 00:41:45,000
nodes in that network and you can ask

815
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:48,694
what are their Markov blankets? And in

816
00:41:48,732 --> 00:41:50,746
particular, you can just define the

817
00:41:50,768 --> 00:41:53,754
Markov blanket of a particular node to

818
00:41:53,792 --> 00:41:57,030
be its parents.

819
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:00,522
So those

820
00:42:00,656 --> 00:42:02,766
nodes that it's conditionally sort of

821
00:42:02,788 --> 00:42:05,998
dependent on its children,

822
00:42:06,164 --> 00:42:07,982
sort of those nodes which are

823
00:42:08,036 --> 00:42:10,846
conditionally dependent on it and what

824
00:42:10,868 --> 00:42:13,950
are known as its coparent, so the other

825
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,860
parents of its children.

826
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,726
And that's a very nicely well defined

827
00:42:19,758 --> 00:42:22,914
notion, but it's only nicely and well

828
00:42:22,952 --> 00:42:27,694
defined in this context of Bayesian

829
00:42:27,742 --> 00:42:31,198
networks. And so it's like

830
00:42:31,384 --> 00:42:35,154
generalizing that to kind of situations

831
00:42:35,202 --> 00:42:36,994
where you've got interacting dynamical

832
00:42:37,042 --> 00:42:40,914
systems is something that informally

833
00:42:40,962 --> 00:42:42,346
makes total sense. You want to say,

834
00:42:42,368 --> 00:42:44,474
okay, well, I have this thing in the

835
00:42:44,512 --> 00:42:47,706
world and it behaves so it changes in

836
00:42:47,728 --> 00:42:51,350
time, and it's sort of a coherent unity

837
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:53,486
in some sense. And so it has a kind of

838
00:42:53,508 --> 00:42:56,910
boundary. And because it has a boundary,

839
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:01,966
information and energy from

840
00:43:01,988 --> 00:43:03,674
the environment always has to flow

841
00:43:03,722 --> 00:43:05,986
through this boundary in order to

842
00:43:06,008 --> 00:43:09,186
interact with it. And that sort of

843
00:43:09,208 --> 00:43:11,970
boundary notion, it seems, is like what

844
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,338
is in other contexts also called a

845
00:43:14,344 --> 00:43:17,574
Markov blanket. And I think if you set

846
00:43:17,612 --> 00:43:21,942
up your dynamics in a particular way or

847
00:43:21,996 --> 00:43:24,406
your definition of Bayesian network in a

848
00:43:24,428 --> 00:43:28,454
particular way, that the two ideas that

849
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:31,174
might coincide. But I don't think that's

850
00:43:31,222 --> 00:43:35,210
true in general. And I think what people

851
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,126
mean in the literature when they're

852
00:43:37,158 --> 00:43:39,514
talking about Markov blankets, but in

853
00:43:39,552 --> 00:43:42,166
this dynamical context, I think all they

854
00:43:42,208 --> 00:43:45,070
really mean is like boundary or

855
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:49,214
interface. So the data

856
00:43:49,332 --> 00:43:52,794
of the system, like capacity

857
00:43:52,842 --> 00:43:54,746
for interaction or something like that,

858
00:43:54,868 --> 00:43:57,186
the stuff that is on the edge of the

859
00:43:57,208 --> 00:44:00,034
system through which interactions with

860
00:44:00,072 --> 00:44:02,850
its environment are mediated,

861
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:10,582
that sort of general idea is something,

862
00:44:10,636 --> 00:44:12,760
again, that appears nicely in

863
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:16,198
categorical systems theory, but in a

864
00:44:16,204 --> 00:44:19,026
very general way. And it doesn't require

865
00:44:19,218 --> 00:44:22,854
any of the notions of Bayesian

866
00:44:22,902 --> 00:44:25,530
statistics, and it doesn't require

867
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:31,766
conditional dependence or parents

868
00:44:31,798 --> 00:44:34,314
or children of a graph because you might

869
00:44:34,352 --> 00:44:35,830
have something more complicated than a

870
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,654
graph. Like you might have edges which

871
00:44:38,692 --> 00:44:39,934
are allowed to connect more than one

872
00:44:39,972 --> 00:44:41,706
node, and that gives you a hypergraph.

873
00:44:41,738 --> 00:44:43,166
And there, of course the notion of

874
00:44:43,188 --> 00:44:45,986
Bayesian of marker blanket in the

875
00:44:46,008 --> 00:44:47,394
standard sense that doesn't make sense

876
00:44:47,432 --> 00:44:50,754
at all, but of course the notion of

877
00:44:50,792 --> 00:44:53,698
interface does. And there are certain

878
00:44:53,784 --> 00:44:56,802
categories of interfaces. And those

879
00:44:56,856 --> 00:45:00,054
wiring diagrams I was drawing before are

880
00:45:00,172 --> 00:45:04,210
an example of a category of interfaces.

881
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:06,262
Like they don't have any data of the

882
00:45:06,316 --> 00:45:08,934
systems themselves. The category just

883
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:11,270
tells you how to sort of plug interfaces

884
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:14,634
together. And so I think it's kind of

885
00:45:14,672 --> 00:45:17,302
neater to think about this connectivity

886
00:45:17,366 --> 00:45:19,766
in the interfaces sort of separately

887
00:45:19,878 --> 00:45:21,706
from the stuff that fills the

888
00:45:21,728 --> 00:45:24,718
interfaces, like the data of the

889
00:45:24,804 --> 00:45:27,386
dynamical systems or of the active

890
00:45:27,418 --> 00:45:29,246
inference, like games that I've been

891
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,160
talking about.

892
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:36,974
And so a really nice kind of category

893
00:45:37,102 --> 00:45:39,058
that you can use to talk about

894
00:45:39,144 --> 00:45:42,638
interfaces and indeed to talk about lots

895
00:45:42,654 --> 00:45:44,226
of other things, but in particular to

896
00:45:44,248 --> 00:45:47,146
talk about interfaces is this category

897
00:45:47,198 --> 00:45:51,286
of polynomial functions. And it

898
00:45:51,308 --> 00:45:53,426
kind of generalizes these wiring

899
00:45:53,458 --> 00:45:56,178
diagrams that I was drawing earlier.

900
00:45:56,354 --> 00:45:59,630
And it does so in a particularly useful

901
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:04,666
way, I think, which is that if

902
00:46:04,688 --> 00:46:07,386
you sort of formalize the interface of a

903
00:46:07,408 --> 00:46:11,254
system using this polynomial

904
00:46:11,302 --> 00:46:13,838
language, you can start to talk about

905
00:46:13,924 --> 00:46:16,638
interfaces that themselves might change

906
00:46:16,724 --> 00:46:18,350
depending on the context.

907
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:23,230
So when you get into the car to

908
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,450
drive somewhere effectively, you've sort

909
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,986
of changed your interface because now

910
00:46:28,088 --> 00:46:31,426
you've got this car around you and it

911
00:46:31,448 --> 00:46:33,106
behaves in a different way than if

912
00:46:33,128 --> 00:46:36,462
you're just on your own or if you're

913
00:46:36,526 --> 00:46:40,214
just normally going

914
00:46:40,252 --> 00:46:43,590
about your life. You might blink right,

915
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:46,038
or you might close your eyes, and that

916
00:46:46,124 --> 00:46:48,082
means that you're no longer receiving

917
00:46:48,146 --> 00:46:51,482
visual signals from the world. And so

918
00:46:51,536 --> 00:46:54,282
if you just say you're writing down your

919
00:46:54,336 --> 00:46:56,106
active inference model and part of the

920
00:46:56,128 --> 00:46:58,374
model is that it receives visual

921
00:46:58,422 --> 00:47:03,262
signals, then talking

922
00:47:03,316 --> 00:47:05,674
about situations where those visual

923
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:06,880
signals go away.

924
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:12,334
You. Can do it right, but it's not very

925
00:47:12,372 --> 00:47:14,962
neat. And so to sort of account for

926
00:47:15,016 --> 00:47:16,722
interfaces that might change like this,

927
00:47:16,776 --> 00:47:19,090
it's nicer to be able to say, okay,

928
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:22,478
well, my interface actually is allowed

929
00:47:22,494 --> 00:47:25,540
to depend on what I'm doing right now.

930
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:29,606
So I'm currently on a video call and it

931
00:47:29,628 --> 00:47:31,986
means I can do certain things, but I'm

932
00:47:32,018 --> 00:47:33,638
currently wired into the computer so I

933
00:47:33,644 --> 00:47:36,854
can't so easily go and walk around like

934
00:47:36,892 --> 00:47:40,614
the set of signals I receive or actions

935
00:47:40,662 --> 00:47:43,786
I might take might change. And so I

936
00:47:43,808 --> 00:47:47,418
think it's easy to start by saying,

937
00:47:47,504 --> 00:47:50,166
okay, when we're talking about Markov

938
00:47:50,198 --> 00:47:52,394
blankets in dynamical systems, we just

939
00:47:52,432 --> 00:47:54,730
mean like, there is some set that is

940
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,134
like the action set and some set which

941
00:47:57,172 --> 00:48:00,698
is the sort of sensory set. For me it's

942
00:48:00,714 --> 00:48:02,414
just not enough because of the fact that

943
00:48:02,452 --> 00:48:06,180
the world is dynamical context change

944
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:10,146
coupling might be dependent on like you

945
00:48:10,168 --> 00:48:12,126
might be in an organization and there's

946
00:48:12,158 --> 00:48:15,682
some executive who's in charge of

947
00:48:15,736 --> 00:48:18,694
defining the team structure. And that

948
00:48:18,732 --> 00:48:20,854
means the team structure is like the

949
00:48:20,892 --> 00:48:22,774
wiring of the agents in that

950
00:48:22,812 --> 00:48:26,214
organization, but how

951
00:48:26,252 --> 00:48:28,146
they behave depends on the decisions

952
00:48:28,178 --> 00:48:31,142
that that executive makes. And so their

953
00:48:31,196 --> 00:48:34,650
markup blankets are conditional on those

954
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,666
decisions. And that's something you can

955
00:48:36,688 --> 00:48:38,486
talk about nicely in this polynomial

956
00:48:38,518 --> 00:48:40,378
language because you're allowed to have

957
00:48:40,544 --> 00:48:44,014
systems which affect the wiring of other

958
00:48:44,052 --> 00:48:46,014
systems. But it's really not something

959
00:48:46,052 --> 00:48:48,702
that's easy to talk about in this

960
00:48:48,836 --> 00:48:53,482
standard framework of interfaces

961
00:48:53,546 --> 00:48:55,858
and boundaries that is dominant in the

962
00:48:55,864 --> 00:48:58,066
active inference literature. And I think

963
00:48:58,088 --> 00:48:59,806
that's because really in the active

964
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:01,186
inference literature, there isn't a

965
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:04,754
framework for interfaces and wiring and

966
00:49:04,792 --> 00:49:07,362
that framework is supplied by these

967
00:49:07,416 --> 00:49:10,406
categories of interfaces. And so you can

968
00:49:10,428 --> 00:49:12,774
just choose one and you can hope it does

969
00:49:12,892 --> 00:49:14,742
choose one that's appropriate for your

970
00:49:14,876 --> 00:49:16,840
situation that you're trying to model,

971
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:19,506
but it helps to actually have one that

972
00:49:19,548 --> 00:49:22,038
allows you to do this wiring and that's

973
00:49:22,054 --> 00:49:23,414
something that using category theory

974
00:49:23,462 --> 00:49:24,922
allows you to do because it's all about

975
00:49:24,976 --> 00:49:25,850
composition.

976
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:31,926
Awesome. The textbooks

977
00:49:31,958 --> 00:49:34,094
will be rewritten. Dean quick thing,

978
00:49:34,132 --> 00:49:38,046
Toby, does the timing of the choice in

979
00:49:38,068 --> 00:49:41,680
your experience really matter?

980
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:47,494
The timing in what whenever,

981
00:49:47,562 --> 00:49:50,162
whenever you. Do decide to make a

982
00:49:50,216 --> 00:49:53,826
choice, doesn't the effect of the

983
00:49:53,848 --> 00:49:57,694
timing, the whenness of activating that

984
00:49:57,752 --> 00:50:01,174
choice play a huge part in

985
00:50:01,372 --> 00:50:03,874
what follows in terms of the category?

986
00:50:04,002 --> 00:50:05,986
Yeah. So do you mean like if you're

987
00:50:06,018 --> 00:50:08,294
choosing to use a particular kind of

988
00:50:08,332 --> 00:50:11,706
interface language, say or describe a

989
00:50:11,728 --> 00:50:14,826
thing with a particular interface or

990
00:50:14,848 --> 00:50:17,050
like particular kind of boundary?

991
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:20,806
Yeah. So I agree. And that's

992
00:50:20,838 --> 00:50:22,494
why I kind of tend to work quite

993
00:50:22,532 --> 00:50:25,674
abstractly. So rather than saying I'm

994
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:27,774
working with a particular kind of

995
00:50:27,892 --> 00:50:31,582
interface language, I'm just saying I

996
00:50:31,636 --> 00:50:33,898
will assume my interface language allows

997
00:50:33,914 --> 00:50:36,866
me to do these certain things. And so

998
00:50:36,888 --> 00:50:39,186
that's not so useful for actually

999
00:50:39,288 --> 00:50:43,154
implementing a particular model. But if

1000
00:50:43,192 --> 00:50:46,354
you're trying to think about systems in

1001
00:50:46,392 --> 00:50:48,520
general, it's helpful to work

1002
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:52,166
agnostically in that way. And so

1003
00:50:52,188 --> 00:50:54,342
the reason I sort of advocate like this

1004
00:50:54,396 --> 00:50:57,880
for polynomial functions is I think that

1005
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:02,098
they sort of fit at a nice sort of

1006
00:51:02,124 --> 00:51:05,078
intermediate level of abstraction. It's

1007
00:51:05,094 --> 00:51:06,778
not to say, okay, well, there is a

1008
00:51:06,784 --> 00:51:08,154
collection of interfaces and some

1009
00:51:08,192 --> 00:51:10,010
collection wiring them together because

1010
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,254
that doesn't tell you actually how that

1011
00:51:12,292 --> 00:51:16,458
works. So it is slightly opinionated.

1012
00:51:16,634 --> 00:51:19,422
It's different from certain choices that

1013
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:21,306
people in other bits of applied category

1014
00:51:21,338 --> 00:51:24,634
theory make. But it does

1015
00:51:24,692 --> 00:51:27,506
generalize this simple case where you

1016
00:51:27,528 --> 00:51:29,858
have just a single set of outputs and a

1017
00:51:29,864 --> 00:51:31,986
single set of inputs or single set of

1018
00:51:32,008 --> 00:51:33,860
actions and a single set of

1019
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:38,066
observations. And so I think because of

1020
00:51:38,088 --> 00:51:40,926
that it's a nice sort of intermediate

1021
00:51:40,958 --> 00:51:43,206
level and I think it's one I've tried to

1022
00:51:43,228 --> 00:51:44,774
work with, because I think it's quite

1023
00:51:44,892 --> 00:51:47,286
natural. But yeah, you can sort of

1024
00:51:47,308 --> 00:51:49,062
totally work at a very abstract level.

1025
00:51:49,116 --> 00:51:52,326
And that's what David Jazz does with

1026
00:51:52,348 --> 00:51:55,434
his systems, just he just talks about

1027
00:51:55,472 --> 00:51:57,260
interfaces in general.

1028
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:01,980
You might not have actions at all.

1029
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:05,610
It's completely agnostic.

1030
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,040
Awesome. Ollie.

1031
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:17,612
OK, thank you so much. So my second

1032
00:52:17,666 --> 00:52:20,850
question is about the relation between

1033
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:23,196
your compositional account of active

1034
00:52:23,228 --> 00:52:25,616
inference and the recent line of

1035
00:52:25,638 --> 00:52:28,620
research done in Bayesian mechanics,

1036
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:31,632
namely the discovery of the duality

1037
00:52:31,696 --> 00:52:34,384
between FEP and constraint maximum

1038
00:52:34,432 --> 00:52:38,484
entropy principle as

1039
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:41,620
discovered primarily through the work of

1040
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:44,424
Dalton Saktive Adebel in the last couple

1041
00:52:44,462 --> 00:52:48,180
of years. There's this nice duality

1042
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:54,056
between the observer dependent the

1043
00:52:54,078 --> 00:52:56,748
viewpoint from the inside observer of

1044
00:52:56,754 --> 00:52:59,470
the agent and the outside observer. So,

1045
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,756
respectively, the perspective of FEP as

1046
00:53:03,778 --> 00:53:06,648
opposed to constrained maximum entropy

1047
00:53:06,744 --> 00:53:09,984
principle. But Dalton has

1048
00:53:10,022 --> 00:53:12,224
demonstrated that actually, those two

1049
00:53:12,262 --> 00:53:15,680
perspectives can be unified through

1050
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:17,792
showing the equivalency between the

1051
00:53:17,846 --> 00:53:20,172
Bayesian optimality and James

1052
00:53:20,236 --> 00:53:24,224
optimality. So from Bayesian optimality,

1053
00:53:24,272 --> 00:53:26,816
we can obtain FEP, and from Jane's

1054
00:53:26,848 --> 00:53:30,640
optimality, we can acquire

1055
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:35,304
CMAP. So, given that the

1056
00:53:35,342 --> 00:53:39,092
notion of Bayesian lens also comprise

1057
00:53:39,156 --> 00:53:43,080
both Bayesian inference and

1058
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:48,136
its inverse process, do you think the

1059
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:51,630
Bayesian lens as providing a kind of,

1060
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,260
I don't know, a tool to account for

1061
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:58,892
showing this kind of duality between FEP

1062
00:53:58,956 --> 00:54:00,716
and constraint maximum entropy

1063
00:54:00,748 --> 00:54:03,888
principle? I think the answer is

1064
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:05,808
probably yes. But I think this is a

1065
00:54:05,814 --> 00:54:07,104
really great question, because

1066
00:54:07,222 --> 00:54:10,960
genuinely, I don't know the story mean,

1067
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:13,988
I know a bit about Dalton's work, and I

1068
00:54:13,994 --> 00:54:16,688
think it's wonderful, but I really don't

1069
00:54:16,704 --> 00:54:19,636
know yet how it connects to the stuff

1070
00:54:19,658 --> 00:54:21,636
I've been doing. And it's really like an

1071
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:24,440
open question for me. But there are some

1072
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:27,048
tantalizing signs that, as I say, I

1073
00:54:27,054 --> 00:54:28,392
think the answer to your question is

1074
00:54:28,446 --> 00:54:30,568
yes. There is a kind of unification of

1075
00:54:30,574 --> 00:54:32,010
the two kinds of story,

1076
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:37,164
and some of the ingredients of that

1077
00:54:37,202 --> 00:54:39,532
story are kind of floating around out

1078
00:54:39,586 --> 00:54:43,084
there. So I know that there seems to

1079
00:54:43,122 --> 00:54:46,108
be a connection, or like I know that

1080
00:54:46,114 --> 00:54:48,748
there is a connection between quantities

1081
00:54:48,844 --> 00:54:55,564
like the relative entropy and energetic

1082
00:54:55,612 --> 00:54:58,752
concepts you get in physics. And through

1083
00:54:58,806 --> 00:55:01,000
that, you can make a link to the kinds

1084
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,692
of things that Dalton has been doing

1085
00:55:02,746 --> 00:55:06,550
with gauge theory. And I feel like there

1086
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:10,596
is a kind of geometrical structure that

1087
00:55:10,618 --> 00:55:12,864
you can put on top of these statistical

1088
00:55:12,912 --> 00:55:14,292
games that I've been working with,

1089
00:55:14,346 --> 00:55:16,740
because, remember, they are these lenses

1090
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,336
with these loss functions. And these

1091
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:21,256
loss functions seem to have this kind

1092
00:55:21,278 --> 00:55:24,084
of, as I say, this kind of geometric

1093
00:55:24,132 --> 00:55:27,550
thing going on with them. But really

1094
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:33,736
explaining or putting constrained

1095
00:55:33,768 --> 00:55:37,304
maximum entropy into statistical games

1096
00:55:37,352 --> 00:55:39,792
language is not something that I've done

1097
00:55:39,846 --> 00:55:42,816
and it's something that I've been

1098
00:55:42,838 --> 00:55:44,704
thinking about doing, and I'd be

1099
00:55:44,742 --> 00:55:46,770
delighted to talk to people about more.

1100
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:49,696
And so I don't know precisely the

1101
00:55:49,718 --> 00:55:53,236
details. There is a kind of other

1102
00:55:53,418 --> 00:55:55,364
duality, which I think is quite nice

1103
00:55:55,402 --> 00:55:56,870
which is related to this.

1104
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:03,056
And I think again, at the nexus of these

1105
00:56:03,178 --> 00:56:06,970
is this systems theoretic idea,

1106
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:11,096
because of course, all of this work of

1107
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:13,364
Dalton's lives in this kind of dynamical

1108
00:56:13,492 --> 00:56:15,992
systems world where you have dynamical

1109
00:56:16,056 --> 00:56:18,412
systems that are interacting and

1110
00:56:18,466 --> 00:56:20,670
information flowing between them.

1111
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,420
And there are some really tantalizing

1112
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,312
connections, again, of course, between

1113
00:56:28,466 --> 00:56:30,352
physics and information processing. And

1114
00:56:30,406 --> 00:56:31,724
I learned the other day, for instance,

1115
00:56:31,772 --> 00:56:35,170
that there are certain classes of

1116
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:39,984
generative adversarial networks sorry,

1117
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:41,476
this is just a slight tangent, but I

1118
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:42,868
think you might be interested to know

1119
00:56:42,954 --> 00:56:43,984
certain classes of generative

1120
00:56:44,032 --> 00:56:46,804
adversarial networks that you can set

1121
00:56:46,842 --> 00:56:51,056
them up. And the two parts

1122
00:56:51,088 --> 00:56:54,216
of the network tend to instead of

1123
00:56:54,238 --> 00:56:56,676
settling into an equilibrium, they seem

1124
00:56:56,708 --> 00:56:59,496
to exhibit some orbits around each other

1125
00:56:59,598 --> 00:57:03,012
so they don't achieve some equilibrium

1126
00:57:03,076 --> 00:57:04,616
state in the game they're playing. They

1127
00:57:04,638 --> 00:57:06,430
kind of just got around.

1128
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:14,956
But somebody was telling me about if

1129
00:57:14,978 --> 00:57:16,828
you have an orbit and you're a

1130
00:57:16,834 --> 00:57:19,004
physicist, you think, okay, well, what

1131
00:57:19,042 --> 00:57:22,336
is that orbit conserving? Is there like

1132
00:57:22,358 --> 00:57:24,896
a quantity that it's conserving? And in

1133
00:57:24,918 --> 00:57:26,396
this case, and I don't know the details,

1134
00:57:26,428 --> 00:57:29,568
but in this case, this person found that

1135
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:32,384
the quantity that was conserved in this

1136
00:57:32,502 --> 00:57:35,220
orbit was the relative entropy. And so

1137
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:36,756
there's this weird thing going on.

1138
00:57:36,858 --> 00:57:38,356
These things are playing a game, but

1139
00:57:38,378 --> 00:57:41,504
they're still at this kind of somehow

1140
00:57:41,552 --> 00:57:43,540
steady state of relative entropy.

1141
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:46,596
And so there seems to be this deep

1142
00:57:46,628 --> 00:57:49,272
connection between these kinds of game

1143
00:57:49,326 --> 00:57:52,856
like systems and sort

1144
00:57:52,878 --> 00:57:55,610
of information physics in some sense.

1145
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:58,008
And I'm aware I need to head off for the

1146
00:57:58,014 --> 00:57:59,544
moment, but I just want to draw one more

1147
00:57:59,582 --> 00:58:01,036
picture. And I'm sorry, Elliot, you

1148
00:58:01,058 --> 00:58:02,396
probably had loads of questions, but we

1149
00:58:02,418 --> 00:58:04,844
kind of ran out of managed to answer

1150
00:58:04,882 --> 00:58:06,876
many of them, but hopefully we'll get to

1151
00:58:06,898 --> 00:58:09,824
the rest of them soon. But if I just

1152
00:58:09,862 --> 00:58:14,560
draw, as I say, one more picture,

1153
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:19,504
which is a kind of slightly different

1154
00:58:19,622 --> 00:58:22,228
kind of duality, but a similar kind of

1155
00:58:22,314 --> 00:58:25,460
similar kind of flavor. So what we have

1156
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:28,564
in systems theory is

1157
00:58:28,602 --> 00:58:30,756
this category. You have this category of

1158
00:58:30,778 --> 00:58:34,116
interfaces of systems and the morphisms

1159
00:58:34,148 --> 00:58:36,836
tell you how to wire these systems

1160
00:58:36,868 --> 00:58:40,216
together to give like hierarchical or

1161
00:58:40,238 --> 00:58:41,800
like composite systems.

1162
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:46,536
And if

1163
00:58:46,558 --> 00:58:48,316
you have something like this thing which

1164
00:58:48,338 --> 00:58:51,916
I wrote before Din, which I said for

1165
00:58:51,938 --> 00:58:55,500
each interface I was like a category,

1166
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,916
then you can sort of think of this as a

1167
00:58:57,938 --> 00:59:01,120
functor from int to

1168
00:59:01,190 --> 00:59:04,640
like cat the category of categories.

1169
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:08,124
And one thing you can do with index

1170
00:59:08,172 --> 00:59:10,256
categories of this kind is you can sort

1171
00:59:10,278 --> 00:59:12,930
of turn them into what are called like

1172
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,136
vibrations using what's known as the

1173
00:59:15,158 --> 00:59:16,836
Groton deconstruction. And if you know

1174
00:59:16,858 --> 00:59:18,756
about physics, you've probably heard of

1175
00:59:18,778 --> 00:59:21,796
a concept called a fiber bundle, which

1176
00:59:21,818 --> 00:59:24,100
is just like a collection of spaces

1177
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:27,896
indexed by points of another space. And

1178
00:59:27,918 --> 00:59:31,080
so what you can do is you can write this

1179
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:34,264
vibration which says, okay, well, for

1180
00:59:34,302 --> 00:59:36,924
each interface I've got a category of

1181
00:59:36,962 --> 00:59:38,296
systems on that interface and they're

1182
00:59:38,328 --> 00:59:41,144
all like glued together correspondingly

1183
00:59:41,192 --> 00:59:44,728
with the wirings of your interface

1184
00:59:44,824 --> 00:59:47,756
category. And so you write this as like

1185
00:59:47,778 --> 00:59:49,676
another function which kind of forgets

1186
00:59:49,708 --> 00:59:51,424
about the dynamical systems and just

1187
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:53,904
returns the interface again. And so you

1188
00:59:53,942 --> 00:59:57,056
have this vibration thing here and this

1189
00:59:57,078 --> 00:59:58,412
is like where kind of like physics

1190
00:59:58,476 --> 00:59:59,090
lives.

1191
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,636
And so what I've been trying to tell

1192
01:00:03,738 --> 01:00:06,452
this story about, in this story about

1193
01:00:06,586 --> 01:00:08,196
active inference is that you have a

1194
01:00:08,218 --> 01:00:12,644
similar one where you have for

1195
01:00:12,682 --> 01:00:15,928
each type of interface, the category of

1196
01:00:16,014 --> 01:00:20,020
agents that might have that interface.

1197
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:22,936
Like we're all humans and so we are all

1198
01:00:22,958 --> 01:00:24,888
like the type that might fit in like a

1199
01:00:24,894 --> 01:00:27,528
human shaped box and so we're all in

1200
01:00:27,534 --> 01:00:29,676
that particular category and we come

1201
01:00:29,698 --> 01:00:31,436
together to form organizations and

1202
01:00:31,458 --> 01:00:33,256
that's another object of this category

1203
01:00:33,288 --> 01:00:35,196
of interfaces and another kind of agent

1204
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,676
category on those interfaces. And so

1205
01:00:37,698 --> 01:00:38,876
that gives you another one of these

1206
01:00:38,898 --> 01:00:40,224
vibrations. And the thing that something

1207
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:41,936
like predictive coding tells you is it

1208
01:00:41,958 --> 01:00:45,568
says, okay, well, given a certain story

1209
01:00:45,654 --> 01:00:47,970
about a type of agent,

1210
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:50,512
can I turn that into a dynamical system

1211
01:00:50,566 --> 01:00:52,836
which actually animates it? And so

1212
01:00:52,858 --> 01:00:55,830
that's like a functor like this.

1213
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:58,676
So maybe what we could do is we could

1214
01:00:58,698 --> 01:01:00,976
think of this as maybe like some version

1215
01:01:01,008 --> 01:01:04,196
of biology or we could think of this as

1216
01:01:04,218 --> 01:01:06,932
like we could think of this as like body

1217
01:01:07,066 --> 01:01:08,584
and we could sort of think of this as

1218
01:01:08,622 --> 01:01:12,136
like mind. And so this is telling us how

1219
01:01:12,158 --> 01:01:14,164
to go from a description of a mental

1220
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:16,730
system to a sort of embodied system.

1221
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:19,412
And I think some of what the free energy

1222
01:01:19,486 --> 01:01:21,692
principle is trying to say is that for

1223
01:01:21,746 --> 01:01:24,172
certain kinds of systems there's a way

1224
01:01:24,226 --> 01:01:26,344
to turn your description of a dynamical

1225
01:01:26,392 --> 01:01:27,836
system into something that looks like an

1226
01:01:27,858 --> 01:01:30,528
agent. And so the thing I'm wondering is

1227
01:01:30,534 --> 01:01:34,572
that whether there's some adjunction

1228
01:01:34,716 --> 01:01:37,570
or maybe this is like I don't know.

1229
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:40,144
I don't know which way we might write

1230
01:01:40,262 --> 01:01:41,756
labels on these, but maybe there's,

1231
01:01:41,788 --> 01:01:45,204
like, some adjunction here that

1232
01:01:45,242 --> 01:01:47,616
allows us to compare these two processes

1233
01:01:47,728 --> 01:01:51,456
of turning a sort of mental

1234
01:01:51,488 --> 01:01:53,216
system into a physical one and then

1235
01:01:53,258 --> 01:01:54,488
going in the other direction from a

1236
01:01:54,494 --> 01:01:57,416
physical system into a mental one. And

1237
01:01:57,438 --> 01:02:00,296
so maybe this is also where information

1238
01:02:00,478 --> 01:02:04,088
comes in. And it's a kind

1239
01:02:04,094 --> 01:02:08,004
of similar story in category

1240
01:02:08,052 --> 01:02:12,724
theory where there's a sort of duality

1241
01:02:12,852 --> 01:02:17,904
between geometry and logic that

1242
01:02:18,062 --> 01:02:20,016
that's sort of sometimes written like

1243
01:02:20,038 --> 01:02:22,304
this. You have truth values down here

1244
01:02:22,342 --> 01:02:25,472
and you have logic over here

1245
01:02:25,526 --> 01:02:29,680
and you have space over here and

1246
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:33,216
there's a way to sort of draw a picture

1247
01:02:33,248 --> 01:02:35,910
like this that says, okay, well,

1248
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:39,636
logic is somehow like dual to space in

1249
01:02:39,658 --> 01:02:42,180
some sort of mumbo Jumboy way. I mean,

1250
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:44,084
again, I've run out of time, but I think

1251
01:02:44,202 --> 01:02:46,664
there's a story that people try to tell

1252
01:02:46,702 --> 01:02:49,812
about science in this kind of abstract

1253
01:02:49,876 --> 01:02:51,512
world and I think it's a similar story

1254
01:02:51,566 --> 01:02:53,032
to maybe something that's being told

1255
01:02:53,086 --> 01:02:56,580
over here. Again, lots of details,

1256
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:57,896
and I don't know precisely the

1257
01:02:57,918 --> 01:02:59,916
connection with Dalton's work, but I

1258
01:02:59,938 --> 01:03:01,628
think it's kind of pointing in this kind

1259
01:03:01,634 --> 01:03:05,004
of direction. Thank you,

1260
01:03:05,042 --> 01:03:08,780
topy. After you have revised

1261
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:10,880
and proceeded,

1262
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:15,840
let's have 54.3 and talk more about

1263
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:18,368
action, active inference. So thank you.

1264
01:03:18,534 --> 01:03:19,968
Yeah, great. Thank you so much for

1265
01:03:19,974 --> 01:03:21,124
having me. And I look forward to

1266
01:03:21,162 --> 01:03:22,676
speaking again and answering your

1267
01:03:22,698 --> 01:03:26,116
questions. Ali, thank you so much. That

1268
01:03:26,138 --> 01:03:28,630
was great. Okay, great. Bye, guys.

1269
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:32,710
Bye. Well,

1270
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,736
I'd like to ask Dean a oh, Ali, please

1271
01:03:43,758 --> 01:03:46,250
make a remark. And then I have a yeah,

1272
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:50,732
you know, I really think of Toby's work

1273
01:03:50,786 --> 01:03:54,284
as really provocative as

1274
01:03:54,322 --> 01:03:56,796
it really opens up Pandora's box of

1275
01:03:56,818 --> 01:04:00,908
many, many different fertile questions.

1276
01:04:01,074 --> 01:04:04,616
So I'm a firm believer

1277
01:04:04,728 --> 01:04:07,568
of this old saying that a sign of a

1278
01:04:07,574 --> 01:04:10,144
great book is not how many answers it

1279
01:04:10,182 --> 01:04:12,372
provides, but actually how many

1280
01:04:12,506 --> 01:04:15,444
questions it gives rise to. So I really

1281
01:04:15,482 --> 01:04:18,752
wanted to congratulate Toby on writing

1282
01:04:18,816 --> 01:04:22,390
such a I mean,

1283
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:27,704
it looks as if he

1284
01:04:27,742 --> 01:04:31,912
began from the perspective of trying to

1285
01:04:32,046 --> 01:04:35,320
address some of the I don't know,

1286
01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:38,796
some long held questions, but then it

1287
01:04:38,818 --> 01:04:41,756
turned out to be much more deeper than

1288
01:04:41,778 --> 01:04:44,796
that in terms of actually giving rise to

1289
01:04:44,818 --> 01:04:47,644
many fertile questions. So, yeah,

1290
01:04:47,682 --> 01:04:49,010
that's really great.

1291
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:55,950
Dean, I'd like to ask, what is the

1292
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:58,046
difference or how can we think about

1293
01:04:58,228 --> 01:05:01,582
being on time in time and

1294
01:05:01,636 --> 01:05:02,660
out of time?

1295
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:07,234
Because Toby said he was out of time

1296
01:05:07,432 --> 01:05:11,598
with the answer. And I know that we've

1297
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:13,618
spoken about this when we consider some

1298
01:05:13,624 --> 01:05:16,482
of the time consciousness and category

1299
01:05:16,546 --> 01:05:20,166
theory work previously. So what is it to

1300
01:05:20,188 --> 01:05:22,760
be out of time? Yeah,

1301
01:05:23,370 --> 01:05:25,334
that's a great question. All I can say

1302
01:05:25,372 --> 01:05:29,042
at this point is that it's easier

1303
01:05:29,106 --> 01:05:32,754
to discretize when you're

1304
01:05:32,802 --> 01:05:37,286
in time and out of time as

1305
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:40,046
a comparator than it is to say when

1306
01:05:40,068 --> 01:05:43,658
you're on time versus

1307
01:05:43,754 --> 01:05:46,510
those first two positions.

1308
01:05:49,010 --> 01:05:51,630
That's all I can say about that for now,

1309
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:54,766
because I'm sure Toby,

1310
01:05:54,958 --> 01:05:57,330
from a diagrammatic perspective,

1311
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:01,874
could probably tell us what is happening

1312
01:06:01,912 --> 01:06:04,930
when he's actually using his stylus

1313
01:06:06,810 --> 01:06:13,200
versus not right.

1314
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:16,464
Like the result of that leaves something

1315
01:06:16,662 --> 01:06:20,050
in and out. But while he's actually

1316
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:25,184
on point, he's literally

1317
01:06:25,232 --> 01:06:26,470
in a different place.

1318
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:31,396
Here's an interesting thing, back to the

1319
01:06:31,418 --> 01:06:34,504
provocative Ali in the Dot. One was

1320
01:06:34,542 --> 01:06:36,692
talking about virtual and actual models

1321
01:06:36,756 --> 01:06:40,248
and was probably saying it in a way

1322
01:06:40,414 --> 01:06:43,050
that's completely different than how I

1323
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:47,020
use. I believe those same

1324
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:49,710
two models are in effect.

1325
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:56,876
And so if

1326
01:06:56,898 --> 01:07:02,224
you, for example, draw up a

1327
01:07:02,262 --> 01:07:04,476
play, say, in sports, because we're

1328
01:07:04,508 --> 01:07:06,992
talking a lot of strategy while Toby was

1329
01:07:07,126 --> 01:07:10,436
on today and a lot of gaming theory and

1330
01:07:10,458 --> 01:07:14,020
stuff, you draw up a play, then you

1331
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:17,270
confirm that you have all of the

1332
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,916
elements or resources that you need in

1333
01:07:20,938 --> 01:07:23,210
order to be able to carry that out.

1334
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:27,764
And then you're as a group communicating

1335
01:07:27,812 --> 01:07:31,224
with one another like we are doing on

1336
01:07:31,262 --> 01:07:32,916
this live stream, right? Like you're

1337
01:07:32,948 --> 01:07:36,376
literally calling out the play in North

1338
01:07:36,408 --> 01:07:39,484
American football. You'd huddle up and

1339
01:07:39,522 --> 01:07:41,996
literally call out a sequence of code

1340
01:07:42,178 --> 01:07:45,224
and then you'd have to literally reverse

1341
01:07:45,272 --> 01:07:49,280
that and turn the inference as

1342
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:53,488
the shortest time window into

1343
01:07:53,654 --> 01:07:56,572
a prediction. Like you would literally

1344
01:07:56,636 --> 01:07:59,876
line up and then you would

1345
01:07:59,898 --> 01:08:03,350
carry out the simulation in actual

1346
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:07,670
terms. All of that

1347
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:11,684
together means that I believe that the

1348
01:08:11,722 --> 01:08:15,732
virtual version of the model is, as Toby

1349
01:08:15,796 --> 01:08:17,832
was saying, in the bi directional sense,

1350
01:08:17,966 --> 01:08:20,968
going in one direction, and the actual

1351
01:08:21,054 --> 01:08:25,360
model is going in 180 degrees

1352
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:28,812
the opposite direction. And then when he

1353
01:08:28,866 --> 01:08:32,268
mentioned the dagger symbol today,

1354
01:08:32,434 --> 01:08:35,020
I was just like, okay, where does that

1355
01:08:35,090 --> 01:08:38,576
fit in to this bi directionality and the

1356
01:08:38,598 --> 01:08:41,792
difference between. The.

1357
01:08:41,846 --> 01:08:44,636
SIM, the digital, the virtual,

1358
01:08:44,828 --> 01:08:47,600
and the actual? So these are the things

1359
01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:52,084
that literally pop up at

1360
01:08:52,122 --> 01:08:54,960
any given moment, aren't necessarily

1361
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:58,084
part of what you consider to be the

1362
01:08:58,122 --> 01:09:01,360
space that is inhabited by virtuality

1363
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:04,840
and actuality. And yet there it is.

1364
01:09:04,990 --> 01:09:07,768
It just appears. And then you have to

1365
01:09:07,774 --> 01:09:09,016
sit down and figure out, well, where

1366
01:09:09,038 --> 01:09:11,450
does that categorically fit?

1367
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:15,404
So again, don't want to go off on

1368
01:09:15,442 --> 01:09:19,052
a deep rabbit hole philosophical take

1369
01:09:19,106 --> 01:09:21,772
on this, but I just find that at any

1370
01:09:21,826 --> 01:09:24,716
given moment, there is again,

1371
01:09:24,818 --> 01:09:28,364
so much math in this philosophy that

1372
01:09:28,562 --> 01:09:30,848
it's kind of staggering. And just to be

1373
01:09:30,854 --> 01:09:32,864
able to have somebody who can explain

1374
01:09:32,982 --> 01:09:37,168
that and draw it out is

1375
01:09:37,334 --> 01:09:40,628
pretty impressive. I don't

1376
01:09:40,634 --> 01:09:42,804
know if it's provocative what I just

1377
01:09:42,842 --> 01:09:45,556
said. I hope it isn't because, man, I

1378
01:09:45,578 --> 01:09:49,110
did this work for almost a decade and

1379
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:52,900
it seemed like young people weren't

1380
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:55,784
scared by it. Maybe older folks are,

1381
01:09:55,822 --> 01:09:56,890
but I don't know.

1382
01:10:00,910 --> 01:10:04,138
So if I may add a brief comment on just

1383
01:10:04,224 --> 01:10:07,598
what you said, I was recently watching

1384
01:10:07,684 --> 01:10:11,246
this talk by John Bayes about the

1385
01:10:11,268 --> 01:10:13,470
history of applied category theory.

1386
01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:18,010
So he had this nice diagram

1387
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:21,770
showing the relationship between

1388
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:24,354
different areas of knowledge, I mean,

1389
01:10:24,392 --> 01:10:27,182
going from business to pure mathematics.

1390
01:10:27,326 --> 01:10:30,814
And he claimed that most

1391
01:10:30,872 --> 01:10:34,134
people in category theory, or in most

1392
01:10:34,172 --> 01:10:37,730
other areas, consider category theory

1393
01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:41,366
as being on the top

1394
01:10:41,388 --> 01:10:43,686
of the pyramid, as being the purest of

1395
01:10:43,708 --> 01:10:46,922
the pure, so as being even

1396
01:10:47,056 --> 01:10:50,394
kind of being on a meta level than

1397
01:10:50,512 --> 01:10:54,554
even the pure mathematics. But then he

1398
01:10:54,592 --> 01:10:58,430
said that I believe category theory can

1399
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:01,370
actually be seen as kind of permeating

1400
01:11:01,450 --> 01:11:03,854
all of these levels. So it's not

1401
01:11:03,892 --> 01:11:08,282
something that sits on top of the

1402
01:11:08,356 --> 01:11:10,690
hierarchy. It's something that actually

1403
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:12,786
can be seen as influencing and

1404
01:11:12,808 --> 01:11:16,626
permeating all the levels. So at

1405
01:11:16,648 --> 01:11:19,374
least from the perspective of applied

1406
01:11:19,422 --> 01:11:22,680
category theory, it seems to be,

1407
01:11:24,170 --> 01:11:27,720
if not self evident, but something that

1408
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:32,786
gathers much, I mean, more evidence

1409
01:11:32,898 --> 01:11:35,674
as the research goes by. So I'm really

1410
01:11:35,712 --> 01:11:38,406
optimistic in the research direction

1411
01:11:38,438 --> 01:11:40,714
that applied category theory is going.

1412
01:11:40,832 --> 01:11:43,594
And hopefully in near future we can see

1413
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:46,426
it applied to many, many different

1414
01:11:46,528 --> 01:11:50,030
areas, many different unforeseen areas.

1415
01:11:52,770 --> 01:11:55,390
I think I'll just tag on to that. Ali,

1416
01:11:57,810 --> 01:12:00,942
if you use an abductive logic

1417
01:12:01,006 --> 01:12:04,162
lens, then it's simply a question of

1418
01:12:04,296 --> 01:12:07,314
when did you enter, at what point did

1419
01:12:07,352 --> 01:12:11,170
you enter the abstracted

1420
01:12:11,610 --> 01:12:14,854
timeline? Because if you see it

1421
01:12:14,892 --> 01:12:17,846
that way, it's not just top down and

1422
01:12:17,868 --> 01:12:21,782
it's not just bottom up. It's back to my

1423
01:12:21,836 --> 01:12:24,680
question to Toby was,

1424
01:12:25,690 --> 01:12:29,546
does the whenness of this really

1425
01:12:29,728 --> 01:12:32,906
matter if you want to be able to

1426
01:12:33,008 --> 01:12:36,586
take it off the shelf and use it? And of

1427
01:12:36,608 --> 01:12:39,450
course, his answer was, yeah,

1428
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,850
if you want to deal with idiosyncrasies,

1429
01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:46,154
you're left with no choice but actually

1430
01:12:46,272 --> 01:12:50,322
to acknowledge the point

1431
01:12:50,376 --> 01:12:53,554
in the continuum where you take this up.

1432
01:12:53,752 --> 01:12:56,098
But I think that actually makes it quite

1433
01:12:56,184 --> 01:13:00,114
easy to see it permeating every level.

1434
01:13:00,312 --> 01:13:03,510
But again, it's the abduction,

1435
01:13:04,090 --> 01:13:07,222
the abductive piece of this back to last

1436
01:13:07,276 --> 01:13:10,966
year in August, right? We're coming up

1437
01:13:10,988 --> 01:13:12,806
on one year since we talked about how

1438
01:13:12,828 --> 01:13:16,700
important that is, and yet here we are,

1439
01:13:17,790 --> 01:13:21,340
what, ten and a half months later,

1440
01:13:21,950 --> 01:13:24,586
and we're circling back. We have another

1441
01:13:24,688 --> 01:13:27,210
predictive parabolic on our. Heads.

1442
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:35,956
Few comments on that. It's reminding

1443
01:13:35,988 --> 01:13:39,556
me of Professor Mike Levin's work on

1444
01:13:39,598 --> 01:13:42,940
basal cognition and the idea that

1445
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:44,956
intelligence isn't on the top of the

1446
01:13:44,978 --> 01:13:47,580
pyramid either. Rather, it's something

1447
01:13:47,650 --> 01:13:51,448
that's distributed compositionally

1448
01:13:51,624 --> 01:13:53,596
across levels and something that exists

1449
01:13:53,628 --> 01:13:56,432
at all levels. And so we can then still

1450
01:13:56,486 --> 01:13:58,896
talk about higher order properties of

1451
01:13:58,918 --> 01:14:01,952
systems or properties of

1452
01:14:02,086 --> 01:14:06,708
composites or aggregate systems while

1453
01:14:06,794 --> 01:14:14,036
also grounding in

1454
01:14:14,058 --> 01:14:17,220
the foundations. Um.

1455
01:14:22,230 --> 01:14:23,926
Yeah, and that, and that grounding and

1456
01:14:23,948 --> 01:14:27,414
anchoring and stabilizing, that's by

1457
01:14:27,452 --> 01:14:31,254
itself is nothing

1458
01:14:31,292 --> 01:14:33,638
but a feature. I think you also want to

1459
01:14:33,644 --> 01:14:35,066
be able to, though, because there was a

1460
01:14:35,088 --> 01:14:38,602
lot of talk today about being able to

1461
01:14:38,656 --> 01:14:42,394
see this in the

1462
01:14:42,432 --> 01:14:46,510
way that things dynamically

1463
01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:50,206
play out. So, again, we're back to

1464
01:14:50,228 --> 01:14:53,374
the what's the minimum two ways that we

1465
01:14:53,412 --> 01:14:57,102
want to incorporate this observation,

1466
01:14:57,246 --> 01:14:59,870
both as stabilized and as searching.

1467
01:14:59,950 --> 01:15:03,714
Right. If we can have one eye on each at

1468
01:15:03,752 --> 01:15:07,442
all times, it does take a bit of

1469
01:15:07,576 --> 01:15:08,770
rethinking.

1470
01:15:12,890 --> 01:15:15,414
There is a there is a there is an

1471
01:15:15,452 --> 01:15:18,454
interoceptive piece to this. What we

1472
01:15:18,492 --> 01:15:21,770
feel from that is

1473
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:22,460
different.

1474
01:15:26,030 --> 01:15:28,966
That brings us to the sensor fusion

1475
01:15:29,158 --> 01:15:36,254
aspects of the dissertation 7.1.1

1476
01:15:36,292 --> 01:15:39,040
Bayesian sensor fusion. Yeah.

1477
01:15:40,930 --> 01:15:42,586
A situation that is common in natural

1478
01:15:42,618 --> 01:15:44,574
embodied systems, but which is not yet

1479
01:15:44,612 --> 01:15:46,334
well treated by current statistical

1480
01:15:46,382 --> 01:15:49,166
machine learning methods. Also, Ali,

1481
01:15:49,198 --> 01:15:51,326
thanks so much for asking the Markov

1482
01:15:51,358 --> 01:15:55,650
blanket question. I think his response

1483
01:15:56,070 --> 01:15:58,446
is worthy, honestly, to review and

1484
01:15:58,488 --> 01:16:01,606
unpack in the time we have, we can just

1485
01:16:01,628 --> 01:16:03,894
sort of review a little bit and think

1486
01:16:03,932 --> 01:16:06,102
about what other questions we want to

1487
01:16:06,156 --> 01:16:08,600
prepare for. Two,

1488
01:16:11,310 --> 01:16:15,420
how would you, Ali, restate the

1489
01:16:17,390 --> 01:16:19,622
limitations of the Markov blanket

1490
01:16:19,686 --> 01:16:22,266
concept for all the positive things that

1491
01:16:22,288 --> 01:16:24,094
we've said in the previous 300 live

1492
01:16:24,132 --> 01:16:27,742
streams and where category theory can

1493
01:16:27,796 --> 01:16:31,360
help address and move past some of that?

1494
01:16:33,810 --> 01:16:37,090
Yeah, you see, this notion obviously

1495
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:40,434
is one of the most or,

1496
01:16:40,632 --> 01:16:42,514
I don't know, probably one of the most

1497
01:16:42,552 --> 01:16:46,094
controversial concepts in whole FEP

1498
01:16:46,142 --> 01:16:49,238
literature because it has received a

1499
01:16:49,244 --> 01:16:52,678
fair amount of criticism from many

1500
01:16:52,764 --> 01:16:55,654
various perspectives. But some

1501
01:16:55,692 --> 01:16:59,014
criticisms, at least

1502
01:16:59,052 --> 01:17:00,440
as far as I know,

1503
01:17:02,430 --> 01:17:04,874
they're basically directed toward the

1504
01:17:04,912 --> 01:17:07,114
universality of Markov blanket. How

1505
01:17:07,152 --> 01:17:10,650
universal is this notion

1506
01:17:11,230 --> 01:17:14,318
as it's claimed to be ranging from, I

1507
01:17:14,324 --> 01:17:17,050
don't know, inert rocks to the brains,

1508
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:20,810
right. So does it apply equally

1509
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:24,560
for modeling inert rocks as well as

1510
01:17:25,330 --> 01:17:28,578
the most complex system we know of in

1511
01:17:28,584 --> 01:17:30,850
the whole universe, namely the brain?

1512
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:34,626
So the response this line of

1513
01:17:34,648 --> 01:17:38,098
criticism got from the researchers in

1514
01:17:38,104 --> 01:17:41,590
the active inference area, again,

1515
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:44,966
to the best of my understanding, is to

1516
01:17:44,988 --> 01:17:48,754
the effect that although theoretically,

1517
01:17:48,882 --> 01:17:52,140
it can be applied to many

1518
01:17:53,550 --> 01:17:56,842
different systems with many

1519
01:17:56,896 --> 01:17:59,754
different levels of complexity. But then

1520
01:17:59,792 --> 01:18:03,714
again, for simple linear systems

1521
01:18:03,782 --> 01:18:07,546
such as I don't know, many non

1522
01:18:07,578 --> 01:18:09,230
complex systems,

1523
01:18:10,370 --> 01:18:12,894
it doesn't have anything interesting to

1524
01:18:12,932 --> 01:18:16,530
say. So rather than being

1525
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:19,586
applicable to all of these systems, the

1526
01:18:19,608 --> 01:18:21,460
relevant question should. Be.

1527
01:18:25,190 --> 01:18:28,554
There are enough insights we can gain

1528
01:18:28,622 --> 01:18:32,662
from applying this notion to many

1529
01:18:32,716 --> 01:18:36,418
different situations and systems.

1530
01:18:36,514 --> 01:18:40,390
So I believe Toby's

1531
01:18:41,230 --> 01:18:44,586
alternative for this problem by

1532
01:18:44,768 --> 01:18:48,986
proposing the polynomial function as

1533
01:18:49,008 --> 01:18:52,778
a replacement for Markup blanket can

1534
01:18:52,944 --> 01:18:56,042
cover this line of criticism pretty

1535
01:18:56,176 --> 01:18:58,074
nicely. It can address this criticism

1536
01:18:58,122 --> 01:19:02,378
pretty nicely due to its abstractness

1537
01:19:02,474 --> 01:19:06,306
and a kind of more rigorous way of

1538
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:10,402
talking about both the universality and

1539
01:19:10,536 --> 01:19:13,074
the individuality of each system.

1540
01:19:13,192 --> 01:19:16,946
So I think that's a

1541
01:19:16,968 --> 01:19:20,726
nice way to at least a

1542
01:19:20,748 --> 01:19:24,182
viable answer to this

1543
01:19:24,316 --> 01:19:27,158
question that needs a lot more

1544
01:19:27,244 --> 01:19:31,074
consideration. So that's my take on

1545
01:19:31,132 --> 01:19:32,380
it as far as.

1546
01:19:34,350 --> 01:19:38,060
Okay, I'll give my

1547
01:19:39,070 --> 01:19:42,986
take two, which is the

1548
01:19:43,008 --> 01:19:45,774
Markov blanket concept, since the work

1549
01:19:45,812 --> 01:19:48,960
of Pearl in the 1990s is

1550
01:19:49,730 --> 01:19:51,582
actually not doing that much

1551
01:19:51,636 --> 01:19:54,254
philosophical work in and of itself. It

1552
01:19:54,292 --> 01:19:56,798
just describes the parents, the children

1553
01:19:56,884 --> 01:19:59,614
and the coparents of any given node

1554
01:19:59,662 --> 01:20:01,314
within a graph. So first, we're talking

1555
01:20:01,352 --> 01:20:03,554
about maps, not territories. We're not

1556
01:20:03,592 --> 01:20:04,930
talking about features of the world,

1557
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,254
carving nature of the joints,

1558
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:09,166
necessarily hashtag malandrus. We're

1559
01:20:09,198 --> 01:20:11,254
talking about the Bayesian graph. And

1560
01:20:11,292 --> 01:20:14,614
secondly, even on the graph, it's not

1561
01:20:14,652 --> 01:20:17,734
that a node is like by its essence an

1562
01:20:17,772 --> 01:20:19,990
internal state or a blanket state or an

1563
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:21,478
action state if you use the Friston

1564
01:20:21,494 --> 01:20:22,986
blanket. Rather it's always in

1565
01:20:23,008 --> 01:20:25,574
relationship to others. So the concept

1566
01:20:25,622 --> 01:20:27,434
by itself does very little work.

1567
01:20:27,552 --> 01:20:30,346
However, people have deployed the

1568
01:20:30,368 --> 01:20:34,062
concept implicitly and explicitly to

1569
01:20:34,116 --> 01:20:36,554
describe interfaces of cybernetic

1570
01:20:36,602 --> 01:20:39,454
entities, the kinds of entities that it

1571
01:20:39,492 --> 01:20:41,706
makes sense to describe as an active

1572
01:20:41,738 --> 01:20:44,926
inference agent. So we know from the

1573
01:20:45,108 --> 01:20:48,686
particular physics and the strange kinds

1574
01:20:48,798 --> 01:20:51,986
work the path integrals paper that we

1575
01:20:52,008 --> 01:20:55,586
can describe using the

1576
01:20:55,608 --> 01:20:58,786
formalism, the rocks, the simple active

1577
01:20:58,818 --> 01:21:00,946
systems and the sophisticated active

1578
01:21:00,978 --> 01:21:04,662
systems. In. Order to have

1579
01:21:04,716 --> 01:21:08,418
an interface concept that does justice

1580
01:21:08,514 --> 01:21:12,118
to on one hand the relatively inert

1581
01:21:12,294 --> 01:21:15,274
interfaces, on the other hand,

1582
01:21:15,392 --> 01:21:18,474
potentially extremely conditional or

1583
01:21:18,512 --> 01:21:20,250
contextual interfaces.

1584
01:21:22,830 --> 01:21:26,960
Just having some

1585
01:21:27,570 --> 01:21:30,846
tagging system of nodes on

1586
01:21:30,868 --> 01:21:33,114
a Bayes graph is going to get extremely

1587
01:21:33,162 --> 01:21:35,326
messy. It's not that it couldn't be

1588
01:21:35,348 --> 01:21:36,882
done, but just in terms of actually

1589
01:21:36,936 --> 01:21:39,106
doing the programming, it's going to be

1590
01:21:39,128 --> 01:21:41,426
extremely messy. You're going to need to

1591
01:21:41,448 --> 01:21:43,902
have a lot of accessory or auxiliary

1592
01:21:43,966 --> 01:21:47,746
variables that indicate what the

1593
01:21:47,768 --> 01:21:49,686
current interface is at this time or

1594
01:21:49,708 --> 01:21:51,766
what it would be if this happened. And

1595
01:21:51,788 --> 01:21:53,910
all these kinds of conditionalities

1596
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:58,486
would be like a less elegant way of

1597
01:21:58,588 --> 01:22:01,054
describing what our category theory

1598
01:22:01,122 --> 01:22:02,710
colleagues have been developing

1599
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:05,226
explicitly with the wiring diagrams and

1600
01:22:05,248 --> 01:22:07,526
interfaces. So just to kind of conclude

1601
01:22:07,558 --> 01:22:10,214
there people draw the Bayesian graphs

1602
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:13,806
and the particular physics is using

1603
01:22:13,908 --> 01:22:16,720
a Bayesian graph. However,

1604
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:20,286
Bayesian graphs don't naturally have a

1605
01:22:20,308 --> 01:22:23,422
lot of these properties that

1606
01:22:23,476 --> 01:22:27,870
were really being conflated

1607
01:22:27,950 --> 01:22:31,682
with interfaces more generally. And by

1608
01:22:31,736 --> 01:22:33,854
using an interface concept, as Toby

1609
01:22:33,902 --> 01:22:35,266
said, at an intermediate level of

1610
01:22:35,288 --> 01:22:37,822
abstraction, that's slightly opinionated

1611
01:22:37,886 --> 01:22:41,106
but also really flexible, that is kind

1612
01:22:41,128 --> 01:22:43,222
of the right coarse graining, the right

1613
01:22:43,276 --> 01:22:47,014
optimal grasp on the interfaces that we

1614
01:22:47,052 --> 01:22:50,546
actually want to talk about for active

1615
01:22:50,578 --> 01:22:53,094
inference agents. And again, just trying

1616
01:22:53,132 --> 01:22:55,866
to get down to the firmware with the

1617
01:22:55,888 --> 01:22:58,086
Bayesian graph, we're going to get lost

1618
01:22:58,118 --> 01:22:59,846
in the details. And any accounting

1619
01:22:59,878 --> 01:23:02,074
system that we develop is going to be ad

1620
01:23:02,112 --> 01:23:04,266
hoc and certainly less principled or

1621
01:23:04,288 --> 01:23:05,974
powerful than what the category

1622
01:23:06,022 --> 01:23:09,354
theorists are developing. Yes.

1623
01:23:09,392 --> 01:23:12,766
Dean, I'm really curious what you

1624
01:23:12,788 --> 01:23:15,566
think of this. If we're talking about

1625
01:23:15,588 --> 01:23:19,250
the relationship with the interface,

1626
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:23,922
could we see and I'm really asking this

1627
01:23:23,976 --> 01:23:26,574
question. I don't know, I'm spitballing

1628
01:23:26,702 --> 01:23:30,230
could we see the Markov blanket as the

1629
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:32,566
more stabilized version or form of the

1630
01:23:32,588 --> 01:23:38,770
relationship and see the polynomial

1631
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:42,506
version of that as the search version of

1632
01:23:42,528 --> 01:23:43,994
that relationship? What do you guys

1633
01:23:44,032 --> 01:23:44,940
think of that?

1634
01:23:51,070 --> 01:23:53,946
And I'm really asking, just listening to

1635
01:23:53,968 --> 01:23:56,394
both of you talk here, I'm just

1636
01:23:56,432 --> 01:23:58,718
wondering if I'm having one of those

1637
01:23:58,884 --> 01:24:03,280
unitary moments myself or if I'm way out

1638
01:24:03,650 --> 01:24:04,400
to.

1639
01:24:07,010 --> 01:24:09,098
Ali, give a first thought, then I'll

1640
01:24:09,114 --> 01:24:10,820
also give a speculative answer.

1641
01:24:12,870 --> 01:24:17,138
Yes. So one thing that comes to mind is,

1642
01:24:17,304 --> 01:24:21,458
you see, sometimes people consider

1643
01:24:21,544 --> 01:24:25,570
markup blanket as being a kind of static

1644
01:24:25,650 --> 01:24:28,870
boundary or interface that just

1645
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:31,174
separates the agent from its

1646
01:24:31,212 --> 01:24:34,502
environment. But actually what it really

1647
01:24:34,556 --> 01:24:39,642
is is kind of providing really

1648
01:24:39,696 --> 01:24:43,098
a dynamic interface between those two

1649
01:24:43,184 --> 01:24:46,006
internal and external states. So it's

1650
01:24:46,038 --> 01:24:49,150
not a static or stabilized in any way.

1651
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:52,174
But of course, in some situations we

1652
01:24:52,212 --> 01:24:55,454
treat it as if it's stable or,

1653
01:24:55,572 --> 01:25:00,038
I don't know, static coding.

1654
01:25:00,154 --> 01:25:03,694
Maxwell Ramstead every theory of markup

1655
01:25:03,742 --> 01:25:07,234
blanket is inherently per se, so there

1656
01:25:07,272 --> 01:25:10,798
isn't any static conception

1657
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:13,400
of markup blanket at all.

1658
01:25:14,410 --> 01:25:16,600
But on the other hand, well,

1659
01:25:17,610 --> 01:25:19,960
obviously for the polynomial function,

1660
01:25:21,610 --> 01:25:24,262
not just polynomial function, but the

1661
01:25:24,316 --> 01:25:28,790
whole area, category theory deals

1662
01:25:28,870 --> 01:25:32,538
with objects not in their static sense,

1663
01:25:32,704 --> 01:25:36,774
but rather in the meaning

1664
01:25:36,822 --> 01:25:39,230
they acquire through their relations,

1665
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:41,854
through their morphisms. And it's not

1666
01:25:41,892 --> 01:25:45,594
about so one of the main differences

1667
01:25:45,642 --> 01:25:47,950
between category theory and the set

1668
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:52,494
theory is exactly hinges

1669
01:25:52,542 --> 01:25:55,342
on that distinction between the static

1670
01:25:55,406 --> 01:25:58,558
viewpoint of mathematical or, I don't

1671
01:25:58,574 --> 01:26:01,940
know even non mathematical objects and

1672
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:05,998
the inherently dynamical or relational

1673
01:26:06,174 --> 01:26:09,346
identity of the objects as defined

1674
01:26:09,378 --> 01:26:13,110
in categories. So I believe polynomial

1675
01:26:13,610 --> 01:26:17,400
functions again, by themselves

1676
01:26:17,930 --> 01:26:22,934
are inherently

1677
01:26:23,062 --> 01:26:24,870
and intrinsically dynamical,

1678
01:26:24,950 --> 01:26:28,558
perceptual, and in the

1679
01:26:28,564 --> 01:26:31,018
terms of some continental philosophers,

1680
01:26:31,034 --> 01:26:32,510
such as Alan Badu,

1681
01:26:34,530 --> 01:26:37,294
they acquire existence through their

1682
01:26:37,412 --> 01:26:38,720
imminent relations.

1683
01:26:41,810 --> 01:26:45,662
They don't need any notion of

1684
01:26:45,716 --> 01:26:48,974
pre existence as some of the Platonic

1685
01:26:49,022 --> 01:26:51,826
notions of mathematical objects and

1686
01:26:51,848 --> 01:26:54,982
ideas. So yes, in this

1687
01:26:55,036 --> 01:26:58,882
sense, I think polynomial

1688
01:26:59,026 --> 01:27:02,950
functions, I'm not sure which one

1689
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:05,738
can be seen as, I don't know, more

1690
01:27:05,904 --> 01:27:08,570
dynamic or processual than the other,

1691
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:12,326
but at least to a degree,

1692
01:27:12,438 --> 01:27:15,386
both of those concepts can be seen as

1693
01:27:15,568 --> 01:27:19,520
sufficiently processual, in my view.

1694
01:27:21,170 --> 01:27:23,534
Awesome. Okay, I'll just add with a few

1695
01:27:23,572 --> 01:27:26,926
other associative comments. One is to

1696
01:27:26,948 --> 01:27:28,686
blanket something is to dampen and

1697
01:27:28,708 --> 01:27:31,794
stabilize it, whereas polynomial seems

1698
01:27:31,832 --> 01:27:34,782
to invoke, like many names, polynomos,

1699
01:27:34,926 --> 01:27:37,906
polytopos. So potentially there's a

1700
01:27:37,928 --> 01:27:41,362
multiplicity in the polynomial that

1701
01:27:41,496 --> 01:27:44,998
is not acknowledged. So lexically in the

1702
01:27:45,004 --> 01:27:47,474
Markov blanket and then a more formal

1703
01:27:47,522 --> 01:27:50,946
way to say that would be a Markov

1704
01:27:50,978 --> 01:27:52,806
blanket might be like a specific

1705
01:27:52,908 --> 01:27:55,326
realization of some little neighborhood

1706
01:27:55,458 --> 01:27:58,694
within the polynomial. So polynomial

1707
01:27:58,742 --> 01:28:00,218
functor is a generalization of the

1708
01:28:00,224 --> 01:28:02,890
Markov blanket. And so in that sense,

1709
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:06,314
it requires more searching and it is

1710
01:28:06,352 --> 01:28:08,766
more abstract and it is more general.

1711
01:28:08,948 --> 01:28:11,600
But when you do stabilize it down,

1712
01:28:12,530 --> 01:28:16,014
then the Markov blanket formalism may

1713
01:28:16,052 --> 01:28:19,754
absolutely apply. But wherever

1714
01:28:19,802 --> 01:28:22,302
the Markov blanket formalism does apply,

1715
01:28:22,436 --> 01:28:24,046
like, let's just say that we stabilize

1716
01:28:24,078 --> 01:28:26,354
down to a computer system and we have an

1717
01:28:26,392 --> 01:28:28,418
API and we consider that that's one of

1718
01:28:28,424 --> 01:28:31,554
our blanket states. That would

1719
01:28:31,592 --> 01:28:35,250
also be seen as an interface, of course,

1720
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:36,886
which is happy we'll talk about it. And

1721
01:28:36,908 --> 01:28:39,080
so it would be a polynomial function.

1722
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:44,214
And so this helps us look back at

1723
01:28:44,252 --> 01:28:47,500
the literature and see,

1724
01:28:48,110 --> 01:28:50,854
as has been done many, many times in FEP

1725
01:28:50,902 --> 01:28:54,358
and other literatures, recent

1726
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:56,742
developments enable previous

1727
01:28:56,806 --> 01:28:58,974
developments not to be invalidated, but

1728
01:28:59,012 --> 01:29:01,758
understood as special cases or

1729
01:29:01,844 --> 01:29:04,270
constrained or stabilized cases.

1730
01:29:05,010 --> 01:29:06,894
And it only makes sense that we would

1731
01:29:06,932 --> 01:29:07,520
start.

1732
01:29:09,990 --> 01:29:13,826
Well, putting aside what makes sense in

1733
01:29:13,848 --> 01:29:16,082
active inference, it seems that we are

1734
01:29:16,136 --> 01:29:20,206
taking both paths. In some cases leading

1735
01:29:20,238 --> 01:29:22,506
with the stabilized and generalizing,

1736
01:29:22,638 --> 01:29:25,842
but in other situations making unstable

1737
01:29:25,906 --> 01:29:30,194
generalizations that then precipitate

1738
01:29:30,242 --> 01:29:33,720
stability inside of them.

1739
01:29:36,010 --> 01:29:37,930
So more bi directionality.

1740
01:29:43,530 --> 01:29:46,934
Great. Well, we will have

1741
01:29:46,972 --> 01:29:51,434
a 54.3 with

1742
01:29:51,472 --> 01:29:54,266
a focus more on action. Are there any

1743
01:29:54,288 --> 01:29:57,766
other topics that you fellas

1744
01:29:57,798 --> 01:29:59,498
would like to raise? Or if anyone in the

1745
01:29:59,504 --> 01:30:02,046
chat wants to ask a question, please go

1746
01:30:02,068 --> 01:30:05,520
for it. In our last bit here,

1747
01:30:06,050 --> 01:30:08,234
let's look back to the table of contents

1748
01:30:08,282 --> 01:30:11,390
or Ali, please go for it. No,

1749
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:16,786
just I wanted to ask Toby about the

1750
01:30:16,808 --> 01:30:20,834
relationship between his theory or

1751
01:30:20,872 --> 01:30:23,902
compositional account of statistical

1752
01:30:24,046 --> 01:30:28,854
inference as opposed to the

1753
01:30:28,892 --> 01:30:31,906
category theoretical account developed

1754
01:30:31,938 --> 01:30:34,678
about, I don't know, more than probably

1755
01:30:34,764 --> 01:30:38,354
ten years ago by people like Bob Kirky

1756
01:30:38,402 --> 01:30:42,074
and others specifically related to

1757
01:30:42,112 --> 01:30:44,202
the distinction between classical and

1758
01:30:44,256 --> 01:30:47,370
non classical Bayesian inference.

1759
01:30:48,270 --> 01:30:51,898
That's been clearly distinguished

1760
01:30:51,994 --> 01:30:57,034
in one of the papers from 2011.

1761
01:30:57,082 --> 01:31:00,126
I guess so, yeah. That's one question I

1762
01:31:00,148 --> 01:31:02,526
wanted to ask Toby, and of course a

1763
01:31:02,548 --> 01:31:05,614
subsequent question about the relation

1764
01:31:05,662 --> 01:31:09,598
of this distinction nondistinction

1765
01:31:09,774 --> 01:31:13,182
to the accounts of quantum FEP.

1766
01:31:13,246 --> 01:31:16,370
Because in quantum FEP markup blanket

1767
01:31:16,810 --> 01:31:19,794
is kind of replaced, or rather blended

1768
01:31:19,842 --> 01:31:24,370
with the notion of holographic

1769
01:31:24,530 --> 01:31:29,434
inner screen. So how

1770
01:31:29,472 --> 01:31:33,434
can we see quantum FEP as

1771
01:31:33,472 --> 01:31:37,130
arising from quantum Bayesianism

1772
01:31:38,510 --> 01:31:40,854
rather than from, I don't know,

1773
01:31:40,992 --> 01:31:43,806
predictive quantum theory and the

1774
01:31:43,828 --> 01:31:46,926
relation between those two frameworks of

1775
01:31:46,948 --> 01:31:51,230
Bayesian inference to that topic?

1776
01:31:53,750 --> 01:31:57,758
Awesome. Yes, the quantum

1777
01:31:57,934 --> 01:32:02,690
category theory active FEP triangle.

1778
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:10,844
And also, I think the

1779
01:32:10,882 --> 01:32:16,316
question about reading the literature in

1780
01:32:16,338 --> 01:32:18,860
terms of the interfaces between a work

1781
01:32:18,930 --> 01:32:21,436
and the citations, I think is extremely

1782
01:32:21,548 --> 01:32:25,100
rich. It's a really novel

1783
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:27,840
way to perform bibliographic

1784
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:32,050
metaanalysis, but also just in our own

1785
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:33,860
learning journeys.

1786
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:40,500
This following this category theory

1787
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,124
dictum of knowing a thing by its

1788
01:32:43,162 --> 01:32:46,856
relations understanding the paper

1789
01:32:46,958 --> 01:32:49,704
within the web of the past papers which

1790
01:32:49,742 --> 01:32:52,344
it cites, all of which are past and

1791
01:32:52,382 --> 01:32:56,344
actual and then its future time cone of

1792
01:32:56,382 --> 01:32:58,076
possible relationships to things that

1793
01:32:58,098 --> 01:33:00,296
haven't happened yet. The co parents

1794
01:33:00,328 --> 01:33:02,488
haven't even happened yet, necessarily.

1795
01:33:02,664 --> 01:33:05,032
But that becomes part of the evaluation

1796
01:33:05,096 --> 01:33:06,910
of the significance in the moment.

1797
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:10,604
And if we could have the right

1798
01:33:10,642 --> 01:33:12,704
generative model and understand how much

1799
01:33:12,742 --> 01:33:15,010
attention to weight onto different

1800
01:33:15,540 --> 01:33:18,224
things in the moment, that would be like

1801
01:33:18,262 --> 01:33:21,296
being able to see the whole time cone at

1802
01:33:21,318 --> 01:33:23,316
the right core screening. But of course,

1803
01:33:23,338 --> 01:33:25,572
as limited nest mates we can't do that.

1804
01:33:25,706 --> 01:33:28,592
But we have our rules, our heuristics

1805
01:33:28,656 --> 01:33:31,076
and our approaches that address that

1806
01:33:31,098 --> 01:33:32,020
nonetheless.

1807
01:33:34,940 --> 01:33:37,336
Anyone in the Chat or Dean, what would

1808
01:33:37,358 --> 01:33:40,090
you like to explore in 54.3?

1809
01:33:43,180 --> 01:33:47,108
I'm just going to follow the two of you.

1810
01:33:47,294 --> 01:33:50,524
I got two big workhorses here.

1811
01:33:50,722 --> 01:33:52,188
I just got to get out of the way so I

1812
01:33:52,194 --> 01:33:53,340
don't get trampled.

1813
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:00,380
Let's look at the table of contents

1814
01:34:03,140 --> 01:34:06,448
here. We're just shifting to the code of

1815
01:34:06,454 --> 01:34:08,384
document, the back end that we use to

1816
01:34:08,422 --> 01:34:12,096
coordinate a lot of our work just

1817
01:34:12,118 --> 01:34:15,270
so that it can all be seen in the video.

1818
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:20,790
Chapter one is short.

1819
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:27,108
Chapter two, if someone is looking for

1820
01:34:27,194 --> 01:34:29,432
another account of like, why does

1821
01:34:29,486 --> 01:34:31,370
category theory matter?

1822
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:34,392
Toby begins chapter two with three

1823
01:34:34,446 --> 01:34:38,344
examples of situations neural circuits,

1824
01:34:38,392 --> 01:34:40,044
Bayesian networks and computations where

1825
01:34:40,082 --> 01:34:42,172
people often just use a kind of

1826
01:34:42,226 --> 01:34:45,480
schematic diagram but it's not necessary

1827
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:48,924
or sufficient to really convey all of

1828
01:34:48,962 --> 01:34:52,384
the richness that we can add on with

1829
01:34:52,422 --> 01:34:53,760
category theory.

1830
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:00,944
Chapter three starts getting into more

1831
01:35:00,982 --> 01:35:04,084
detail with string diagrams and

1832
01:35:04,122 --> 01:35:06,804
developing towards circuit diagrams in

1833
01:35:06,842 --> 01:35:09,220
this rate coding neural setting,

1834
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:12,964
a lot more new vocabulary arising along

1835
01:35:13,002 --> 01:35:16,344
the way. Chapter four,

1836
01:35:16,462 --> 01:35:19,192
which the question the beginning of this

1837
01:35:19,326 --> 01:35:22,760
Livestream brought a focus to, is on

1838
01:35:22,830 --> 01:35:24,904
the compositional aspects of

1839
01:35:24,942 --> 01:35:28,600
probability. The copy discard

1840
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:32,396
structure is introduced, which we saw in

1841
01:35:32,418 --> 01:35:34,364
the diagram today. That's when the piece

1842
01:35:34,402 --> 01:35:35,996
of information is duplicated and then

1843
01:35:36,018 --> 01:35:39,876
one of them can be thrown away Bayesian

1844
01:35:39,928 --> 01:35:43,388
inversion, the dagger, Lady Macbeth's

1845
01:35:43,404 --> 01:35:47,420
dagger always just dangling

1846
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:51,324
there. Then the growth

1847
01:35:51,372 --> 01:35:53,940
and deek construction,

1848
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:59,312
bringing back strong recall

1849
01:35:59,456 --> 01:36:02,304
of Shauna Dobson, Chris Field's, math,

1850
01:36:02,352 --> 01:36:05,690
art and the complexity of the self.

1851
01:36:08,940 --> 01:36:12,420
Chapter five went into dynamical

1852
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:16,520
systems. Markov chains

1853
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:23,020
open and closed dynamical systems

1854
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,700
with this polynomial interface concept.

1855
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:31,676
It's really built up in an extremely

1856
01:36:31,868 --> 01:36:36,012
methodical way. First the dynamical

1857
01:36:36,076 --> 01:36:39,280
system is kept, within a nutshell,

1858
01:36:39,780 --> 01:36:41,676
extremely bounded, but then it's

1859
01:36:41,708 --> 01:36:44,164
progressively opened up. And so even

1860
01:36:44,202 --> 01:36:46,324
though it's going to be a lot of new

1861
01:36:46,362 --> 01:36:48,240
information reading the dissertation,

1862
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:50,932
it's done in a way that does also

1863
01:36:50,986 --> 01:36:54,470
clearly build upon itself. Chapter six

1864
01:36:54,780 --> 01:36:58,356
goes into the Bayesian lenses, connects

1865
01:36:58,388 --> 01:37:02,532
to several more prevalent concepts

1866
01:37:02,596 --> 01:37:04,484
in statistics maximum likelihood

1867
01:37:04,532 --> 01:37:06,036
estimation, approximate Bayesian

1868
01:37:06,068 --> 01:37:09,768
inference, auto encoders, and connects

1869
01:37:09,784 --> 01:37:13,116
this to the emerging concepts of

1870
01:37:13,218 --> 01:37:17,196
Bayesian lenses and statistical games in

1871
01:37:17,218 --> 01:37:18,856
terms of the approximate inference

1872
01:37:18,888 --> 01:37:21,836
doctrines in chapter seven. Yeah, Ali,

1873
01:37:21,868 --> 01:37:24,912
please. No, I just wanted to mention

1874
01:37:25,046 --> 01:37:26,800
this particular chapter is being

1875
01:37:26,870 --> 01:37:29,344
rewritten at the moment, so yeah,

1876
01:37:29,382 --> 01:37:32,692
that's thank you. Absolutely. Yes.

1877
01:37:32,746 --> 01:37:34,064
As we discussed a little earlier,

1878
01:37:34,112 --> 01:37:37,844
chapter six is going to get simpler but

1879
01:37:37,882 --> 01:37:40,048
better, but it was tricky. But it's

1880
01:37:40,064 --> 01:37:42,196
simpler. But it's better. But it was

1881
01:37:42,218 --> 01:37:42,980
tricky.

1882
01:37:45,260 --> 01:37:48,584
And then chapter seven closes it out,

1883
01:37:48,622 --> 01:37:50,776
but really opens it up with the

1884
01:37:50,798 --> 01:37:53,732
compositional, cognitive cartography

1885
01:37:53,876 --> 01:37:56,904
sailing the Three Seas society of

1886
01:37:56,942 --> 01:37:58,940
systems more alliteration,

1887
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:03,256
many, many connections to areas

1888
01:38:03,288 --> 01:38:06,008
of interest for all system scientists

1889
01:38:06,104 --> 01:38:08,380
and complexity enthusiasts.

1890
01:38:11,940 --> 01:38:16,176
What a tour de force and a

1891
01:38:16,198 --> 01:38:18,896
journey. And it's going to be awesome

1892
01:38:18,998 --> 01:38:22,596
that we'll get to see some of the

1893
01:38:22,618 --> 01:38:26,404
next increments in the work. Talk more

1894
01:38:26,442 --> 01:38:28,900
with Toby. Yes, Dean?

1895
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:32,676
Can I just throw this in? And it's going

1896
01:38:32,698 --> 01:38:37,448
to indicate how old I am. But a

1897
01:38:37,454 --> 01:38:40,372
long time ago, the first time a needle

1898
01:38:40,436 --> 01:38:44,040
dropped on the first Van Halen album,

1899
01:38:45,020 --> 01:38:47,996
something changed about everything that

1900
01:38:48,018 --> 01:38:50,636
we thought about guitar playing. And if

1901
01:38:50,658 --> 01:38:53,484
you weren't there in that moment, you

1902
01:38:53,522 --> 01:38:56,312
wouldn't know how everything changed.

1903
01:38:56,376 --> 01:39:00,400
I'm not sure what category theory taken

1904
01:39:00,470 --> 01:39:03,824
up on a mass scale will do if it will be

1905
01:39:03,862 --> 01:39:09,008
the equivalent moment for all people

1906
01:39:09,094 --> 01:39:13,044
who use math in all the

1907
01:39:13,082 --> 01:39:15,780
different ways that they use it, but I

1908
01:39:15,850 --> 01:39:19,236
think that we are at the beginning of

1909
01:39:19,258 --> 01:39:23,252
something that it is going to change

1910
01:39:23,386 --> 01:39:25,464
things. And I don't know exactly how

1911
01:39:25,502 --> 01:39:28,776
it's going to change things, but I

1912
01:39:28,798 --> 01:39:33,380
think this will always now be included

1913
01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:37,192
as how we try to both

1914
01:39:37,246 --> 01:39:41,096
figure things out and out the figures in

1915
01:39:41,118 --> 01:39:42,708
that three dimensional space. I mean,

1916
01:39:42,734 --> 01:39:43,836
one of the things that I thought was

1917
01:39:43,858 --> 01:39:45,944
interesting in the dot one was when Toby

1918
01:39:45,992 --> 01:39:49,852
said, well, I work in 2D space and

1919
01:39:49,986 --> 01:39:51,776
now I'm curious about I wonder what that

1920
01:39:51,798 --> 01:39:55,244
would look like. Well, we exist

1921
01:39:55,292 --> 01:39:57,616
in a 3D space and so I think the

1922
01:39:57,638 --> 01:40:00,096
applicability of it is going off at any

1923
01:40:00,118 --> 01:40:03,044
given moment. But I do really think this

1924
01:40:03,082 --> 01:40:04,470
is the start of something.

1925
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:10,308
I'm not sure exactly what, but I

1926
01:40:10,314 --> 01:40:11,936
don't think we'll be able to unlearn

1927
01:40:11,968 --> 01:40:13,792
this. I think it's going to remain

1928
01:40:13,856 --> 01:40:15,690
influential for a long time.

1929
01:40:17,580 --> 01:40:20,724
For those about to categorify, we salute

1930
01:40:20,772 --> 01:40:24,776
you. Yeah. Right. There we

1931
01:40:24,798 --> 01:40:26,410
go. Thank you.

1932
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:29,470
You can always make it better.

1933
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:36,620
Any other thoughts on this? Otherwise.

1934
01:40:41,750 --> 01:40:45,154
Great. Yeah. Ali, please with any last

1935
01:40:45,192 --> 01:40:48,306
thoughts? No, I just wanted to say

1936
01:40:48,328 --> 01:40:50,322
I'm really looking forward for the next

1937
01:40:50,376 --> 01:40:52,562
installment. I hope it happens soon

1938
01:40:52,616 --> 01:40:56,854
because again, I have so many

1939
01:40:56,892 --> 01:41:00,646
burning questions. I try mean

1940
01:41:00,748 --> 01:41:04,518
whittle it down to some I don't know,

1941
01:41:04,604 --> 01:41:06,966
not too much time consuming questions.

1942
01:41:07,068 --> 01:41:11,698
But yeah, I'm really interested in I'm

1943
01:41:11,794 --> 01:41:14,582
curious to know Toby's answers to them.

1944
01:41:14,636 --> 01:41:17,046
So thank you so much for everything,

1945
01:41:17,148 --> 01:41:19,790
for organizing this and inviting Toby.

1946
01:41:20,210 --> 01:41:23,758
Oh, absolutely. All right,

1947
01:41:23,924 --> 01:41:27,760
thank you, everybody. See you in 54.3.

1948
01:41:32,370 --> 01:41:32,650
Bye.
