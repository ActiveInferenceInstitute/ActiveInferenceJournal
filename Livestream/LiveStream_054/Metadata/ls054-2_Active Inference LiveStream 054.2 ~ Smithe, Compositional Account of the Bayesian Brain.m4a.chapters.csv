250	45820	00:00	This is a recorded and an arch Live Livestream. We're a participatory online institute that is communicating, learning, and practicing applied active inference. All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome and we'll follow video etiquette for Live Streams. Head over to activeinference. org to learn more about participating in Live streams.	The active institute is communicating, learning, and practicing applied active inference	Welcome to the Active Institute's Live Stream
46480	665564	00:46	Dean Ali and Toby will discuss the foundations for a compositional account of the Bayesian brain. What does it mean for Bayes theorem to be categorified? And where is that in the dissertation? And we have some questions that people have submitted.	Dean Ali and Toby have some questions for us on Bayesian brain	Bayes' Theorem and Compositional Probability Theory
665682	942950	11:05	The rewritten version of chapter six is close to being online. It's simpler but also kind of more structured. Should I dig deeper into chapter six until the updated observations arrive? Or is chapter six something that won't change too much?	I'm mostly wondering about how chapter six will be rewritten	Chapter 6
944920	1268030	15:44	You cite Erisman and Van Bermesh work on memory evolution systems. Would it be correct to say that there might exist a functor from that book to your dissertation or indeed to any of your citations? Is there work someone could do to explore the connection between the two?	You cite Erisman and Van Bermesh work on memory evolution systems	Inference and memory evolutive systems
1268720	2059690	21:08	In the par, pazulo and Friston 2022 active inference textbook, the first question in the recipe for designing an active inference model is which system? This entails three pieces of data one, the agent generative model, two, the interface sensory data and actions, and three, the external environment, the generative process.	Mark: How does the recipe for making an active inference model map to dissertation	Active Inference 1, Designing a model
2060940	2196484	34:20	The whole bi directionality, the whole predictive parabolic. You can bring this into classrooms and have it make sense. It doesn't have to be esoteric or too remote. There's lots left to do, but an important part of that is like spreading the word.	Dean: Yeah, there's lots left to do with this project	Reveal: The Rehearsal Play
2196602	2240236	36:36	All right, in the rest of the time that we have with you for the two Toby. Your video is frozen. Maybe you can just turn it off. In basically three to ridiculously.	Your video is frozen. Maybe you can just turn it off	Your video is frozen Toby
2240268	2412922	37:20	Is there yet a recipe for designing the kind of categorical, kind of compositional organization that you alluded to? I can answer that quickly. What I've been thinking about lately is trying to fit active inference into that framework. The pictures I was sketching are kind of a fragment of that other framework.	Is there yet a recipe for designing the categorical, kind of compositional organization	Categorical Systems Theory and Active Inference
2413056	3136412	40:13	In your paper Polynomial life, you say in the literature on active inference, there is much debate about the concept and role of markup blankets. Instead you use this notion of polynomial functions as its more formal or perhaps more rigorous replacement.	There is much debate about the concept and role of markup blankets	Polynomial Functions and Markov Blankets
3136466	3488030	52:16	My second question is about the relation between your compositional account of active inference and the recent line of research done in Bayesian mechanics. The discovery of the duality between FEP and constraint maximum entropy principle. There are some really tantalizing connections between physics and information processing.	Second question is about relation between active inference and Bayesian mechanics	Bayesian inference and the constraint maximum entropy principle
3488740	3889010	58:08	Dean Obeidallah: What we have in systems theory is this category. You have this category of interfaces of systems and the morphisms tell you how to wire these systems together to give like hierarchical or like composite systems. Maybe there's a way to turn your description of a dynamical system into something that looks like an agent.	So what we have in systems theory is this category. You have this category of interfaces of systems	Inactive Inference and Systems Theory
3892050	4196890	1:04:52	Dean Obeidallah: What is the difference or how can we think about being on time in time and out of time? He says there is again, so much math in this philosophy that it's kind of staggering. To be able to explain that and draw it out is pretty impressive.	Dean: What is the difference between being in time and out of time	What is it to Be Out of Time?
4200910	4310030	1:10:00	Applied category theory can be seen as permeating all levels of knowledge. I'm really optimistic in the research direction that applied category theory is going. And hopefully in near future we can see it applied to many, many different areas.	John Bayes says applied category theory permeates all levels of knowledge	Advocacy of applied category theory
4312770	4522460	1:11:52	Ali: If you use an abductive logic lens, then it's simply a question of when did you enter. It's reminding me of Professor Mike Levin's work on basal cognition. Intelligence isn't on the top of the pyramid either. Rather, it's something that exists at all levels.	Ali: If you use an abductive logic lens, then it's	Abductive Logic: The Whenness of Intelligence
4526030	5053282	1:15:26	That brings us to the sensor fusion aspects of the dissertation 7.1.1 Bayesian sensor fusion. How universal is this notion as it's claimed to be ranging from inert rocks to the brains? Toby's alternative for this problem by proposing the polynomial function as a replacement for Markup blanket can cover this line of criticism.	Ali: Markov blanket concept has received a fair amount of criticism	Markov Blanket and Bayesian Sensor Fusion
5053336	5410000	1:24:13	Mark markup blanket is a dynamic interface between internal and external states. In some situations we treat it as if it's stable or, I don't know, static coding. But polynomial functions by themselves are inherently and intrinsically dynamical, perceptual. Are there any other topics that you fellas would like to raise?	Markov blanket provides dynamic interface between internal and external states	Markov Blanket and Polynomial Functions
5410930	5612020	1:30:10	I wanted to ask Toby about the relationship between his theory or compositional account of statistical inference as opposed to the category theoretical account. How can we see quantum FEP as arising from quantum Bayesianism rather than from predictive quantum theory?	I wanted to ask Toby about relation between Bayesian inference and quantum FEP	Quantum FEP and Bayesian Inference
5614940	6043314	1:33:34	Dean Obeidallah: What would you like to explore in 54.3? He says category theory is at the beginning of something that will change things. Chapter six is going to get simpler but better, but it was tricky. And then chapter seven closes it out with the compositional, cognitive cartography.	Ali: Dean, what would you like to explore in 54.3	54.3
6043352	6092650	1:40:43	Ali, please with any last thoughts? No, I just wanted to say I'm really looking forward for the next installment. I have so many burning questions. See you in 54.3.	Ali: I'm really looking forward to the next installment	5 burning questions for Toby
