3150	3700	A	0.546256959438324	You.
5670	7714	B	0.915437638759613	Hello and welcome everyone.
7912	12498	B	0.8339563012123108	This is active inference Livestream number 54.0.
12664	18050	B	0.8719437122344971	We're discussing mathematical foundations for a compositional account of the Bayesian Brain.
18630	20942	B	0.8058606386184692	Welcome to the active institute.
21086	28050	B	0.5337911248207092	We're a participatory online institute that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference.
28430	34906	B	0.5049800872802734	This is a recorded, archived and published Livestream, so please provide feedback so we can improve our work.
35088	51790	B	0.8819199204444885	All backgrounds and perspective are welcome and we'll follow video etiquette for Livestream, head over Active Inference.org to learn more about getting involved in live streams and in a variety of other projects and learning groups.
53090	76502	B	0.7021166086196899	All right, well, we're in stream number 54.0 and we're going to be learning and discussing the paper that was submitted on the 23 December 2022 as part of a dissertation work, mathematical Foundations for a Compositional Account of the Bayesian Brain by Toby St.
76556	77790	B	0.8524367213249207	Clair Smyth.
77970	83718	B	0.8861724138259888	The video is an introduction for some of the ideas in this multi hundred page thesis.
83814	103150	B	0.7612895369529724	It's not a review or a final word or a thesis dissertation committee, this 54.0, given the scope and the complexity, but also accessibility of the ideas, we're going to be approaching it in a familiar way, but also with some twists.
103810	109410	B	0.8894374370574951	We're going to begin with some introductions, the aims and claims, abstract and roadmap as usual.
110070	117714	B	0.8507471084594727	Then we're going to approach the keywords and the context in a slightly different way than we've done in a lot of other zeros.
117842	130458	B	0.9143462777137756	And then we're going to kind of bookend the dissertation and focus most on chapter one and chapter seven, the first and the final chapter and chapters two through six.
130544	135514	B	0.9322776198387146	We're looking forward to unpacking more with Toby in the coming weeks.
135712	140826	B	0.8939362168312073	So we'll begin with some introductions and warm ups.
140858	150430	B	0.9384974241256714	We could all just say hello and something that was exciting for us about the paper dissertation or what brought us to the work.
150500	151262	B	0.7286992073059082	I'll begin.
151396	152202	B	0.7465788722038269	I'm Daniel.
152266	173826	B	0.5733826756477356	I'm a researcher in California, and I have to say that six months ago, when we started this journey haw on the heels of the dissertation being posted when, along with Ali and Dean and others, we decided to embark on this weekly learning quest, I was very unfamiliar with category theory.
173938	178506	B	0.6150884032249451	And thankfully, after closing the window, it all escapes my mind.
178608	184940	B	0.5337610244750977	So it's been quite a six month period to learn and to forget so much.
185310	186970	B	0.80741947889328	I'll pass to Dean.
187550	188358	C	0.7800778746604919	Thanks, Daniel.
188374	190098	C	0.8865938782691956	I'm Dean, I'm here in Calgary.
190294	223938	C	0.7197777032852173	I think the thing for me, when it was first broached the idea of taking this up about a decade ago, I started just scratching the surface of this idea called category theory, and to see this amount of work put together, to sort of bring a whole bunch of ideas together and, as Daniel already mentioned, make it somewhat accessible or I don't know if it's a beginner's guide or a category theory for dummies.
224034	224390	C	0.5662814974784851	Exactly.
224460	226934	C	0.79316645860672	Because there's still a lot in here.
227052	241238	C	0.8742747902870178	But in terms of giving us an opportunity to get some verifications, for me, at least that's what I got with some validations and some verifications was really helpful.
241334	251390	C	0.9813786745071411	So I am excited about having a chance to talk about this and bring the author on eventually and have that conversation get extended and I'll pass it over to Ali.
255710	256650	A	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
256800	260326	A	0.9134550094604492	I'm Allie, I'm an independent researcher from Iran.
260518	275070	A	0.5733043551445007	Well, I also had just a passing familiarity with category theory and wasn't familiar at all with lots of terminology and formalism in this thesis.
275570	287140	A	0.7720946669578552	But after covering the whole thesis in our six month period, it now begins to make much more sense.
289670	304494	A	0.685627281665802	I definitely started seeing category theory in almost everywhere, both in sciences and also in some other, not specifically scientific areas.
304642	314074	A	0.9884111881256104	So I'm really excited to have these discussions with Toby and learn even a lot more.
314192	314860	A	0.6283750534057617	Thanks.
315630	316650	B	0.5708940029144287	Excellent.
317230	319100	B	0.509720504283905	All right, on we go.
320110	322466	B	0.9211626052856445	We'll begin here with a meta prompt.
322598	331730	B	0.7626751065254211	So for all of you human and non human language models, please fill your context window with this metaprompt.
335350	336900	B	0.7151724696159363	On to the big questions.
337270	343810	B	0.8543499112129211	So we have some hidden questions that are in white font below that those who go to the slides will find and discover.
343970	347080	B	0.7583631873130798	But we raised many questions.
347530	352086	B	0.9008405208587646	And Dean or Ali, what's just a question that strikes you today?
352188	357606	B	0.8378344774246216	What is a question that would lead someone to come to this dissertation?
357798	365574	B	0.8985522389411926	And we're going to be covering a lot of Toby's summaries in terms of the contributions, Ames claims and foci of the dissertation.
365622	372510	B	0.7870781421661377	But what does this dissertation ask or what would somebody ask to get to this dissertation?
375090	376430	B	0.7332368493080139	Yeah, please, Dean.
376850	392174	C	0.7288091778755188	I think the first thing for me was if we are pattern seekers and pattern impliers, then if you're going to look at what the formalism behind that is, then this is a good place to start.
392232	410090	C	0.7438915967941284	If you want to know why we tend to put things into groups, why things have a world where there's something that's in a category or outside of a category, and most importantly, where are the things that aren't in either of those two places?
410510	417420	C	0.7203313708305359	This gives you some of the operational backbone to be able to start figuring that out.
419090	419840	B	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
421650	423840	B	0.509720504283905	All right, on we go.
424450	426846	B	0.8397442102432251	Aims and claims of the paper.
427028	441266	B	0.930446207523346	So, paper or dissertation Draft mathematical Foundations for a Compositional Account of the Bayesian Brain was uploaded in late December 2022 and just several overview claims of the work.
441448	454680	B	0.6607792973518372	Our main aim in this thesis is to formalize predictive coding through functional semantics and Bayesian lenses will provide an important part of the syntax of statistical models that we need.
455530	465750	B	0.9006914496421814	In this 54.0 video, we're only going to cover chapter one and chapter seven, and we're going to review them for some really interesting, bold and ambitious claims.
465910	476670	B	0.9403899908065796	And there's a few great overview claims for the entire work that do a great job of just distilling down so many hundreds of pages and so many technical contributions from page seven.
476820	488862	B	0.8377690315246582	The main individual contribution of this thesis is the introduction of Bayesian lenses and the proof that Bayesian lenses compose optically and the first sentence of the abstract.
489006	495874	B	0.6887231469154358	This dissertation reports some first steps towards a compositional account of active inference and the Bayesian brain.
496002	498870	B	0.8757809996604919	Anything else to add on aims and claims?
502740	508660	B	0.8424723744392395	Okay, either of you please start with the first half of the abstract.
510040	510964	C	0.6675993204116821	I'll read it.
511082	512448	C	0.5029617547988892	Go for it, Dean.
512544	512900	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
512970	518496	C	0.7835619449615479	The dissertation reports some first steps towards compositional count of active inference and the Bayesian brain.
518608	528420	C	0.83762127161026	Specifically, we use the tools of contemporary applied category theory to supply functional semantics for approximate inference.
528580	535128	C	0.8837361931800842	To do so, we define, on the syntactic side, the new notion of Bayesian lenses.
535304	543420	C	0.7444704174995422	Think it's important to get the plural there and show that Bayesian updating composes according to the compositional lens pattern.
543940	556408	C	0.8146703243255615	Using Bayesian lenses, and inspired by compositional game theory, we define categories of statistical games and use them to classify various problems of statistical inference.
556524	583684	C	0.8210603594779968	On the semantic side, we present a new formalization of general open dynamical systems, particularly deterministic stochastic and random and discrete and continuous time as certain coalgebras of polynomial functions which we show collect into monoidal open text categories or alternatively, into algebras for multi categories of generalized polynomial functors.
583812	599692	C	0.8915600180625916	We use these openexed categories to define monoidal bicategories of cilia dynamical systems which control lenses and which supply detarget for our functorial semantics.
599756	601090	C	0.7451722621917725	Just one quick thing.
601780	608390	C	0.5535772442817688	If you're like me, you had to spend a lot of time finding out what do these words actually mean?
611800	619140	B	0.7457677125930786	We're going to come to talk more about words and Ali second half the abstract.
620700	637020	A	0.8569965362548828	Accordingly, we construct Funk tours which explain the bi directional compositional structure of predictive coding neural circuits under the free energy principle, thereby giving a formal mathematical underpinning to the bi directionality observed in the cortex.
637440	651680	A	0.8608947396278381	Along the way, we explain how to compose rate coded neural circuits using an algebra for a multicategory of linear circuit diagrams, showing subsequently that this is subsumed by lenses and polynomial functors.
652100	667830	A	0.6180635690689087	Because category theory is unfamiliar to many computational neuroscientists and cognitive scientists, we have made a particular effort to give clear, detailed and approachable expositions of all the category theoretical structures and results of which we make use.
668600	679240	A	0.9565609097480774	We hope that this dissertation will prove helpful in establishing a new well typed science of life and mind and in facilitating interdisciplinary communication.
680780	681530	B	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
682560	685660	B	0.7850655317306519	Okay, here's the roadmap.
686160	699120	B	0.8314239382743835	We're only showing a zoomed out view because if the other papers we've discussed were going on a road trip this is the continent scale road trip.
700340	705376	B	0.7032157778739929	The dissertation is 230 plus pages long.
705478	714660	B	0.8600584864616394	It's in seven chapters that are shown here, and in 54.0, we're going to be focusing on chapter one and chapter seven.
714810	718150	B	0.6009072065353394	So it's quite a piece of work.
718940	722468	B	0.8094789981842041	And this is just the background and context.
722564	727610	B	0.8912771940231323	There's a table of contents with more information and on what the chapters do.
728140	741852	B	0.7713801264762878	Let's take a few more steps or moments in the background and context to really set up the reading and expressing of this work and really this kind of work.
741986	747280	B	0.9698501229286194	So thanks a lot to Jr for preparing some of the following slides.
748100	758900	B	0.917792797088623	Here we have some selections from several works in mathematics and category theory on reading math.
760520	763568	B	0.925617516040802	There is a real joy in doing mathematics.
763744	769930	B	0.7049568891525269	We've all heard it before, but it really comes to be true when we enact it that way.
771740	785070	B	0.7856852412223816	The challenge of mathematical understanding is to find a way to make new mental images in oneself on the basis of formal definitions, to make these definitions intuitive, to feel what they are talking about.
786000	795016	B	0.922371506690979	And Jr's summary of some of the ways that math is utilized in this dissertation.
795128	802764	B	0.8729987144470215	So, in regards to the writing in this thesis, just like with anything else, something is being written for an audience.
802892	811952	B	0.6609830856323242	Toby is writing to an audience of domain experts and a dissertation committee, ultimately to demonstrate and embed new contributions to knowledge.
812096	816128	B	0.8391580581665039	He also takes a pedagogical approach, a teaching approach.
816304	821732	B	0.8835785388946533	And Jr asked, is this pedagogical approach something you see in most PhD?
821796	825610	B	0.6807669401168823	Theses briefly, I would suggest no.
826220	831930	B	0.5809153914451599	And on the reading of this thesis, it helps to be clear why we're reading it.
832460	840200	B	0.8104636073112488	If to help understand or sense make active inference models, then aim to read it at one level and take the rest on faith.
840360	849200	B	0.8073935508728027	If we want to understand the formality better of the really nitty gritty category theory itself, then read to that level and go deeper.
849700	854320	B	0.8983813524246216	Any thoughts, either of you fellows on the first Reading Math slide?
856580	857088	B	0.584351658821106	Okay.
857174	864864	B	0.9076126217842102	And on the second Reading Math slide, a few more great tips on just reading math and what we're doing with math.
864992	867344	B	0.6913511753082275	So, first, eyes on the prize.
867472	876660	B	0.8803550004959106	Math is a language, and as such, it's there to convey something about the world, about the structure of this thesis overall.
876820	887592	B	0.6089414358139038	And overwhelmingly, there is a plain English exposition of what concepts are needed and why, with nice transitions, foreshadowing and back references.
887736	901250	B	0.9347975850105286	There's also a true wealth of beautiful diagrams, which in category theory have a formality that those used to schema type diagrams will be pleasantly surprised by.
902180	904732	B	0.4959738552570343	They're definitely challenging to interpret.
904796	913140	B	0.7369976043701172	It is a new visual language for some, however, it's one that can be admired without necessarily needing all the formality.
914280	922564	B	0.8562751412391663	About roles of definitions in reading of math, what the audience knows is truth is a shared prior belief.
922692	924184	B	0.7940813899040222	Things start from there.
924382	936168	B	0.7157770395278931	These definitions are used to build up further truths through logic and the proofs, and from the Bessis citation in a mathematical text, the most important passages are neither proofs nor theorems.
936264	937640	B	0.6966814994812012	They are definitions.
937800	947068	B	0.8744931817054749	Mathematical language works as a construction game where words are truly defined, that is, constructed from other words that themselves have been previously defined.
947244	955600	B	0.7795053124427795	And about role of proofs in reading maths, very similar to providing well argued evidence in any technical writing.
957960	962896	B	0.8861405849456787	Math is technical writing with math as its particular structure.
963008	964644	B	0.909820020198822	And there's other great things to read.
964682	980552	B	0.5990937948226929	But that's all I'll mention here, just at an overview, are there any other thoughts that either of you would add just about reading math or reading this kind of technical work, which can be like getting dropped in the deep end.
980606	988712	B	0.7246986031532288	I mean, we're getting dropped into the cutting edge PhD contribution frontier of knowledge.
988776	1002748	B	0.712792694568634	So how do we negotiate that, especially when there are these esoteric or inscrutable symbolic systems that seemingly constitute the majority of the words in certain passages?
1002844	1003600	B	0.6498749256134033	Dean.
1005300	1029912	C	0.5018267631530762	I think this might be a slightly strange metaphor, but what I would equate this process to as a reader, I would equate it to being offered to build a 10,000 piece puzzle, except you have to build it backwards so you don't actually have the benefit of having image and contrast at first.
1029966	1037292	C	0.8616547584533691	All you basically have is the geometry, but when all the pieces fit together, you're then allowed to flip it over.
1037346	1039256	C	0.7084710001945496	So you have to be really committed.
1039288	1052530	C	0.7508504390716553	And my hat is often to the work that Toby has done because for him to make it coherent, given the actual volume of information that he would like to pass along.
1054420	1063940	C	0.4923209846019745	Part of my grinding through this was the thought in my head that if I'm grinding through this, I can't imagine what the author had to go through.
1064090	1068740	C	0.5249174237251282	So even if you're excited about this, it's still a huge commitment.
1071260	1071960	B	0.6716039180755615	So true.
1072030	1073210	B	0.8367794156074524	Ollie, anything?
1077260	1089944	A	0.7502015233039856	Just wanted to add that well, obviously category theory is very abstract discipline, even for mathematicians.
1090072	1110310	A	0.46213188767433167	So I agree with Dean that doing such a I mean, such an admirable task of organizing the materials of the dissertation in such a coherent way is truly a herculean task to do so.
1111400	1126680	A	0.8023101091384888	But another point is that, well, even in the realm of category theory, most of the things done so far is done in the purely mathematical world.
1126830	1145568	A	0.8150579929351807	So applying those concepts of category theoretical concepts to some realms outside of mathematics is something that's just been explored for the last few years at least.
1145654	1160788	A	0.5251346230506897	Seriously so I believe Toby didn't have much to start with, given that the scarcity of material in the applied category theory area.
1160874	1169324	A	0.8700568675994873	But of course it's a burgeoning field and it's gaining traction quite rapidly.
1169472	1182940	A	0.9840129613876343	So I hope to see much interesting works in the future and I believe Toby's dissertation will help a lot in shaping the future trajectories.
1184720	1188460	B	0.8967112302780151	Great comments about applied category theory.
1189520	1191768	B	0.7714195847511292	On to the keywords.
1191864	1200588	B	0.8064072728157043	So three big keywords are category theory, Bayesian brain and active inference.
1200764	1218790	B	0.6429293751716614	And then category theory is really a language of its own for some of the relevant keywords that we pulled out in our shared epistemic niche, the coda document that we utilized to collaborate over the last six months as a team.
1219960	1228968	B	0.781365156173706	Here's some of the terms that we had on the right side and we had a full table that people who go to the slides or the coda document can explore more.
1229054	1238632	B	0.5772477984428406	But there were so many creative words, just words that you're not going to get outside of applied or basic category theory.
1238776	1252268	B	0.5716928243637085	It was quite a learning journey just from a lexical perspective, so a lot of keywords and a lot of domain specific words in category theory.
1252444	1257540	B	0.7684957981109619	But we keep the bigger picture in mind about Bayesian Brain and active inference.
1257960	1264596	B	0.9094797372817993	And one last piece of information here before we head off into the dissertation itself.
1264778	1265808	B	0.6332778930664062	Jr.
1265984	1296464	B	0.9740384221076965	During their internship over the last several months at the Active Inference Institute, among other works, completed an absolutely beautiful Syllabus adventure mode syllabus for introduction to category theory applied to active inference, and it's hosted on our GitHub at the institute, so hopefully people can find it useful and continue to version and utilize it and make contributions to it.
1296582	1298240	B	0.8146786093711853	I'll just read the summary.
1300100	1311168	B	0.5054097175598145	It's for any curious, thrill seeking active Inference institute participant who wishes to study and conduct further research on active inference related papers that involve category theoretic tools.
1311264	1323210	B	0.751128077507019	And we have a fractal embedding of a quotation from Christopher White on model stream number 1.1 we have a finite time on this earth, right, and a finite time to dedicate to learning things.
1323580	1332590	B	0.9120618104934692	The syllabus is centered around the Joy and the dissertation, so another category theoretic work for background and the dissertation itself.
1333120	1350652	B	0.7436531782150269	The approach is based on experiences within the category theory learning group, insights from the Topos Institute Category Theory Outreach Panel and Chang and the Joy Book Club, and this great line from Emily Real in her book Category Theory and Context in the Note to the Reader's section.
1350796	1367088	B	0.7095935940742493	Inevitably, given the diversity of mathematical tastes and experiences, the examples presented here will seldom be optimized for any particular individual, and indeed, each reader is encouraged to search for their own context in which to explore categorical ideas.
1367184	1378472	B	0.5785648226737976	So this curriculum is something that will be living and versioning as we move forward in the active inference applied category space.
1378606	1379492	B	0.9775505661964417	Super exciting.
1379556	1390844	B	0.9832220673561096	So thanks again Jr, for the epic contribution and we all reviewed the syllabus and just found so many interesting aspects to it.
1390882	1394736	B	0.5811703205108643	So there's a lot to learn, no surprises there.
1394838	1404172	B	0.9644055962562561	But it's awesome when other adventurers help create spaces and ways for others to go on their own adventures.
1404236	1408980	B	0.7480760812759399	And it really feels like in category theory that there is a culture of that.
1409050	1410660	B	0.972953200340271	So it's really encouraging.
1411640	1416230	B	0.8541129231452942	Okay, to the overview of the dissertation itself.
1418940	1422148	B	0.9153947830200195	As stated earlier, there are seven chapters.
1422324	1424676	B	0.7798670530319214	Chapter one is an introduction.
1424868	1431300	B	0.8330603837966919	Chapter two is a comprehensive review of the concepts and results needed to understand the mathematical contributions.
1431460	1438760	B	0.8921305537223816	Chapter three begins to re approach neural modeling and more generally, the algebraic modeling of the structure of interacting systems.
1438920	1447760	B	0.8987392783164978	Chapter four presents the first main result that Bayesian Updating composes according to the categorical lens pattern.
1448180	1457410	B	0.8739685416221619	Chapter five introduces the corresponding semantical categories with a new abstract formalization of the concept of open dynamical system.
1457940	1490460	B	0.8725877404212952	Chapter Six presents the functional formalization of predictive coding using a new notion of approximate inference doctrine by which statistical models are translated into dynamical systems, and chapter Seven reviews the prospects for future work from the Mathematics of the cognitive map a program called compositional cognitive cartography to the composition of multiagent systems and ecosystems and the connections with compositional, game theory, and other categorical approaches to cybernetics.
1491040	1498380	B	0.9263819456100464	Aliyardine, any overall thoughts on the seven parthe structure of the dissertation?
1501040	1515940	C	0.8649357557296753	Just real quick, if you decide that you want to read this and use this as your leverage point, I would suggest that maybe you do it in the usual chronological order.
1516090	1519116	C	0.707359790802002	But you also will find that you can work backwards.
1519248	1525012	C	0.6897214651107788	In fact, there's stuff in chapter seven that literally points you in that direction.
1525156	1532028	C	0.8722904324531555	So you might want to give it like a once over just to sort of orient yourself.
1532114	1551840	C	0.5689498782157898	And then you should feel free to be able to go bi directionally, just a strategic prompt, because if you get bogged down and it's very easy to get sort of caught up in the minutiae of this, I would just say Zuma, step back.
1551990	1562660	C	0.8006765246391296	And if it's not registering on the first pass, it might register if you start going a little bit backwards and forwards instead of just one directional.
1563960	1564710	B	0.7671424746513367	Great.
1566040	1571388	B	0.8610667586326599	And just to summarize some of the primary contributions few quotes.
1571504	1592220	B	0.7938666343688965	The main contribution of this thesis is the formalization of models of predictive coding circuits as functional semantics and the associated development and exemplification of categories of statistical games, as well as the introduction of Bayesian lenses and the proof that Bayesian updates compose optically that is in some sense like optics.
1592720	1604640	B	0.7172395586967468	We believe our presentation of general open dynamical systems as certain polynomial coalgebras also to be novel, along with a concept of cilia and their associated monoidal bicategories.
1605540	1615216	B	0.9020330905914307	We hope that this dissertation contributes to a renaissance of cognitive and computational neuroscience through the adoption of categorical methods.
1615328	1620324	B	0.9788369536399841	We're going to be returning more to all of these, so it's going to be cool.
1620442	1628650	B	0.5563613176345825	And Ollie, it's all good with a video off for internet's sake, but just raise your hand or bring your video on whenever you would like to speak.
1630380	1645120	B	0.5116718411445618	Before we take the jump, we just pulled out two small quotes that's going to help us leap off this cliff to map the gap, respect it and beyond.
1645460	1649490	B	0.9224451184272766	So first, from page 226, this is from chapter seven.
1650020	1664310	B	0.5681756734848022	This resemblance becomes even closer when one considers the recent Diegetic open parentheses Diegetic occurring within the context of the story and able to be heard by the characters within the story.
1665880	1678036	B	0.8944826126098633	The recent Diegetic formulation of open games in which strategies themselves can be updated using a backwards map from the arena of the game back into strategies or rather strategy updates.
1678228	1698784	B	0.8501929640769958	And then fundamentally, from page 225, this is also the idea underlying the successor representation of the cognitive map, which says roughly that the brain's representation of where it is is equivalently a representation of where it soon expects to be.
1698982	1721080	B	0.7557269334793091	And so how as we bring that last foot of the 6ft off the other side of the cliff and jump through the unknown, how do we take this immense work and update our strategies backwards so that we can successfully represent and disseminate ourselves?
1722700	1728200	B	0.9218153357505798	Any final words before we jump into chapter one on this topic?
1729740	1755532	C	0.692104697227478	Just think if you're part of the active inference community, and you've been wondering if there's been any sort of question in your mind as to the role of strategy in that relationship between inference and action, this is going to be really helpful in terms of maybe giving you a better sense of you identifying and then you carrying out choices.
1755676	1762660	C	0.6986804008483887	So I think it's very important to now take the leap.
1763960	1766980	B	0.6871543526649475	Okay, zero to one.
1767130	1768864	B	0.8579698204994202	Now we're in chapter one.
1769002	1779640	B	0.9053181409835815	So for the coming slides, Ali or Dean, please just, if you'd like, select one bullet point.
1779790	1783208	B	0.8370904922485352	Feel free to read the bullet point or give any remark.
1783384	1787564	B	0.7866656184196472	And on these coming slides we're just going to move through.
1787602	1792236	B	0.8282111883163452	But either of you or both of you, please take the first pass.
1792418	1792844	B	0.4896698594093323	All right.
1792882	1795200	B	0.8089122176170349	So chapter one introduction.
1799160	1801312	C	0.8187987804412842	I'll let people read through the slide.
1801456	1809880	C	0.862162709236145	I think the one that we bolded here, category theory is the mathematics of pattern, composition, connection and interaction.
1810620	1819320	C	0.8615403175354004	I think you can read that, but I believe you also have to kind of sit back and ask yourself, so what does that mean?
1819470	1825240	C	0.5888640880584717	So right away they're taking a superordinate and they're breaking it up into its parts.
1825400	1836160	C	0.755107581615448	And so again, there's this world within world within world thing that is reinforced just in the way that we have to try to communicate the ideas to the readers.
1839220	1840720	B	0.935081422328949	Awesome and Ali.
1842500	1859800	A	0.8111705183982849	Yes, and I also think the two problems I find in the first page of chapter one, namely that each research group has not only its own language but also its own perspective, and these languages and perspectives are not well connected.
1861340	1869012	A	0.8463155031204224	These two issues, I believe, are the organizing themes of the whole dissertation.
1869076	1894530	A	0.80464768409729	And we see these issues addressed time and time again throughout the thesis and particularly in chapter seven, which these issues are addressed quite explicitly, both in terms of the work or the contribution done in this thesis and the suggestions for future research.
1896040	1905856	A	0.7788659334182739	The other point is that the language of category theory is homo iconic and can be used to translate constructions between contexts.
1905888	1920136	A	0.8824511766433716	So again, right at the beginning, this dissertation tries to put a particular perspective in order to address the two issues just mentioned.
1920238	1932350	A	0.8877284526824951	So in this case, Toby uses the homo iconic property of category theory to address those two issues.
1935220	1949860	A	0.7722969651222229	Or more explicitly, category theory resolves both problems of scientific translations in this way that concepts expressed categorically are inevitably expressed in context and not in isolation.
1950280	1959652	A	0.8433061838150024	And secondly, these contexts are naturally interconnected as if by a categorical web with the connections and expressed categorically.
1959796	1975864	A	0.8093317151069641	So in other words, category theory provides probably the ideal toolkit to address those situations, those issues, which I believe is not restricted only to scientific endeavors.
1975992	1985632	A	0.8022056221961975	So these two issues come up in many other areas and outside science as well.
1985686	1997970	A	0.6409457921981812	So in that case, I believe category theory can provide a much more general framework to address them, even in non scientific fields as well.
1998420	2001076	C	0.8956874012947083	Can I just add on to what Ali just said there real quick?
2001178	2005152	C	0.8873217105865479	I agree with you 100%, Allie, about the toolkit.
2005296	2017752	C	0.66343092918396	And I would add that I also believe it gives us an opening to develop a rule kit so that we can actually figure out how to do that translation piece.
2017806	2019812	C	0.532392144203186	And it also gives us a pool.
2019956	2036130	C	0.5916472673416138	I like to use things that rhyme because it's easy to remember, but the way that we collect how things congregate, what that attractor state becomes so that we can then figure out how things are moving in that dynamic situation.
2036500	2040480	C	0.8441405892372131	So I think it provides a toolkit, a rule kit, and a pool kit.
2042100	2042850	B	0.7671424746513367	Great.
2044580	2048116	B	0.7870219945907593	All right, next slide on chapter one.
2048218	2051830	B	0.7580444812774658	I'll just pick one and then either of you please.
2052920	2062836	B	0.9444912672042847	The one that's exciting to me is we show that the theory of predictive coding has a clear compositional structure that explains the bi directional circuitry observed in the brain.
2062948	2088032	B	0.8792804479598999	So even outside of the connection to the empirical grounded embodied biology, the idea that a lot of the ways that in retrospect, informally, we've been talking over the last years as a field and in the institute about the compositionality of models and can we just plug in the sense states here to the action states here?
2088086	2090112	B	0.8145663738250732	Can we nest the models these ways?
2090246	2095704	B	0.8085932731628418	And the ways that we've been thinking about the active inference cognitive kernel like a Lego kit.
2095852	2105792	B	0.563010036945343	All of this is realizing a level of formality, which doesn't mean inaccessibility, really quite the opposite.
2105936	2109796	B	0.770057737827301	That's just accelerating what's possible with predictive coding.
2109828	2113044	B	0.8431461453437805	Bayesian brain active inference free energy principle.
2113172	2129580	B	0.6932454705238342	So we're really seeing like a dawning of the formal compositionality and to be able to compose and to be able to construct are going to have a relationship that we can continue to weave in the coming sessions.
2130080	2132910	B	0.9114299416542053	Either of you want to highlight some other piece here?
2134080	2145200	C	0.9126021862030029	I think it's really interesting because I know that they are trying to build an infrastructure, but a lot of this dissertation has to do with a process that's actually a deconstructor.
2145860	2159800	C	0.8710300326347351	deconstructure meaning there's a lot of pruning and sculpting that they actually speak to if we were to talk about real things that form and shape and give us that sense of what's in and what's out.
2159950	2173660	C	0.5187312960624695	So yes, they are building an infrastructure, but then Toby goes along and speaks a whole bunch about so why does this stay and why does this not get included?
2177790	2179660	B	0.7952426075935364	Ollie, anything or we'll continue.
2182270	2183660	A	0.7037452459335327	Just real quick.
2184270	2195760	A	0.8167758584022522	It reminds me of Mario Bongay's work on causality and also Alan Garfinkel's theory of explanation and particularly in Garfinkel's work.
2196130	2219446	A	0.6894433498382568	In his book Forms of Explanation, he provides a theory of explanation based on rigorous modeling of problems in terms of state spaces and how we can address the context dependent explanations based on the contrast space on one hand and the relevant space on the other.
2219548	2250638	A	0.7709761261940002	So category theory, I believe, somehow unifies, or in other words, translates these kinds of theories into a rigorous and coherent framework that can be used to formalize or rather to frame all of these theories of explanations and causalities within a unified framework.
2250814	2256290	A	0.9367418885231018	So that's, I believe, one of its greatest advantages.
2257750	2258500	B	0.7671424746513367	Great.
2260390	2264920	B	0.8850452303886414	Okay, anyone want to give a comment here?
2269050	2280490	B	0.8169916272163391	I'll just give a quick comment, which is and this is just a peek ahead to chapter two we're only going to have a few snippets from the medium, the meso chapters, the space between.
2280640	2294778	B	0.7695476412773132	But don't we see diagrams like this all the time in active inference with internal external blanket states, the particular partition, hierarchical predictive processing, Bayesian brain architectures?
2294954	2297434	B	0.7078337073326111	We see these diagrams all the time.
2297572	2323034	B	0.5134478211402893	And section 2.1 is extremely provocative with the analysis of neural circuitry and two other types of systems in really establishing that the drawing, if it's informal, is insufficient to completely convey the argument and to really represent the situation.
2323232	2344654	B	0.45542454719543457	However, if we use the kind of string diagrams or just diagrams more generally that category theory provides, we really get a graphical compositionality that just drawing on a page, though obviously wonderful and fun, does not reach.
2344852	2366280	B	0.783354640007019	And so we're going to be able to talk about how these types of diagrams, which again we see all over the literature, can be enriched with this category theoretic perspective so that we can assess, well, what if I draw a line from this one over to that one?
2366650	2367666	B	0.82034832239151	Is that valid?
2367698	2369474	B	0.7620877623558044	How is that going to change the properties?
2369602	2381702	B	0.6856520175933838	And so we're going to be able to know a lot more about that when we understand the compositional structure via the Bayesian lenses of these compositional Bayesian systems.
2381846	2383610	B	0.89897221326828	Anything else to add on this slide?
2386210	2387120	B	0.4896698594093323	All right.
2389010	2390234	B	0.8738727569580078	Dean or Ali?
2390282	2391040	B	0.6500546336174011	Go ahead.
2396010	2414910	A	0.7253540754318237	So chapter one begins with the claim that the brain's visual circuitry seems to be roughly hierarchical, and this hierarchical structure is a hint of compositionality and thus a sign that a categorical approach may be helpful and enlightening.
2415810	2425250	A	0.8834781050682068	On the other hand, the underlying equations of the free energy principle exhibit a form of compositionality which is used to obtain the hierarchical models.
2425670	2441240	A	0.7821050882339478	Despite the hint of compositionality, the equations of motion for these hierarchical systems are typically derived from scratch each time a redundant effort that would not be required had a compositional formalism, such as category theory being used from the start.
2441690	2450970	A	0.8234357833862305	So this thesis supplies such a categorical formalism and exemplifies it with hierarchical predictive coding under the free energy principle.
2451550	2457382	A	0.6990388035774231	Category theory has a rich formal vocabulary for precisely describing universal constructions.
2457526	2460298	A	0.8019733428955078	And so not only does a categorical formulation of.
2460304	2471870	A	0.5906546711921692	The free energy framework promise to clarify the current confusions around FEP, but it may be expected also to shed light on its potential universality.
2473730	2476980	B	0.98456871509552	Just so exciting and interesting.
2477510	2490840	B	0.594122052192688	And in terms of the current, the past, present and future status of the free energy principle and active inference, it's an absolutely consequential direction of work.
2491290	2492840	B	0.8468698859214783	Dean, anything here?
2494170	2494822	C	0.49361860752105713	No.
2494956	2505562	C	0.8908490538597107	I know that in seven four one, which we'll talk about later, the introduction of the term fuzzy and fuzzy distributions comes up.
2505616	2511660	C	0.7343239784240723	So even though they're being precise, they're being precise, their fuzziness as well.
2513010	2513470	B	0.7671424746513367	Great.
2513540	2520030	B	0.7512770891189575	Like a high resolution picture of a fuzzy jacket onwards.
2520610	2527662	B	0.5934932231903076	So in this thesis, we do not get as far as a completely general formulation of active inference.
2527726	2533186	B	0.5493066310882568	And it goes without saying this expression could be added to every single thing that we read today.
2533288	2543720	B	0.9319025874137878	But in the coming videos and beyond, we're going to discuss what this all means and just one more exciting piece from this page.
2544570	2560998	B	0.6546138525009155	Because active inference models and the free energy framework more broadly are descriptions of systems that are open to an environment, interacting with it, and therefore situated in context, they are particularly suited to a category theoretic reformulation.
2561174	2575582	B	0.9655961394309998	So that's very exciting because we've from qualitative philosophical, humanistic approaches and also from statistical, numerical, formal approaches.
2575726	2592280	B	0.6683569550514221	We've discussed a lot of this openness and now we have another entree or another vector or another toolkit rule kit, pool kit to work with, and that is just opening the space up a lot.
2592650	2594582	B	0.8863564729690552	Ollie or Dean, want to add anything.
2594636	2596822	C	0.8198911547660828	Here, just real quick?
2596876	2598434	C	0.8302404284477234	We've talked in other live streams.
2598482	2608746	C	0.7847885489463806	We've used images of ice cream cones and ice cream trucks and what's in the foreground and what's in the background, what's actually the context and what is the content.
2608928	2623086	C	0.7057665586471558	And this reinforces that idea of as the observer, as the one using their optic nerves, what did you choose to put in front and what is in behind?
2623188	2631202	C	0.7537007927894592	And we have to keep that in mind because we shouldn't assume that everybody chooses the way that we do.
2631336	2636846	C	0.8405020236968994	So, again, just making sure we understand what's being said here in this slide.
2636878	2637880	C	0.7350836992263794	It's really important.
2638570	2639990	B	0.8810703158378601	Thank you, Ali.
2642890	2655350	A	0.7936329245567322	Yes, and I still think it's really clever to title the dissertation as mathematical foundations for a compositional account of the Bayesian brain as opposed to active Inference.
2655510	2672154	A	0.6826373338699341	Because, as we all know, one of the distinguishing features of active inference theory and what sets it apart from other related theories such as Bayesian brain and predictive coding theories, is the fundamental integration of action into perception.
2672282	2696194	A	0.6238849759101868	So as long as this dissertation doesn't provide a full fledged account of this kind of action integration, I believe it would be more appropriate to term it as a compositional account of the Bayesian brain and not particularly active inference.
2696242	2708778	A	0.738855242729187	But of course, in chapter seven, toby suggests some potential ways that this kind of integration can potentially be done in the future.
2708864	2709500	A	0.7060800194740295	Research.
2710350	2711100	B	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
2711870	2712778	B	0.4896698594093323	All right.
2712944	2718250	B	0.874035656452179	Chapter One is already foreshadowing the idea of cognitive maps.
2718410	2722698	B	0.8959060311317444	And Toby writes current models of cognitive maps.
2722874	2727582	B	0.8667957186698914	Some are expressed in the language of approximate variational inference.
2727726	2729746	B	0.8432372212409973	We talk about that a lot.
2729928	2733220	B	0.8543696403503418	Some are expressed in the language of reinforcement learning.
2733670	2736100	B	0.8482486009597778	Some attempt to combine the two.
2736810	2741922	B	0.6228059530258179	We expect that the foundations developed here will help us unify these accounts.
2742066	2744114	B	0.7824551463127136	So how can we be reimagining?
2744162	2744870	B	0.6391889452934265	Maps?
2746490	2748070	B	0.8329134583473206	Cognitive maps?
2748570	2749900	B	0.7086790204048157	Aren't they all?
2751070	2753820	B	0.9054051041603088	Alir, Dean, anything else to add here?
2757790	2763040	B	0.8233708739280701	All right, and last few selections from chapter One.
2764050	2765118	B	0.7493879199028015	Either of you, please.
2765204	2766414	B	0.8255125284194946	What's the first take?
2766452	2767040	B	0.7212399840354919	Here?
2773430	2774562	B	0.7568590641021729	I'll go first.
2774696	2782946	B	0.5285786390304565	Our primary motivation in writing this thesis is to lay the groundwork for well typed cognitive science and computational neuroscience.
2783138	2792398	B	0.9129398465156555	It's a very interesting topic about the implications of well typing and what does it mean for something to be well typed?
2792434	2798006	B	0.8238403797149658	What is a programming language or a scientific culture or a framework that's well piped?
2798198	2809840	B	0.6569817066192627	The free energy framework, like the structurally adjacent framework of compositional game theory, has a strong flavor of teleology what is that taste like?
2811010	2815698	B	0.8375663161277771	And systems act in order to make their predictions come true.
2815864	2819940	B	0.7424960732460022	We come to this so many times and in so many ways.
2820310	2845750	B	0.683148980140686	In reinforcement or reward oriented learning, you have a reward function, and systems work to maximize reward, whereas in free energy as a bounding variable or functional on surprise, the imperative is to bound and reduce surprise such that expectations or preferences are realized.
2845910	2848822	B	0.8322750926017761	And so here it's expressed qualitatively.
2848966	2864370	B	0.7750558853149414	We've approached this in many different paper discussions from a statistical, numerical, formal, analytical angle, and here we're approaching it from another formal avenue of category theory.
2864790	2871234	B	0.882749080657959	And either of you have any comments on this or want to talk about the last piece?
2871432	2874702	C	0.7757536172866821	Yeah, I'll talk quickly about scientific faith.
2874846	2884818	C	0.8237932920455933	In the programming that I did, we had a little axiom or expression that was, if it isn't history, then it's a mystery.
2884914	2889898	C	0.861796498298645	And I think that's part of what this scientific faith piece is all about.
2889984	2902014	C	0.636440098285675	I mean, if you have some data, if you have some way of recording or taking in or gaining some sense of, that's great, that's the historical part.
2902052	2911194	C	0.7696025967597961	But you still also need that curiosity and that sense that there is yet still to be witnessed and observed.
2911322	2915460	C	0.6653285622596741	And you have to have some faith that sticking around is going to be able to provide that opportunity.
2921270	2926706	C	0.5387169122695923	I don't know if a well typed science will buttress scientific faith.
2926738	2930434	C	0.7979785799980164	I think sometimes the personality matters.
2930482	2950620	C	0.5799775123596191	I think if you're the kind of person who believes in curiosity being resolved and wayfinding being a really good strategy to find out who you are and what the world is about, I think that's the faith piece that some of us just seem to carry around, whether we like it or not.
2952690	2953294	B	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
2953412	2957200	B	0.8986530303955078	Ali, anything on this slide or enclosure of chapter one?
2961090	2968446	A	0.7372071743011475	Just wanted to mention that by well typed cognitive science, or more generally, well typed science.
2968638	2982114	A	0.6575015187263489	I believe Toby somehow implying a kind of more or less claim for disunity of sciences as opposed to a unified vision of science.
2982162	3009514	A	0.6385028958320618	Because you see, in the unified vision for science, every explanatory models and every theory can theoretically be unified within an overarching principle or overarching theory, which has not been discovered yet.
3009632	3015982	A	0.7124575972557068	But some philosophers advocate the position of disunity of sciences.
3016126	3034646	A	0.621173083782196	In other words, although there are some commonalities between every scientific areas, but there are some individual types, or individual concepts, if you will, that cannot be taken.
3034828	3047526	A	0.622192919254303	I mean, this individuality cannot be taken for granted simply by just explaining it away, by proposing some unifying principle.
3047638	3059834	A	0.681766927242279	So in this sense, well typed science is quite a rigorous and individualized notion of scientific endeavor, at least in my opinion.
3059882	3063790	A	0.8360103964805603	But I'm curious to know Toby's opinion.
3064790	3076786	B	0.4961383044719696	I'll just add one more comment on the well typed in programming languages where type safety or type soundness is being described as a beneficial feature in certain contexts.
3076818	3090486	B	0.6561613082885742	Obviously, people point to the way that a well typed language can prevent illegal operations or use safer handling of short term memory, working memory, and avert logical errors.
3090598	3104926	B	0.8584868311882019	So it's very interesting to think about what that means in science in terms of not just the reproducibility of experimentation, but in terms of what experiments and what research avenues are pursued overall, as well as even cognitive security.
3105028	3114114	B	0.8102247714996338	So there's so many different angles where well typing is going to matter for the way that we think about compositional, cognitive cartography, which we're going to come to.
3114152	3120354	B	0.7545170187950134	Now, chapter seven, we skipped over a few pieces, didn't we?
3120472	3122222	B	0.7232690453529358	That's how the last six months felt.
3122286	3123730	C	0.8106802701950073	It was 9900.
3123800	3124420	C	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
3130570	3135640	B	0.6014598608016968	I'll hold on the jokes for now, but yeah, we skipped about 200 pages right there.
3136810	3140730	B	0.6957247257232666	That's the part that you want to take lightly.
3141150	3142902	B	0.6924396753311157	That's the bottom of the bathtub.
3142966	3145574	B	0.9729492664337158	You jump into chapter one and it's exciting.
3145622	3146934	B	0.7002406716346741	It's like skiing downhill.
3146982	3158830	B	0.768720805644989	And then this vast tundra opens of chapters two through six, which again was the last half year for us and several others.
3158900	3166530	B	0.8829024434089661	So now let's get to chapter seven, and then the sandwich will be dissected with Toby.
3167190	3167940	B	0.584351658821106	Okay.
3170070	3176738	B	0.533353865146637	With absolute humility and accuracy, toby points to three prominent shortcomings of the thesis.
3176754	3180230	B	0.548231303691864	Ali, do you want to summarize these three shortcomings?
3182170	3182920	A	0.4753468334674835	Sure.
3183370	3191450	A	0.8936980366706848	So the first one is that the notion of approximate inference doctrine should be tested with further exemplification.
3192590	3200380	A	0.7874817848205566	In other words, specifically with the problem of double counting, which is addressed in chapter six.
3203470	3217250	A	0.6855116486549377	The other one is that the general models that Toby is considered in this dissertation are somehow static despite its application in modeling dynamical systems.
3217590	3222530	A	0.6416152715682983	So again, this problem is addressed.
3223190	3237190	A	0.8479995131492615	I mean, some suggestions for overcoming this shortcoming is addressed in this chapter, specifically in relation to Meyer's Categorical theory of dynamical systems.
3237690	3251130	A	0.6685215830802917	And finally, although we consider lower level neural circuit models, we did not explicitly connect our approximate inference doctrines to these more biological models.
3251490	3270850	A	0.7331842184066772	So in other words, it's not a theory for modeling the whole Iguana, it's just a modeling framework for modeling a very specific function or the cognitive function of the brain.
3272070	3277410	C	0.7261273264884949	I don't know that knowing your limits should be considered a shortcoming.
3277750	3281490	C	0.7156943678855896	That's just philosophical me going knowing.
3282010	3287398	C	0.4378115236759186	Okay, so of the three of us, I'm the one guy who's proud to say I get it wrong 20% of the time.
3287484	3292374	C	0.6501895785331726	I don't give a rat's backside most often about precision and perfection.
3292502	3293818	C	0.715756893157959	I want to try.
3293984	3306206	C	0.627806544303894	And so if somebody says, well, the thing that I'm talking about here has its limits and it's not going to solve all the problems of the world, I just think that's being realistic and honest.
3306388	3314420	C	0.5283226370811462	So call it shortcomings, I see it as a bit of a feature, being self aware of not being able to do everything at once.
3315350	3321218	B	0.5766270756721497	Yeah, so often in papers it's apologetic when it's actually the adjacent possible.
3321384	3325586	B	0.5041830539703369	And there's always an adjacent possible, indeed an expanding one.
3325688	3340010	B	0.632956326007843	So to make an exponentially expansive apology rather than pointing to the adjacent possible and seeing what can become is just two sides of the same coin with a third side being the rim on that coin.
3341310	3347430	B	0.8706944584846497	7.1 structured worlds and 7.1.1 Bayesian sensor fusion.
3347510	3349930	B	0.8987365365028381	Ollie, how do you see sensor fusion?
3353490	3376262	A	0.6900171637535095	Yes, so sensor fusion is a situation where one has a number of sensors which report spatially situated data and also it's kind of a problem of combining the local data with the global data.
3376396	3404526	A	0.6705428957939148	So in category theory there is an obvious choice for addressing this particular problem, namely the notion of sheets, which is a spatially coherent data type, something like a bundle for which local sections can always be uniquely glued together into a global section, as Toby described here.
3404708	3422958	A	0.8676085472106934	And it reminds me of the theory of, I mean the derivation of the duality between FEP and CMEP in Bayesian mechanics paper by deploying these notions of bundles.
3423134	3440730	A	0.8597258925437927	So in other sense, sheath theory and the related fields of applied topology and chromology allow us to judge when it is possible to form a consensus and quantify the obstructions to the formation of consensus.
3442270	3458030	A	0.7076497077941895	Hence, the consensus between FEP and CMAP as done in Bayesian mechanics paper, I believe is done in the same sense of sheath theory as providing a possibility for emerging such a consensus.
3459490	3469970	A	0.5819718241691589	And also missing from the current chief theoretic understanding of sensor fusion is a thorough treatment of belief and uncertainty, especially from a Bayesian perspective.
3470390	3485910	A	0.7694212198257446	A first possible extension of the work presented here is to extend statistical gains and approximate and approximate inference doctrines and hence the classes of model that they encompass, to structured data types such as sheets.
3486410	3492570	A	0.8864548206329346	We expect that the first step will be to consider categories of channels between sheeps.
3493550	3494154	B	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
3494272	3507626	B	0.8881666660308838	And just to give a more mundane or empirical example of sensor fusion, what if we have many EEG sensors on a head and we need to synthesize into one joint representation?
3507738	3514254	B	0.9036080241203308	Or what if we have temperature sensors across an agricultural field and humidity sensors?
3514382	3523890	B	0.7623938918113708	How this happens is called sensor fusion, and category theory is helping us understand the compositionality of such issues.
3524040	3533750	C	0.5996320843696594	Dean yeah, I just want to focus in on bullet number two here, because, Daniel, both you and Allie, I think you're absolutely correct.
3533820	3543290	C	0.8336944580078125	I think where they say something like a bundle for which local sections can always be uniquely glued together into a global section.
3543630	3551166	C	0.7392947673797607	Well, of course they can, but I don't know that that's necessarily the magic what if in a counterfactual sense.
3551268	3552910	C	0.8422826528549194	What if they are glued?
3553730	3556240	C	0.9030497670173645	Is that something we must commit to?
3558050	3573410	C	0.9109472632408142	And then if it is going to be glued together into some sort of global composition, when that timing of when to do that, I also think is something that we judge.
3574070	3582742	C	0.8420525193214417	So is that the data set, the what if and the when, is that the data set that we're going to eventually bump into?
3582876	3584440	C	0.5728376507759094	I would argue yes.
3584810	3590854	C	0.5997156500816345	Does that mean we're going to have to pass through that moment and come out on the other side of it, hopefully still intact?
3590982	3594940	C	0.5817512273788452	Yes, to me, that is consensus building.
3595470	3601066	C	0.6582648754119873	So I know that that's one little sentence in a 200 page paper.
3601168	3622626	C	0.4571685791015625	But again, there are so many nuggets in this paper where if you just slow down and read it and think about what the implications of what they're saying are, you could literally go off right there on that one sentence and spend hours trying to figure out, okay, so really, what should we be doing with this?
3622648	3624110	C	0.8498010635375977	Is this a priority?
3624270	3624980	C	0.5607155561447144	Whatever.
3625690	3626440	B	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
3627850	3640902	B	0.6950205564498901	Continuing on to address that first shortcoming, we already mentioned Sheaves, and we hope that these tools will suggest new connections to work on quantum theoretic formulations of the free energy framework.
3641046	3644662	B	0.8537372350692749	That's something we've discussed in several stream series.
3644806	3666722	B	0.8844690918922424	Livestream 17 with Chris Fields on information flow in context dependent hierarchical Bayesian inference, Livestream 40 with Friston, Levin, Glazebrook and Fields on a free energy principle for generic quantum systems and the ongoing Chris Fields course, Physics as Information Processing 2023.
3666856	3687122	B	0.7091346383094788	So category theory and adjacent tools are already widely utilized in quantum sciences, quantum information science, more broadly, quantum computation, and so on one hand, we see the quantum and free energy principle synthesis outlined in these stream series.
3687266	3694038	B	0.8017920255661011	And here we have the category theory, active inference, Bayesian brain, free energy principle synthesis.
3694134	3699930	B	0.8532956838607788	So all three category theory, quantum and FEP walk into a sheath.
3700610	3701840	B	0.7591184377670288	What do they say?
3703410	3712160	B	0.9067386388778687	All right, Ali, what is a summary or overview on learning structure and structured learning?
3716550	3716962	A	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
3717016	3724270	A	0.6114212870597839	So an interesting distinction is provided right at the beginning between structured learning and learning structure.
3724430	3732194	A	0.7284194231033325	So structured learning, at least Toby, means extending the process of learning to a structured setting.
3732322	3737000	A	0.8400066494941711	But by learning structure, he means learning the underlying structures themselves.
3738510	3749670	A	0.8764933943748474	So in the categorical semantics of dependent type theory, the context is witnessed by the object over which a slice category is defined.
3749830	3758634	A	0.8577021956443787	And in so in some sense it defines the shape of the universe by the growth in the construction.
3758762	3764494	A	0.9026724100112915	There is correspondence between sheaves and certain bundles as objects of slice categories.
3764622	3771294	A	0.7874418497085571	And so we can think of structured inference and learning as taking place in appropriate slice categories.
3771422	3782600	A	0.8618379235267639	So both of those somehow address the binary concepts of structured learning and learning structure in a complementary way.
3783450	3789206	A	0.8483506441116333	So we can think of bundle morphisms as generalized parameters maps.
3789398	3796540	A	0.5620952248573303	And in that case, the problem of learning structure then becomes a problem of generalized parameter learning.
3797150	3810254	A	0.8574835658073425	And this is the way that some reinforcement learning techniques have been deployed by using this kind of generalized parameter learning.
3810452	3827270	A	0.8704433441162109	So we expect this line of inquiry to clarify the relationships between our formalism of approximate inference and other related work on the categorical foundations of cybernetics which have typically been studied in a differential rather than probabilistic setting.
3827770	3839366	A	0.7443586587905884	We expect the connection to be made by information geometry where Bayesian inference can be understood both using gradient descent and as a kind of parallel transport.
3839558	3863070	A	0.820627748966217	In other words, it is a way to unify both the physical formulation of physical formulation of system as done through the differential equations in cybernetics and also the probabilistic formulation of the systems as done in Bayesian mechanics.
3864290	3865038	B	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
3865204	3866942	B	0.8817691206932068	Just two quick notes on this.
3866996	3869250	B	0.7781993746757507	First, the growth and deak construction.
3869670	3891466	B	0.9041844010353088	Shauna Dobson spoke about this in the Math Art Guest Stream in the context of the evolution of art and other areas in math and philosophy over the last hundred years with this progressive swarmification sheafification of self.
3891568	3893420	B	0.9887033104896545	So that's really cool to see.
3894990	3898140	B	0.8148519396781921	And then we expect the connection to be made.
3899070	3907822	B	0.8147780895233154	What we expect is what we prefer, and then what we expect prefer is shaping our action selection to realize it.
3907956	3925650	B	0.8080757260322571	So again, once we, as mentioned earlier, understand that systems act in order to make their expectations realized, we see that these kinds of expressions are more than just the expression of a belief, they're also in some ways an action imperative.
3927290	3928710	B	0.7896305918693542	Dean, any thoughts?
3929370	3947980	C	0.5133131146430969	I could go for days on this section, of course, but I will say this who knew there was so much to be loaded up between the difference of a verb tense right structure and structured added D and all of a sudden we're discretized between process and product.
3948350	3954158	C	0.7870029211044312	I'll just start there and wait for Toby to come on because I could literally have a field day.
3954244	3962240	C	0.5587551593780518	I'm at the circus, the carnival and every single theme park in the world when it comes to this stuff.
3964310	3965506	B	0.9781022667884827	It's awesome.
3965608	3976090	B	0.8019970059394836	All right, now we get to seven one three compositional, cognitive, cartography sailing, the three C's.
3976270	3979640	B	0.8192030191421509	Ali, what is this section about?
3983450	4000330	A	0.7531352043151855	Okay, so this is mainly addresses the success of representation and I mean doing a kind of a comparison between successive representation and other cognitive map theories.
4001410	4020530	A	0.6262049078941345	In other words, the topus theoretic developments sketched so far may provide a suitable setting in which to understand the neural basis for navigation and help explain how, ostensibly spatial navigation processes and circuits are invariably involved in more abstract problem solving.
4021110	4033060	A	0.6721318364143372	Atopos is not only a richly structured category of spaces or spatial types, but it can also be understood as a category as a categorified space itself.
4034390	4049878	A	0.7454731464385986	But an important notion here is that under the free energy principle, there's a close relationship between beliefs about the geometry of an environment and beliefs about expected future trajectories in that environment.
4050054	4064658	A	0.8310762643814087	So this is basically the idea behind successor representation of the cognitive map, which says roughly that the brain's representation of where it is is equivalently a representation of where it soon expects to be.
4064824	4079270	A	0.89132159948349	So under the free energy principle, and similarly, under the successor representation, the expected dynamics is a geodesic flow, which is determined by beliefs about the spatial geometry.
4080170	4085298	A	0.7644092440605164	But crucially, these beliefs are not a static.
4085474	4090362	A	0.8330156803131104	They depend on what the agent believes will happen.
4090496	4096742	A	0.8601694107055664	And this has been suggested as an explanation for the predictive nature of the cognitive map.
4096806	4124290	A	0.5276999473571777	In other words, if we don't take into consideration the uncertainty behind the information available to the agent, then we wouldn't get to formalize the behavior in a truly predictive way, because obviously there isn't any uncertainty to predict about and then compare the prediction with the actual data.
4124440	4134850	A	0.874269425868988	The cognitive map has its central locus in the hippocampus, which we may therefore understand as representing the base space over which the big topus is sliced.
4134930	4147830	A	0.8686765432357788	And since changes of plan seem therefore to induce changes of base, we might see the functional connectivity of the brain as witnessing this mathematical structure.
4147990	4162382	A	0.6899057626724243	And this particular claim, I believe, is maps perhaps perfectly onto Boujaki's theory of brain from inside out.
4162516	4194940	A	0.8668482303619385	So Boujaki provides a kind of theory that sets the hippocampus as the agential center of all the cognitive tests that needs to be reconstructed from inside out, as opposed to just processing the coming data in a kind of purely computational unidirectional way.
4198000	4207490	B	0.7826839089393616	We talked a lot about, and certainly will in the coming weeks, about what is witnessing, how is witness related to observation, but we'll come back to that.
4208580	4226304	B	0.8864102363586426	Okay, continuing on, on the compositional cognitive cartography, there's some discussion about the internal universe of the topos, not just the Topos institute, but the concept and the way that the representations of the cognitive map are inherently context dependent.
4226432	4235850	B	0.8848314881324768	Therefore, it fits naturally within the subjectivist metaphysics implied by the free energy framework, a topic that I know Ali is extremely interested in.
4236620	4240510	B	0.8930511474609375	And Dean Ali, any other comments on this?
4240880	4241820	B	0.7507401704788208	Slice?
4244720	4249020	B	0.8393241167068481	Maybe we can start calling them a slice or a bundle instead of a slide.
4250080	4256530	C	0.7861526608467102	Well, if we do go the slice route, one thing I would just pause for a second.
4257700	4272784	C	0.7286946773529053	I think for most people, in context, geometry or geometric stability is usually the association, whereas geodesic flow, which was mentioned in the last slide is a lot more dynamic.
4272832	4287924	C	0.844086766242981	And I think that if we're going to talk about a composition like the flow of the piece of music that's now playing out, we have to think of this as both framed and filtered.
4288052	4311212	C	0.9114669561386108	And so these sheaves allow for that sense of distribution, that movement part, I think, metaphorically of exploitation and exploration now being the two passengers in the HOV Lane and HOV Lanes in North America at least, are designated by a diamond.
4311276	4330010	C	0.7676444053649902	So you can see how the geometry and the geodesic again can all be put together, and you're starting to build a picture in these different models and maps that you may be constructing great.
4330780	4341870	B	0.5856562256813049	7.2 societies of Systems I'll just say that a collection of purely passive agents is no society at all.
4342240	4346264	B	0.810504674911499	What would it even be, Ali?
4346312	4352220	B	0.9093489050865173	Want to add anything more on the forwards and backwards, perhaps, and the compositional structure?
4354500	4374384	A	0.6631700396537781	Well, first of all, I wanted to just point that the very first sentence here, a collection of purely passive agents is no society also applies to one of my favorite metaphysical theories out there, namely the assemblage theory.
4374432	4379896	A	0.8393071293830872	So we can say that a collection of purely passive agents is no assemblage as well.
4380078	4387400	A	0.839547872543335	But in any case, the doctrines of approximate inference introduced in this thesis are inherently perceptual.
4388700	4417164	A	0.8559794425964355	But the forward channel of a statistical gain points towards the environment predicting the expected incoming sense data, whereas the backwards channel points from the environment into the agent, terminating in the agent's most causally abstract beliefs one way in which we can incorporate action and thereby shape the framework of this thesis into a framework for active inference.
4417292	4426292	A	0.8761559724807739	The forwards channel should predict not only sense data incoming from the environment, but also the actions to be taken by the agent.
4426426	4453996	A	0.7145676612854004	So up until now in the dissertation, he has provided in quite elaborate detail how this kind of formulation of the bi directional channels can be used to reframe the perceptual side of active inference.
4454108	4462384	A	0.647674024105072	But as I mentioned earlier, he doesn't go so far as to integrate the action into this framework as well.
4462502	4479560	A	0.5883939266204834	But of course, here is a potential way forward which we can deploy the same forward channel as being the actions to be taken by the environment because of the same directionality it possesses.
4479980	4493740	A	0.8845959305763245	We therefore expect the compositional theory of active inference to have forwards channel rather so that an agent's sensorium depends on the configuration or quote unquote action that it has chosen.
4494320	4527444	A	0.5122230052947998	And another very, in my opinion, significant point here is the substitution of the notion of markup blankets throughout the whole dissertation with the notion of polynomial fontors, because, as have been discussed in the previous chapters as well, Markov blanket doesn't provide a rigorous enough concept to be applied quite at least directly in category theory.
4527492	4543050	A	0.8618665337562561	So polynomial functions substitute the well known notion of markup blanket as used in active inference literature to characterize basically the same thing or the interaction boundaries of adaptive agents.
4544060	4546088	B	0.9713054895401001	Yes, so many great pieces here.
4546174	4559840	B	0.8576086163520813	Markup blanket used in the informal active inference literature, like everything we've been studying for the last few years, all of that casual light, airy, breezy we had fun.
4559990	4562370	B	0.814337432384491	Now it's time to formalize that.
4563780	4569590	B	0.7374565601348877	And there's so much more we can say about backwards and forwards, but we'll just carry on.
4571720	4587092	B	0.8431388139724731	7.21 active Inference there are some mentions about the resemblance between active inference and economic games in terms of they're both having lenses into the area or the arena of interaction.
4587236	4593432	B	0.8833698034286499	And this line of inquiry naturally leads onto the consideration of multi agent systems.
4593576	4596860	B	0.8721768260002136	Perhaps this can be investigated with poly algebras.
4597680	4601470	B	0.8731788992881775	7.2.2 what is the type of a plan?
4602080	4611170	B	0.8179326057434082	Perception and action are thus in general, the two dual ways in which a system can minimize its free energy change your mind, change the world.
4611540	4629210	B	0.8922516107559204	Akin to the two degrees of freedom available in an autoencoder game discussed in the thesis a system that acts must necessarily be motivated towards some goal and in order to realize its goal, the system must enact a plan.
4629980	4632330	B	0.7855700254440308	Dean, pick it up from here.
4637100	4641828	C	0.6962959170341492	Well, I will just say this I'm not going to speak to the stuff on the slide necessarily.
4641924	4650424	C	0.8915281891822815	At the very end of this section, Toby writes this prompts us to ask what is the form of this data and how can we incorporate it into the compositional framework?
4650472	4653330	C	0.8024919629096985	In other words, what is the type of a plan?
4654180	4658688	C	0.6287762522697449	These seem to us to be key questions for future work.
4658854	4666420	C	0.7059418559074402	This prompted me to go and then we wonder why teachers struggle sometimes to necessarily remember what it was like to be the learner.
4667240	4668852	C	0.612216591835022	Because we can come up with a plan.
4668906	4669892	C	0.7502660155296326	Because we've done the learning.
4669946	4671830	C	0.8017423748970032	We're now the learned, right?
4672520	4682664	C	0.8624799847602844	The learner now changes because of one tense present to past tense change.
4682862	4689284	C	0.570513904094696	Or why the plan that we put before learners removes all the critical work for self organizing.
4689332	4692484	C	0.8739264607429504	This is the cost of being a teacher.
4692612	4705196	C	0.6097583770751953	Because if we do the planning for somebody and I understand why we have to do it, because if they're walking into a space, we don't want them falling off jumping off cliffs necessarily and not having a soft landing.
4705308	4728410	C	0.8279449343681335	However, we do need to talk a little bit about what is the type of a plan and what are the benefits and the costs of choosing to use that strategy going forward, especially if we're in the role of somebody who's supposed to be guiding, opening up worlds, horizons and all that other stuff.
4729820	4730664	B	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
4730782	4733400	B	0.8461532592773438	Ollie, any other comments on this section?
4735900	4737130	A	0.655727744102478	Not at the moment.
4738300	4751828	B	0.6668618321418762	One piece to me is it seems unnecessarily crude to hide all of this data, which is described as a lot of data, inside of a single undifferentiated choice of prior distributions.
4752024	4764640	B	0.8892329335212708	So that's very interesting in light of, again, the statistical, numerical, quantitative way that we've approached policy selection as inference planning as inference action and inference.
4765000	4768500	B	0.8096553683280945	What does it mean to differentiate this choice?
4770200	4774640	B	0.5170455574989319	Okay, reinforcement learning, open games and ecosystems.
4774720	4777270	B	0.8375518918037415	Ali, any summary here?
4780380	4799320	A	0.8132246136665344	Okay, so as also indicated in the first sentence, there is a close relationship between active inference theory, markup decision problems and reinforcement learning as explored numerous times before in many papers.
4799480	4817712	A	0.8595331907272339	But the standard algorithm for gaining an optimality for policy selection is usually called backward induction in reinforcement learning, or Akas dynamic programming.
4817856	4838440	A	0.8869704604148865	So namely, backward induction is structured according to a similar bi directional pattern, or the optic pattern to that of both Bayesian inference and reverse differentiation, and that MDPs themselves fit into the associated general framework of open games.
4838780	4852896	A	0.8762133121490479	So in the informal active inference approach to MDPs, the system in question counterfactually evaluates policies using a backward induction like process, accumulating free energies in order to score them.
4853078	4868390	A	0.8805314302444458	Now, in this process, it is this process that results in the prior that we're all familiar with in active inference context, which is then updated by the agents inference process.
4868760	4902956	A	0.8341911435127258	But future work will need to untangle this not of interrelated bi directional process, in other words, how we can explicitly determine in what way those kinds of processes, although being quite in a quite different opposite directionality, can be unified into a unified framework.
4903068	4919300	A	0.528187096118927	So we hope that having done so, we will show how the whole picture emerges and how it relates to the developing geometric or diegetic framework in categorical cybernetics, possibly involving the further development of our notion of cilia.
4922710	4923460	B	0.7671424746513367	Great.
4926230	4930242	B	0.5267382264137268	Continuing on with reinforcement learning, open games, and ecosystems.
4930386	4950380	B	0.5311530232429504	Since the free energy principle underlying active inference asserts a certain informal universality, we might also hope that the satisfactory development of compositional active inference might exhibit a universal property that any other doctrine of cybernetic systems factors uniquely through it.
4952270	4958240	B	0.8889515399932861	There's some discussion of multiagent systems and their implied global search.
4959650	4969780	B	0.5850477814674377	Casting this account into the emerging framework of compositional active inference will point towards a bridge to multiagent reinforcement learning.
4970150	4981960	B	0.689801812171936	The resulting general account of multiagent intelligence will encompass both reinforcement learning and active inference, allowing us to understand their relative strengths and difference.
4982730	4993950	B	0.8763138651847839	We hope that one distal outcome of the work will be a new and beneficial understanding of corporate activity, sometimes called organizational cybernetics or metagovernance.
4994130	5004490	B	0.6865215301513672	We should expect any framework resulting from this work to capture existing models of collective active inference, such as recent work on spin glasses or ant colonies.
5005090	5006414	B	0.8169754147529602	Any other thoughts on this?
5006452	5028258	C	0.5509030222892761	Yes, Dean, I know that this is my biases literally on the surface, but I believe that the idea of open games and opened P-E-N-E-D ecosystems is a future path that a lot of formalized and structured learning is going to take.
5028424	5032166	C	0.8290572166442871	It's the work that I did essentially for ten years.
5032268	5042506	C	0.7526167631149292	And so I think that everything that you're seeing here may become a new model that can be optioned into in terms of how you would.
5042528	5044010	C	0.7885556221008301	Want to structure your learning.
5044160	5047820	C	0.9213206768035889	So I think this is really important stuff.

5056420	5066158	B	0.8986569046974182	The mathematics of Life we move on to consider the relationships between compositional active inference and the contemporary mathematics of life.
5066324	5075714	B	0.5324493646621704	We hope that compositional active inference may supply part of the story of a modern theory of autopoiesis the ability for life to recreate itself.
5075912	5081174	B	0.8126558065414429	So just some brief notes on topics that are near and dear to us as we get close to the end.
5081372	5082838	B	0.6565900444984436	7.3.1.
5082924	5085586	B	0.7873451113700867	Bayesian mechanics and the free energy principle.
5085778	5097526	B	0.8798306584358215	Recently it has been suggested in various venues citation 53 and 54 Karl Friston 2019 a free Energy Principle for a Particular Physics and fort.

5110930	5117738	B	0.558087170124054	Bayesian mechanics promises to build upon the nascent understanding of random dynamics via inference.
5117914	5130630	B	0.9135949611663818	245, 245 dalton's activity Bell towards a Geometry and Analysis for Bayesian Mechanics and Ramstead et al.
5130700	5133666	B	0.8487590551376343	On Bayesian mechanics, a physics of and by beliefs.
5133778	5140658	B	0.8290625810623169	Also check out Livestream number 49 to supply a new theory of mechanics for statistical systems.
5140754	5152970	B	0.8141727447509766	The present formulation of Bayesian mechanics is constructed using mathematical tools from physics, but not yet the kinds of compositional tools promoted in this thesis.
5153310	5169594	B	0.5003313422203064	We expect that developments along the lines sketched here will unify the ongoing developments of Bayesian mechanics with the new synthetic understanding of mathematical physics by casting all dynamics as abstract inference.
5169722	5181880	B	0.8514610528945923	We should also expect this line of inquiry to begin to quantify the persistence of things and imbue much of physics within elon vital with a vital energy.
5182570	5184120	B	0.8065135478973389	Any thoughts on this?
5186890	5198522	C	0.507465660572052	Okay, well, I was just going to say I think that section you've already talked about the importance of adjunction, and this section literally makes that very clear.
5198576	5215310	C	0.7202674150466919	I think that the relation and the translation are kind of the on and through of this part of where the Bayesian mechanics and the free energy principle help us understand that there is a statistical game that's also strategic.
5216790	5218466	C	0.8931950926780701	Again, I'll be interested to talk to.
5218488	5230690	B	0.8155325055122375	Toby about that great carrying on with mathematics life seven, three, two biosemiotics Ali, want to give any summary or thoughts on biosimiotics?
5233430	5233890	A	0.4753468334674835	Sure.
5233960	5265018	A	0.7250500917434692	So the emerging biosymiotic reconceptualization of life explicitly acknowledges the importance and universality of communication in context, proposing that in any such situation, the interpreting system necessarily has an internal representation of the external world, so to speak, its own belt, which is updated by interpreting incoming signals.
5265194	5272962	A	0.809712290763855	We can in principle reconstruct the external world by understanding it as that which a collection of systems agrees about.
5273096	5282850	A	0.5871325135231018	Perhaps then, the shared universe, as determined topus theoretically of a fusion of active inference agents is a good model of this semi sphere.
5283290	5304178	A	0.669475793838501	It seems therefore, that mathematics resulting from our work on internal universes and their interactions and more broadly, many of the formal ingredients of compositional active inference is well aligned with the informal structures of biosymiotics, and so it may be desirable to reexpress biosymiotics accordingly.
5304294	5321090	A	0.8857693672180176	In doing so, perhaps the mathematics of a modern Bayesian subjectivist metaphysics will be found, for instance, by expressing communication and its phenomenology as a geometric morphism, a generalized base change between agents internal universes.
5321590	5333458	A	0.6394335031509399	And it might be worth mentioning here the work of people like Terrence Deacon and also Karen Broad's agential Realism.
5333634	5345174	A	0.7453115582466125	Because in Terrence Deacon's work, and particularly in his book called Incomplete Nature, he provides a kind of nested hierarchy.
5345222	5376558	A	0.8830896615982056	Of how various kinds of informations as provided to biological organisms are structured in a nested, hierarchical way that would allow the agent to distinguish the purely informational data as opposed to the semantic data that is, in the innermost level of the nested hierarchy.
5376734	5396630	A	0.867681622505188	And also, Karen broad's agential realism provides this notion of intra action, which allow the agent or the system of interest to co constitute itself via the very interaction with the environment.
5396710	5411550	A	0.8627901077270508	So it's not just pure interaction between the system and its environment, but rather both the agent and the environment co constitutes themselves through the intra action.
5412130	5419780	A	0.5467550754547119	So it might be worth exploring some of these ideas with Toby as well.
5421430	5423460	B	0.8590812683105469	Dean, anything to add on this one?
5424390	5426930	C	0.5909748673439026	No, I think Ali summed it up perfectly.
5427270	5427810	B	0.4896698594093323	All right.
5427880	5436680	B	0.789636492729187	And the final section Fundamental Theory future work connected to this thesis need not only be an application.
5437690	5441750	B	0.8333081603050232	A number of purely theoretical questions raise themselves too.
5441900	5451846	B	0.4678155779838562	So for people who we could already hear in the live chat in the YouTube comments complaining that this was too practical, too application oriented, don't worry.
5451958	5467426	B	0.853485643863678	There's also some theoretical questions that raise themselves so first, geometric methods for structured belief updating the mathematics of belief is in large part about replacing definite points with Fuzzier distributions over them.
5467528	5478638	B	0.6766765713691711	In fact, this PDF copy error with a fuzzy interpretive system allows the word to be read by a human independent type theory.
5478734	5480740	B	0.7802489399909973	We replace points with terms.
5481270	5483606	B	0.7786606550216675	Non dependent terms are exactly points.
5483788	5488280	B	0.8524810671806335	So a type theory with belief should somehow encompass fuzzy terms.
5489050	5495180	B	0.8158448934555054	We might well want to express beliefs about things whose identity we are not quite sure.
5495790	5497690	B	0.6796509623527527	Seven four two dynamics.
5498030	5505982	B	0.8445780873298645	Chapter five supplies the beginnings of a compositional coalgebraic theory for open, stochastic and random dynamical systems in general time.
5506116	5512698	B	0.7469525337219238	And we hope that this theory could provide a home for a modern account of nonequilibrium systems.
5512874	5514800	B	0.7549582719802856	Home, home on the state space.
5515730	5518290	B	0.6504919528961182	And seven four three computation.
5518710	5525230	B	0.8290880918502808	A new understanding of computation may follow the semiotic understanding of information processing that we propose above.
5525390	5530310	B	0.8609399199485779	Perhaps we could say more precisely that computation is the dynamics of semiosis.
5531210	5552982	B	0.6940988898277283	The time is right for such a reconceptualization, as human made systems increasingly move away from von Neumann architectures towards more biosimilar ones such as Mem risters optical processors, Neuromorphic technology, graph processors, or even many core and mesh based evolutions of classical processors.
5553126	5558202	B	0.9496307373046875	So some absolutely fantastic theoretical avenues to pursue.
5558346	5561594	B	0.8964404463768005	Any of you want to comment on some of these avenues?
5561722	5562800	B	0.7806005477905273	Dean, please.
5563490	5570580	C	0.4503416121006012	In the dynamics section, there's a really interesting, again, more confirmation bias in my world.
5571270	5579860	C	0.8734777569770813	He says here, chapter five has supplied the beginnings of the composition of Coalgebraic theory for open, stochastic and random dynamical systems in general time.
5580470	5581702	C	0.7589673399925232	Me being a time guy.
5581756	5582662	C	0.9727233648300171	That's cool.
5582796	5593254	C	0.6315588355064392	And we hope that this theory could provide a home for a modern account of non equilibrium systems with category polynomial functions, applying a satisfactory account of these systems.
5593302	5595946	C	0.8990806937217712	And then I'm going to slow down because this is the part that I really like.
5596048	5616490	C	0.8630326390266418	Interfaces in brackets, I e, the boundaries across which information flows along and in the word along, there's the word on in the middle, which they compose and through which they interact, and me being an on and through being the same thing.
5616660	5621780	C	0.9332134127616882	This was fantastic confirmation of that in a dynamic sense.
5623350	5624610	B	0.7822493314743042	And Ali.
5629210	5629670	A	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
5629740	5664506	A	0.7607553601264954	And also, again, I think some of the work done by Bob Coke and his colleagues regarding the Bayesian quantum inference and especially proposing a kind of string diagrams in the sense of using category theory to explore the whole theory of the quantum Bayesian inference.
5664698	5676766	A	0.8460373878479004	I believe it maps unto this sense of dynamics as provided by Toby in the final pages of his dissertation.
5676958	5683430	A	0.87201327085495	In the case that in the basing quantum inference, it is also a question.
5683500	5689960	A	0.8409218788146973	Of how to provide the exact time evolution of each state or each agent.
5690490	5701178	A	0.8281166553497314	Not strictly in a linear sense, but both in linear and sorry in the predictive and also the retroactive sense.
5701344	5713198	A	0.8282381296157837	In other words, by taking into account the whole arrow of time, not just a particular instant or particular moment of it.
5713284	5745530	A	0.6847787499427795	So in the sense, I think the discussion of non equilibrium systems, which is still an underexplored area of physics, by using category theory, can help to unify or at least make connections between these kinds of predictive models as used in classical physics and also some of the retroactive models as recently proposed in quantum Bayesian theory.
5747070	5747820	B	0.7671424746513367	Great.
5748590	5760320	B	0.5846676230430603	And so we couldn't escape without showing at least a little bit of a hint of what realistically much of the dissertation looks like.
5760770	5764014	B	0.8011978268623352	So next time we're going to jump into the thick of it.
5764132	5771710	B	0.8134962320327759	These kinds of equations and diagrams are what you're going to find when you unpack the dissertation.
5771870	5784710	B	0.6773675680160522	And of course, there's so much to add and we did so much work on just scratching the surface of what these diagrams are and how they actually convey formality in category theory.
5785210	5791722	B	0.9565706253051758	And it's going to be great to work and talk together on them.
5791776	5799878	B	0.838539719581604	And with Toby, where does that leave us, fellows?
5799974	5804970	B	0.9125067591667175	Dean with the pre penultimate thought and then Ollie?
5808290	5814202	C	0.6266040802001953	Well, I think that there's going to be a big shift from today's Livestream.
5814266	5814880	A	0.5689514875411987	Which.
5818390	5825650	C	0.717494785785675	Tries to be gentle on us, but also anybody who's really curious as to where this goes next.
5825720	5843714	C	0.727483332157135	I think it's going to be a lot more sophisticated and there's going to be a little bit more work to do, but I think at least we've started down a path that hopefully we've piqued your curiosity.
5843842	5846860	C	0.9060991406440735	As the last question says, what are you still curious about?
5847390	5858080	C	0.9546386003494263	I think there's a lot coming up that should be pretty good for those that want to really dig now into the real formalisms and the real structure of this.
5859250	5860122	B	0.8339378237724304	Thank you, Dean.
5860186	5860990	B	0.6637656092643738	Ali?
5865090	5892700	A	0.981752872467041	Well, at the end of our six month joyful ride through this dissertation, I believe, at least from a personal point of view, I truly learned a lot and it piqued my interest in lots of domains and areas which I didn't know I have interest in them before.
5893070	5935574	A	0.9152160882949829	So I think it's really a good mark of an influential work, be it dissertation or a book or paper or any other kinds of academic publication to peak people's mind, to explore in even some unexplored areas and try to connect the dots in particular in the category theory sense, in a very rigorous, well typed and even insightful ways.
5935692	5945930	A	0.944955050945282	And maybe some exciting developments and results can emerge from these kinds of dot connections.
5948920	5952192	B	0.9884350299835205	Thank you both for this excellent stream.
5952256	5976680	B	0.9853517413139343	I have so much gratitude for the whole category theory team, not just the sheaves around Toby that enable and scaffold this work, but also the way that we were able to collaborate over the last months and in the bigger picture, maybe the end of a chapter.
5976760	5983212	B	0.7091483473777771	We just finished chapter one or chapter zero, and that's really what the dot zero is.
5983266	5985260	B	0.8307580947875977	So we were in the dot.
5986320	5990168	B	0.8375261425971985	Now we are bringing the dot zero to a closure.
5990344	6000820	B	0.8433879613876343	Soon we're going to jump into the dot one and the dot two with Toby and even that in some other nested scale is AOO or a dot zero.
6000970	6004548	B	0.9512726068496704	So thank you again, Ali and Dean et al.
6004714	6005910	B	0.6996942758560181	Till next time.
6008440	6009430	C	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
