255710	316650	04:15	Allie: After covering the whole thesis in our six month period, it now begins to make much more sense. I definitely started seeing category theory in almost everywhere. So I'm really excited to have these discussions with Toby and learn even a lot more.	Allie: I had very little familiarity with category theory in my thesis	Categories Theory in the Sciences
317230	419840	05:17	We'll begin here with a meta prompt. What is a question that would lead someone to come to this dissertation? And we're going to cover a lot of Toby's summaries in terms of the contributions, claims and foci of the dissertation. What does this dissertation ask or what would somebody ask to get to it?

421650	747280	07:01	Dean Obeidallah: The dissertation reports some first steps towards a compositional account of active inference and the Bayesian brain. The main aim is to formalize predictive coding through functional semantics and Bayesian lenses will provide an important part of the syntax of statistical models. In this video, we're going to focus on chapter one and chapter seven.	The dissertation is 230 plus pages long. It's in seven chapters that are shown here	Critical Foundations for a Compositional Account of the Bayesian Brain
748100	864864	12:28	Here we have some selections from several works in mathematics and category theory on reading math. The challenge of mathematical understanding is to find a way to make new mental images in oneself. On the second Reading Math slide, a few more great tips on just reading math and what we're doing with math.	Here are some tips on just reading math and category theory on reading	Reading Math
864992	964644	14:24	Math is a language, and as such, it's there to convey something about the world. There is a plain English exposition of what concepts are needed and why. There's also a true wealth of beautiful diagrams. And about role of proofs in reading maths.	There is a plain English exposition of what concepts are needed and why	A Short Introduction to Math
964682	1188460	16:04	Dean: How do we negotiate these esoteric or inscrutable symbolic systems that seemingly constitute the majority of the words in certain passages? Ollie: Great comments about applied category theory. I believe Toby's dissertation will help a lot in shaping the future trajectories.	Dean: Reading a PhD dissertation can be like getting dropped in the deep end	Reading Toby's Dissertation

These two issues come up in many other areas and outside science as well.	Ali: Toby uses category theory to address two issues in his dissertation	The language of category theory in the Dissertation
2042100	2256290	34:02	Theory of predictive coding has a clear compositional structure that explains the bi directional circuitry observed in the brain. Categories theory somehow unifies, or in other words, translates these kinds of theories into a rigorous and coherent framework.

2257750	2383610	37:37	Don't we see diagrams like this all the time in active inference with internal external blanket states, the particular partition, hierarchical predictive processing, Bayesian brain architectures? We're going to be able to talk about how these types of diagrams can be enriched with this category theoretic perspective.

2386210	2711100	39:46	The dissertation is titled as mathematical foundations for a compositional account of the Bayesian brain as opposed to active Inference. In chapter seven, toby suggests some potential ways that this kind of integration can potentially be done in the future.

2711870	2753820	45:11	All right. Chapter One is already foreshadowing the idea of cognitive maps. Some are expressed in the language of approximate variational inference. Some attempt to combine the two. We expect that the foundations developed here will help us unify these accounts.	Chapter One is already foreshadowing the idea of cognitive maps	Neurocognitive Maps
2757790	2950620	45:57	Our primary motivation in writing this thesis is to lay the groundwork for well typed cognitive science and computational neuroscience. And either of you have any comments on this or want to talk about the last piece? Yeah, I'll talk quickly about scientific faith.	This thesis lays groundwork for well typed cognitive science and computational neuroscience	Well-Typed Cognitive Science and Computational Neuroscience
2952690	3114114	49:12	Well typed cognitive science is quite a rigorous and individualized notion of scientific endeavor, at least in my opinion. Some philosophers advocate the position of disunity of sciences. There's so many different angles where well typing is going to matter for the way that we think about compositional, cognitive cartography.

3114152	3166530	51:54	Now, chapter seven, we skipped over a few pieces. That's how the last six months felt. You jump into chapter one and it's exciting. Then this vast tundra opens of chapters two through six. Now let's get to chapter seven and then the sandwich will be dissected with Toby.	Now, chapter seven, we skipped over a few pieces, didn't we	The End of The Year: Chapter 7
3167190	3340010	52:47	Toby points to three prominent shortcomings of the thesis. The notion of approximate inference doctrine should be tested with further exemplification. Although we consider lower level neural circuit models, we did not explicitly connect our approximate inference doctrines to these more biological models.

How this happens is called sensor fusion, and category theory is helping us understand the compositionality of such issues. Also missing from the current chief theoretic understanding of sensor fusion is a thorough treatment of belief and uncertainty.

3627850	3712160	1:00:27	We hope that these tools will suggest new connections to work on quantum theoretic formulations of the free energy framework. Categories theory and adjacent tools are already widely utilized in quantum sciences. Here we have the category theory, active inference, Bayesian brain, free energy principle synthesis.	Free energy principle synthesis is something we've discussed in several stream series	Quantum Information Science: Learning structure and structured learning
3716550	3965506	1:01:56	Toby: structured learning means extending the process of learning to a structured setting. By learning structure, he means learning the underlying structures themselves. The problem of learning structure then becomes a problem of generalized parameter learning. We expect the connection to be made by information geometry.	Toby: Structured learning and learning structure are complementary concepts	Inferring Structured Learning and Learning Structure
3965608	4207490	1:06:05	Ali: There's a close relationship between beliefs about the geometry of an environment and beliefs about expected future trajectories in that environment. This has been suggested as an explanation for the predictive nature of the cognitive map. And this particular claim maps perhaps perfectly onto Boujaki's theory of brain from inside out.	This section mainly addresses the success of representation and other cognitive map theories	Cognitive map theory, the free energy principle
4208580	4330010	1:10:08	On the compositional cognitive cartography, there's some discussion about the internal universe of the topos. The representations of the cognitive map are inherently context dependent. Maybe we can start calling them a slice or a bundle instead of a slide.	Cognitive maps are inherently context dependent, Dean Ali says	Cognitive Cartography and the Topos
4330780	4569590	1:12:10	7.2 societies of Systems I'll just say that a collection of purely passive agents is no society at all. Want to add anything more on the forwards and backwards, perhaps, and the compositional structure?	Ali: Compositional theory of active inference should have forwards and backwards channels	7.2 Societies of Systems
4571720	4728410	1:16:11	7.21 active Inference there are some mentions about the resemblance between active inference and economic games. In order to realize its goal, the system must enact a plan. What is the type of a plan? These seem to us to be key questions for future work.	7.2 what is the type of a plan? Perception and action are	7.2.2 What is the type of a plan?
4729820	4923460	1:18:49	There is a close relationship between active inference theory, markup decision problems and reinforcement learning. The standard algorithm for gaining an optimality for policy selection is usually called backward induction. Future work will need to untangle this not of interrelated bi directional process.

4926230	5075714	1:22:06	Continuing on with reinforcement learning, open games, and ecosystems. I believe that the idea of open games is a future path that a lot of formalized and structured learning is going to take. And so I think that everything that you're seeing here may become a new model.

5218488	5426930	1:26:58	The emerging biosymiotic reconceptualization of life acknowledges the importance and universality of communication in context. Many of the formal ingredients of compositional active inference is well aligned with the informal structures of biosymiotics. It might be worth exploring some of these ideas with Toby and Dean.

5427270	6009430	1:30:27	Future work connected to this thesis need not only be an application. A number of purely theoretical questions raise themselves too. A new understanding of computation may follow the semiotic understanding of information processing. Any of you want to comment on some of these avenues?
