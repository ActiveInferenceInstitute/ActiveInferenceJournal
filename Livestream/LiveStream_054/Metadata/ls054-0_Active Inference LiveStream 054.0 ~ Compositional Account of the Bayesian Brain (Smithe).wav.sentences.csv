5670	7714	2	B	0.96061	Hello and welcome everyone.
7912	12498	3	B	0.99828	This is active inference Livestream number 54.0.
12664	18050	4	B	0.84376	We're discussing mathematical foundations for a compositional account of the Bayesian Brain.
18630	20942	5	B	0.99992	Welcome to the active institute.
21086	28050	6	B	0.64708	We're a participatory online institute that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference.
28430	34906	7	B	0.99559	This is a recorded, archived and published Livestream, so please provide feedback so we can improve our work.
35088	51790	8	B	0.99971	All backgrounds and perspective are welcome and we'll follow video etiquette for Livestream, head over Active Inference.org to learn more about getting involved in live streams and in a variety of other projects and learning groups.
53090	76502	9	B	0.93605	All right, well, we're in stream number 54.0 and we're going to be learning and discussing the paper that was submitted on the 23 December 2022 as part of a dissertation work, mathematical Foundations for a Compositional Account of the Bayesian Brain by Toby St. Clere
76556	77790	10	B	0.99866	Smithe.
77970	83718	11	B	1	The video is an introduction for some of the ideas in this multi hundred page thesis.
83814	103150	12	B	0.95747	It's not a review or a final word or a thesis dissertation committee, this 54.0, given the scope and the complexity, but also accessibility of the ideas, we're going to be approaching it in a familiar way, but also with some twists.
103810	109410	13	B	0.99721	We're going to begin with some introductions, the aims and claims, abstract and roadmap as usual.
110070	117714	14	B	1	Then we're going to approach the keywords and the context in a slightly different way than we've done in a lot of other zeros.
117842	130458	15	B	1	And then we're going to kind of bookend the dissertation and focus most on chapter one and chapter seven, the first and the final chapter and chapters two through six.
130544	135514	16	B	0.99794	We're looking forward to unpacking more with Toby in the coming weeks.
135712	140826	17	B	0.99948	So we'll begin with some introductions and warm ups.
140858	150430	18	B	0.99997	We could all just say hello and something that was exciting for us about the paper dissertation or what brought us to the work.
150500	151262	19	B	0.74564	I'll begin.
151396	152202	20	B	0.98464	I'm Daniel.
152266	173826	21	B	0.53823	I'm a researcher in California, and I have to say that six months ago, when we started this journey haw on the heels of the dissertation being posted when, along with Ali and Dean and others, we decided to embark on this weekly learning quest, I was very unfamiliar with category theory.
173938	178506	22	B	1	And thankfully, after closing the window, it all escapes my mind.
178608	184940	23	B	0.78266	So it's been quite a six month period to learn and to forget so much.
185310	186970	24	B	0.97888	I'll pass to Dean.
187550	188358	25	C	0.9189	Thanks, Daniel.
188374	190098	26	C	0.90232	I'm Dean, I'm here in Calgary.
190294	223938	27	C	0.97	I think the thing for me, when it was first broached the idea of taking this up about a decade ago, I started just scratching the surface of this idea called category theory, and to see this amount of work put together, to sort of bring a whole bunch of ideas together and, as Daniel already mentioned, make it somewhat accessible or I don't know if it's a beginner's guide or a category theory for dummies.
224034	224390	28	C	0.99992	Exactly.
224460	226934	29	C	0.99583	Because there's still a lot in here.
227052	241238	30	C	0.57614	But in terms of giving us an opportunity to get some verifications, for me, at least that's what I got with some validations and some verifications was really helpful.
241334	251390	31	C	0.63257	So I am excited about having a chance to talk about this and bring the author on eventually and have that conversation get extended and I'll pass it over to Ali.
255710	256650	32	A	0.80194	Thank you.
256800	260326	33	A	0.9641	I'm Ali, I'm an independent researcher from Iran.
260518	275070	34	A	0.99923	Well, I also had just a passing familiarity with category theory and wasn't familiar at all with lots of terminology and formalism in this thesis.
275570	287140	35	A	0.99998	But after covering the whole thesis in our six month period, it now begins to make much more sense.
289670	304494	36	A	1	I definitely started seeing category theory in almost everywhere, both in sciences and also in some other, not specifically scientific areas.
304642	314074	37	A	0.80054	So I'm really excited to have these discussions with Toby and learn even a lot more.
314192	314860	38	A	0.89915	Thanks.
315630	316650	39	B	0.43466	Excellent.
317230	319100	40	B	0.94345	All right, on we go.
320110	322466	41	B	0.62338	We'll begin here with a meta prompt.
322598	331730	42	B	0.99874	So for all of you human and non human language models, please fill your context window with this metaprompt.
335350	336900	43	B	0.76023	On to the big questions.
337270	343810	44	B	0.9343	So we have some hidden questions that are in white font below that those who go to the slides will find and discover.
343970	347080	45	B	0.99998	But we raised many questions.
347530	352086	46	B	0.99	And Dean or Ali, what's just a question that strikes you today?
352188	357606	47	B	0.99946	What is a question that would lead someone to come to this dissertation?
357798	365574	48	B	0.87	And we're going to be covering a lot of Toby's summaries in terms of the contributions, Ames claims and foci of the dissertation.
365622	372510	49	B	0.99999	But what does this dissertation ask or what would somebody ask to get to this dissertation?
375090	376430	50	B	0.98	Yeah, please, Dean.
376850	392174	51	C	1	I think the first thing for me was if we are pattern seekers and pattern impliers, then if you're going to look at what the formalism behind that is, then this is a good place to start.
392232	410090	52	C	0.95533	If you want to know why we tend to put things into groups, why things have a world where there's something that's in a category or outside of a category, and most importantly, where are the things that aren't in either of those two places?
410510	417420	53	C	0.99997	This gives you some of the operational backbone to be able to start figuring that out.
419090	419840	54	B	0.99852	Awesome.
421650	423840	55	B	0.89932	All right, on we go.
424450	426846	56	B	0.67267	Aims and claims of the paper.
427028	441266	57	B	0.75584	So, paper or dissertation Draft mathematical Foundations for a Compositional Account of the Bayesian Brain was uploaded in late December 2022 and just several overview claims of the work.
441448	454680	58	B	0.99988	Our main aim in this thesis is to formalize predictive coding through functional semantics and Bayesian lenses will provide an important part of the syntax of statistical models that we need.
455530	465750	59	B	0.99997	In this 54.0 video, we're only going to cover chapter one and chapter seven, and we're going to review them for some really interesting, bold and ambitious claims.
465910	476670	60	B	0.99	And there's a few great overview claims for the entire work that do a great job of just distilling down so many hundreds of pages and so many technical contributions from page seven.
476820	488862	61	B	1	The main individual contribution of this thesis is the introduction of Bayesian lenses and the proof that Bayesian lenses compose optically and the first sentence of the abstract.
489006	495874	62	B	0.99996	This dissertation reports some first steps towards a compositional account of active inference and the Bayesian brain.
496002	498870	63	B	0.99638	Anything else to add on aims and claims?
502740	508660	64	B	1	Okay, either of you please start with the first half of the abstract.
510040	510964	65	C	0.63093	I'll read it.
511082	512448	66	C	0.69096	Go for it, Dean.
512544	512900	67	A	0.99	Yeah.
512970	518496	68	C	1	The dissertation reports some first steps towards compositional count of active inference and the Bayesian brain.
518608	528420	69	C	0.71807	Specifically, we use the tools of contemporary applied category theory to supply functional semantics for approximate inference.
528580	535128	70	C	1	To do so, we define, on the syntactic side, the new notion of Bayesian lenses.
535304	543420	71	C	0.77427	Think it's important to get the plural there and show that Bayesian updating composes according to the compositional lens pattern.
543940	556408	72	C	0.98724	Using Bayesian lenses, and inspired by compositional game theory, we define categories of statistical games and use them to classify various problems of statistical inference.
556524	583684	73	C	0.57424	On the semantic side, we present a new formalization of general open dynamical systems, particularly deterministic stochastic and random and discrete and continuous time as certain coalgebras of polynomial functions which we show collect into monoidal open text categories or alternatively, into algebras for multi categories of generalized polynomial functors.
583812	599692	74	C	0.99998	We use these openexed categories to define monoidal bicategories of cilia dynamical systems which control lenses and which supply detarget for our functorial semantics.
599756	601090	75	C	0.99981	Just one quick thing.
601780	608390	76	C	0.99989	If you're like me, you had to spend a lot of time finding out what do these words actually mean?
611800	619140	77	B	0.99656	We're going to come to talk more about words and Ali second half the abstract.
620700	637020	78	A	0.81015	Accordingly, we construct Funk tours which explain the bi directional compositional structure of predictive coding neural circuits under the free energy principle, thereby giving a formal mathematical underpinning to the bi directionality observed in the cortex.
637440	651680	79	A	0.9978	Along the way, we explain how to compose rate coded neural circuits using an algebra for a multicategory of linear circuit diagrams, showing subsequently that this is subsumed by lenses and polynomial functors.
652100	667830	80	A	0.99981	Because category theory is unfamiliar to many computational neuroscientists and cognitive scientists, we have made a particular effort to give clear, detailed and approachable expositions of all the category theoretical structures and results of which we make use.
668600	679240	81	A	0.99992	We hope that this dissertation will prove helpful in establishing a new well typed science of life and mind and in facilitating interdisciplinary communication.
680780	681530	82	B	0.9997	Awesome.
682560	685660	83	B	0.99	Okay, here's the roadmap.
686160	699120	84	B	0.63357	We're only showing a zoomed out view because if the other papers we've discussed were going on a road trip this is the continent scale road trip.
700340	705376	85	B	0.97	The dissertation is 230 plus pages long.
705478	714660	86	B	0.99984	It's in seven chapters that are shown here, and in 54.0, we're going to be focusing on chapter one and chapter seven.
714810	718150	87	B	0.99994	So it's quite a piece of work.
718940	722468	88	B	0.72	And this is just the background and context.
722564	727610	89	B	0.881	There's a table of contents with more information and on what the chapters do.
728140	741852	90	B	0.77858	Let's take a few more steps or moments in the background and context to really set up the reading and expressing of this work and really this kind of work.
741986	747280	91	B	0.99777	So thanks a lot to Jr for preparing some of the following slides.
748100	758900	92	B	0.57311	Here we have some selections from several works in mathematics and category theory on reading math.
760520	763568	93	B	0.99995	There is a real joy in doing mathematics.
763744	769930	94	B	0.9999	We've all heard it before, but it really comes to be true when we enact it that way.
771740	785070	95	B	1	The challenge of mathematical understanding is to find a way to make new mental images in oneself on the basis of formal definitions, to make these definitions intuitive, to feel what they are talking about.
786000	795016	96	B	1	And Jr's summary of some of the ways that math is utilized in this dissertation.
795128	802764	97	B	0.67111	So, in regards to the writing in this thesis, just like with anything else, something is being written for an audience.
802892	811952	98	B	0.99554	Toby is writing to an audience of domain experts and a dissertation committee, ultimately to demonstrate and embed new contributions to knowledge.
812096	816128	99	B	0.99951	He also takes a pedagogical approach, a teaching approach.
816304	821732	100	B	1	And Jr asked, is this pedagogical approach something you see in most PhD?
821796	825610	101	B	0.50193	Theses briefly, I would suggest no.
826220	831930	102	B	1	And on the reading of this thesis, it helps to be clear why we're reading it.
832460	840200	103	B	0.7234	If to help understand or sense make active inference models, then aim to read it at one level and take the rest on faith.
840360	849200	104	B	0.99999	If we want to understand the formality better of the really nitty gritty category theory itself, then read to that level and go deeper.
849700	854320	105	B	0.99987	Any thoughts, either of you fellows on the first Reading Math slide?
856580	857088	106	B	0.99	Okay.
857174	864864	107	B	1	And on the second Reading Math slide, a few more great tips on just reading math and what we're doing with math.
864992	867344	108	B	0.9999	So, first, eyes on the prize.
867472	876660	109	B	0.93897	Math is a language, and as such, it's there to convey something about the world, about the structure of this thesis overall.
876820	887592	110	B	1	And overwhelmingly, there is a plain English exposition of what concepts are needed and why, with nice transitions, foreshadowing and back references.
887736	901250	111	B	0.51105	There's also a true wealth of beautiful diagrams, which in category theory have a formality that those used to schema type diagrams will be pleasantly surprised by.
902180	904732	112	B	0.84553	They're definitely challenging to interpret.
904796	913140	113	B	1	It is a new visual language for some, however, it's one that can be admired without necessarily needing all the formality.
914280	922564	114	B	1	About roles of definitions in reading of math, what the audience knows is truth is a shared prior belief.
922692	924184	115	B	0.99977	Things start from there.
924382	936168	116	B	0.99999	These definitions are used to build up further truths through logic and the proofs, and from the Bessis citation in a mathematical text, the most important passages are neither proofs nor theorems.
936264	937640	117	B	0.9973	They are definitions.
937800	947068	118	B	0.78159	Mathematical language works as a construction game where words are truly defined, that is, constructed from other words that themselves have been previously defined.
947244	955600	119	B	0.75	And about role of proofs in reading maths, very similar to providing well argued evidence in any technical writing.
957960	962896	120	B	0.97683	Math is technical writing with math as its particular structure.
963008	964644	121	B	1	And there's other great things to read.
964682	980552	122	B	0.99775	But that's all I'll mention here, just at an overview, are there any other thoughts that either of you would add just about reading math or reading this kind of technical work, which can be like getting dropped in the deep end.
980606	988712	123	B	0.93	I mean, we're getting dropped into the cutting edge PhD contribution frontier of knowledge.
988776	1002748	124	B	0.99998	So how do we negotiate that, especially when there are these esoteric or inscrutable symbolic systems that seemingly constitute the majority of the words in certain passages?
1002844	1003600	125	B	0.92474	Dean.
1005300	1029912	126	C	1	I think this might be a slightly strange metaphor, but what I would equate this process to as a reader, I would equate it to being offered to build a 10,000 piece puzzle, except you have to build it backwards so you don't actually have the benefit of having image and contrast at first.
1029966	1037292	127	C	0.51677	All you basically have is the geometry, but when all the pieces fit together, you're then allowed to flip it over.
1037346	1039256	128	C	0.99958	So you have to be really committed.
1039288	1052530	129	C	0.68	And my hat is often to the work that Toby has done because for him to make it coherent, given the actual volume of information that he would like to pass along.
1054420	1063940	130	C	0.99996	Part of my grinding through this was the thought in my head that if I'm grinding through this, I can't imagine what the author had to go through.
1064090	1068740	131	C	0.99996	So even if you're excited about this, it's still a huge commitment.
1071260	1071960	132	B	0.99612	So true.
1072030	1073210	133	B	0.63094	Ollie, anything?
1077260	1089944	134	A	0.99999	Just wanted to add that well, obviously category theory is very abstract discipline, even for mathematicians.
1090072	1110310	135	A	0.99989	So I agree with Dean that doing such a I mean, such an admirable task of organizing the materials of the dissertation in such a coherent way is truly a herculean task to do so.
1111400	1126680	136	A	0.9573	But another point is that, well, even in the realm of category theory, most of the things done so far is done in the purely mathematical world.
1126830	1145568	137	A	0.98331	So applying those concepts of category theoretical concepts to some realms outside of mathematics is something that's just been explored for the last few years at least.
1145654	1160788	138	A	0.90869	Seriously so I believe Toby didn't have much to start with, given that the scarcity of material in the applied category theory area.
1160874	1169324	139	A	0.99944	But of course it's a burgeoning field and it's gaining traction quite rapidly.
1169472	1182940	140	A	0.99996	So I hope to see much interesting works in the future and I believe Toby's dissertation will help a lot in shaping the future trajectories.
1184720	1188460	141	B	0.99988	Great comments about applied category theory.
1189520	1191768	142	B	0.64487	On to the keywords.
1191864	1200588	143	B	0.99107	So three big keywords are category theory, Bayesian brain and active inference.
1200764	1218790	144	B	1	And then category theory is really a language of its own for some of the relevant keywords that we pulled out in our shared epistemic niche, the coda document that we utilized to collaborate over the last six months as a team.
1219960	1228968	145	B	0.97355	Here's some of the terms that we had on the right side and we had a full table that people who go to the slides or the coda document can explore more.
1229054	1238632	146	B	0.99999	But there were so many creative words, just words that you're not going to get outside of applied or basic category theory.
1238776	1252268	147	B	1	It was quite a learning journey just from a lexical perspective, so a lot of keywords and a lot of domain specific words in category theory.
1252444	1257540	148	B	0.99999	But we keep the bigger picture in mind about Bayesian Brain and active inference.
1257960	1264596	149	B	1	And one last piece of information here before we head off into the dissertation itself.
1264778	1265808	150	B	0.53416	Jr.
1265984	1296464	151	B	0.9999	During their internship over the last several months at the Active Inference Institute, among other works, completed an absolutely beautiful Syllabus adventure mode syllabus for introduction to category theory applied to active inference, and it's hosted on our GitHub at the institute, so hopefully people can find it useful and continue to version and utilize it and make contributions to it.
1296582	1298240	152	B	0.99899	I'll just read the summary.
1300100	1311168	153	B	0.73523	It's for any curious, thrill seeking active Inference institute participant who wishes to study and conduct further research on active inference related papers that involve category theoretic tools.
1311264	1323210	154	B	1	And we have a fractal embedding of a quotation from Christopher White on model stream number 1.1 we have a finite time on this earth, right, and a finite time to dedicate to learning things.
1323580	1332590	155	B	1	The syllabus is centered around the Joy and the dissertation, so another category theoretic work for background and the dissertation itself.
1333120	1350652	156	B	0.93	The approach is based on experiences within the category theory learning group, insights from the Topos Institute Category Theory Outreach Panel and Chang and the Joy Book Club, and this great line from Emily Real in her book Category Theory and Context in the Note to the Reader's section.
1350796	1367088	157	B	0.48484	Inevitably, given the diversity of mathematical tastes and experiences, the examples presented here will seldom be optimized for any particular individual, and indeed, each reader is encouraged to search for their own context in which to explore categorical ideas.
1367184	1378472	158	B	0.83038	So this curriculum is something that will be living and versioning as we move forward in the active inference applied category space.
1378606	1379492	159	B	0.99993	Super exciting.
1379556	1390844	160	B	0.99988	So thanks again Jr, for the epic contribution and we all reviewed the syllabus and just found so many interesting aspects to it.
1390882	1394736	161	B	0.99983	So there's a lot to learn, no surprises there.
1394838	1404172	162	B	0.60419	But it's awesome when other adventurers help create spaces and ways for others to go on their own adventures.
1404236	1408980	163	B	0.76	And it really feels like in category theory that there is a culture of that.
1409050	1410660	164	B	0.99999	So it's really encouraging.
1411640	1416230	165	B	1	Okay, to the overview of the dissertation itself.
1418940	1422148	166	B	0.99556	As stated earlier, there are seven chapters.
1422324	1424676	167	B	0.99968	Chapter one is an introduction.
1424868	1431300	168	B	0.39919	Chapter two is a comprehensive review of the concepts and results needed to understand the mathematical contributions.
1431460	1438760	169	B	0.99498	Chapter three begins to re approach neural modeling and more generally, the algebraic modeling of the structure of interacting systems.
1438920	1447760	170	B	0.99986	Chapter four presents the first main result that Bayesian Updating composes according to the categorical lens pattern.
1448180	1457410	171	B	0.99987	Chapter five introduces the corresponding semantical categories with a new abstract formalization of the concept of open dynamical system.
1457940	1490460	172	B	0.85315	Chapter Six presents the functional formalization of predictive coding using a new notion of approximate inference doctrine by which statistical models are translated into dynamical systems, and chapter Seven reviews the prospects for future work from the Mathematics of the cognitive map a program called compositional cognitive cartography to the composition of multiagent systems and ecosystems and the connections with compositional, game theory, and other categorical approaches to cybernetics.
1491040	1498380	173	B	0.08528	Aliyardine, any overall thoughts on the seven parthe structure of the dissertation?
1501040	1515940	174	C	0.9991	Just real quick, if you decide that you want to read this and use this as your leverage point, I would suggest that maybe you do it in the usual chronological order.
1516090	1519116	175	C	0.99997	But you also will find that you can work backwards.
1519248	1525012	176	C	0.667	In fact, there's stuff in chapter seven that literally points you in that direction.
1525156	1532028	177	C	0.56264	So you might want to give it like a once over just to sort of orient yourself.
1532114	1551840	178	C	1	And then you should feel free to be able to go bi directionally, just a strategic prompt, because if you get bogged down and it's very easy to get sort of caught up in the minutiae of this, I would just say Zuma, step back.
1551990	1562660	179	C	0.56	And if it's not registering on the first pass, it might register if you start going a little bit backwards and forwards instead of just one directional.
1563960	1564710	180	B	0.99846	Great.
1566040	1571388	181	B	0.73	And just to summarize some of the primary contributions few quotes.
1571504	1592220	182	B	1	The main contribution of this thesis is the formalization of models of predictive coding circuits as functional semantics and the associated development and exemplification of categories of statistical games, as well as the introduction of Bayesian lenses and the proof that Bayesian updates compose optically that is in some sense like optics.
1592720	1604640	183	B	0.99993	We believe our presentation of general open dynamical systems as certain polynomial coalgebras also to be novel, along with a concept of cilia and their associated monoidal bicategories.
1605540	1615216	184	B	0.99978	We hope that this dissertation contributes to a renaissance of cognitive and computational neuroscience through the adoption of categorical methods.
1615328	1620324	185	B	0.53475	We're going to be returning more to all of these, so it's going to be cool.
1620442	1628650	186	B	0.98	And Ollie, it's all good with a video off for internet's sake, but just raise your hand or bring your video on whenever you would like to speak.
1630380	1645120	187	B	0.99993	Before we take the jump, we just pulled out two small quotes that's going to help us leap off this cliff to map the gap, respect it and beyond.
1645460	1649490	188	B	0.99997	So first, from page 226, this is from chapter seven.
1650020	1664310	189	B	0.99999	This resemblance becomes even closer when one considers the recent Diegetic open parentheses Diegetic occurring within the context of the story and able to be heard by the characters within the story.
1665880	1678036	190	B	1	The recent Diegetic formulation of open games in which strategies themselves can be updated using a backwards map from the arena of the game back into strategies or rather strategy updates.
1678228	1698784	191	B	1	And then fundamentally, from page 225, this is also the idea underlying the successor representation of the cognitive map, which says roughly that the brain's representation of where it is is equivalently a representation of where it soon expects to be.
1698982	1721080	192	B	1	And so how as we bring that last foot of the 6ft off the other side of the cliff and jump through the unknown, how do we take this immense work and update our strategies backwards so that we can successfully represent and disseminate ourselves?
1722700	1728200	193	B	0.99999	Any final words before we jump into chapter one on this topic?
1729740	1755532	194	C	0.51558	Just think if you're part of the active inference community, and you've been wondering if there's been any sort of question in your mind as to the role of strategy in that relationship between inference and action, this is going to be really helpful in terms of maybe giving you a better sense of you identifying and then you carrying out choices.
1755676	1762660	195	C	0.84809	So I think it's very important to now take the leap.
1763960	1766980	196	B	1	Okay, zero to one.
1767130	1768864	197	B	1	Now we're in chapter one.
1769002	1779640	198	B	0.57184	So for the coming slides, Ali or Dean, please just, if you'd like, select one bullet point.
1779790	1783208	199	B	0.99997	Feel free to read the bullet point or give any remark.
1783384	1787564	200	B	0.99	And on these coming slides we're just going to move through.
1787602	1792236	201	B	0.95817	But either of you or both of you, please take the first pass.
1792418	1792844	202	B	0.96292	All right.
1792882	1795200	203	B	0.99996	So chapter one introduction.
1799160	1801312	204	C	0.64874	I'll let people read through the slide.
1801456	1809880	205	C	1	I think the one that we bolded here, category theory is the mathematics of pattern, composition, connection and interaction.
1810620	1819320	206	C	1	I think you can read that, but I believe you also have to kind of sit back and ask yourself, so what does that mean?
1819470	1825240	207	C	0.98669	So right away they're taking a superordinate and they're breaking it up into its parts.
1825400	1836160	208	C	1	And so again, there's this world within world within world thing that is reinforced just in the way that we have to try to communicate the ideas to the readers.
1839220	1840720	209	B	0.99993	Awesome and Ali.
1842500	1859800	210	A	0.98	Yes, and I also think the two problems I find in the first page of chapter one, namely that each research group has not only its own language but also its own perspective, and these languages and perspectives are not well connected.
1861340	1869012	211	A	0.99998	These two issues, I believe, are the organizing themes of the whole dissertation.
1869076	1894530	212	A	0.72	And we see these issues addressed time and time again throughout the thesis and particularly in chapter seven, which these issues are addressed quite explicitly, both in terms of the work or the contribution done in this thesis and the suggestions for future research.
1896040	1905856	213	A	1	The other point is that the language of category theory is homo iconic and can be used to translate constructions between contexts.
1905888	1920136	214	A	0.99964	So again, right at the beginning, this dissertation tries to put a particular perspective in order to address the two issues just mentioned.
1920238	1932350	215	A	0.99986	So in this case, Toby uses the homo iconic property of category theory to address those two issues.
1935220	1949860	216	A	0.92249	Or more explicitly, category theory resolves both problems of scientific translations in this way that concepts expressed categorically are inevitably expressed in context and not in isolation.
1950280	1959652	217	A	0.62	And secondly, these contexts are naturally interconnected as if by a categorical web with the connections and expressed categorically.
1959796	1975864	218	A	0.98847	So in other words, category theory provides probably the ideal toolkit to address those situations, those issues, which I believe is not restricted only to scientific endeavors.
1975992	1985632	219	A	0.99939	So these two issues come up in many other areas and outside science as well.
1985686	1997970	220	A	0.99964	So in that case, I believe category theory can provide a much more general framework to address them, even in non scientific fields as well.
1998420	2001076	221	C	0.68225	Can I just add on to what Ali just said there real quick?
2001178	2005152	222	C	1	I agree with you 100%, Allie, about the toolkit.
2005296	2017752	223	C	1	And I would add that I also believe it gives us an opening to develop a rule kit so that we can actually figure out how to do that translation piece.
2017806	2019812	224	C	1	And it also gives us a pool.
2019956	2036130	225	C	0.79	I like to use things that rhyme because it's easy to remember, but the way that we collect how things congregate, what that attractor state becomes so that we can then figure out how things are moving in that dynamic situation.
2036500	2040480	226	C	0.99996	So I think it provides a toolkit, a rule kit, and a pool kit.
2042100	2042850	227	B	0.96225	Great.
2044580	2048116	228	B	0.48501	All right, next slide on chapter one.
2048218	2051830	229	B	0.95071	I'll just pick one and then either of you please.
2052920	2062836	230	B	0.81	The one that's exciting to me is we show that the theory of predictive coding has a clear compositional structure that explains the bi directional circuitry observed in the brain.
2062948	2088032	231	B	0.99579	So even outside of the connection to the empirical grounded embodied biology, the idea that a lot of the ways that in retrospect, informally, we've been talking over the last years as a field and in the institute about the compositionality of models and can we just plug in the sense states here to the action states here?
2088086	2090112	232	B	0.99988	Can we nest the models these ways?
2090246	2095704	233	B	0.99	And the ways that we've been thinking about the active inference cognitive kernel like a Lego kit.
2095852	2105792	234	B	0.51411	All of this is realizing a level of formality, which doesn't mean inaccessibility, really quite the opposite.
2105936	2109796	235	B	0.73732	That's just accelerating what's possible with predictive coding.
2109828	2113044	236	B	0.80344	Bayesian brain active inference free energy principle.
2113172	2129580	237	B	0.99993	So we're really seeing like a dawning of the formal compositionality and to be able to compose and to be able to construct are going to have a relationship that we can continue to weave in the coming sessions.
2130080	2132910	238	B	0.99813	Either of you want to highlight some other piece here?
2134080	2145200	239	C	0.9	I think it's really interesting because I know that they are trying to build an infrastructure, but a lot of this dissertation has to do with a process that's actually a deconstructor.
2145860	2159800	240	C	0.4799	deconstructure meaning there's a lot of pruning and sculpting that they actually speak to if we were to talk about real things that form and shape and give us that sense of what's in and what's out.
2159950	2173660	241	C	0.99596	So yes, they are building an infrastructure, but then Toby goes along and speaks a whole bunch about so why does this stay and why does this not get included?
2177790	2179660	242	B	0.47364	Ollie, anything or we'll continue.
2182270	2183660	243	A	0.69168	Just real quick.
2184270	2195760	244	A	0.99	It reminds me of Mario Bongay's work on causality and also Alan Garfinkel's theory of explanation and particularly in Garfinkel's work.
2196130	2219446	245	A	0.81557	In his book Forms of Explanation, he provides a theory of explanation based on rigorous modeling of problems in terms of state spaces and how we can address the context dependent explanations based on the contrast space on one hand and the relevant space on the other.
2219548	2250638	246	A	0.75673	So category theory, I believe, somehow unifies, or in other words, translates these kinds of theories into a rigorous and coherent framework that can be used to formalize or rather to frame all of these theories of explanations and causalities within a unified framework.
2250814	2256290	247	A	0.99981	So that's, I believe, one of its greatest advantages.
2257750	2258500	248	B	0.99995	Great.
2260390	2264920	249	B	1	Okay, anyone want to give a comment here?
2269050	2280490	250	B	0.90516	I'll just give a quick comment, which is and this is just a peek ahead to chapter two we're only going to have a few snippets from the medium, the meso chapters, the space between.
2280640	2294778	251	B	0.99998	But don't we see diagrams like this all the time in active inference with internal external blanket states, the particular partition, hierarchical predictive processing, Bayesian brain architectures?
2294954	2297434	252	B	1	We see these diagrams all the time.
2297572	2323034	253	B	1	And section 2.1 is extremely provocative with the analysis of neural circuitry and two other types of systems in really establishing that the drawing, if it's informal, is insufficient to completely convey the argument and to really represent the situation.
2323232	2344654	254	B	0.99999	However, if we use the kind of string diagrams or just diagrams more generally that category theory provides, we really get a graphical compositionality that just drawing on a page, though obviously wonderful and fun, does not reach.
2344852	2366280	255	B	1	And so we're going to be able to talk about how these types of diagrams, which again we see all over the literature, can be enriched with this category theoretic perspective so that we can assess, well, what if I draw a line from this one over to that one?
2366650	2367666	256	B	0.99999	Is that valid?
2367698	2369474	257	B	1	How is that going to change the properties?
2369602	2381702	258	B	1	And so we're going to be able to know a lot more about that when we understand the compositional structure via the Bayesian lenses of these compositional Bayesian systems.
2381846	2383610	259	B	0.99999	Anything else to add on this slide?
2386210	2387120	260	B	0.94554	All right.
2389010	2390234	261	B	0.54261	Dean or Ali?
2390282	2391040	262	B	0.99998	Go ahead.
2396010	2414910	263	A	0.99065	So chapter one begins with the claim that the brain's visual circuitry seems to be roughly hierarchical, and this hierarchical structure is a hint of compositionality and thus a sign that a categorical approach may be helpful and enlightening.
2415810	2425250	264	A	0.99999	On the other hand, the underlying equations of the free energy principle exhibit a form of compositionality which is used to obtain the hierarchical models.
2425670	2441240	265	A	0.68976	Despite the hint of compositionality, the equations of motion for these hierarchical systems are typically derived from scratch each time a redundant effort that would not be required had a compositional formalism, such as category theory being used from the start.
2441690	2450970	266	A	0.99876	So this thesis supplies such a categorical formalism and exemplifies it with hierarchical predictive coding under the free energy principle.
2451550	2457382	267	A	0.99886	Category theory has a rich formal vocabulary for precisely describing universal constructions.
2457526	2460298	268	A	1	And so not only does a categorical formulation of.
2460304	2471870	269	A	1	The free energy framework promise to clarify the current confusions around FEP, but it may be expected also to shed light on its potential universality.
2473730	2476980	270	B	0.99939	Just so exciting and interesting.
2477510	2490840	271	B	0.55	And in terms of the current, the past, present and future status of the free energy principle and active inference, it's an absolutely consequential direction of work.
2491290	2492840	272	B	0.99914	Dean, anything here?
2494170	2494822	273	C	0.68275	No.
2494956	2505562	274	C	1	I know that in seven four one, which we'll talk about later, the introduction of the term fuzzy and fuzzy distributions comes up.
2505616	2511660	275	C	0.99964	So even though they're being precise, they're being precise, their fuzziness as well.
2513010	2513470	276	B	0.99998	Great.
2513540	2520030	277	B	0.9999	Like a high resolution picture of a fuzzy jacket onwards.
2520610	2527662	278	B	0.95868	So in this thesis, we do not get as far as a completely general formulation of active inference.
2527726	2533186	279	B	0.94	And it goes without saying this expression could be added to every single thing that we read today.
2533288	2543720	280	B	1	But in the coming videos and beyond, we're going to discuss what this all means and just one more exciting piece from this page.
2544570	2560998	281	B	0.99988	Because active inference models and the free energy framework more broadly are descriptions of systems that are open to an environment, interacting with it, and therefore situated in context, they are particularly suited to a category theoretic reformulation.
2561174	2575582	282	B	0.92427	So that's very exciting because we've from qualitative philosophical, humanistic approaches and also from statistical, numerical, formal approaches.
2575726	2592280	283	B	0.98772	We've discussed a lot of this openness and now we have another entree or another vector or another toolkit rule kit, pool kit to work with, and that is just opening the space up a lot.
2592650	2594582	284	B	0.88173	Ollie or Dean, want to add anything.
2594636	2596822	285	C	0.63705	Here, just real quick?
2596876	2598434	286	C	0.55259	We've talked in other live streams.
2598482	2608746	287	C	0.99601	We've used images of ice cream cones and ice cream trucks and what's in the foreground and what's in the background, what's actually the context and what is the content.
2608928	2623086	288	C	1	And this reinforces that idea of as the observer, as the one using their optic nerves, what did you choose to put in front and what is in behind?
2623188	2631202	289	C	1	And we have to keep that in mind because we shouldn't assume that everybody chooses the way that we do.
2631336	2636846	290	C	0.95841	So, again, just making sure we understand what's being said here in this slide.
2636878	2637880	291	C	0.52969	It's really important.
2638570	2639990	292	B	0.99998	Thank you, Ali.
2642890	2655350	293	A	0.97	Yes, and I still think it's really clever to title the dissertation as mathematical foundations for a compositional account of the Bayesian brain as opposed to active Inference.
2655510	2672154	294	A	0.99996	Because, as we all know, one of the distinguishing features of active inference theory and what sets it apart from other related theories such as Bayesian brain and predictive coding theories, is the fundamental integration of action into perception.
2672282	2696194	295	A	0.59273	So as long as this dissertation doesn't provide a full fledged account of this kind of action integration, I believe it would be more appropriate to term it as a compositional account of the Bayesian brain and not particularly active inference.
2696242	2708778	296	A	1	But of course, in chapter seven, toby suggests some potential ways that this kind of integration can potentially be done in the future.
2708864	2709500	297	A	0.55251	Research.
2710350	2711100	298	B	0.92043	Awesome.
2711870	2712778	299	B	0.96158	All right.
2712944	2718250	300	B	0.99999	Chapter One is already foreshadowing the idea of cognitive maps.
2718410	2722698	301	B	0.62	And Toby writes current models of cognitive maps.
2722874	2727582	302	B	0.99979	Some are expressed in the language of approximate variational inference.
2727726	2729746	303	B	0.82605	We talk about that a lot.
2729928	2733220	304	B	0.99997	Some are expressed in the language of reinforcement learning.
2733670	2736100	305	B	1	Some attempt to combine the two.
2736810	2741922	306	B	0.99997	We expect that the foundations developed here will help us unify these accounts.
2742066	2744114	307	B	0.99997	So how can we be reimagining?
2744162	2744870	308	B	0.98413	Maps?
2746490	2748070	309	B	0.65885	Cognitive maps?
2748570	2749900	310	B	0.89028	Aren't they all?
2751070	2753820	311	B	0.51348	Alir, Dean, anything else to add here?
2757790	2763040	312	B	0.93045	All right, and last few selections from chapter One.
2764050	2765118	313	B	0.99995	Either of you, please.
2765204	2766414	314	B	0.78747	What's the first take?
2766452	2767040	315	B	0.67184	Here?
2773430	2774562	316	B	0.99743	I'll go first.
2774696	2782946	317	B	0.99995	Our primary motivation in writing this thesis is to lay the groundwork for well typed cognitive science and computational neuroscience.
2783138	2792398	318	B	0.82858	It's a very interesting topic about the implications of well typing and what does it mean for something to be well typed?
2792434	2798006	319	B	0.99999	What is a programming language or a scientific culture or a framework that's well piped?
2798198	2809840	320	B	1	The free energy framework, like the structurally adjacent framework of compositional game theory, has a strong flavor of teleology what is that taste like?
2811010	2815698	321	B	1	And systems act in order to make their predictions come true.
2815864	2819940	322	B	0.93134	We come to this so many times and in so many ways.
2820310	2845750	323	B	0.99999	In reinforcement or reward oriented learning, you have a reward function, and systems work to maximize reward, whereas in free energy as a bounding variable or functional on surprise, the imperative is to bound and reduce surprise such that expectations or preferences are realized.
2845910	2848822	324	B	0.98	And so here it's expressed qualitatively.
2848966	2864370	325	B	0.99976	We've approached this in many different paper discussions from a statistical, numerical, formal, analytical angle, and here we're approaching it from another formal avenue of category theory.
2864790	2871234	326	B	1	And either of you have any comments on this or want to talk about the last piece?
2871432	2874702	327	C	0.99	Yeah, I'll talk quickly about scientific faith.
2874846	2884818	328	C	0.99753	In the programming that I did, we had a little axiom or expression that was, if it isn't history, then it's a mystery.
2884914	2889898	329	C	1	And I think that's part of what this scientific faith piece is all about.
2889984	2902014	330	C	0.94	I mean, if you have some data, if you have some way of recording or taking in or gaining some sense of, that's great, that's the historical part.
2902052	2911194	331	C	0.99988	But you still also need that curiosity and that sense that there is yet still to be witnessed and observed.
2911322	2915460	332	C	0.65	And you have to have some faith that sticking around is going to be able to provide that opportunity.
2921270	2926706	333	C	1	I don't know if a well typed science will buttress scientific faith.
2926738	2930434	334	C	1	I think sometimes the personality matters.
2930482	2950620	335	C	0.66	I think if you're the kind of person who believes in curiosity being resolved and wayfinding being a really good strategy to find out who you are and what the world is about, I think that's the faith piece that some of us just seem to carry around, whether we like it or not.
2952690	2953294	336	B	0.99967	Awesome.
2953412	2957200	337	B	0.30455	Ali, anything on this slide or enclosure of chapter one?
2961090	2968446	338	A	0.99501	Just wanted to mention that by well typed cognitive science, or more generally, well typed science.
2968638	2982114	339	A	0.56	I believe Toby somehow implying a kind of more or less claim for disunity of sciences as opposed to a unified vision of science.
2982162	3009514	340	A	0.99999	Because you see, in the unified vision for science, every explanatory models and every theory can theoretically be unified within an overarching principle or overarching theory, which has not been discovered yet.
3009632	3015982	341	A	0.88537	But some philosophers advocate the position of disunity of sciences.
3016126	3034646	342	A	0.99999	In other words, although there are some commonalities between every scientific areas, but there are some individual types, or individual concepts, if you will, that cannot be taken.
3034828	3047526	343	A	0.92	I mean, this individuality cannot be taken for granted simply by just explaining it away, by proposing some unifying principle.
3047638	3059834	344	A	0.99996	So in this sense, well typed science is quite a rigorous and individualized notion of scientific endeavor, at least in my opinion.
3059882	3063790	345	A	0.69166	But I'm curious to know Toby's opinion.
3064790	3076786	346	B	0.66845	I'll just add one more comment on the well typed in programming languages where type safety or type soundness is being described as a beneficial feature in certain contexts.
3076818	3090486	347	B	0.99685	Obviously, people point to the way that a well typed language can prevent illegal operations or use safer handling of short term memory, working memory, and avert logical errors.
3090598	3104926	348	B	0.99994	So it's very interesting to think about what that means in science in terms of not just the reproducibility of experimentation, but in terms of what experiments and what research avenues are pursued overall, as well as even cognitive security.
3105028	3114114	349	B	0.99996	So there's so many different angles where well typing is going to matter for the way that we think about compositional, cognitive cartography, which we're going to come to.
3114152	3120354	350	B	1	Now, chapter seven, we skipped over a few pieces, didn't we?
3120472	3122222	351	B	0.99926	That's how the last six months felt.
3122286	3123730	352	C	0.57	It was 9900.
3123800	3124420	353	C	0.7	Yeah.
3130570	3135640	354	B	0.97566	I'll hold on the jokes for now, but yeah, we skipped about 200 pages right there.
3136810	3140730	355	B	0.99982	That's the part that you want to take lightly.
3141150	3142902	356	B	0.99894	That's the bottom of the bathtub.
3142966	3145574	357	B	0.56	You jump into chapter one and it's exciting.
3145622	3146934	358	B	0.99993	It's like skiing downhill.
3146982	3158830	359	B	0.79	And then this vast tundra opens of chapters two through six, which again was the last half year for us and several others.
3158900	3166530	360	B	0.91143	So now let's get to chapter seven, and then the sandwich will be dissected with Toby.
3167190	3167940	361	B	1	Okay.
3170070	3176738	362	B	1	With absolute humility and accuracy, toby points to three prominent shortcomings of the thesis.
3176754	3180230	363	B	0.80168	Ali, do you want to summarize these three shortcomings?
3182170	3182920	364	A	0.99999	Sure.
3183370	3191450	365	A	0.99868	So the first one is that the notion of approximate inference doctrine should be tested with further exemplification.
3192590	3200380	366	A	0.91934	In other words, specifically with the problem of double counting, which is addressed in chapter six.
3203470	3217250	367	A	1	The other one is that the general models that Toby is considered in this dissertation are somehow static despite its application in modeling dynamical systems.
3217590	3222530	368	A	0.856	So again, this problem is addressed.
3223190	3237190	369	A	0.67	I mean, some suggestions for overcoming this shortcoming is addressed in this chapter, specifically in relation to Meyer's Categorical theory of dynamical systems.
3237690	3251130	370	A	1	And finally, although we consider lower level neural circuit models, we did not explicitly connect our approximate inference doctrines to these more biological models.
3251490	3270850	371	A	0.99555	So in other words, it's not a theory for modeling the whole Iguana, it's just a modeling framework for modeling a very specific function or the cognitive function of the brain.
3272070	3277410	372	C	0.68	I don't know that knowing your limits should be considered a shortcoming.
3277750	3281490	373	C	0.90712	That's just philosophical me going knowing.
3282010	3287398	374	C	0.98	Okay, so of the three of us, I'm the one guy who's proud to say I get it wrong 20% of the time.
3287484	3292374	375	C	1	I don't give a rat's backside most often about precision and perfection.
3292502	3293818	376	C	0.72	I want to try.
3293984	3306206	377	C	0.88	And so if somebody says, well, the thing that I'm talking about here has its limits and it's not going to solve all the problems of the world, I just think that's being realistic and honest.
3306388	3314420	378	C	0.99974	So call it shortcomings, I see it as a bit of a feature, being self aware of not being able to do everything at once.
3315350	3321218	379	B	0.96	Yeah, so often in papers it's apologetic when it's actually the adjacent possible.
3321384	3325586	380	B	1	And there's always an adjacent possible, indeed an expanding one.
3325688	3340010	381	B	0.68959	So to make an exponentially expansive apology rather than pointing to the adjacent possible and seeing what can become is just two sides of the same coin with a third side being the rim on that coin.
3341310	3347430	382	B	0.88	7.1 structured worlds and 7.1.1 Bayesian sensor fusion.
3347510	3349930	383	B	0.30581	Ollie, how do you see sensor fusion?
3353490	3376262	384	A	0.96	Yes, so sensor fusion is a situation where one has a number of sensors which report spatially situated data and also it's kind of a problem of combining the local data with the global data.
3376396	3404526	385	A	0.98996	So in category theory there is an obvious choice for addressing this particular problem, namely the notion of sheets, which is a spatially coherent data type, something like a bundle for which local sections can always be uniquely glued together into a global section, as Toby described here.
3404708	3422958	386	A	0.69	And it reminds me of the theory of, I mean the derivation of the duality between FEP and CMEP in Bayesian mechanics paper by deploying these notions of bundles.
3423134	3440730	387	A	0.99813	So in other sense, sheath theory and the related fields of applied topology and chromology allow us to judge when it is possible to form a consensus and quantify the obstructions to the formation of consensus.
3442270	3458030	388	A	0.8635	Hence, the consensus between FEP and CMAP as done in Bayesian mechanics paper, I believe is done in the same sense of sheath theory as providing a possibility for emerging such a consensus.
3459490	3469970	389	A	1	And also missing from the current chief theoretic understanding of sensor fusion is a thorough treatment of belief and uncertainty, especially from a Bayesian perspective.
3470390	3485910	390	A	0.9	A first possible extension of the work presented here is to extend statistical gains and approximate and approximate inference doctrines and hence the classes of model that they encompass, to structured data types such as sheets.
3486410	3492570	391	A	1	We expect that the first step will be to consider categories of channels between sheeps.
3493550	3494154	392	B	0.99988	Awesome.
3494272	3507626	393	B	0.97	And just to give a more mundane or empirical example of sensor fusion, what if we have many EEG sensors on a head and we need to synthesize into one joint representation?
3507738	3514254	394	B	0.99999	Or what if we have temperature sensors across an agricultural field and humidity sensors?
3514382	3523890	395	B	0.99994	How this happens is called sensor fusion, and category theory is helping us understand the compositionality of such issues.
3524040	3533750	396	C	0.8049	Dean yeah, I just want to focus in on bullet number two here, because, Daniel, both you and Allie, I think you're absolutely correct.
3533820	3543290	397	C	1	I think where they say something like a bundle for which local sections can always be uniquely glued together into a global section.
3543630	3551166	398	C	0.99027	Well, of course they can, but I don't know that that's necessarily the magic what if in a counterfactual sense.
3551268	3552910	399	C	0.99998	What if they are glued?
3553730	3556240	400	C	0.99952	Is that something we must commit to?
3558050	3573410	401	C	1	And then if it is going to be glued together into some sort of global composition, when that timing of when to do that, I also think is something that we judge.
3574070	3582742	402	C	0.52853	So is that the data set, the what if and the when, is that the data set that we're going to eventually bump into?
3582876	3584440	403	C	1	I would argue yes.
3584810	3590854	404	C	0.99977	Does that mean we're going to have to pass through that moment and come out on the other side of it, hopefully still intact?
3590982	3594940	405	C	1	Yes, to me, that is consensus building.
3595470	3601066	406	C	0.99535	So I know that that's one little sentence in a 200 page paper.
3601168	3622626	407	C	1	But again, there are so many nuggets in this paper where if you just slow down and read it and think about what the implications of what they're saying are, you could literally go off right there on that one sentence and spend hours trying to figure out, okay, so really, what should we be doing with this?
3622648	3624110	408	C	0.52709	Is this a priority?
3624270	3624980	409	C	0.99245	Whatever.
3625690	3626440	410	B	0.99984	Awesome.
3627850	3640902	411	B	0.99902	Continuing on to address that first shortcoming, we already mentioned Sheaves, and we hope that these tools will suggest new connections to work on quantum theoretic formulations of the free energy framework.
3641046	3644662	412	B	0.99473	That's something we've discussed in several stream series.
3644806	3666722	413	B	0.74033	Livestream 17 with Chris Fields on information flow in context dependent hierarchical Bayesian inference, Livestream 40 with Friston, Levin, Glazebrook and Fields on a free energy principle for generic quantum systems and the ongoing Chris Fields course, Physics as Information Processing 2023.
3666856	3687122	414	B	0.99992	So category theory and adjacent tools are already widely utilized in quantum sciences, quantum information science, more broadly, quantum computation, and so on one hand, we see the quantum and free energy principle synthesis outlined in these stream series.
3687266	3694038	415	B	0.98	And here we have the category theory, active inference, Bayesian brain, free energy principle synthesis.
3694134	3699930	416	B	0.9999	So all three category theory, quantum and FEP walk into a sheath.
3700610	3701840	417	B	0.9856	What do they say?
3703410	3712160	418	B	0.50449	All right, Ali, what is a summary or overview on learning structure and structured learning?
3716550	3716962	419	A	0.8	Yes.
3717016	3724270	420	A	0.99632	So an interesting distinction is provided right at the beginning between structured learning and learning structure.
3724430	3732194	421	A	0.99988	So structured learning, at least Toby, means extending the process of learning to a structured setting.
3732322	3737000	422	A	0.99955	But by learning structure, he means learning the underlying structures themselves.
3738510	3749670	423	A	0.74246	So in the categorical semantics of dependent type theory, the context is witnessed by the object over which a slice category is defined.
3749830	3758634	424	A	1	And in so in some sense it defines the shape of the universe by the growth in the construction.
3758762	3764494	425	A	0.99999	There is correspondence between sheaves and certain bundles as objects of slice categories.
3764622	3771294	426	A	0.9	And so we can think of structured inference and learning as taking place in appropriate slice categories.
3771422	3782600	427	A	0.99997	So both of those somehow address the binary concepts of structured learning and learning structure in a complementary way.
3783450	3789206	428	A	0.99986	So we can think of bundle morphisms as generalized parameters maps.
3789398	3796540	429	A	1	And in that case, the problem of learning structure then becomes a problem of generalized parameter learning.
3797150	3810254	430	A	0.8	And this is the way that some reinforcement learning techniques have been deployed by using this kind of generalized parameter learning.
3810452	3827270	431	A	0.99996	So we expect this line of inquiry to clarify the relationships between our formalism of approximate inference and other related work on the categorical foundations of cybernetics which have typically been studied in a differential rather than probabilistic setting.
3827770	3839366	432	A	0.68089	We expect the connection to be made by information geometry where Bayesian inference can be understood both using gradient descent and as a kind of parallel transport.
3839558	3863070	433	A	0.99999	In other words, it is a way to unify both the physical formulation of physical formulation of system as done through the differential equations in cybernetics and also the probabilistic formulation of the systems as done in Bayesian mechanics.
3864290	3865038	434	B	0.99992	Awesome.
3865204	3866942	435	B	0.75819	Just two quick notes on this.
3866996	3869250	436	B	1	First, the growth and deak construction.
3869670	3891466	437	B	0.49176	Shauna Dobson spoke about this in the Math Art Guest Stream in the context of the evolution of art and other areas in math and philosophy over the last hundred years with this progressive swarmification sheafification of self.
3891568	3893420	438	B	0.99995	So that's really cool to see.
3894990	3898140	439	B	1	And then we expect the connection to be made.
3899070	3907822	440	B	1	What we expect is what we prefer, and then what we expect prefer is shaping our action selection to realize it.
3907956	3925650	441	B	0.99997	So again, once we, as mentioned earlier, understand that systems act in order to make their expectations realized, we see that these kinds of expressions are more than just the expression of a belief, they're also in some ways an action imperative.
3927290	3928710	442	B	0.96838	Dean, any thoughts?
3929370	3947980	443	C	1	I could go for days on this section, of course, but I will say this who knew there was so much to be loaded up between the difference of a verb tense right structure and structured added D and all of a sudden we're discretized between process and product.
3948350	3954158	444	C	0.99107	I'll just start there and wait for Toby to come on because I could literally have a field day.
3954244	3962240	445	C	0.55691	I'm at the circus, the carnival and every single theme park in the world when it comes to this stuff.
3964310	3965506	446	B	0.52925	It's awesome.
3965608	3976090	447	B	0.5845	All right, now we get to seven one three compositional, cognitive, cartography sailing, the three C's.
3976270	3979640	448	B	0.82869	Ali, what is this section about?
3983450	4000330	449	A	1	Okay, so this is mainly addresses the success of representation and I mean doing a kind of a comparison between successive representation and other cognitive map theories.
4001410	4020530	450	A	0.99986	In other words, the topus theoretic developments sketched so far may provide a suitable setting in which to understand the neural basis for navigation and help explain how, ostensibly spatial navigation processes and circuits are invariably involved in more abstract problem solving.
4021110	4033060	451	A	0.15824	Atopos is not only a richly structured category of spaces or spatial types, but it can also be understood as a category as a categorified space itself.
4034390	4049878	452	A	0.9998	But an important notion here is that under the free energy principle, there's a close relationship between beliefs about the geometry of an environment and beliefs about expected future trajectories in that environment.
4050054	4064658	453	A	0.99991	So this is basically the idea behind successor representation of the cognitive map, which says roughly that the brain's representation of where it is is equivalently a representation of where it soon expects to be.
4064824	4079270	454	A	0.99963	So under the free energy principle, and similarly, under the successor representation, the expected dynamics is a geodesic flow, which is determined by beliefs about the spatial geometry.
4080170	4085298	455	A	0.99999	But crucially, these beliefs are not a static.
4085474	4090362	456	A	0.549	They depend on what the agent believes will happen.
4090496	4096742	457	A	0.99	And this has been suggested as an explanation for the predictive nature of the cognitive map.
4096806	4124290	458	A	1	In other words, if we don't take into consideration the uncertainty behind the information available to the agent, then we wouldn't get to formalize the behavior in a truly predictive way, because obviously there isn't any uncertainty to predict about and then compare the prediction with the actual data.
4124440	4134850	459	A	1	The cognitive map has its central locus in the hippocampus, which we may therefore understand as representing the base space over which the big topus is sliced.
4134930	4147830	460	A	0.84	And since changes of plan seem therefore to induce changes of base, we might see the functional connectivity of the brain as witnessing this mathematical structure.
4147990	4162382	461	A	1	And this particular claim, I believe, is maps perhaps perfectly onto Boujaki's theory of brain from inside out.
4162516	4194940	462	A	0.71349	So Boujaki provides a kind of theory that sets the hippocampus as the agential center of all the cognitive tests that needs to be reconstructed from inside out, as opposed to just processing the coming data in a kind of purely computational unidirectional way.
4198000	4207490	463	B	0.99998	We talked a lot about, and certainly will in the coming weeks, about what is witnessing, how is witness related to observation, but we'll come back to that.
4208580	4226304	464	B	1	Okay, continuing on, on the compositional cognitive cartography, there's some discussion about the internal universe of the topos, not just the Topos institute, but the concept and the way that the representations of the cognitive map are inherently context dependent.
4226432	4235850	465	B	0.99413	Therefore, it fits naturally within the subjectivist metaphysics implied by the free energy framework, a topic that I know Ali is extremely interested in.
4236620	4240510	466	B	1	And Dean Ali, any other comments on this?
4240880	4241820	467	B	0.7324	Slice?
4244720	4249020	468	B	0.99997	Maybe we can start calling them a slice or a bundle instead of a slide.
4250080	4256530	469	C	0.76764	Well, if we do go the slice route, one thing I would just pause for a second.
4257700	4272784	470	C	0.87	I think for most people, in context, geometry or geometric stability is usually the association, whereas geodesic flow, which was mentioned in the last slide is a lot more dynamic.
4272832	4287924	471	C	1	And I think that if we're going to talk about a composition like the flow of the piece of music that's now playing out, we have to think of this as both framed and filtered.
4288052	4311212	472	C	1	And so these sheaves allow for that sense of distribution, that movement part, I think, metaphorically of exploitation and exploration now being the two passengers in the HOV Lane and HOV Lanes in North America at least, are designated by a diamond.
4311276	4330010	473	C	0.99995	So you can see how the geometry and the geodesic again can all be put together, and you're starting to build a picture in these different models and maps that you may be constructing great.
4330780	4341870	474	B	0.93	7.2 societies of Systems I'll just say that a collection of purely passive agents is no society at all.
4342240	4346264	475	B	0.99997	What would it even be, Ali?
4346312	4352220	476	B	0.99784	Want to add anything more on the forwards and backwards, perhaps, and the compositional structure?
4354500	4374384	477	A	0.99947	Well, first of all, I wanted to just point that the very first sentence here, a collection of purely passive agents is no society also applies to one of my favorite metaphysical theories out there, namely the assemblage theory.
4374432	4379896	478	A	0.99997	So we can say that a collection of purely passive agents is no assemblage as well.
4380078	4387400	479	A	0.99999	But in any case, the doctrines of approximate inference introduced in this thesis are inherently perceptual.
4388700	4417164	480	A	0.65708	But the forward channel of a statistical gain points towards the environment predicting the expected incoming sense data, whereas the backwards channel points from the environment into the agent, terminating in the agent's most causally abstract beliefs one way in which we can incorporate action and thereby shape the framework of this thesis into a framework for active inference.
4417292	4426292	481	A	1	The forwards channel should predict not only sense data incoming from the environment, but also the actions to be taken by the agent.
4426426	4453996	482	A	0.99136	So up until now in the dissertation, he has provided in quite elaborate detail how this kind of formulation of the bi directional channels can be used to reframe the perceptual side of active inference.
4454108	4462384	483	A	0.8066	But as I mentioned earlier, he doesn't go so far as to integrate the action into this framework as well.
4462502	4479560	484	A	0.99999	But of course, here is a potential way forward which we can deploy the same forward channel as being the actions to be taken by the environment because of the same directionality it possesses.
4479980	4493740	485	A	1	We therefore expect the compositional theory of active inference to have forwards channel rather so that an agent's sensorium depends on the configuration or quote unquote action that it has chosen.
4494320	4527444	486	A	1	And another very, in my opinion, significant point here is the substitution of the notion of markup blankets throughout the whole dissertation with the notion of polynomial fontors, because, as have been discussed in the previous chapters as well, Markov blanket doesn't provide a rigorous enough concept to be applied quite at least directly in category theory.
4527492	4543050	487	A	0.84389	So polynomial functions substitute the well known notion of markup blanket as used in active inference literature to characterize basically the same thing or the interaction boundaries of adaptive agents.
4544060	4546088	488	B	0.51	Yes, so many great pieces here.
4546174	4559840	489	B	0.9737	Markup blanket used in the informal active inference literature, like everything we've been studying for the last few years, all of that casual light, airy, breezy we had fun.
4559990	4562370	490	B	1	Now it's time to formalize that.
4563780	4569590	491	B	1	And there's so much more we can say about backwards and forwards, but we'll just carry on.
4571720	4587092	492	B	0.82	7.21 active Inference there are some mentions about the resemblance between active inference and economic games in terms of they're both having lenses into the area or the arena of interaction.
4587236	4593432	493	B	1	And this line of inquiry naturally leads onto the consideration of multi agent systems.
4593576	4596860	494	B	0.99716	Perhaps this can be investigated with poly algebras.
4597680	4601470	495	B	0.9	7.2.2 what is the type of a plan?
4602080	4611170	496	B	0.99915	Perception and action are thus in general, the two dual ways in which a system can minimize its free energy change your mind, change the world.
4611540	4629210	497	B	0.96655	Akin to the two degrees of freedom available in an autoencoder game discussed in the thesis a system that acts must necessarily be motivated towards some goal and in order to realize its goal, the system must enact a plan.
4629980	4632330	498	B	0.79668	Dean, pick it up from here.
4637100	4641828	499	C	0.99656	Well, I will just say this I'm not going to speak to the stuff on the slide necessarily.
4641924	4650424	500	C	1	At the very end of this section, Toby writes this prompts us to ask what is the form of this data and how can we incorporate it into the compositional framework?
4650472	4653330	501	C	0.99999	In other words, what is the type of a plan?
4654180	4658688	502	C	0.99418	These seem to us to be key questions for future work.
4658854	4666420	503	C	0.99991	This prompted me to go and then we wonder why teachers struggle sometimes to necessarily remember what it was like to be the learner.
4667240	4668852	504	C	0.99857	Because we can come up with a plan.
4668906	4669892	505	C	0.99916	Because we've done the learning.
4669946	4671830	506	C	0.99714	We're now the learned, right?
4672520	4682664	507	C	0.54	The learner now changes because of one tense present to past tense change.
4682862	4689284	508	C	0.66521	Or why the plan that we put before learners removes all the critical work for self organizing.
4689332	4692484	509	C	0.99998	This is the cost of being a teacher.
4692612	4705196	510	C	1	Because if we do the planning for somebody and I understand why we have to do it, because if they're walking into a space, we don't want them falling off jumping off cliffs necessarily and not having a soft landing.
4705308	4728410	511	C	1	However, we do need to talk a little bit about what is the type of a plan and what are the benefits and the costs of choosing to use that strategy going forward, especially if we're in the role of somebody who's supposed to be guiding, opening up worlds, horizons and all that other stuff.
4729820	4730664	512	B	0.99519	Thank you.
4730782	4733400	513	B	0.43288	Ollie, any other comments on this section?
4735900	4737130	514	A	0.99825	Not at the moment.
4738300	4751828	515	B	1	One piece to me is it seems unnecessarily crude to hide all of this data, which is described as a lot of data, inside of a single undifferentiated choice of prior distributions.
4752024	4764640	516	B	0.8951	So that's very interesting in light of, again, the statistical, numerical, quantitative way that we've approached policy selection as inference planning as inference action and inference.
4765000	4768500	517	B	0.99999	What does it mean to differentiate this choice?
4770200	4774640	518	B	1	Okay, reinforcement learning, open games and ecosystems.
4774720	4777270	519	B	0.72968	Ali, any summary here?
4780380	4799320	520	A	0.96	Okay, so as also indicated in the first sentence, there is a close relationship between active inference theory, markup decision problems and reinforcement learning as explored numerous times before in many papers.
4799480	4817712	521	A	0.99621	But the standard algorithm for gaining an optimality for policy selection is usually called backward induction in reinforcement learning, or Akas dynamic programming.
4817856	4838440	522	A	0.85596	So namely, backward induction is structured according to a similar bi directional pattern, or the optic pattern to that of both Bayesian inference and reverse differentiation, and that MDPs themselves fit into the associated general framework of open games.
4838780	4852896	523	A	0.99996	So in the informal active inference approach to MDPs, the system in question counterfactually evaluates policies using a backward induction like process, accumulating free energies in order to score them.
4853078	4868390	524	A	0.95	Now, in this process, it is this process that results in the prior that we're all familiar with in active inference context, which is then updated by the agents inference process.
4868760	4902956	525	A	0.9997	But future work will need to untangle this not of interrelated bi directional process, in other words, how we can explicitly determine in what way those kinds of processes, although being quite in a quite different opposite directionality, can be unified into a unified framework.
4903068	4919300	526	A	0.99979	So we hope that having done so, we will show how the whole picture emerges and how it relates to the developing geometric or diegetic framework in categorical cybernetics, possibly involving the further development of our notion of cilia.
4922710	4923460	527	B	0.99877	Great.
4926230	4930242	528	B	0.94128	Continuing on with reinforcement learning, open games, and ecosystems.
4930386	4950380	529	B	0.99997	Since the free energy principle underlying active inference asserts a certain informal universality, we might also hope that the satisfactory development of compositional active inference might exhibit a universal property that any other doctrine of cybernetic systems factors uniquely through it.
4952270	4958240	530	B	0.67398	There's some discussion of multiagent systems and their implied global search.
4959650	4969780	531	B	0.77847	Casting this account into the emerging framework of compositional active inference will point towards a bridge to multiagent reinforcement learning.
4970150	4981960	532	B	1	The resulting general account of multiagent intelligence will encompass both reinforcement learning and active inference, allowing us to understand their relative strengths and difference.
4982730	4993950	533	B	0.99999	We hope that one distal outcome of the work will be a new and beneficial understanding of corporate activity, sometimes called organizational cybernetics or metagovernance.
4994130	5004490	534	B	0.99625	We should expect any framework resulting from this work to capture existing models of collective active inference, such as recent work on spin glasses or ant colonies.
5005090	5006414	535	B	0.99991	Any other thoughts on this?
5006452	5028258	536	C	0.82	Yes, Dean, I know that this is my biases literally on the surface, but I believe that the idea of open games and opened P-E-N-E-D ecosystems is a future path that a lot of formalized and structured learning is going to take.
5028424	5032166	537	C	0.99973	It's the work that I did essentially for ten years.
5032268	5042506	538	C	0.92	And so I think that everything that you're seeing here may become a new model that can be optioned into in terms of how you would.
5042528	5044010	539	C	0.90678	Want to structure your learning.
5044160	5047820	540	C	0.74605	So I think this is really important stuff.
5048510	5053660	541	B	0.99963	How you'd like to structure your learning and how you'd like to learn structure exactly.
5055250	5056350	542	B	0.97	7.3.
5056420	5066158	543	B	1	The mathematics of Life we move on to consider the relationships between compositional active inference and the contemporary mathematics of life.
5066324	5075714	544	B	0.99998	We hope that compositional active inference may supply part of the story of a modern theory of autopoiesis the ability for life to recreate itself.
5075912	5081174	545	B	0.86682	So just some brief notes on topics that are near and dear to us as we get close to the end.
5081372	5082838	546	B	0.98	7.3.1.
5082924	5085586	547	B	0.65544	Bayesian mechanics and the free energy principle.
5085778	5097526	548	B	0.96275	Recently it has been suggested in various venues citation 53 and 54 Karl Friston 2019 a free Energy Principle for a Particular Physics and fort.

5110930	5117738	550	B	0.74914	Bayesian mechanics promises to build upon the nascent understanding of random dynamics via inference.
5117914	5130630	551	B	0.86	245, 245 dalton's activity Bell towards a Geometry and Analysis for Bayesian Mechanics and Ramstead et al.
5130700	5133666	552	B	0.92284	On Bayesian mechanics, a physics of and by beliefs.
5133778	5140658	553	B	0.99973	Also check out Livestream number 49 to supply a new theory of mechanics for statistical systems.
5140754	5152970	554	B	1	The present formulation of Bayesian mechanics is constructed using mathematical tools from physics, but not yet the kinds of compositional tools promoted in this thesis.
5153310	5169594	555	B	1	We expect that developments along the lines sketched here will unify the ongoing developments of Bayesian mechanics with the new synthetic understanding of mathematical physics by casting all dynamics as abstract inference.
5169722	5181880	556	B	1	We should also expect this line of inquiry to begin to quantify the persistence of things and imbue much of physics within elon vital with a vital energy.
5182570	5184120	557	B	0.99988	Any thoughts on this?
5186890	5198522	558	C	0.99	Okay, well, I was just going to say I think that section you've already talked about the importance of adjunction, and this section literally makes that very clear.
5198576	5215310	559	C	1	I think that the relation and the translation are kind of the on and through of this part of where the Bayesian mechanics and the free energy principle help us understand that there is a statistical game that's also strategic.
5216790	5218466	560	C	0.86838	Again, I'll be interested to talk to.
5218488	5230690	561	B	0.98925	Toby about that great carrying on with mathematics life seven, three, two biosemiotics Ali, want to give any summary or thoughts on biosimiotics?
5233430	5233890	562	A	0.78893	Sure.
5233960	5265018	563	A	0.99913	So the emerging biosymiotic reconceptualization of life explicitly acknowledges the importance and universality of communication in context, proposing that in any such situation, the interpreting system necessarily has an internal representation of the external world, so to speak, its own belt, which is updated by interpreting incoming signals.
5265194	5272962	564	A	0.99999	We can in principle reconstruct the external world by understanding it as that which a collection of systems agrees about.
5273096	5282850	565	A	0.99021	Perhaps then, the shared universe, as determined topus theoretically of a fusion of active inference agents is a good model of this semi sphere.
5283290	5304178	566	A	0.89	It seems therefore, that mathematics resulting from our work on internal universes and their interactions and more broadly, many of the formal ingredients of compositional active inference is well aligned with the informal structures of biosymiotics, and so it may be desirable to reexpress biosymiotics accordingly.
5304294	5321090	567	A	0.67204	In doing so, perhaps the mathematics of a modern Bayesian subjectivist metaphysics will be found, for instance, by expressing communication and its phenomenology as a geometric morphism, a generalized base change between agents internal universes.
5321590	5333458	568	A	1	And it might be worth mentioning here the work of people like Terrence Deacon and also Karen Broad's agential Realism.
5333634	5345174	569	A	0.97418	Because in Terrence Deacon's work, and particularly in his book called Incomplete Nature, he provides a kind of nested hierarchy.
5345222	5376558	570	A	0.78	Of how various kinds of informations as provided to biological organisms are structured in a nested, hierarchical way that would allow the agent to distinguish the purely informational data as opposed to the semantic data that is, in the innermost level of the nested hierarchy.
5376734	5396630	571	A	1	And also, Karen broad's agential realism provides this notion of intra action, which allow the agent or the system of interest to co constitute itself via the very interaction with the environment.
5396710	5411550	572	A	0.99986	So it's not just pure interaction between the system and its environment, but rather both the agent and the environment co constitutes themselves through the intra action.
5412130	5419780	573	A	0.99988	So it might be worth exploring some of these ideas with Toby as well.
5421430	5423460	574	B	0.87883	Dean, anything to add on this one?
5424390	5426930	575	C	0.98983	No, I think Ali summed it up perfectly.
5427270	5427810	576	B	0.97429	All right.
5427880	5436680	577	B	0.99	And the final section Fundamental Theory future work connected to this thesis need not only be an application.
5437690	5441750	578	B	1	A number of purely theoretical questions raise themselves too.
5441900	5451846	579	B	0.99998	So for people who we could already hear in the live chat in the YouTube comments complaining that this was too practical, too application oriented, don't worry.
5451958	5467426	580	B	0.73051	There's also some theoretical questions that raise themselves so first, geometric methods for structured belief updating the mathematics of belief is in large part about replacing definite points with Fuzzier distributions over them.
5467528	5478638	581	B	1	In fact, this PDF copy error with a fuzzy interpretive system allows the word to be read by a human independent type theory.
5478734	5480740	582	B	0.99999	We replace points with terms.
5481270	5483606	583	B	0.50797	Non dependent terms are exactly points.
5483788	5488280	584	B	0.99994	So a type theory with belief should somehow encompass fuzzy terms.
5489050	5495180	585	B	0.99997	We might well want to express beliefs about things whose identity we are not quite sure.
5495790	5497690	586	B	0.74	Seven four two dynamics.
5498030	5505982	587	B	0.84521	Chapter five supplies the beginnings of a compositional coalgebraic theory for open, stochastic and random dynamical systems in general time.
5506116	5512698	588	B	0.91	And we hope that this theory could provide a home for a modern account of nonequilibrium systems.
5512874	5514800	589	B	0.99846	Home, home on the state space.
5515730	5518290	590	B	0.94	And seven four three computation.
5518710	5525230	591	B	0.76	A new understanding of computation may follow the semiotic understanding of information processing that we propose above.
5525390	5530310	592	B	0.89641	Perhaps we could say more precisely that computation is the dynamics of semiosis.
5531210	5552982	593	B	1	The time is right for such a reconceptualization, as human made systems increasingly move away from von Neumann architectures towards more biosimilar ones such as Mem risters optical processors, Neuromorphic technology, graph processors, or even many core and mesh based evolutions of classical processors.
5553126	5558202	594	B	0.9998	So some absolutely fantastic theoretical avenues to pursue.
5558346	5561594	595	B	0.99982	Any of you want to comment on some of these avenues?
5561722	5562800	596	B	0.99874	Dean, please.
5563490	5570580	597	C	0.99988	In the dynamics section, there's a really interesting, again, more confirmation bias in my world.
5571270	5579860	598	C	0.70236	He says here, chapter five has supplied the beginnings of the composition of Coalgebraic theory for open, stochastic and random dynamical systems in general time.
5580470	5581702	599	C	0.59764	Me being a time guy.
5581756	5582662	600	C	0.77548	That's cool.
5582796	5593254	601	C	1	And we hope that this theory could provide a home for a modern account of non equilibrium systems with category polynomial functions, applying a satisfactory account of these systems.
5593302	5595946	602	C	1	And then I'm going to slow down because this is the part that I really like.
5596048	5616490	603	C	0.63986	Interfaces in brackets, I e, the boundaries across which information flows along and in the word along, there's the word on in the middle, which they compose and through which they interact, and me being an on and through being the same thing.
5616660	5621780	604	C	0.99412	This was fantastic confirmation of that in a dynamic sense.
5623350	5624610	605	B	0.55	And Ali.
5629210	5629670	606	A	1	Yes.
5629740	5664506	607	A	0.94	And also, again, I think some of the work done by Bob Coke and his colleagues regarding the Bayesian quantum inference and especially proposing a kind of string diagrams in the sense of using category theory to explore the whole theory of the quantum Bayesian inference.
5664698	5676766	608	A	1	I believe it maps unto this sense of dynamics as provided by Toby in the final pages of his dissertation.
5676958	5683430	609	A	0.99155	In the case that in the basing quantum inference, it is also a question.
5683500	5689960	610	A	1	Of how to provide the exact time evolution of each state or each agent.
5690490	5701178	611	A	0.99999	Not strictly in a linear sense, but both in linear and sorry in the predictive and also the retroactive sense.
5701344	5713198	612	A	0.81287	In other words, by taking into account the whole arrow of time, not just a particular instant or particular moment of it.
5713284	5745530	613	A	0.96378	So in the sense, I think the discussion of non equilibrium systems, which is still an underexplored area of physics, by using category theory, can help to unify or at least make connections between these kinds of predictive models as used in classical physics and also some of the retroactive models as recently proposed in quantum Bayesian theory.
5747070	5747820	614	B	0.99938	Great.
5748590	5760320	615	B	1	And so we couldn't escape without showing at least a little bit of a hint of what realistically much of the dissertation looks like.
5760770	5764014	616	B	0.89933	So next time we're going to jump into the thick of it.
5764132	5771710	617	B	0.66286	These kinds of equations and diagrams are what you're going to find when you unpack the dissertation.
5771870	5784710	618	B	0.99	And of course, there's so much to add and we did so much work on just scratching the surface of what these diagrams are and how they actually convey formality in category theory.
5785210	5791722	619	B	1	And it's going to be great to work and talk together on them.
5791776	5799878	620	B	1	And with Toby, where does that leave us, fellows?
5799974	5804970	621	B	0.90873	Dean with the pre penultimate thought and then Ollie?
5808290	5814202	622	C	0.99606	Well, I think that there's going to be a big shift from today's Livestream.
5814266	5814880	623	A	0.99998	Which.
5818390	5825650	624	C	0.83727	Tries to be gentle on us, but also anybody who's really curious as to where this goes next.
5825720	5843714	625	C	1	I think it's going to be a lot more sophisticated and there's going to be a little bit more work to do, but I think at least we've started down a path that hopefully we've piqued your curiosity.
5843842	5846860	626	C	0.9995	As the last question says, what are you still curious about?
5847390	5858080	627	C	0.89	I think there's a lot coming up that should be pretty good for those that want to really dig now into the real formalisms and the real structure of this.
5859250	5860122	628	B	0.99996	Thank you, Dean.
5860186	5860990	629	B	0.94131	Ali?
5865090	5892700	630	A	0.73994	Well, at the end of our six month joyful ride through this dissertation, I believe, at least from a personal point of view, I truly learned a lot and it piqued my interest in lots of domains and areas which I didn't know I have interest in them before.
5893070	5935574	631	A	0.487	So I think it's really a good mark of an influential work, be it dissertation or a book or paper or any other kinds of academic publication to peak people's mind, to explore in even some unexplored areas and try to connect the dots in particular in the category theory sense, in a very rigorous, well typed and even insightful ways.
5935692	5945930	632	A	1	And maybe some exciting developments and results can emerge from these kinds of dot connections.
5948920	5952192	633	B	0.9999	Thank you both for this excellent stream.
5952256	5976680	634	B	0.95	I have so much gratitude for the whole category theory team, not just the sheaves around Toby that enable and scaffold this work, but also the way that we were able to collaborate over the last months and in the bigger picture, maybe the end of a chapter.
5976760	5983212	635	B	0.99932	We just finished chapter one or chapter zero, and that's really what the dot zero is.
5983266	5985260	636	B	0.99967	So we were in the dot.
5986320	5990168	637	B	0.91	Now we are bringing the dot zero to a closure.
5990344	6000820	638	B	0.99999	Soon we're going to jump into the dot one and the dot two with Toby and even that in some other nested scale is AOO or a dot zero.
6000970	6004548	639	B	0.99937	So thank you again, Ali and Dean et al.
6004714	6005910	640	B	0.78532	Till next time.
6008440	6009430	641	C	0.99657	Thank you.
