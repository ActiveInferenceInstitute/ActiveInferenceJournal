the 4th of 22 be with you

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,200
and we're here in

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,960
flab live stream number 43.1

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,800
blue i don't know how you do it with

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,800
always joining during the theme song

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,520
welcome to the actin flab

14
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,039
we're a participatory online lab that is

15
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,879
communicating learning and practicing

16
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,440
applied active inference you can find us

17
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,438
at links on this slide

18
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,520
this is recorded in an archived live

19
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,880
stream so please provide us with

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,360
feedback so we can improve our work

21
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,200
all backgrounds and perspectives are

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,040
welcome and we'll be following video

23
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,320
etiquette for live streams

24
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,560
check out activeinference.org

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,479
if you want to learn more about what's

26
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,960
happening in the lab and get involved

27
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,119
and participate in the live streams or

28
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,159
any other

29
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,799
activities

30
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,759
all right well we're here in

31
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,720
live stream number 43.1

32
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,119
and are continuing the discussion of the

33
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,439
paper predictive coding a theoretical

34
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,079
and experimental review by baron millage

35
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,640
neil seth and christopher buckley

36
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,960
in 43.0

37
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,399
with maria

38
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,040
we went over some of the background and

39
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,000
context and did like a first pass

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,479
on various aspects of the paper but by

41
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,799
no means exhausted it because it's a

42
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,320
long and

43
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,040
very intricate paper and also it touches

44
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,600
on a ton of other areas of more general

45
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,919
interest so there's a lot to discuss

46
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,878
and

47
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,319
in the 43.1 today we'll see where things

48
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,200
go

49
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,280
if you're watching live it would be

50
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,280
awesome to have any questions in the

51
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,640
live chat

52
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,520
otherwise we will just start with some

53
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,760
introductions and pick up with whatever

54
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,680
people are finding salient and exciting

55
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,640
so we'll just start by saying hello and

56
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,080
going from there

57
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,160
i'm daniel and i'm a researcher in

58
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,160
california and thanks a lot blue for

59
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,560
joining

60
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,280
i'm blue i'm a researcher in new mexico

61
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,640
and yeah i'm excited to be here today

62
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,120
this paper was um

63
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,840
really intricate and detailed and

64
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,959
provided a lot of background um that i

65
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,040
don't have because you know there are so

66
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,440
many active papers that i want to read

67
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,519
but i don't have time to get to them all

68
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,239
um because i'm i like to read things

69
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,640
very thoroughly and slowly and carefully

70
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,800
and look up the things that i don't know

71
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,879
and the back references

72
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,800
travel down the scientific rabbit hole

73
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,480
so to speak

74
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,720
so yeah this was a good paper that kind

75
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,200
of helped me you know

76
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,680
shirk all those active responsibilities

77
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,200
that i have and

78
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,840
um came out with more like questions

79
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,360
than than

80
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,560
answers

81
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,360
which

82
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,040
is always a good sign of a good paper

83
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,360
awesome well how about going into the

84
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,480
paper

85
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,560
what questions did you have and maybe

86
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,720
we'll get to how our questions evolved

87
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,040
but what were you expecting

88
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,799
to find in the paper and what questions

89
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,840
were motivating you to seek it

90
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,120
so i i always have had a hard time like

91
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,360
what is the difference between

92
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,879
predictive coding

93
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,319
variational base and active right and

94
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,239
and like i was really hoping that the

95
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,480
paper would kind of lay that out for me

96
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,680
and like no

97
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,239
so like i mean i kind of got a good

98
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,439
historical overview of um how they all

99
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,160
are interlocking and overlapping

100
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,279
which i didn't know before um because

101
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,720
you know all these things none of them

102
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,919
are simple

103
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,000
and there are intricate details in all

104
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,880
of them like you know that i don't know

105
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,360
all the details ins and outs but i think

106
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,040
that this gave a very good like

107
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,280
historical overview of how these things

108
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,880
kind of layer into a nice little

109
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,280
sandwich

110
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,400
great

111
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,840
definitely a good

112
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,360
starting place let's also add

113
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,960
bayesian brain

114
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,720
there to the mix

115
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,919
and

116
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,880
start to look at maybe some similarities

117
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,720
too because they're not exactly like

118
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,639
addressing the same

119
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,080
area and they're compatible often more

120
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,320
compatible than not so getting at what

121
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,759
distinguishes them

122
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,600
is very important

123
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,360
and

124
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,160
like one way that that happened and

125
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,199
it came up in the dot zero was so much

126
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,160
of the paper was dealing with

127
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,919
inference on

128
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,479
the relationship between observations

129
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,600
and unobserved latent states so think

130
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,680
like trying to infer the temperature of

131
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,560
the room given the thermometer readings

132
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,560
and that was so much of the paper and

133
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,160
then

134
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,600
action comes into the picture

135
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,680
in

136
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,080
uh section four five

137
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,280
it's like

138
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,800
predictive coding

139
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,639
the authors write can also be extended

140
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,720
to include action allowing for

141
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,960
predictive coding agents to undertake

142
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,440
adaptive actions without any major

143
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,080
change to their fundamental algorithms

144
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,720
but that's 50 equations deep and so it's

145
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,600
very interesting to see like if those 50

146
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,919
equations are kind of like the stem i

147
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,199
know that the equations are not

148
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,120
sequential and building on each other in

149
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,240
in all of these cases but then

150
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,680
action gets tucked into a bigger picture

151
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,400
very seamlessly and i think that speaks

152
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,680
to the the relevance of distinguishing

153
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,039
how they're similar

154
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,960
and different and

155
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,120
why it matters i guess so how should we

156
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,520
even begin to look at that

157
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,840
so even action actually came up earlier

158
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,199
in the paper before 4.5 so action came

159
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,880
up in um

160
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,759
section 2.3 with dynamical predictive

161
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,720
coding

162
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,360
and generalized coordinates and and this

163
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,280
i thought was a really good

164
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,160
um

165
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,720
example like like i was craving

166
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,520
and still i'm craving like a really

167
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,319
simple example like like it's one thing

168
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,919
you know we talk about the equations we

169
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,520
go through all the letters we compare

170
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,520
this and that but it would be really

171
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,319
great to see a super simple example

172
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,599
works through like from start to finish

173
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,360
using all of these

174
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,840
observable states latent states

175
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,400
complexity accuracy like

176
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,479
it would be really great to see that at

177
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,280
some

178
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,039
point um

179
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,520
and uh if you're listening to this live

180
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,840
stream and want to come on and give like

181
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,479
a guest tutorial on like how do we

182
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,520
actually work these equations into some

183
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,280
very simple problem that we can solve in

184
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,880
real life like i would be more than

185
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,160
happy to

186
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,759
facilitate that presentation um yeah

187
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,960
because i can't even like

188
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,120
i can't jump from like all these

189
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,400
equations into like how does that apply

190
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,599
um but even in in 2.3 this was kind of a

191
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,919
good um

192
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,000
a good

193
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,960
a goodish example a a real life example

194
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,639
about like inferring

195
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,080
you know the velocity and the

196
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,080
acceleration and the jerk um just given

197
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,039
the the observed coordinates um so that

198
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,280
was kind of and it talks here about also

199
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,560
free action

200
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,759
which um

201
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,840
i've not heard before

202
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,160
so instead of minimizing the variational

203
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,520
free energy

204
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,280
it says we must instead minimize the

205
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,840
free action which is f bar

206
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,720
um

207
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,599
and i've not seen or heard it referred

208
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,840
to in that way but it's modeling like

209
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,160
time series of observations

210
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,360
um so like you know you know the

211
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,440
coordinates at time one time two time

212
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,679
three of a of a swinging pendulum for

213
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,679
example um

214
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,039
if you know those coordinates then you

215
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,120
can kind of guess you know how fast is

216
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,120
the object moving and you can infer

217
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,440
these other these other variables so i

218
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,880
haven't seen that free action but it did

219
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,399
even come up before four or five

220
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,920
yes

221
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,120
and it speaks to that

222
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,080
expected free energy efe

223
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,040
which is

224
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,360
what do you expect the free energy to be

225
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,040
and then there's the free energy of the

226
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,160
expected future which one of the authors

227
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,839
has worked on which is kind of a

228
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,160
slightly different variant and then

229
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,000
here's another way

230
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,399
to look at the free energy of some

231
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,480
future time steps

232
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,320
and and it speaks to that difference

233
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,560
between the variational free energy

234
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,000
which is like what you're able to

235
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,800
calculate right now with the information

236
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,360
at hand and looking backwards

237
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,839
and so the more perceptual aspects of

238
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,640
inference can be calculated using the

239
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,600
variational free energy approach

240
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,399
but then any time the future is coming

241
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,519
into play

242
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,680
there's uncertainty about the

243
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,040
observations

244
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,800
as well as even uncertainty about what

245
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,880
actions one will take let alone the

246
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,560
consequences of the actions that one

247
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,120
will take in the future so

248
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,800
we do need a different way to calculate

249
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,640
it and then as you're kind of getting at

250
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,399
this is a different way than we've seen

251
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,440
it before

252
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,080
with a minimization of free

253
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,279
action

254
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,680
but let's return to

255
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,279
this page

256
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,720
and think about

257
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,040
how we can

258
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,519
distinguish with like a venn diagram or

259
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,000
something that helps us understand how

260
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
these core ideas are linked

261
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,120
one couple

262
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,200
that we can highlight is predictive

263
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,519
coding and predictive processing do you

264
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,040
have any thoughts or questions on that

265
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,320
yeah so maybe not a

266
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,279
venn diagram but like maybe we should

267
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,560
build

268
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,800
perhaps like a pyramid or like a

269
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,399
multi-level building because i think um

270
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,320
you know based on the

271
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,279
the

272
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,920
um what i read in the paper i think

273
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,800
really predictive coding

274
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,640
kind of starts it all off and also um

275
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,600
it makes sense to make a layer cake like

276
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,519
being that these all kind of start off

277
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,399
with the layers of um

278
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,720
cortical processing that happen quite

279
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,760
literally in the brain so i i think um

280
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,000
making a layer cake maybe makes the most

281
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,600
sense

282
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,760
okay so we're in the kitchen

283
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,079
we're in um the active restaurant

284
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,040
kitchen

285
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,399
and

286
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,240
what are we gonna

287
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,480
build in or what is the bottom of this

288
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,720
layer cake

289
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,279
so i think the bottom at least um

290
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,120
so so there might be two layers on the

291
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,880
bottom um

292
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,640
one from

293
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,920
helmholtz

294
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,760
so we can start with like the the

295
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,399
perception as unconscious inference view

296
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,839
of helmholtz

297
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,440
um and then predictive coding um as

298
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,040
described by rao and ballard

299
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,560
um in their

300
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,200
description of the visual system in the

301
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,279
visual cortex

302
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,519
okay and

303
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,399
again kind of calling back to the

304
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,360
dot zero

305
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,480
the

306
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,920
uh two qualitative philosophical ideas

307
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,480
that the authors invoke and that maria

308
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,000
helped us unpack

309
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,279
were helmholtz's notion of perception as

310
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,600
unconscious inference

311
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,040
and kant's

312
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,160
const notion that a priori or beforehand

313
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,720
structure like prior structure is needed

314
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,959
to make sense of sensory data

315
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,360
so we're gonna have one

316
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,399
um

317
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,800
bottom layer of the cake

318
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,120
with uh helmholtz

319
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,079
and then also with uh the kantian so

320
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,839
this is going to be our qualitative

321
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,600
philosophical

322
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,399
layer of the cake these two notions

323
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,720
and then you mentioned another critical

324
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,760
work which was round ballard's 1999 work

325
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,800
building on a broader history of

326
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,120
applying predictive and anticipatory

327
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,680
approaches to different neural systems

328
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,279
and in the dot zero the two neural

329
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,639
systems that we looked at were first the

330
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,480
retina system

331
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,800
with a

332
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,120
srinivasan 1982 and this is looking at

333
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,800
retinal

334
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,600
physiology and like the

335
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,720
electrophysiology of photons hitting the

336
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,920
retina

337
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,839
and then another area where predictive

338
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,120
approaches

339
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,800
especially early on

340
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,040
were getting built out around and

341
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,000
towards

342
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,800
was the cortical

343
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,160
hierarchy

344
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,760
and the different layers in the

345
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,200
mammalian cortex so these two anatomical

346
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,480
exemplars

347
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,000
of some

348
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,040
micro

349
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,440
circuitry some histology

350
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,920
that is compatible with

351
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,920
a predictive approach okay so we have

352
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,320
these two

353
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,639
basal layers but we might even add more

354
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,480
basal layers but we have

355
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,560
biological systems

356
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,519
that are doing predictive things

357
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,360
and that includes the

358
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,800
retinal as well as the cortex

359
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,600
also of course if anyone has like

360
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,519
questions we'll get to it in the right

361
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,240
way so please ask any questions or

362
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,560
doing any comments so we have the retina

363
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,199
the cortex

364
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,920
as examples but there's others

365
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,800
okay and then if there's a third layer

366
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,600
that

367
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,120
we can add to the bottom i think it

368
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,839
would just be bayesian statistics

369
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,120
because so

370
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,279
i think it comes maybe before that also

371
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,600
or maybe like maybe now

372
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,800
um

373
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,079
maybe bayesian statistics is like a

374
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,320
a layer two but like i think before the

375
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,519
bayesian statistics um and even before

376
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,680
biological systems doing prediction

377
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,560
there's the information theory component

378
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,240
that i think is

379
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,480
important also

380
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,160
okay

381
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,360
so well we have um this is qualitative

382
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,279
and philosophical

383
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,639
then we have

384
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,079
biological

385
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,600
and actual

386
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,279
and then we have a formal

387
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,600
area and that'll be

388
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,959
information and base

389
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,720
information

390
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,639
yeah the information goes under the bays

391
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,360
i think just like um the helmholtz comes

392
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,399
under

393
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,839
the cont right um i i think

394
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,480
it's the really the relationship between

395
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,920
um information and probability

396
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,680
which we started to

397
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,440
explore in um or we explored a lot in

398
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,040
the uh

399
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,680
fep of generic quantum systems

400
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,160
live stream number 40 that was 40 i

401
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,199
think

402
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,920
so many streams ago

403
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,959
okay

404
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,720
this is

405
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,399
fun and i think we're we're going to

406
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,720
start building this

407
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,199
into a tasty structure so we have the

408
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,279
philosophical

409
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,000
coming in on the left and that's one

410
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,920
on-ramp that

411
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,199
just like

412
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,199
we had discussed earlier like this is

413
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,480
something that has been almost

414
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,639
imminently available

415
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,279
to thinkers for thousands of years these

416
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,600
are the kinds of qualitative claims that

417
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,519
anyone can experience whether by

418
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,680
thinking about the blind spot or about

419
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,320
how their sense making in response to

420
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,079
some stimuli this is just the idea that

421
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,480
the sensory observations

422
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,560
are first off not the direct contact

423
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,320
with the world like we're not seeing the

424
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,480
lightning strike event we're seeing

425
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,120
photons hit the retina and sound hit the

426
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,279
eardrum and so we're receiving sensory

427
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,040
input that's that kind of plato's cave

428
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,000
angle

429
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,560
and then kant and helmholtz elaborated

430
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,800
on that to include this idea of

431
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,959
unconscious inference that requires a

432
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,880
priority structure or like what we would

433
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,959
call like a bayesian prior

434
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,759
then we have this biological area

435
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,759
and these are just reflecting natural

436
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,720
systems that are exhibiting some kind of

437
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,439
behavior like we can think about the

438
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,079
1999 paper of round ballard themselves

439
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,559
about the functional interpretation of

440
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,199
extra classical receptive field effects

441
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,959
and we talked about that in the dot zero

442
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,280
like the classical effects are kind of

443
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,039
the simple normative ones like the joke

444
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,199
is it's classical because of the papers

445
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,440
in the order they were published but

446
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,520
that doesn't like make it

447
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,000
even true let alone the best model the

448
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,960
classical is just like it's like classic

449
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,720
rock you might like other genres but

450
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,280
then there's the classics or whatever

451
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,320
so

452
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,919
that's the biological systems that are

453
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,320
exhibiting certain kinds of outcomes

454
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,559
and then we have these two

455
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,799
formal or quantitative areas

456
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,640
and those are the bayesian statistics

457
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,799
and probability as well as information

458
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:01,679
theory

459
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,039
and they're

460
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,440
definitely linked as well but we'll just

461
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,600
leave them as kind of two

462
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,440
conjoined layers here

463
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,400
okay

464
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,360
now

465
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,479
where do we go from here

466
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,320
well isn't that the question

467
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,200
so maybe um

468
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,000
predictive coding and predictive

469
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,280
processing um and like really what's the

470
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,240
the

471
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,120
difference between these two i think

472
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,039
predictive coding came from neuroscience

473
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,799
so maybe that layers on top of the

474
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,039
biological

475
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,679
part the biological piece of the cake

476
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,080
and then predictive processing might go

477
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,280
on to the

478
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,960
quantitative

479
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,320
piece

480
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,440
awesome

481
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,000
yeah and it really is what maria

482
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,200
highlighted

483
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,960
and and drew out in the dot zero

484
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,960
which was

485
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,080
using a a quote from an andy clark

486
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,880
book and clark wrote that predictive

487
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,960
processing is not simply the use of the

488
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,720
data compression strategy known as

489
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,200
predictive coding so at least in this

490
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,400
take

491
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,400
predictive coding is like mp4 it's like

492
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,720
an encoding strategy which is also why

493
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,880
we connected it to frame differencing

494
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,760
and video encoding but predictive coding

495
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,000
is going to be something that's data

496
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,480
oriented and it's related to information

497
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,160
theory compression

498
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,919
information encapsulation

499
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,480
and then clark is writing predictive

500
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,280
processing is not simply that

501
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,240
and so

502
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,320
maria spoke to how another way to think

503
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,400
about the difference between predictive

504
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,880
coding and predictive processing is to

505
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,720
use coding for the formalisms and

506
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,160
implementations

507
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,000
and processing for the philosophical

508
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,640
understanding that prediction is the

509
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,120
basis of signal interpretation

510
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,520
as opposed to merely recognition or

511
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,080
descriptive models so if anyone has like

512
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,240
a thought on that then

513
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,159
you know put it in the live chat or come

514
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,880
get involved but let's work with that

515
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,880
delineation going forward so predictive

516
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,240
processing

517
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,039
is going to be um

518
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,080
somehow related to the formal or sorry

519
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,520
predictive coding

520
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,200
is going to be more close to the formal

521
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,400
whether it's

522
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,159
predictive coding in a biological

523
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,240
context or whether it's going to be in a

524
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,400
philosophical context or something it's

525
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,600
going to be more on the formal side

526
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,440
whereas predictive processing

527
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,360
is going to be

528
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,320
where

529
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,880
a little bit closer to the philosophical

530
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,440
yeah i think so and then maybe like

531
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,240
does the bayesian brain like make up the

532
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,960
the third part of our like predictive

533
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,039
coding layers over the bayesian

534
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,480
statistics

535
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,400
and predictive processing layers over

536
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,240
the philosophical then does the bayesian

537
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,400
brain somehow make the in-between

538
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,520
sandwich that goes over the biological

539
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,320
okay

540
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,159
okay so let's see

541
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,760
we have

542
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,080
predictive processing

543
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,240
as being a philosophical approach

544
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,559
and consideration

545
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,799
of these

546
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,720
philosophical

547
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,400
memes and themes

548
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,559
in the biological case

549
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,919
which were

550
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,679
certainly bound to then

551
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,840
we can have predictive coding

552
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,960
as kind of the formal way

553
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,520
that these predictive anticipatory

554
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,799
systems

555
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,880
are implementing predictive processing

556
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,080
and then

557
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,320
what is the bayesian brain seems pretty

558
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,799
fair to put it at like the intersection

559
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,240
between

560
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,520
bayesian

561
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,320
and brain but what is the bayesian brain

562
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,480
to you

563
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,720
so to me the the bayesian brain is kind

564
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,720
of um

565
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,240
you know i i'm trying to look back

566
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,720
through the paper to their uh

567
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,880
description but um

568
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,039
in my like recollection recollection of

569
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,720
the bayesian brain which was like

570
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,559
probably my first introduction to

571
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,480
bayesian statistics i was like oh this

572
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,640
is great um and it wasn't even the

573
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,360
bayesian brain it was like the janesian

574
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,799
interpretation

575
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,720
of the bayesian brain paper but like

576
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,000
that paper was like probably the my

577
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,799
like turn on to bayesian statistics and

578
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,360
and implementing this and um

579
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,720
so so in my mind the bayesian brain is

580
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,360
is just this idea that

581
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,720
the brain

582
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,480
uses bayesian

583
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,280
reasoning or bayesian updating to

584
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,000
process information and and go forward

585
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,720
so but that's probably a very simplified

586
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,039
interpretation

587
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,720
i think there's going to be one

588
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,840
more realist interpretation like the

589
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,240
brain is doing bayesian stuff

590
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,280
and then there's the more

591
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,440
instrumentalist interpretation

592
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,080
we can use bayesian statistics to model

593
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,360
what it is that the brain is doing so is

594
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,880
bayesian

595
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,440
the territory or the map of the brain

596
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,520
but we'll just leave it as an edge for

597
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,480
now

598
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,400
so i'll read a question

599
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,080
from dean and then i think we're going

600
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:24,960
to be

601
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,039
exploring a lot where action

602
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,600
and active inference comes into play so

603
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,720
blue

604
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,039
dean writes

605
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,280
what do you think of this

606
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,919
as coding you are doing something in

607
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,200
coding

608
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,960
as processing

609
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,640
you determine by comparing

610
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,880
processing and or not processing as

611
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,640
you're doing

612
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,760
so process entails processing types

613
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,120
what

614
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,480
i'm hearing there is encoding

615
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,600
doesn't require two arguments

616
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,919
it just takes one you take one file and

617
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,720
you zip it you've encoded that in a

618
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,679
way

619
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,120
so

620
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,720
predictive coding

621
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,600
can

622
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,840
encode and or implement some type of

623
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,080
informational algorithm without a

624
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,240
reference or a comparator

625
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,440
whereas

626
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,840
dean's saying as processing

627
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,279
you determine

628
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,640
not with this

629
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,159
single argument

630
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,520
um plug and chug but you determine by

631
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,039
comparing

632
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,120
as you're doing and so predictive

633
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,480
processing

634
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,960
it it does have that sort of

635
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,799
top down and bottom up as it's often

636
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,960
visually represented but processing is

637
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,159
entailing that full stack

638
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,919
and therefore the processing is

639
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,400
requiring something like a minimum of

640
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,880
two to have consideration if you're

641
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,200
processing

642
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,159
nuts

643
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,679
then you're sorting them into two

644
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,360
different kinds or you're removing

645
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,880
something from something else about

646
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,640
those like you're doing something that

647
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,799
has

648
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:07,360
compositionality

649
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,400
or

650
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,559
some type of multiplicity to it it's not

651
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,559
just something you can take

652
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,360
that one file and just zip it so that's

653
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,240
a great point dean i think i'll add two

654
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,159
little arrows um

655
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,480
here

656
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,120
yes okay yes blue let me share the

657
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,080
slides

658
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,120
thank you

659
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,679
um i'm left in the dark here

660
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,520
uh i definitely um

661
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,400
yeah agree with dean's point about the

662
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,440
um coding versus processing like

663
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,720
i can

664
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,799
write a whole lot of things right like i

665
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,799
can take a whole lot of notes and that's

666
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,880
coding that's like encoding the

667
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,520
information from our conversation this

668
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,840
live stream but like until i do

669
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,840
something with those notes like turn

670
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,960
them into

671
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,799
elements of a paper that i want to write

672
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,720
or or something like this like i have

673
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,600
not processed what i have encoded until

674
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,600
i take them forward

675
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,679
to a forward step so i think like there

676
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,720
is kind of this temporal implication

677
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,320
with processing versus coding

678
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,559
yeah also like the timeliness of

679
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,640
processing like you want to process the

680
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,039
food before it has

681
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,000
become

682
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,679
you know bad or something so okay we

683
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:20,480
have

684
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,880
predictive coding again these are just

685
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,919
tentative slide play if anyone thinks

686
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,840
differently they can join or write a

687
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,679
comment but

688
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,919
predictive coding might entail

689
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,919
something of a unique directionality

690
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,080
just like a dot zip and you say well

691
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,799
somebody will unzip it later but we can

692
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,159
encode it

693
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,000
without that part of the loop being

694
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,799
required and then we have this two

695
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,679
directional relationship with predictive

696
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,080
processing being like

697
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,240
top down and bottom up um

698
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,159
[Music]

699
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,640
okay what do you see now or i can bring

700
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,720
up something

701
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,080
um yeah

702
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,120
so i'm not really seeing anything so why

703
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,919
don't you bring up what what is on your

704
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,080
mind or what what you're thinking of

705
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,400
where is action

706
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,480
and then i think that'll start to walk

707
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,400
us towards where active inference is

708
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,320
so because of the the temporal nature of

709
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,640
processing i think action might start in

710
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,320
the processing

711
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,039
um

712
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,679
element like even in something like

713
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,000
mental action like people do like

714
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,520
thought correction or thought

715
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,880
remediation

716
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,000
um so like if you're uh

717
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,320
you know you have this prediction

718
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,159
and it like surfaces in your mind but

719
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,240
then like you correct the prediction or

720
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,600
like you um

721
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,960
you know you think you see a snake on

722
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,520
the floor and then you say oh that's a

723
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,120
snake but then like you look

724
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,640
let me see that snake like and then you

725
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,240
have to zoom in look at it closer and it

726
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,080
ends up being like a coiled up rope

727
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,679
right and so it's not really a snake but

728
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,559
like you direct your attention because

729
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,120
of some prediction and then can continue

730
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,520
to process that prediction so so

731
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,039
possibly action starts in the processing

732
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:07,350
um

733
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,039
[Music]

734
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,240
in the processing area

735
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,240
or maybe it's there in the middle well

736
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,480
i'm gonna start it in the middle we can

737
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,159
see where it goes because i think it's

738
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,159
going to have an important edge

739
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,679
to each of these three areas so

740
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,279
there's a few ways to represent it of

741
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,080
course

742
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,880
so

743
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,159
how does

744
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,520
action relate to biological

745
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,840
systems or first let's let's um

746
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,399
start with some philosophical frameworks

747
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,200
that highlight the importance of action

748
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,120
so this includes

749
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,440
an activism

750
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,360
embodied

751
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,000
the four e's five e's seventies et

752
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,919
cetera et cetera et cetera everything

753
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,399
involving like

754
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,799
this sort of embodied enacted and

755
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,919
cultured extended etc approach to

756
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,120
cognition

757
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,720
and philosophy

758
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,640
and those can be qualitative so i'm

759
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,320
putting that edge here these are

760
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,559
different qualitative and philosophical

761
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:07,919
areas

762
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,440
yes they can be formalized we'll get to

763
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,360
that edge but these are qualitative

764
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,399
memes

765
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,200
that come from this philosophical area

766
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,399
and they're going to draw us to action

767
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,799
okay now

768
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,000
how about biological systems and action

769
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,200
what do you think about when you think

770
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,720
of biology and action

771
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,600
i don't know i think like those things

772
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,960
are kind of extra inextricably linked

773
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,200
in my mind um because like you can't

774
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,880
have life without

775
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,720
having some action i mean

776
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,600
cells replicate

777
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,480
yeah

778
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,039
i think this is going to be just uh

779
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,600
something that

780
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,960
doesn't

781
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,600
demand to be fed but is totally true

782
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,840
biological systems are active there it's

783
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,520
active matter

784
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,440
and life is this multi-scale

785
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,919
organization of activity

786
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,039
so

787
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,799
there's many ways biological systems are

788
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,000
doing action

789
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,120
and what are some areas that are formal

790
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,240
whether or not they have to do with

791
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,480
biology or any philosophy

792
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,360
can you name a few areas of like formal

793
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,679
theory and science that you think relate

794
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,159
to action

795
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,960
so i mean i think um just that's maybe

796
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,919
more related to processing um but but as

797
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,279
i said earlier i think processing is

798
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,440
related to action but like bayesian

799
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,720
inference and and variational inference

800
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,399
i think um

801
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,720
which also tie in a lot to active

802
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,000
inference um i i think that they come in

803
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,960
their

804
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,000
uh

805
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
in the processing slash

806
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,919
processing through action or action

807
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,080
through processing

808
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,120
okay

809
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,880
great so

810
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,559
um bayesian

811
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,720
planning as inference

812
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,919
as well as areas like cybernetics

813
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,200
control theory and

814
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,760
different formal ways

815
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,120
of modeling

816
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,760
active systems and modeling decision

817
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,080
making

818
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,760
these could be

819
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,960
related to a biological system or not

820
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,399
and they can be drawing on a

821
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,880
philosophical framework implicitly

822
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,039
explicitly or not

823
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,159
all right

824
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,960
so now this is starting to get fun you

825
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,240
added another

826
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,679
term there and i think this will merit a

827
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,240
detour but then i return to here which

828
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,279
is the variational bayesian approach

829
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,240
so

830
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,919
what do you think

831
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,919
variational

832
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,320
is meaning or doing here

833
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,159
so it's interesting and

834
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,200
part of what uh makes this complicated

835
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,320
um

836
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,080
paper and also like a complicated detour

837
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,360
um

838
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,559
that like the authors cast predictive

839
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,360
coding as variational inference like

840
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,960
even though we've kind of made this

841
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,960
distinction between predictive coding

842
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,440
and predictive processing

843
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,120
where coding does just is like a one-way

844
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,279
street and processing is like a two-way

845
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,240
street

846
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,120
um the authors nevertheless use the term

847
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,880
predictive coding as variational

848
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,000
inference

849
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,360
um and and this predictive coding

850
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,279
um

851
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,640
or this variational inference um i think

852
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,799
the the key

853
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,679
um construct here and that's probably i

854
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,360
don't know it overlaps with with

855
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,360
bayesian brain maybe two is the

856
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,559
idea of having a model of of the data

857
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,799
generating process and so

858
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,679
i think um variational inference kind of

859
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:58,000
throws the idea of a of a model into the

860
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,159
loop

861
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:01,360
okay

862
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,039
so let's zoom in on this blue

863
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,440
corner

864
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,880
of formal and quantitative areas

865
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,039
and so these can be taken in an action

866
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,840
independent way

867
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,559
they can be explicitly about action

868
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:22,159
like planning as inference

869
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,480
or they could just more implicitly rest

870
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,039
on inference i'm sorry more implicitly

871
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,760
rest upon action for example in the case

872
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,840
of we're inferring the hidden state of

873
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,519
the temperature of the room and we're

874
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,919
observing the thermometer that doesn't

875
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,320
have pi it doesn't have a it doesn't

876
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,039
have action in that model it might just

877
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,880
have those two parameters of like the

878
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,120
room's temperature hidden state and the

879
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,880
observations of the thermometer but then

880
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,480
we can kind of take a step back and see

881
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,399
all right well there's the person who's

882
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,559
engaging in this experimental action the

883
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,480
person's ocular motor

884
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,760
zooming in on the thermometer maybe we

885
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,480
can just abstract away but action is

886
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,679
always baked into it because we're

887
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,159
talking about active systems but let's

888
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,279
just put some of that aside for a second

889
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,879
and take a quick detour to talk about

890
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,560
variational inference because it's a

891
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,119
really important topic

892
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,440
let's think about and we've also

893
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,119
explored this in

894
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:19,679
active livestream 26

895
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,599
and 37 and a lot of other times so

896
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,839
let's look at three different ways of

897
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,839
doing bays

898
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,280
base ways

899
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,520
bayes areas as they were

900
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,719
so

901
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,560
and maybe there are more

902
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,560
but the three that we can list up here

903
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,879
are exact base

904
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,800
monte carlo

905
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,359
and variational base so pick one and

906
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:44,879
then what is like something important to

907
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,560
know about that way of doing bayesian

908
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,560
statistics

909
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,199
um well so

910
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,000
i'm by no means an expert in bayesian

911
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,160
statistics actually like cracked out my

912
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,240
bayesian data analysis book while i was

913
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,280
reading this paper because it was uh one

914
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,359
of those papers like i said i'm uh i'm

915
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,359
anal retentive and and detailed and i

916
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:08,400
love like what does that mean i have to

917
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,680
look up every little thing i don't

918
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,680
understand um so

919
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,920
like okay so let me start with the exact

920
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,359
ways um so exact base when i think about

921
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:18,720
exact base

922
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,240
it's like um

923
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,119
the probability of a given b like the

924
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:25,599
probability of rain given clouds or

925
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,079
something like that um and so

926
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,040
it's like a an alternate

927
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,920
alternative to frequentest statistics

928
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,960
where

929
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,300
um

930
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,520
[Music]

931
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,920
the probability of rain

932
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,079
[Music]

933
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,280
and the probability of clouds or or like

934
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,440
a coin flip is easier to talk about

935
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,800
right like so each flip of the coin

936
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,200
is half and so like you know the idea

937
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,720
that what what are the chances that

938
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,800
you're gonna get heads

939
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,920
um

940
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,800
you know

941
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,720
five times in a row is half times half

942
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,280
times half times half times half so

943
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,079
um

944
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:06,560
in bayesian statistics there's um

945
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,160
or the probability that you're going to

946
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,240
get rain here this is it in frequency

947
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,520
statistics the probability that you're

948
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,720
going to get rain and the probability

949
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,640
that you're going to get clouds

950
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,680
is um the probability of rain times the

951
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,760
probability of clouds that's a great way

952
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,440
to put it and then in bayesian

953
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,839
statistics there's it evaluates the

954
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:25,760
probability of rain with clouds like

955
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,160
given what you already have observed

956
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,880
before like if it's rained it it's

957
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,520
usually cloudy this percent of the time

958
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,599
um and it takes into consideration the

959
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,960
probability of

960
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,040
rain with clouds probability of rain

961
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,640
probability of clouds all those things

962
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,560
separately so it gives you a prior

963
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,240
estimation i think

964
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,839
so i don't know that's probably super

965
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,440
confusing

966
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,680
great no you mentioned a lot of really

967
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,760
important points which is it's

968
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,560
uh

969
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,040
an alternative to frequentist statistics

970
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,000
analysis so we're not getting a p-value

971
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,359
out of this

972
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,839
and we're able to explicitly

973
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,520
say our priors

974
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,720
and

975
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,560
not to go down this rabbit hole but a

976
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,960
lot of frequentism implicitly has a

977
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,359
uniform prior and we'll just leave it at

978
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,240
that for now so the exact base is using

979
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,920
the bayes equation

980
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,240
essentially as written and just as you

981
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,680
said it there's the probability of

982
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,320
something given something else and then

983
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,720
you kind of find the probability of that

984
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,040
other thing given the first thing

985
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,000
multiplied by these other terms and then

986
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,079
you fill out all of those variables and

987
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,640
you literally do that division and so we

988
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,680
explored like this in the case of axel

989
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,800
constance paper with the bacteria and so

990
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,280
there was the exact bayesian bacteria

991
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,760
that was having its prior and then

992
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,720
taking in new information and updating

993
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,839
how it thought about what was out there

994
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,839
based upon the new incoming information

995
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,640
and it was like in a formula and it was

996
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,720
like dividing exactly the numbers that

997
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,119
you see here in this way

998
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,880
okay so that's exact base now

999
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,160
what are some issues with exact base

1000
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,160
it might be straightforward when you're

1001
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,079
talking about that coin flip but if

1002
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,760
you're talking about a high dimensional

1003
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,800
space

1004
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,119
or something that is just bigger than

1005
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,079
the ram or whatever of your computer

1006
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,839
when it comes to the implementation

1007
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,560
there's often challenges with exact base

1008
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,640
and so there's several

1009
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,200
techniques that have been developed

1010
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,240
to

1011
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,240
approximate

1012
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,720
what an exact bayesian approach would be

1013
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,000
in a more tractable way so there's two

1014
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,839
alternatives to exact bay's

1015
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,079
implementation and the spirit is going

1016
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,400
to be exactly the same of taking in new

1017
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,320
information and updating our priors as

1018
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,880
specified but it's going to be done in a

1019
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,920
few different ways so first what about

1020
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,680
monte carlo what is monte carlo

1021
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,880
um so monte carlo uh you probably know

1022
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,599
more about the history than i do but but

1023
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,280
um monte carlo is like a sampling

1024
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,280
technique so you know instead of um

1025
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,280
trying to calculate

1026
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,320
the probability of um

1027
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,040
rain and clouds using exact space

1028
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,800
you just sample like out of you know

1029
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,520
a thousand rainy days how many of them

1030
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,280
were cloudy and out of you know a

1031
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,880
thousand cloudy days how many of them

1032
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,960
were rainy and so instead of like

1033
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,200
getting an exact measurement of your

1034
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,200
distribution like what is where is the

1035
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,599
overlap between clouds and rain you just

1036
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,760
randomly pick out from all of the

1037
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,359
possible days

1038
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,040
you estimate your sample

1039
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,359
that way

1040
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,320
great

1041
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,880
so

1042
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,200
it's based upon sampling

1043
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,280
and so it's like

1044
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,920
we might not know one of these terms but

1045
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,079
we can at least draw a sample and so

1046
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,079
this does a few different things it

1047
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,560
connects us first to empirical and

1048
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,240
specific data as implemented like in a

1049
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,440
row of a program not just

1050
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,160
b sub i or some sort of analytical

1051
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,520
representation but like this is where

1052
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,839
we're getting into this specific sample

1053
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,599
was pulled by this algorithm at this

1054
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:24,640
time

1055
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,760
and

1056
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,119
one method that's a common

1057
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,920
thing is the markov chain monte carlo

1058
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,480
and this is using a local resampling

1059
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,920
approach like assessing local maneuvers

1060
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,079
of a given chain that's engaged in

1061
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,760
sampling and you kind of drop these

1062
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,280
chains into different parts of the

1063
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,680
probability distribution and then have

1064
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,400
them evaluate different aspects of that

1065
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,800
distribution so it's as easy or hard as

1066
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,880
dropping those paratroopers

1067
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,720
into different parts of the physical

1068
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,960
landscape and then having them accept or

1069
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,599
reject different proposed moves so

1070
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:02,960
that's sort of a

1071
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,720
two-dimensional landscape with the

1072
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,040
height being elevation and maybe that's

1073
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,560
what you want to map because you might

1074
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,319
want to know is there one

1075
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,720
central peak are there two peaks that

1076
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,240
are very similar

1077
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,599
and

1078
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,160
take that into the statistical case

1079
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,599
and this is especially helpful for when

1080
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,240
there's no

1081
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,359
um well i don't say no idea but there is

1082
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,880
not the desire to explicitly formalize

1083
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,240
what shape

1084
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,560
the distribution looks like so we might

1085
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,440
want to do like bayesian phylogenetics

1086
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,359
and so we need to talk somehow about the

1087
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,680
likelihood of a given dna sequence being

1088
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,760
that way but like

1089
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,599
where do you go from there

1090
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,599
and so that's where the monte carlo

1091
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,359
sampling based approach really comes

1092
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,440
into play and then

1093
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,200
because it's based upon sampling the

1094
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,520
advantages are you can run that sampling

1095
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,560
for three iterations or three million so

1096
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,640
it's very flexible with the amount of

1097
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,560
computing power that you bring to bear

1098
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,520
on this

1099
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,040
challenge

1100
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,440
but also there are the risks of over

1101
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,000
sampling which is that you have

1102
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,560
used some unneeded electrical power and

1103
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,160
computational power which is really

1104
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,960
non-trivial but also there's the risk of

1105
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,319
under sampling

1106
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:21,280
and you might even be like in a regime

1107
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,720
where you think that you've sampled

1108
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,000
because you're

1109
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,520
getting samples that are just confirming

1110
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,960
what you already know

1111
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,000
but you know there's a whole other

1112
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,040
island that you didn't do the paradrop

1113
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,400
to so

1114
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,599
one can be lulled into a false precision

1115
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,680
with bootstrapping and sampling based

1116
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,720
approaches

1117
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,640
because they can give ultra high

1118
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,160
precisions

1119
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,960
but that can be based upon um actually

1120
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,000
more like a biased sampling approach or

1121
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,599
all these other features and just the

1122
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,079
one anecdote that i have on that is in

1123
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:52,880
the

1124
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,119
bayesian phylogenetics case

1125
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,359
i remember this one professor in

1126
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,920
undergrad uh professor moore and he'd

1127
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,319
always say fuzzy caterpillar you want it

1128
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,000
to look like a fuzzy caterpillar and

1129
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,839
there's some technical details but it's

1130
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,599
like you want it to be

1131
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,480
exploring the full range

1132
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,079
of a parameter like if something could

1133
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,319
be zero to one you want to be exploring

1134
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:15,760
the full range

1135
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,480
but returning to the best estimate and

1136
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,720
that shows that you're sampling like the

1137
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,520
diversity of what that parameter can be

1138
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,560
but also spending more or most of your

1139
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,599
time

1140
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,520
in the most likely and in the best

1141
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,440
regions and so if the value were at

1142
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,680
point five and the range of what's

1143
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,079
possible was like zero to one that looks

1144
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,079
like a fuzzy caterpillar with more

1145
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:39,680
thickness in the middle and then a lot

1146
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,520
of fluctuation but it's not like it's

1147
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,280
spending a ton of time at one and then

1148
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,599
it drops suddenly to zero because that

1149
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,079
would suggest that you're not converged

1150
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:49,760
yet whereas when you see that fuzzy

1151
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,240
caterpillar it's like you're sampling

1152
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,560
the extremes and getting novelty

1153
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,000
and testing different combinations but

1154
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,440
you're also returning to something that

1155
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,200
is working so

1156
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,680
monte carlo sampling based approach

1157
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,520
brings in all these opportunities and

1158
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,040
challenges associated with sampling

1159
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,440
uh well so i i was under the impression

1160
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,680
like you talked about over sampling but

1161
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,600
i think um

1162
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,760
[Music]

1163
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,240
over sampling like as you as sampling

1164
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,280
goes to infinity like your um

1165
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,359
your accuracy increases like you're

1166
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,319
you're more closer able to get the true

1167
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,960
posterior um but i think it's it's

1168
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,599
uneven sampling that's the the danger in

1169
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,040
the monte carlo method like if you're

1170
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,760
sampling too far in one end or the other

1171
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,640
and perhaps like asymptotically if you

1172
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,119
exhausted the state space

1173
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:40,800
then you would know that you had the

1174
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,480
right answer but the whole reason why

1175
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,480
we're using any kind of heuristic

1176
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,240
approach rather than exact base is

1177
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,760
because like we don't have the full

1178
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,560
state space so yeah there's um

1179
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,319
relatively low cost to over sampling

1180
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,560
but we don't always know when that is

1181
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,040
and then under sampling can be just

1182
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,319
totally

1183
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:03,200
misleading if we take that as our only

1184
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,839
um

1185
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,560
representation of that distribution and

1186
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,319
so there's all kinds of cool techniques

1187
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,079
that involve like multiple chains

1188
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,920
happening in parallel and some of them

1189
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,359
are like higher temperature and less

1190
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,119
temperature so for one of those

1191
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:18,800
paratrooper teams

1192
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,960
it's very cold and so they're only

1193
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,599
making the best very local moves it's

1194
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,079
like the elevation is sharpened for them

1195
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:28,640
it's very hard to get out of a local

1196
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,560
rut and there might be another team

1197
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,480
that's very high temperature and for

1198
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,880
them the landscape is flat

1199
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,440
maybe even completely flat and then

1200
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,520
they're like a hot molecule that's able

1201
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,280
to move over something that might be a

1202
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,839
barrier for another team so that team is

1203
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:46,560
going to like fill in the details and

1204
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,960
locally explore quality solutions

1205
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,640
whereas there's another team that's like

1206
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,680
or another chain and so that's the

1207
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,599
multiple chain

1208
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,599
monte carlo approach and there's a lot

1209
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,520
to that in phylogenetics which is where

1210
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,599
i've seen it the most but also probably

1211
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:05,040
many other areas okay i've i've run it

1212
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,040
in phylogenetics too and like i mean the

1213
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,800
programs can take

1214
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,400
forever

1215
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,400
that's too fun because you know i mean

1216
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,079
you're too many parameters and and

1217
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:15,440
whatever they can really take a long

1218
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,079
time um the computational power is no

1219
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,880
joke like what goes into um the monte

1220
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,599
carlo sampling so we have exact base

1221
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:26,640
which is calculating the true posterior

1222
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,480
and then we have the monte carlo which

1223
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,040
is estimating the true posterior through

1224
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,359
sampling and then we come to the

1225
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:36,000
variational which is

1226
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,560
trying to minimize the divergence

1227
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,720
between

1228
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,119
the true posterior and your

1229
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:46,640
approximation of the posterior

1230
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,880
great

1231
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,280
minimizing divergence between

1232
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,280
the true posterior

1233
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,920
like what we would really have wanted to

1234
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,520
actually know

1235
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,359
what is the actual temperature in the

1236
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,760
room conditioned upon the noisy

1237
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,160
thermometer estimates that we're getting

1238
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,839
so are we going to sample our way out of

1239
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:06,720
that one

1240
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,240
the variational approach is going to be

1241
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,400
very different and and in 26 i think we

1242
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,480
had like the cat

1243
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,480
and then one approach was like the monte

1244
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,720
carlo was like pointillism it was like

1245
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,560
dots so we're sampling pixels from the

1246
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,720
cat and then it becomes like a pointless

1247
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,880
picture of a cat that if you do sample

1248
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,880
densely enough it looks like a cat or

1249
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,800
it's recognizable as a cat

1250
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,599
and the variational approach was like a

1251
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:32,079
clip art template and so let's just say

1252
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:33,599
that you had a template of different

1253
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,599
curves or of like you knew that

1254
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,440
that it wanted to be a cat you knew you

1255
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,359
were looking at a cat so then you have

1256
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:40,640
like a cat

1257
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,160
template that can get

1258
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,280
stretched

1259
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,119
or zoomed in or out

1260
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:46,640
and so that might be very

1261
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,720
straightforward to optimize

1262
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,160
because you're just trying to minimize

1263
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,760
the divergence between these very

1264
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,119
limited parametric changes

1265
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:56,720
that you can implement

1266
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,559
but then of course you run into a

1267
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,480
situation which will explore various

1268
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,359
aspects of variational inference

1269
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,119
what if you try to stretch

1270
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,280
that cat emoji

1271
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,400
onto

1272
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,160
a different animal or what if it's a

1273
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,079
totally different kind of data set so

1274
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,359
you will

1275
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:17,359
find some divergence minimizing solution

1276
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:19,680
that doesn't mean it's sufficient or

1277
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,200
even in the right ballpark just like

1278
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,240
doing

1279
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,680
l2 least squares minimizing

1280
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,440
linear regression

1281
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,240
will always find a best fitting linear

1282
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,599
regression

1283
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:32,400
but

1284
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,400
that best fitting linear regression

1285
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,200
can be like hilariously inaccurate like

1286
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,880
if the data are like a uh a parabola

1287
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,079
like a u

1288
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:43,839
the best fitting regression might be

1289
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:46,319
like a flat line through the middle or

1290
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,079
if eighty percent of the points are here

1291
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:50,079
and 20 are over here there might be a

1292
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,160
regression that's very misleading that's

1293
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,359
like the simpsons so-called paradox so

1294
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:57,680
in variational we're not going to use

1295
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,599
sampling we're going to use the

1296
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,319
minimization of a divergence which is a

1297
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:05,119
kl divergence but they mention in this

1298
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:07,040
paper it can also be

1299
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,720
a different kind of divergence and the

1300
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,880
rainy divergence has been explored in

1301
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,920
some recent work of sagitta at all so

1302
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,440
we're going to minimize the divergence

1303
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,920
between the true posterior

1304
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,680
and a distribution queue

1305
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,640
that we control and

1306
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,520
is

1307
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:29,880
tractable to optimize

1308
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,760
so it's like instead of that sampling

1309
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,839
based approach we were dropping the

1310
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,040
teams at different parts of the

1311
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,319
landscape

1312
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,559
and then they were going to report back

1313
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,800
on information here in the variational

1314
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,440
approach it's like

1315
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,440
we have a template

1316
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,599
and then we're gonna just do stretching

1317
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:51,920
and bending

1318
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,079
again this is kind of a torture metaphor

1319
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:55,599
but we're gonna stretch and bend and

1320
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,119
there's only a few parameters on the

1321
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,960
stretching and bending and we're going

1322
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,720
to find the best

1323
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,200
fit of those stretching and bending

1324
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,440
parameters like if it were a linear

1325
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,720
regression

1326
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,800
y equals mx plus b

1327
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,280
the two dials that you get to change are

1328
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,720
like the m the slope of x and b like how

1329
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,040
high or low the regression is and then

1330
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,440
you're finding m and b

1331
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,440
that are the best fitting

1332
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,000
about the data y and so you're kind of

1333
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,640
like minimizing the least squares

1334
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,079
error term

1335
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:28,960
here

1336
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,559
it's not a linear regression that we're

1337
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:31,440
fitting

1338
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,000
by minimizing the least squares

1339
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
it's a variational bayesian

1340
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
approximation that we're fitting

1341
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,079
by minimizing the divergence between the

1342
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:42,480
true posterior and the distribution

1343
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,280
queue that we control and is optimal or

1344
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,599
is able to be optimized

1345
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:51,559
what else would you add on that

1346
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:59,680
um i think that's it so uh the the true

1347
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:03,760
posterior and the the distribution

1348
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,200
that is

1349
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,880
tractable and

1350
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,359
we can optimize over yeah that's it

1351
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,760
so let's close this little okay

1352
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,920
computational intensity on variational

1353
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,359
is um

1354
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:17,440
like much less

1355
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,520
right than um

1356
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,319
because instead of

1357
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:24,079
calculating

1358
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:26,400
all of the parameters for every little

1359
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,480
dot every little point on the sample

1360
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,559
we are calculating

1361
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:35,040
for like a big blob

1362
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,880
it's like one big blob instead of

1363
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,119
several little points but we calculate

1364
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,680
for that big blob this is the density of

1365
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,079
that of that function

1366
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:46,400
um and these are the parameters of that

1367
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,319
so so now we're gonna

1368
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,880
back out of this formal cul-de-sac that

1369
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,800
we've been in and just remember to

1370
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,800
ourselves even if it's your first time

1371
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,280
hearing variational inference

1372
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,960
and or you're kind of like blue or eye

1373
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,400
where it's like we've read it in how

1374
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,800
many papers but still every time we kind

1375
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,319
of start on square zero so why do we use

1376
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:08,640
variational bayesian inference so the

1377
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,720
first thing is it allows us to use

1378
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,800
bayesian statistics and probability

1379
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,440
which we might prefer over for example

1380
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,400
frequentism okay variational bayes then

1381
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,960
allows us to use a heuristic bayesian

1382
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,800
implementation

1383
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,160
so if there's something that's too

1384
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,319
challenging or implausible for exact

1385
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:27,280
base

1386
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,440
now we can approach it

1387
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,280
like monte carlo or variational these

1388
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,680
are both heuristics

1389
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,760
unlike monte carlo it's not based upon

1390
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,960
sampling variational is based upon a

1391
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,599
family of equation fitting and so it can

1392
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,280
be implemented very efficiently which

1393
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,480
isn't always the case for monte carlo it

1394
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,680
rests upon an appropriate factorization

1395
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,280
of the problem

1396
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,359
and one other piece is this connects

1397
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:56,079
to

1398
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:58,880
analytical equations in physics

1399
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,960
so it's almost like monte carlo is like

1400
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,440
a computer scientist's approach

1401
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,599
it's like how much ram do we have how

1402
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,520
many processors do we have how big is

1403
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,280
this data set going to be and then

1404
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,200
there's no analytical

1405
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,000
equation or closed form for monte carlo

1406
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,920
it's like engineering it's kind of like

1407
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,319
you have to have some art and skill and

1408
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:20,559
science coming together for the monte

1409
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:22,559
carlo to be the best it can be

1410
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,920
and then it's more about like an

1411
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,079
adequacy and an efficacy question

1412
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:27,599
because you're not converging to the

1413
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:29,839
infinite asymptote again otherwise you

1414
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,760
could have done something else and then

1415
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,400
the variational is like the physicist's

1416
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,160
approach and it draws on the variational

1417
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,280
calculus of feynman and others and this

1418
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,599
is the part that's very amenable and

1419
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:43,440
connected to the equations of least

1420
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,440
action and all these other things like

1421
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,520
factorizing equations

1422
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,119
so it's funny that you bring up the

1423
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:52,079
computer scientist approach um

1424
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:53,610
in monte carlo and like so

1425
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:55,520
[Music]

1426
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,079
i am a horrible

1427
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:00,559
computer person i mean i will brute

1428
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:03,520
force wrangle my data like just give me

1429
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,520
more ram just give me more processing

1430
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,079
power like i i um i just want to make

1431
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:09,200
things work

1432
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,040
i don't have any patience for

1433
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,359
finesse right so in my mind i think

1434
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:15,119
about the monte carlo like the brute

1435
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:16,880
force just shove your data through the

1436
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,400
algorithm no matter how much ram it

1437
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,400
takes i think about monte carlo like

1438
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,880
that and i think about um

1439
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,800
the variational bays more like the

1440
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,079
people that

1441
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:27,839
can do like

1442
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,160
you know very simple things in code to

1443
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,000
make it run much faster that have that

1444
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,880
like very good skill with like oh well

1445
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,280
we can just you know run this little

1446
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,160
factorization or or um

1447
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,680
you know we can make the problem run so

1448
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,599
much better on the computer

1449
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:44,880
so i think about it about the

1450
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,799
variational um like that but you're

1451
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:48,880
right it does have that connection to

1452
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,440
statistical physics and to definement

1453
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,200
but i think about it as like a highly

1454
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,720
optimized

1455
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,119
way to run bayesian statistics but why

1456
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:58,480
daniel would someone want to run

1457
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,480
bayesian statistics in the first place

1458
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,839
so so maybe you want to give us an

1459
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:04,160
example why why would that happen well

1460
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,839
yeah we will pull back just the last

1461
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:07,119
point there is

1462
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:09,920
the variational methods we might even

1463
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,240
have a heuristic for those or an

1464
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,280
algorithm or approximation of those for

1465
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,520
example message passing and forney

1466
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,799
factor graphs

1467
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:21,359
those draw an equivalence between bayes

1468
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,599
graphs where nodes are random variables

1469
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:26,240
and edges are statistical relationships

1470
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,680
bayes graphs

1471
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,680
can undergo variational inference

1472
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,160
and there's a tractable way to use

1473
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,480
toolkits like that developed by the bias

1474
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,680
lab

1475
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,000
and use message passing and a 40 factor

1476
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,400
graph representation to have like a

1477
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,400
level of implementability for even the

1478
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,200
variational whereas it's not possible to

1479
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,520
imagine like a heuristic for monte carlo

1480
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,480
it is the heuristic sampling is sampling

1481
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,880
you can do better sampling but that's

1482
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,280
the game that you have chosen whereas in

1483
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,440
variational even this question of

1484
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,000
minimizing divergence does require kind

1485
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,119
of like a

1486
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:05,359
proximate or an operational approach

1487
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:07,040
because how can we minimize the

1488
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,119
divergence between the true posterior

1489
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:11,040
and something we control when we don't

1490
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,000
know what the true posterior is so there

1491
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,520
have to be a little bit

1492
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,400
more added but this is like very

1493
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,920
awesome discussion because it's helping

1494
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,319
us pull out like this is the sort of

1495
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:25,040
exact approach and then there's a more

1496
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:28,079
computer science like sampling approach

1497
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,079
and then a more analytical and

1498
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:32,240
physics-related approach okay

1499
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:35,839
so why do we want to do base let's

1500
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:36,960
pull back

1501
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,480
to our

1502
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,799
triangle here

1503
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:43,440
why do we want to do base and thinking

1504
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,520
about the concepts here why do we want

1505
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,240
to do base

1506
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:49,760
i asked you you're not allowed to turn

1507
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,359
the question around on me that was me

1508
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:52,480
asking you you're not allowed to just

1509
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,560
talk and then ask me

1510
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:57,359
[Music]

1511
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,760
well there's a few ways to take it i

1512
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,280
guess one would be

1513
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,480
what is the alternative policy selection

1514
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,760
if we're doing research or application

1515
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:11,040
what is our our alternative to picking

1516
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,760
some bayesian approach so if we take the

1517
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,599
bayesian road we know that there's going

1518
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,520
to be some sort of

1519
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,480
trivergence later exact base monte carlo

1520
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,880
variational base something else

1521
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,599
or we could go down a different

1522
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:27,359
statistical path like we could use

1523
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:28,400
frequent

1524
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,520
statistics

1525
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,400
and maybe that's totally adequate and

1526
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,480
effective for the situation

1527
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,520
and both are just maps so a well-fitting

1528
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,799
linear model

1529
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:40,400
of height and weight doesn't make height

1530
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,640
and weight a linear model

1531
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,640
a really good fitting action perception

1532
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,200
loop whether it rests upon a kernel of

1533
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,720
frequency statistics or bayesian

1534
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:52,400
statistics doesn't make those systems

1535
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,640
that way that you modeled it

1536
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,599
um so i would say bayesian statistics is

1537
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,359
useful when we want to do

1538
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:00,960
some kind of

1539
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,839
formal or quantitative inference

1540
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:05,520
where we want to be

1541
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,760
specific and explicit

1542
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,240
about our prior beliefs

1543
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,280
and how we want incoming information to

1544
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,240
update those beliefs

1545
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:19,440
so i i agree and um

1546
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,960
it's what i always try to tell people um

1547
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,799
you know when i'm explaining like what

1548
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:26,400
is bayesian statistics which a lot of

1549
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,640
people have never heard of um like in

1550
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,160
college at least when i graduated

1551
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,599
there's not there's no bayesian

1552
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:33,680
statistics course now many schools have

1553
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,920
them um and you know i'm outdated

1554
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,240
already but uh

1555
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,440
it's really like when you're doing

1556
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,280
frequented statistics

1557
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,920
you go out to the desert and count mice

1558
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,760
every year right every year you go and

1559
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,440
count how many mice you see in the in

1560
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,680
the desert or something like this

1561
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:50,400
and

1562
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,720
if you i mean you expect to see some

1563
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:53,920
mice in the desert otherwise you

1564
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,400
wouldn't be there counting them so um

1565
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,319
you expect a non-zero

1566
00:58:58,319 --> 00:58:59,839
answer right so every year you go out

1567
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:02,480
you find 10 mice 20 mice 50 minus 30

1568
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,559
mice 20 mice 10 mice and every year you

1569
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:06,400
go count mice so

1570
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,559
if you were to go like you have some

1571
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:11,280
expectation that you will find mice um

1572
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,880
you also have some expectation that

1573
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,720
there is going to be less than a

1574
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,960
thousand mice because every year you can

1575
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,839
sample this one place right and so um

1576
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:21,839
what bayesian statistics does is it

1577
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:23,440
takes actually that prior not like

1578
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,799
frequent statistics they don't care if

1579
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,480
you ever found mice there before like

1580
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,400
your probability of finding zero mice

1581
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,480
and 30 mice and 50 mice and 100 mice and

1582
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,839
a thousand mice is all the same it

1583
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:33,040
doesn't matter how many years you've

1584
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,200
been there before like you are starting

1585
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,040
with nothing in frequent statistics you

1586
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,880
don't get to have any guess that there's

1587
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,280
even going to be one mouse in the desert

1588
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,720
where with bayesian

1589
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,559
statistics like obviously you think that

1590
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:45,920
there are there are going to be some

1591
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,119
mice and you think it's going to be some

1592
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:49,920
number you can count reasonably so with

1593
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,839
whatever area and so what bayesian

1594
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:54,880
statistics statistics allows for is that

1595
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,880
prior belief or that expectation that

1596
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,599
you have as experimenter

1597
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:01,839
awesome and that's kind of

1598
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:03,520
what we were getting at with that idea

1599
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,400
of frequentism having this implicit

1600
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,880
uniform distribution you flip the coin

1601
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,440
ten times you get three heads

1602
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:14,400
your maximum likelihood estimate is it

1603
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,440
comes up 30 of the time on heads 0.3

1604
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,079
however if you want to take like a

1605
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:21,760
bigger picture of you you might have

1606
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,079
some sort of precision about where it's

1607
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:26,319
likely to be like is it

1608
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:28,480
likely to be 0.5 and you're going to be

1609
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,640
surprised if it were 0.3 because you

1610
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,079
just pulled it out of

1611
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:34,240
a cash register and then in that case

1612
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,559
you still might say i want to have a

1613
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:39,680
uniform prior and if it is 0.3 then it's

1614
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,559
0.3 or you might want to say i'm very

1615
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:44,640
confident it's something else but

1616
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,119
bayesian statistics opens up the space

1617
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:50,480
to be specific about how we want to use

1618
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,880
our priors how confident we want to be

1619
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,559
how much precision we want to have in

1620
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:57,200
those priors and then how we want to

1621
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,359
incorporate new information so any other

1622
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:01,040
thought on that or let's continue on

1623
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,200
that and connect it to some formalisms

1624
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,640
so i have one more thought on the coin

1625
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,359
flip with baby with the bayesian idea

1626
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:08,880
like if you know it's a fair coin and

1627
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,799
the probability is 50

1628
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:12,559
and like if you're we're flipping coins

1629
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:14,079
and we're betting each time like you

1630
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:15,920
know a dollar a dollar a dollar if if we

1631
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,720
flipped that coin you flip the coin

1632
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,480
10 times in a row in its heads every

1633
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,040
single time like on the 11th time like

1634
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:25,119
my bet is on tails because like it's not

1635
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,559
it's a fair point like it's not going to

1636
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:27,599
come up

1637
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:30,720
um every single time heads and so

1638
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,200
frequent to statistics like does never

1639
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:36,160
allow for that previous information and

1640
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,799
also like where is that information

1641
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:40,319
which is something that always baffles

1642
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:42,400
me like does the coin already know that

1643
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,640
it's been flipped ten times and it's

1644
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,000
come up heads all those times and that

1645
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
it then has to come up tails sooner or

1646
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,160
later i mean that the probability is so

1647
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,200
low that you're gonna get like a

1648
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,359
thousand coin flips of a fair coin in a

1649
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:55,119
row that is heads like i don't know if

1650
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:57,280
it's ever happened to anyone ever so

1651
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,960
like as we increase in the number of

1652
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,400
flips and if it's heads heads headsets

1653
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,319
heads like it becomes increasingly

1654
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:03,680
probable that the next flip is going to

1655
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:06,160
be tails in my view right which is maybe

1656
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,160
totally wrong but but where is that

1657
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:11,119
information stored and um the bayesian

1658
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:13,760
kind of prayer allows for that to be

1659
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,599
there

1660
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,359
and i wonder if this even connects to

1661
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,280
where is that information stored

1662
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,839
in the quantum reference frame of the

1663
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:24,960
observer and nowhere else but

1664
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,520
let's look at how that gets implemented

1665
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:30,160
in these formalisms so you just describe

1666
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:33,359
that setting where somebody has like a

1667
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:35,839
belief that the coin is fair maybe

1668
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:37,520
that's an empirically grounded belief

1669
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,720
like previously they flipped it a

1670
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,440
thousand times and they got 50 50.

1671
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,400
or they have just an a priori

1672
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,280
belief that is fair if that belief were

1673
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,400
generated by a real other data set we

1674
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,039
would call that parametric empirical

1675
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:55,760
base because it's the process where you

1676
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,359
set the priors

1677
01:02:57,359 --> 01:02:59,680
as well as their confidence based upon

1678
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,599
some collected data set

1679
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:04,319
that's parametric empirical base

1680
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:07,520
or one could just take that a priori

1681
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:08,480
cons

1682
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,480
synthetic a priori

1683
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,440
and just say coins ought to be

1684
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:17,760
50 50 and that's what i'm sticking with

1685
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,119
let's just say that then we play this

1686
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:21,359
game we flip it 10 times and

1687
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:22,960
likely or not

1688
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,400
10 heads

1689
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,799
happen that's the trace of behavior in

1690
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:28,799
the niche it actually happened now that

1691
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:30,400
might be seen as a totally likely

1692
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,640
outcome by somebody who believes that it

1693
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,319
always comes up heads hence they're

1694
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:37,039
unsurprised or depending on what your

1695
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:39,680
priors were that could be variably

1696
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,480
surprising and then you

1697
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:45,280
talked about well when and how should

1698
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,640
you update

1699
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,119
your beliefs on that coin

1700
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:50,720
like maybe something changed while you

1701
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,960
weren't looking at it and so you want

1702
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:55,119
like your best estimate

1703
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:58,640
to very heavily reflect the recency and

1704
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,319
maybe that should be like a moving

1705
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:02,960
average of the most recent

1706
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,359
three flips or maybe the most recent 30.

1707
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:08,240
so let's look at two places in the paper

1708
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,960
where they do something like that

1709
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,200
the first one has to do with

1710
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,200
predictive coding

1711
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,599
and frame differencing algorithms in

1712
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:19,440
video compression

1713
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,400
and so

1714
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,599
in this

1715
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:22,720
area

1716
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,400
we can think about

1717
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,200
the

1718
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,400
way that the video

1719
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,680
looks

1720
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,839
people who are watching this video the

1721
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:31,839
way that the video looks is like the

1722
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:34,079
output and then we want to encode like

1723
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:36,000
how surprised are we what is happening

1724
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,240
when the frames are changing and so the

1725
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,319
simplest method is just count where it's

1726
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:41,280
different

1727
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,599
and convey that information

1728
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:47,200
but it might also be important to use as

1729
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,640
they write

1730
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,799
more advanced methods that predict each

1731
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:52,079
new frame

1732
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:54,559
using a number of past frames weighted

1733
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:56,960
by a coefficient in approach known as

1734
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,039
linear predictive coding

1735
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:00,960
so that's one case where you're

1736
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,200
determining how many frames back how

1737
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,799
many coin flips back

1738
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:07,760
should we use for that now casting

1739
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:09,839
and how should we weight them

1740
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:11,520
so that's one area

1741
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,599
and then a second area that they bring

1742
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:15,599
up and connect

1743
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:18,480
is the calm and filter

1744
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,960
so here's the common filter and this is

1745
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:25,359
their formalisms 33 and 34.

1746
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:28,160
and it has a lot to do with bayesian

1747
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:31,039
statistics so on this and bayesian

1748
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:34,319
column filter is very common

1749
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:36,559
we can see it in two different ways so

1750
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:39,039
on the left side of this slide

1751
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:40,720
the top image

1752
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,839
shows um a prior prediction that's the

1753
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:46,000
prediction and then two is the

1754
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,720
measurements and then there's the fusion

1755
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,400
so we have the prediction the

1756
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,640
measurement here with like gps and then

1757
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,000
there's the fusion

1758
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,039
so that is very similar to having a

1759
01:05:57,039 --> 01:05:59,520
prior and then some updated sensory

1760
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,920
information and then the posterior so

1761
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,920
it's just labeled slightly differently

1762
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:05,599
but we can already see how this is like

1763
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:08,720
totally related to bayesian statistics

1764
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:11,200
what this also brings into the picture

1765
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,079
is like a pseudo code that unrolls

1766
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:15,440
through time

1767
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,119
so a bayesian statistics approach

1768
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:19,839
doesn't have to be about time it can be

1769
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:22,559
about a static data set

1770
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:24,640
and then you could be modeling like okay

1771
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:27,680
per extra sample of the population of

1772
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,280
their height and weight we're going to

1773
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,359
update our inference on that

1774
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:32,400
relationship

1775
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,440
but that's a timeless analysis it

1776
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,280
doesn't incorporate some sort of

1777
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,599
unfolding through time

1778
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:42,480
that can be incorporated into the kalman

1779
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:43,520
filter

1780
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,680
using this pseudo code down here on the

1781
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,599
left there's some prior knowledge of

1782
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:50,079
state and this is like two dimensions

1783
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:52,000
and then there's a cloud representing a

1784
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,640
distribution of precision or uncertainty

1785
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,039
so a more precise estimate would be like

1786
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:00,240
a tighter cloud there or a sharper peak

1787
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,839
or a sharper valley depending on how you

1788
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:03,440
want to think about it

1789
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,760
and then less precision

1790
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,559
would be like a broader basin or like a

1791
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:11,839
more diffuse ink drop and then

1792
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:13,440
there's a prediction

1793
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,520
then a measurement occurs which can be

1794
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,240
precise or can also have an associated

1795
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,799
measurement error term

1796
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:22,240
which could be fit with parametric

1797
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,319
empirical bays based upon testing or it

1798
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:26,160
could be determined on the fly with

1799
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,799
expectation maximization and then that

1800
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:31,760
prior gets juxtaposed in this update

1801
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:32,640
step

1802
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,319
and that outputs

1803
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:37,119
so this takes sort of this timeless

1804
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,680
bayesian update scheme

1805
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,319
and specifically adapts it to the case

1806
01:07:42,319 --> 01:07:45,119
of something happening through time

1807
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:47,920
and that's shown on the right side here

1808
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,920
with this image of like time is

1809
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,200
happening

1810
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,760
and we're getting these noisy x

1811
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,200
measurements

1812
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,280
and the true temperatures the purple and

1813
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,880
let's just say it's unchanging in this

1814
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:01,359
case but that could also be changing one

1815
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:03,039
can just imagine that especially if it's

1816
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:04,559
very noisy

1817
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:06,079
it's hard to get

1818
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:08,160
increasingly complex dynamical patterns

1819
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,039
but

1820
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:10,559
that's all part of the game

1821
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:13,599
and then the prior starts high

1822
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:15,839
and then the prior

1823
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:18,880
is weighted it's kind of like a spline

1824
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,560
it's weighted

1825
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,640
through all of these x's and you can

1826
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,679
imagine one extreme case is like

1827
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:28,640
move to the last one that you saw

1828
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,080
and so that would be like basically

1829
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,839
recapitulating the measurement

1830
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:34,080
distribution through time

1831
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,799
the other extreme case would be

1832
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:39,759
wait all the time points evenly so that

1833
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:41,198
like we're kind of converging to a

1834
01:08:41,198 --> 01:08:42,960
moving average so if we have a hundred

1835
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:46,399
hours of video that is like at a two

1836
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:47,759
and then all of a sudden it switches to

1837
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:48,719
an eight

1838
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:51,040
and then your moving average would very

1839
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,479
very slowly

1840
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:54,880
start moving up from a two

1841
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,319
and then one could imagine that there's

1842
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:58,479
some intermediate solution

1843
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:00,719
that doesn't use like the whole data set

1844
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:02,560
because that's too slow to adapt and

1845
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:05,279
maybe takes up too much memory but isn't

1846
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:07,359
just like a one step

1847
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:08,640
instantly switch to the nearest

1848
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:11,759
measurement and that parameter

1849
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:14,158
of how fast should you update your

1850
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:15,839
kalman filter

1851
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:18,158
is a parameter in the model

1852
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:20,158
and so that is exactly what is being

1853
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:22,238
statistically optimized is

1854
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:23,839
how much

1855
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,439
through time

1856
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:28,319
should we update our ongoing estimate

1857
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:30,399
and so in the static or the timeless

1858
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:32,839
bayesian case that's where we talk about

1859
01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:35,679
precision how much should we update our

1860
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:38,799
inference as new information is added to

1861
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:40,799
our data set but that doesn't mean

1862
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:43,279
appended in a temporal way

1863
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:46,799
the common filter is making it explicit

1864
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:48,799
that these data points are being added

1865
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:50,158
sequentially

1866
01:09:50,158 --> 01:09:52,000
and that is providing us with this

1867
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,640
pseudo code by which the latent state

1868
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,800
update the latent state

1869
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,800
is updated

1870
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:01,040
not just as a function of adding data

1871
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,280
but actually adding data in a sequential

1872
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:07,120
and unrolling way what do you think blue

1873
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,120
yeah great i think that that was a super

1874
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:11,840
good

1875
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,920
explanation and

1876
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,440
very clear and

1877
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:16,640
yeah um

1878
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,640
my first uh

1879
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:20,400
interaction with common filtering was in

1880
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,159
imaging and image processing and so i

1881
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:23,360
think

1882
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,520
that's maybe where people come across

1883
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,760
that a lot especially like doing laser

1884
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:30,480
scanning microscopy or

1885
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,920
a video i guess the video update also is

1886
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,600
like that so

1887
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,800
yes so let's just look at some of their

1888
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,679
um writing but these are like

1889
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:44,080
the smaller the formalism

1890
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,159
the less we've paid attention to it and

1891
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:48,159
the more that we would love to know

1892
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:50,640
about what it actually means but let's

1893
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:53,040
kind of pick up above their 35 they

1894
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,000
write

1895
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,239
coleman filtering proceeds in two steps

1896
01:10:56,239 --> 01:10:58,400
first the state is projected forwards

1897
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:01,520
using the dynamics model or prior and

1898
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,199
that's the p

1899
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:06,880
of mu t plus one that's the mean

1900
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:09,840
at the next time step conditioned upon

1901
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:12,239
the mean at this time step so that's

1902
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:13,040
like

1903
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,080
what is

1904
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,159
going to happen next conditioned upon

1905
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:17,920
how it is now

1906
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:20,960
these estimates are corrected or sort of

1907
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,960
compromised

1908
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,280
coming to a compromise by new sensory

1909
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:29,120
data by inverting the likelihood mapping

1910
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,159
p

1911
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:33,120
of observations at the next time point

1912
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,600
conditioned upon our estimate of where

1913
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:38,560
the latent state will be so this is what

1914
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,800
temperature will the room be conditioned

1915
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,560
upon how it is now

1916
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,159
at the next time step what will it be

1917
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:46,080
conditioned upon what it is now

1918
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,239
this likelihood mapping which is like

1919
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:51,600
the a matrix in the pomdps

1920
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,840
is what is the probability of the

1921
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:56,239
outcome in the next time step being a

1922
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:57,520
certain way

1923
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:58,960
conditioned upon

1924
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,800
how we think the room's temperature is

1925
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,800
going to be and so these are the

1926
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,640
equations and some of the

1927
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,480
variables

1928
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:07,520
and then

1929
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:10,159
they kind of conclude or in this little

1930
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:12,239
section the derivation of the rules is

1931
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:14,320
relatively involved and that's in

1932
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,640
appendix a and some other places

1933
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:19,840
but also the common filtering can be

1934
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:22,159
interpreted as finding the optimum of a

1935
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:25,600
maximum a posteriori estimation

1936
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:26,560
problem

1937
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:29,360
so this is almost like we have kant

1938
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,560
with

1939
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:33,920
the exhortation of the a priori what

1940
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,840
information are we bringing to the table

1941
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,199
qualitatively

1942
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:38,080
can't

1943
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:38,960
or

1944
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:42,320
quantitatively bayes that's the a priori

1945
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,320
and then baze kind of bridges the a

1946
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:49,280
priori the prior with a posteriori

1947
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,560
not sure if that's the latin for that

1948
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,880
one but it's the posterior what happens

1949
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:55,120
after the sensory update and then that

1950
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,840
space between like the before

1951
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,360
and the after

1952
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:00,960
is the during

1953
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:04,239
and that's the during of the now that

1954
01:13:04,239 --> 01:13:08,959
were doing action and inference within

1955
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,320
let's look at how they introduce oh

1956
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,679
anything otherwise we'll look at how

1957
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:17,440
they introduce action and then connect

1958
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,760
it back to active inference

1959
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:20,640
so

1960
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,440
i i think um

1961
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:26,000
the common filtering and the the

1962
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,560
updating so i think we we kind of

1963
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,560
skipped over

1964
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:31,760
um

1965
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,920
updating when we were talking uh when we

1966
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,159
were making our layer cake earlier

1967
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:39,600
um and just how um

1968
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,320
how messages in the nervous system

1969
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:45,199
biologically and in predictive coding

1970
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:46,480
are

1971
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:49,280
passed forward and backwards so it might

1972
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:52,880
be helpful to back up and talk about

1973
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:56,719
error propagation and

1974
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,960
propagation of

1975
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:01,520
back propagation and propagation of

1976
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,760
signal through time um just as like a

1977
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:04,640
very

1978
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,320
basic way because i think the common

1979
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,280
filter

1980
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:10,719
um is kind of an advanced way to do that

1981
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:13,280
okay can we detour

1982
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,360
we're back at the triangle and so now

1983
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,920
we've added variational as like a little

1984
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,280
badge

1985
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:20,880
to um

1986
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:23,199
the bayesian and also we're going to add

1987
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:26,239
coleman as a badge where have we visited

1988
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:29,040
on this journey and

1989
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,040
one can imagine that they could take a a

1990
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:33,520
monte carlo or a variational or an exact

1991
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,360
approach to common filtering and so on

1992
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:38,320
and then you mentioned a few more

1993
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:41,760
biologically inspired or compatible

1994
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,120
features

1995
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,840
like error propagation and so on so what

1996
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,320
is a area in the paper or an idea that's

1997
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,960
relevant here

1998
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:54,080
so i think

1999
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:58,960
the the signal propagation and and

2000
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,640
bottom-up

2001
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:03,600
prediction error like how does error

2002
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,120
propagate

2003
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,480
like through

2004
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,320
visual systems through like neural

2005
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:09,679
networks i think that there's

2006
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:12,239
applications here um

2007
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:14,719
and is it the error that's fed forward

2008
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:16,719
or is it the signal that's fed forward

2009
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:19,840
or where does the error go in the system

2010
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,920
so i think these are some some

2011
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:24,480
confusing things that that maybe they

2012
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,640
they touched on um

2013
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:27,360
in

2014
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,040
the beginning of the paper so let me see

2015
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,199
if i can find exactly

2016
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:33,519
um

2017
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:36,880
or there's some debate okay i'm while

2018
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:38,960
you're looking so i've i've

2019
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,000
pulled out

2020
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:40,880
this

2021
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,280
right edge of the triangle so we're

2022
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:44,719
going to just

2023
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:46,880
leave some of the baggage at home

2024
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,800
and take out to the table

2025
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,640
just this link between

2026
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:53,360
bayesian statistics and probability and

2027
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:55,360
biological systems

2028
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,880
and then you raise this really important

2029
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:58,640
question about like how do we think

2030
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:01,120
about error estimation

2031
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,360
and also some related terms there would

2032
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:04,840
be like

2033
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:07,679
precision ambiguity

2034
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:08,880
risk

2035
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,440
compression

2036
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,480
and that so that those are error

2037
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:15,679
estimates

2038
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:18,719
and then how are error estimates

2039
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:20,960
propagated and communicated

2040
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,800
how are they propagated and communicated

2041
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,239
in language

2042
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:26,239
i'm not sure

2043
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:29,959
if i had to guess

2044
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:36,159
in power error estimates communicated in

2045
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:39,760
systems and so we might be interested in

2046
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:42,159
mathematical systems

2047
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:43,760
so then the way that you communicate the

2048
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:46,320
error is just you multiply the two

2049
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:49,120
variables you have a precision matrix

2050
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:50,640
and then you have like some sort of

2051
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,560
hidden state matrix and then you

2052
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:54,800
basically just fuzz

2053
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:57,440
this kind of pristine matrix

2054
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:00,400
by some error matrix and so if your

2055
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:03,040
error on something is like zero this is

2056
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,400
not exactly how the multiplication would

2057
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,560
work because multiplying by zero but

2058
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:10,080
if the error were zero on something

2059
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,560
one would want their estimate to be

2060
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,199
passed through without being blurred

2061
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:17,360
if the estimate of the uncertainty were

2062
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,440
super high

2063
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,760
in the extreme approaching total

2064
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,920
noise and uncertainty and variance

2065
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:26,880
estimate then no matter where that

2066
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:29,440
pristine estimator were you'd want it to

2067
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:32,000
be like totally fuzzed over and then one

2068
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,960
could imagine that in a per variable

2069
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:36,560
ongoing way

2070
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:39,120
you'd want to be updating these variance

2071
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,600
estimators and that is exactly what

2072
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,360
happens in the common filter which is

2073
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:46,480
this unrolling and ongoing estimate of

2074
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:47,840
observations

2075
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,600
latent states and

2076
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,440
the the variance that links them and

2077
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:52,800
that's done like through matrix

2078
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,199
multiplication but how does it happen in

2079
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:56,719
biological systems is a different

2080
01:17:56,719 --> 01:17:59,719
question

2081
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:02,560
so i i think um

2082
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:07,040
some things come into play here like um

2083
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,400
redundancy

2084
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,960
and signal compression and then error

2085
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,880
propagation

2086
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:17,199
forward and backward um and so there is

2087
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:19,440
this um

2088
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:21,280
in predictive coding

2089
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,360
slash predictive processing because i'm

2090
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,199
still like not 100

2091
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:28,560
um on the on the difference there

2092
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:31,120
but but i do think this is a predictive

2093
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:31,920
um

2094
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,360
it seems like that it's a predictive

2095
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,840
processing uh thing but the authors do

2096
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:36,560
say

2097
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:39,360
predictive coding there is like a bottom

2098
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:40,400
up

2099
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:41,520
um

2100
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,920
construction of a model

2101
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:47,840
so the authors say that um

2102
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,760
but it's not only that pers it's the

2103
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,440
authors say that perception is not the

2104
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,600
result of an unbiased feed forward or

2105
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,080
bottom-up processing of sensory data but

2106
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,159
is instead a process of using sensory

2107
01:18:58,159 --> 01:19:00,880
data to update predictions generated

2108
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,360
internally by the brain

2109
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:04,640
so there's

2110
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:08,320
the idea of a model comes in here yeah

2111
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,800
generative model where do you see

2112
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,159
generative model

2113
01:19:12,159 --> 01:19:15,599
in these discussions

2114
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,840
i mean it's kind of threaded throughout

2115
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:22,159
so i think the the idea of um

2116
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:24,400
variational inference

2117
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,800
brings in a model because the model

2118
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,400
constructs

2119
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:29,360
the

2120
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,159
um

2121
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:32,640
estimate of the posterior like where

2122
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:35,199
we're consistently there's a consistent

2123
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:37,760
effort to update the estimate of the or

2124
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:39,920
to sorry to minimize the divergence

2125
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:42,640
between the actual posterior and the

2126
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:44,960
estimate of the posterior

2127
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:48,640
so the estimate of the posterior is like

2128
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,480
you know trying to make the model match

2129
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:52,640
reality so trying to make the picture of

2130
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:54,400
the cat match

2131
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:57,600
stretch bend fold into um

2132
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:00,239
you know the model of the cat

2133
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:05,760
yes awesome so generative model with no

2134
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,760
complications is being put into the

2135
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:10,320
bayesian statistics area because if you

2136
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,719
specify a model that's generating

2137
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:14,239
thermometer

2138
01:20:14,239 --> 01:20:16,080
outputs given the temperature it's quite

2139
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:17,840
literally the generative model and we

2140
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,040
know that there's kind of two directions

2141
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,560
there's like the recognition model and

2142
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:22,239
the generative model that's the tail of

2143
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:23,840
two densities

2144
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:24,800
because a

2145
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,560
distribution can also be understood as a

2146
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,880
density and so in the realm of

2147
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:31,280
statistics generative model is quite

2148
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:32,400
literally

2149
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:35,199
the approach that is taking parameters

2150
01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:37,840
of a model and using it to generate for

2151
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:40,320
example observations in this case

2152
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,639
no need to complicate that but then

2153
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:44,639
there's a few ways that we hear

2154
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:47,199
different people in different papers

2155
01:20:47,199 --> 01:20:49,600
talking about the relationship between

2156
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,080
biological systems and generative models

2157
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,679
as well as recognition models but we're

2158
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:55,760
focused on the generative model here and

2159
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,159
sometimes these are even

2160
01:20:58,159 --> 01:21:00,480
coherently or incoherently used

2161
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,719
differently in the same paper or the

2162
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:04,080
same sentence

2163
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:06,480
which is our favorite and will

2164
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,719
eagerly await the kind of automated

2165
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:10,480
detection systems that will enable us to

2166
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:11,199
do

2167
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:13,440
high throughput analysis but here's just

2168
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,600
a few of the kind of ways that people

2169
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,120
can talk about that

2170
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,199
we hear sometimes that the biological

2171
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:21,199
organism or cell

2172
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:24,560
is a generative model

2173
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:27,199
has a generative model

2174
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:30,480
enacts a generative model or the more

2175
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,080
instrumentalist

2176
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:34,320
we can model

2177
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,880
that system with a generative model

2178
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,639
and so this bottom one

2179
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:40,320
is kind of like saying

2180
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:41,920
i'm just planning to use bayesian

2181
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,520
statistics

2182
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:46,000
to model a biological system

2183
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,639
and perhaps we could say that this is

2184
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:50,639
the least

2185
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:53,120
bringing assumptions to the table

2186
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:56,080
of what that system is doing because by

2187
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:57,520
saying we can model it using a

2188
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:00,239
generative model we can use or fit

2189
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:02,480
derive a generative model for this

2190
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:05,360
behavioral cognitive system

2191
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:06,560
we're just

2192
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:09,280
remaining purely with both feet in

2193
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,520
scientific instrumentalism and

2194
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,840
empiricism we're making only claims

2195
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:16,000
about the map

2196
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,400
and not about the territory per se which

2197
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,199
might

2198
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:20,400
be

2199
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,080
throwing out the um

2200
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:25,360
whatever with the whatever however

2201
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:27,600
these ones are when people are making

2202
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:28,800
claims

2203
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,040
that are about the territory

2204
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:34,480
what is the brain is bayesian brain what

2205
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:37,440
the brain is doing well

2206
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,679
it's not passing around screenshots of

2207
01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:42,159
bayes equation like we are so what is it

2208
01:22:42,159 --> 01:22:43,679
that it is doing

2209
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:45,679
or again is it on the instrumental side

2210
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:46,960
it's just something that we can use to

2211
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:50,080
model the brain so

2212
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:51,679
yeah

2213
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:54,000
so um

2214
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,639
going back to predictive coding and and

2215
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:59,920
also linking to what is the brain um

2216
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:02,800
doing and really this is why i wanted to

2217
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:05,600
uh stop here um i found i found the spot

2218
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,080
in the paper um but but when we were

2219
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:09,280
talking about

2220
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:12,000
common filtering and um

2221
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
image uh

2222
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,800
processing and then error propagation

2223
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,440
in a system um they they talk early in

2224
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:22,159
the paper about predictive coding

2225
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:24,800
as a means to remove redundancy

2226
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:28,320
uh and applied it to signal processing

2227
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:30,719
to reduce transmission bandwidth for for

2228
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:31,679
video

2229
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:32,960
um

2230
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:34,400
and this

2231
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,880
they the authors say here

2232
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:38,080
um

2233
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:40,400
barlow apply applied this principle to

2234
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:43,440
signaling in neural circuits arguing

2235
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:45,840
that the brain faces considerable

2236
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:48,400
evolutionary pressure for information

2237
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,880
theoretic efficiency since neurons are

2238
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:53,120
energetically costly and redundant

2239
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,960
firing would be potentially wasteful and

2240
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,600
damaging to an organism's evolutionary

2241
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:58,560
fitness

2242
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:00,080
because of this we should expect the

2243
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:02,480
brain to utilize a highly optimized code

2244
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:04,800
which is minimally redundant

2245
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:07,040
and they say predictive coding minimizes

2246
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:10,000
this redundancy by only transmitting

2247
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,639
errors or residuals of sensory sensory

2248
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:14,719
input that cannot be explained by

2249
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:17,120
top-down predictions and so they remove

2250
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,199
redundancy at every point in the layer

2251
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:20,320
so it's like when you're watching a

2252
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:21,440
video

2253
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:24,480
and um or even like the flip book like

2254
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:26,159
so we see like you know the the flip

2255
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:28,480
book that likes of a little figure

2256
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:30,960
kicking a ball

2257
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,280
the point that changes is the point

2258
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:35,440
that's prioritized the point that's

2259
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:37,679
different in each frame not the point

2260
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:39,920
that stays consistent because that is

2261
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:42,159
where the action is here

2262
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:44,239
where the motion is happening so that

2263
01:24:44,239 --> 01:24:47,360
that's what's prioritized here

2264
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:48,639
and that

2265
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:51,120
totally connects to information theory

2266
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:54,080
informative updates are the ones that

2267
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:55,600
update your

2268
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:56,719
prior

2269
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:58,880
to move it to a different posterior

2270
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:01,120
that's the bayesian information

2271
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,239
concept

2272
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:05,040
as opposed to for example the

2273
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:07,360
shannon entropy which is like based upon

2274
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:09,040
symbol entropy so they're totally

2275
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:11,199
compatible and if this seems like a

2276
01:25:11,199 --> 01:25:13,199
technical detail it is

2277
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:15,280
but also this is the bayesian concept of

2278
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:17,840
surprise and information but that was a

2279
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:20,000
great section you pulled out so

2280
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,800
here we're we're really highlighting as

2281
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,480
following barlow

2282
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:25,760
applying

2283
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:26,560
this

2284
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:31,199
principle of redundancy removal but

2285
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:33,040
already we can caveat

2286
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:36,080
how much redundancy to remove because a

2287
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:39,120
more redundancy removed system is also

2288
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,040
potentially more fragile

2289
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:43,679
like if we only have one copy of each

2290
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:45,120
saved file

2291
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:46,560
now our

2292
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,000
threat

2293
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,040
of losing it is very high so redundancy

2294
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:52,639
is always in a trade-off with like

2295
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:54,560
resilience and other system features so

2296
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,480
this is one principle but it's not the

2297
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,560
only principle at play so redundancy

2298
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,080
doesn't mean we're going to pare it down

2299
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:01,199
to nothing

2300
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:03,280
it just means that for

2301
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:05,280
an organ like the brain

2302
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,600
which is using like 20 percent or

2303
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,840
however much of an organism's energy

2304
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:10,960
budget

2305
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:13,040
changes in its efficiency by several

2306
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:16,480
percent can be really important so that

2307
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:18,960
principle of redundancy removal is being

2308
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:20,159
applied

2309
01:26:20,159 --> 01:26:21,360
and the argument is that the

2310
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:22,960
evolutionary pressure

2311
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:26,239
is for information theoretic efficiency

2312
01:26:26,239 --> 01:26:28,239
so if you don't have anything to update

2313
01:26:28,239 --> 01:26:30,560
you don't want to spend the energy to do

2314
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:33,040
something extraneous nor do you want to

2315
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:34,800
spend any more energy than you might

2316
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:37,520
have to on updating

2317
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:39,520
and that's again because of the

2318
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:41,440
wastefulness of

2319
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:43,679
potentially excess signaling

2320
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:45,280
and then with evolution there's always a

2321
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:48,000
twist like what if it is wasteful and

2322
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,360
that's just

2323
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:51,840
some second level reason why so it's not

2324
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,600
the whole story this is just sort of

2325
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,760
short sentences

2326
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:57,840
because of this

2327
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:59,440
we should expect the brain to utilize a

2328
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:02,320
highly optimized neural signaling neural

2329
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:05,679
firing code which is minimally redundant

2330
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:07,199
and then they connect it back from what

2331
01:27:07,199 --> 01:27:08,239
the brain

2332
01:27:08,239 --> 01:27:10,960
ought to be doing normatively at a first

2333
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,159
pass

2334
01:27:12,159 --> 01:27:13,120
to

2335
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:15,199
the formalisms that were being described

2336
01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:16,960
with predictive coding

2337
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:19,760
so in the frame differencing case

2338
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:21,280
it was like

2339
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:23,360
only tell me about the pixels that are

2340
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:24,880
changing

2341
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:27,040
and then if nothing's changing just send

2342
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:29,280
me like a little beep and i'll just know

2343
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,960
with just one piece of information just

2344
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:32,719
to keep it exactly the same even if it's

2345
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:35,760
4k video and it's a gigabyte per second

2346
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,760
or whatever but we don't have to change

2347
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:40,400
anything for that video and then

2348
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:43,199
as pixels are changing

2349
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:45,600
update me on how to change them

2350
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,760
and so that would be like the

2351
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:51,199
maximum efficiency encoding

2352
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:53,360
and so you would give a full resolution

2353
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:55,600
of the first frame in the movie that's

2354
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,760
the prior that's d

2355
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:00,400
and then all one has to do is think

2356
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,960
about how to encode

2357
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:05,520
how the subsequent frames change

2358
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:07,040
and sometimes they introduce things like

2359
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,440
a keyframe so every second or every

2360
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:12,080
minute it's it starts with a fresh prior

2361
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:12,960
and so these are the kind of

2362
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,639
computational things that one can do

2363
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:16,639
when they're not bound by like the

2364
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:18,719
constraints of biological systems but

2365
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:21,679
this is an awesome connection um

2366
01:28:21,679 --> 01:28:23,920
any other thoughts on that

2367
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:25,840
um theme or like where does error

2368
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,679
propagation come into play or we'll turn

2369
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:30,719
back to the triangle

2370
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,880
so i don't know the error of propagation

2371
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,719
is is interesting it'd be great to have

2372
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:37,840
like the input of somebody who um

2373
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:40,000
is more like versed in machine learning

2374
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,360
because i think

2375
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:43,520
the idea of like back propagation like

2376
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,280
this is an error and like sending that

2377
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:47,840
back to the previous like layer in the

2378
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:50,400
neural network is super interesting and

2379
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,480
part of what um like enhances the

2380
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,480
efficiency of neural networks like hey

2381
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:57,040
fix this and so i think um and i can't

2382
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:58,480
really find in the paper where they say

2383
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,800
that but but there's like a local

2384
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:03,440
correction for error within each layer

2385
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:07,120
of processing so um in the visual system

2386
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:09,679
and um

2387
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:11,520
in signal processing itself it's like

2388
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:12,480
each

2389
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:15,600
layer prioritizes just fixing their own

2390
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,199
error and then

2391
01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:18,719
that contributes to the overall

2392
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:21,600
efficiency and um

2393
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:24,880
uh accuracy of the system at large yes

2394
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:27,679
back propagation is mentioned

2395
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:30,719
45 times in the paper with a quick

2396
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:32,320
search so it's definitely an important

2397
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:34,000
concept and also something the authors

2398
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,920
have worked in a lot

2399
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:38,239
so good error propagation and back

2400
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:40,879
propagation

2401
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,239
and also that reminds me of um when

2402
01:29:44,239 --> 01:29:45,600
professor levin

2403
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,719
was here in 40.2

2404
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:50,719
with the back propaganda

2405
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:52,159
and the imperatives for like the

2406
01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:53,679
different parts of the neural network

2407
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:55,199
and the kind of information that they

2408
01:29:55,199 --> 01:29:56,080
want

2409
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:58,400
or expect or prefer and then how they

2410
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:01,600
want to escape being trained and engage

2411
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,000
in learning but not being trained but

2412
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,440
still updating

2413
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,679
so it's learning and being trained both

2414
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:10,400
involve like updating priors potentially

2415
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,400
appropriately but in the case of

2416
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,480
training there's a feeling like another

2417
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:16,239
entity or agents

2418
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:17,280
is

2419
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:18,880
imposing their will

2420
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:21,199
versus learning can also be associated

2421
01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:23,280
with um behavioral

2422
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:26,000
and cognitive changes

2423
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,120
but

2424
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:28,960
has a different sense potentially than

2425
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:31,520
being trained

2426
01:30:32,239 --> 01:30:34,480
anyways let's go back to the triangle

2427
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:36,560
as we're sort of

2428
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:37,840
not quite

2429
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,920
landing the dot one play you know the

2430
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:42,719
check has not arrived at our restaurant

2431
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:45,360
but um maybe we're working our way up to

2432
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:46,840
our first star

2433
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:50,480
um where do we sit on where action

2434
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:52,480
is and then we have a few terms that we

2435
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:55,440
want to put which is message passing

2436
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:57,440
and then active inference

2437
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:00,239
oh yeah so what is another term that we

2438
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:02,159
can add in

2439
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:03,280
or something that we're seeing

2440
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:05,520
differently in a new light

2441
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:07,120
or where do you see message passing or

2442
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:09,840
active inference

2443
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:15,679
um

2444
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:18,480
so i think

2445
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:20,560
yeah

2446
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,159
so

2447
01:31:22,159 --> 01:31:24,400
we have action are we happy with where

2448
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:27,879
action is sitting

2449
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,880
i've used every feature of google slides

2450
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:42,560
sufficiently um i i like action as sort

2451
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:45,280
of a fulcrum in the center of the

2452
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,880
merry-go-round

2453
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:48,880
is action and yes more arrows could be

2454
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:50,800
drawn but we'll keep it a little sparse

2455
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,880
but go ahead

2456
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:54,159
so

2457
01:31:54,159 --> 01:31:56,480
i think

2458
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:57,679
maybe

2459
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:01,040
message passing sits between

2460
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:04,800
predictive processing and action

2461
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:06,480
and then that's exactly where i was

2462
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:07,840
going to put active inference was right

2463
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:10,320
where you just typed in inference

2464
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:14,239
um because i think uh if we're or

2465
01:32:14,239 --> 01:32:15,520
yeah

2466
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:18,000
it's hard to say um

2467
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,239
where active inference really goes maybe

2468
01:32:20,239 --> 01:32:21,040
like

2469
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:23,360
not right where inference is but like

2470
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:25,840
somehow if action and the bayesian brain

2471
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:28,800
and biological systems could form a

2472
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,360
a triad maybe active inference would sit

2473
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,199
in the middle of those

2474
01:32:33,199 --> 01:32:34,400
things

2475
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:35,440
um

2476
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:38,239
so i added message passing to bayesian

2477
01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:40,800
statistics and probability because it's

2478
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:43,120
something that we can do on a bayesian

2479
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:44,719
graph

2480
01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:47,360
it's a implementational approach but

2481
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:48,480
it's also

2482
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,080
leaning a little bit towards the

2483
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:51,360
biological

2484
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:53,920
because when people talk about like how

2485
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:56,560
does a given piece of information or

2486
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:58,800
signaling or stimulus in

2487
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:00,239
the toe

2488
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:03,360
end up having an effect on the other

2489
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,600
side of the body or on the brain like

2490
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,520
there's some kind of now it's being used

2491
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:08,960
in a technical bayesian sense with

2492
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:10,320
message passing

2493
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,960
whereas in a more just sort of like

2494
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:14,800
conversational way

2495
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:15,600
um

2496
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:17,760
with biological message passing but

2497
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:19,679
whether it's a synapse

2498
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:22,719
an immune synapse or a neural glial

2499
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:25,760
synapse or it's a mechanotransduction

2500
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:28,719
or a hormone

2501
01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:31,440
broadly we can just consider these

2502
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:33,040
different biological mechanisms that

2503
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:35,120
convey information or updates or

2504
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:36,639
anything

2505
01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:38,080
to be like

2506
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:40,960
past messages so message passing is

2507
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:42,320
going to be a formal technique but it

2508
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:43,920
does lean towards

2509
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:45,280
modeling the ways in which different

2510
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:47,280
biological nested entities are

2511
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:49,440
exchanging information yeah

2512
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:51,920
and so why i would put it with

2513
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:54,239
predictive processing is because when i

2514
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:55,679
think about the things that we were

2515
01:33:55,679 --> 01:33:57,040
talking about like

2516
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:59,040
how are signals compressed how is

2517
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:01,840
redundancy eliminated how is error

2518
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,600
propagated through a system or back

2519
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:05,199
propagated so

2520
01:34:05,199 --> 01:34:07,280
which is why like i liked it

2521
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:09,120
there in the processing because like you

2522
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:10,320
can't

2523
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:12,239
legitimately process that information

2524
01:34:12,239 --> 01:34:15,120
without like knowing how the message is

2525
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:16,960
going to be passed like if you're only

2526
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:19,040
going to get every fourth letter

2527
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:20,560
of the message i passed well i'm going

2528
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,960
to encode my message in every fourth

2529
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:24,800
letter not in every

2530
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:26,639
single letter

2531
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:28,639
and that changes right

2532
01:34:28,639 --> 01:34:31,440
okay thanks yes so we have message

2533
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:32,480
passing

2534
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:34,159
now

2535
01:34:34,159 --> 01:34:36,800
as part of the philosophical concept of

2536
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,960
systems that engage in holistically

2537
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:41,360
considered predictive processing because

2538
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:43,760
it connects what biological systems are

2539
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:45,840
are doing with some idea about like

2540
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:47,679
information sharing without any

2541
01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:50,639
formalism but then message passing

2542
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:53,440
via the forney factor graphs

2543
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:55,199
is gonna be in the bayesian side because

2544
01:34:55,199 --> 01:34:56,719
that's like the implementation so maybe

2545
01:34:56,719 --> 01:34:58,800
message passing here yeah it's like on

2546
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:01,840
the sort of predictive coding

2547
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:04,400
implementational side whereas we don't

2548
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:06,080
we're not saying biological systems are

2549
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:08,080
doing for any factor graphs and message

2550
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:10,320
passing in that technical sense but for

2551
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:12,080
sure we can think about it in this

2552
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:14,960
qualitative way okay

2553
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:16,880
so we have action

2554
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:18,320
in the sensor

2555
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:20,719
and then kind of bifurcated it to

2556
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:23,440
include action and inference

2557
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:25,840
aka active inference

2558
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:29,280
for a few reasons first off

2559
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:30,239
action

2560
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:31,679
is not just

2561
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:32,960
blind

2562
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:35,199
flailing action

2563
01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:37,679
when we talk about planning as inference

2564
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:40,239
and inference on action

2565
01:35:40,239 --> 01:35:43,119
and inference about future latent states

2566
01:35:43,119 --> 01:35:45,199
and observations

2567
01:35:45,199 --> 01:35:47,520
that aren't explicitly about action but

2568
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:48,880
we know an act of inference that they

2569
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:51,520
actually do condition on action so

2570
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:54,239
inference and action how we think and

2571
01:35:54,239 --> 01:35:56,800
how we act how the entity's cognitive

2572
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:59,520
model is and how the entity's behavior

2573
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:00,800
is through time

2574
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:03,920
those two are like an inseparable duel

2575
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:06,239
and that's why active inference

2576
01:36:06,239 --> 01:36:08,480
says it all in the title

2577
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:10,480
it's about action and inference and all

2578
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:12,560
of the ways that they are related to

2579
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:14,639
each other again whether it's like

2580
01:36:14,639 --> 01:36:17,199
planning as inference about future

2581
01:36:17,199 --> 01:36:18,239
action

2582
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:20,960
or inference on the consequences of

2583
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:22,080
action

2584
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:22,960
or

2585
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:25,040
it's inference about something that

2586
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:28,800
isn't explicitly action itself like what

2587
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:32,480
is the temperature but it requires or is

2588
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:34,000
conditioned upon

2589
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,600
policy selection

2590
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:37,440
in this framework not the only way to

2591
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:38,719
look at it but that's how they come

2592
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:41,600
together in active inference and like

2593
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:44,080
let's peep over to 4.5

2594
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:46,480
where they introduce action

2595
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:48,959
formally

2596
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:52,000
the basic approach to including action

2597
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,840
within the predictive coding framework

2598
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:56,000
is to simply minimize the variational

2599
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,440
free energy with respect to action

2600
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:01,679
free energy is not explicitly a function

2601
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:03,440
of action

2602
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:06,239
up until equation 51 it can be made so

2603
01:37:06,239 --> 01:37:08,880
implicitly by noticing the dependence of

2604
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:11,199
sensory observations on action

2605
01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:14,000
so if your future sensory observations

2606
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,239
don't depend on action or don't depend

2607
01:37:16,239 --> 01:37:18,400
on that kind of action

2608
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,560
this is like an extraneous

2609
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:22,880
calculation like if you have a coin flip

2610
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:24,800
and you're rolling a dice

2611
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:27,040
and they don't influence each other

2612
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:29,040
then they're conditionally independent

2613
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:31,360
and so there's no need to calculate the

2614
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:32,960
joint distribution if you're just

2615
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:35,679
interested in the coin flip because it's

2616
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:36,480
not

2617
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:38,080
having a causal relationship with the

2618
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:40,159
rolling the die

2619
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:41,360
however

2620
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:43,760
if we're going to have agency

2621
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:45,920
or model systems that appear to have

2622
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:47,280
agency

2623
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:50,480
then there's some kind of dependence

2624
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:53,360
on future sensory observations related

2625
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:54,639
to action

2626
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:56,080
in the visual case

2627
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:58,639
the visual input is conditioned upon the

2628
01:37:58,639 --> 01:38:00,800
ocular motor decisions and those are

2629
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:04,239
actions of a musculoskeletal system

2630
01:38:04,239 --> 01:38:06,080
and then the way that it gets tucked

2631
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:08,080
into the equations

2632
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:09,360
is

2633
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:11,840
the change in action with respect to

2634
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,199
time

2635
01:38:13,199 --> 01:38:14,480
is going to be

2636
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:17,199
related to a gradient so like a partial

2637
01:38:17,199 --> 01:38:18,560
differential equation but then it's

2638
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:20,880
amenable to gradient descent it's going

2639
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:22,400
to be like a partial

2640
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:23,600
derivative

2641
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:25,920
of free energy and how it changes with

2642
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:27,840
respect to action

2643
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:30,960
so like am i minimizing free energy by

2644
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:32,800
steering the wheel more to the left or

2645
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,639
by steering the wheel more to the right

2646
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:38,000
that's like d f over d a

2647
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,560
change in free energy over change in

2648
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:41,600
action

2649
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:44,560
and then free energy f here

2650
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:47,199
is a function not just of the joint

2651
01:38:47,199 --> 01:38:50,159
distribution of o and mu

2652
01:38:50,159 --> 01:38:51,920
not just a joint distribution of the

2653
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:54,080
observations on the thermometer

2654
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:56,000
and the mean estimate of temperature in

2655
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:56,960
the room

2656
01:38:56,960 --> 01:39:00,000
that's kind of the pure inference take

2657
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,199
but again

2658
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:02,960
we're suggesting that sensory

2659
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:05,440
observations have a dependence

2660
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:07,520
could be partial could be complete on

2661
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:10,000
action and so now observations

2662
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,440
themselves

2663
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:13,679
are a function of action

2664
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:15,280
and then that can be unpacked a little

2665
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:16,400
bit more

2666
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:19,199
in 51 and they discuss it further of

2667
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:21,760
course in the paper and elsewhere but

2668
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:24,239
that's like how this inferential

2669
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:25,679
framework

2670
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:29,280
gets built in predictive coding

2671
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:30,960
and then action

2672
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:32,719
becomes introduced

2673
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:35,920
as something that inference can be about

2674
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:37,520
and that's what they say

2675
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:40,480
allows for predictive coding agents

2676
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:42,320
to undertake adaptive actions without

2677
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:44,320
any major change to their fundamental

2678
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:45,600
algorithms

2679
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:47,280
it's not like there was the

2680
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:49,600
temperature thermometer module

2681
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:51,840
and then now there's this totally ad hoc

2682
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:53,840
decision making module that's bringing

2683
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:55,360
in all this thing about what is the

2684
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:57,840
reward of different temperatures what is

2685
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:59,520
the reward of different thermometer

2686
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:01,119
observations

2687
01:40:01,119 --> 01:40:03,280
rather within this same

2688
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:05,840
parsimonious and first principles

2689
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:08,800
inference framework we can model

2690
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:11,600
active inference which is inference

2691
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:14,560
including action

2692
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:20,880
let's kind of continue on this action

2693
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:22,800
theme and then we'll we'll end in a few

2694
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:24,159
minutes

2695
01:40:24,159 --> 01:40:26,159
so under such a scheme

2696
01:40:26,159 --> 01:40:28,480
the prediction error

2697
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:29,920
becomes the difference between the

2698
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:32,400
current observation and the target or

2699
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:34,000
set point

2700
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,320
that raises the question of where these

2701
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:38,719
set points and targets come from

2702
01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:40,560
and that's where they just sort of have

2703
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:42,800
that road leading off into the distance

2704
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:45,119
saying well in the evolutionary case

2705
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:46,800
it's inherited

2706
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:48,880
in the computational case it's just

2707
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:52,000
simply there it could be just a priori

2708
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,440
speculated or it could have been a

2709
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:55,600
parametric empirical phase

2710
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:58,080
so that's one really interesting point

2711
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:00,880
is like when you do introduce action

2712
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:03,520
you have to discuss not just the target

2713
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:06,159
or the set point and how it's generated

2714
01:41:06,159 --> 01:41:09,040
but also you have to make explicit in

2715
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:10,960
the forward model as they write the

2716
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:13,280
dependence of the observations upon

2717
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:15,760
action and that has to be provided or

2718
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:16,639
learnt

2719
01:41:16,639 --> 01:41:18,080
because just that temperature

2720
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:19,679
thermometer model

2721
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:23,119
is not going to include a forward model

2722
01:41:23,119 --> 01:41:24,960
of what happens when you turn on the

2723
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:27,040
heater or when you put on a jacket so

2724
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:28,800
that's something that has to be learned

2725
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:30,480
and then a second interesting thing that

2726
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:33,520
starts to come out of their framing here

2727
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:36,320
is like the costs of action and that

2728
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:38,880
closes the loop really well with the

2729
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:40,480
discussion that you raised of like

2730
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:41,600
barlow

2731
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:44,480
and the information efficiency argument

2732
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:47,040
for why the brains ought to be doing

2733
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:48,320
something

2734
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:50,080
something like

2735
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:52,000
predictive coding efficient signal

2736
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,040
transfer

2737
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:55,040
and hence why it's either what they

2738
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:57,679
ought to or are doing

2739
01:41:57,679 --> 01:41:59,600
or and

2740
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:01,840
how we ought to or could

2741
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:02,880
model it

2742
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:04,800
so that's why the costs of

2743
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,400
this are important cost of action are

2744
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:07,520
important

2745
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:09,199
and then just one last piece in four or

2746
01:42:09,199 --> 01:42:11,840
five was active inference in the pid

2747
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:13,040
control

2748
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:15,199
which is related to the generalized

2749
01:42:15,199 --> 01:42:16,960
coordinates of motion and we

2750
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:19,520
unpack that a lot in live stream number

2751
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:22,719
26 with the bayesian mechanics paper of

2752
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:24,880
decosta at all

2753
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:26,800
and this connects

2754
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:30,800
control in active inference systems to a

2755
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:34,159
very commonly used engineering framework

2756
01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:36,320
for controlling processes which is pid

2757
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:37,280
control

2758
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:39,920
which is framing action through time as

2759
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:42,000
being related to these three terms which

2760
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
are described above

2761
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,159
so

2762
01:42:46,159 --> 01:42:49,040
that's how they brought action into this

2763
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:52,320
paper was by spending many of the early

2764
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:53,520
sections

2765
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:56,239
providing like the single layer

2766
01:42:56,239 --> 01:42:58,560
predictive coding model

2767
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:01,199
and connecting that to variational bays

2768
01:43:01,199 --> 01:43:03,679
that was in like sections two

2769
01:43:03,679 --> 01:43:05,520
and then in section three

2770
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:07,440
and also in section two they explored

2771
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:09,159
all these different interesting

2772
01:43:09,159 --> 01:43:12,480
generalizations the spatial case the

2773
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:15,040
hierarchical case and then they also

2774
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:16,560
connected it to

2775
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:19,440
biological systems and reviewed some

2776
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,040
evidence for predictive coding of

2777
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:22,320
different kinds

2778
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,719
and then in section four

2779
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:26,320
when they connect to several other

2780
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:28,639
inference algorithms like predictive

2781
01:43:28,639 --> 01:43:31,199
coding and the back propagation of error

2782
01:43:31,199 --> 01:43:32,880
linear predictive coding and the kalman

2783
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:33,920
filter

2784
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:36,320
normalization and the normalizing flows

2785
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:38,480
which we didn't talk about

2786
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:40,560
predictive coding is biased competition

2787
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:42,480
also something we didn't talk about and

2788
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:43,600
then

2789
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:46,080
after all that action gets tucked into

2790
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:48,320
the picture and it's just like very

2791
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:50,719
clean in a very elegant way

2792
01:43:50,719 --> 01:43:52,400
to think about it and helps us

2793
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:54,800
understand like maybe even how active

2794
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:57,040
inference is similar or different to

2795
01:43:57,040 --> 01:44:00,080
some of these other frameworks

2796
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:04,560
so in the spirit of our layer cake i

2797
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:08,080
think um today like we covered

2798
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:11,119
if this paper is a sandwich

2799
01:44:11,119 --> 01:44:13,600
we covered both slices of bread

2800
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:16,320
like the very beginning and the very end

2801
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:18,480
but we left out like all of the things

2802
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:21,199
that kind of come in between um the meat

2803
01:44:21,199 --> 01:44:23,119
and potatoes

2804
01:44:23,119 --> 01:44:26,960
have you had potatoes on a sandwich ever

2805
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:28,320
they do it with some

2806
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:30,080
french fries sometimes but i know what

2807
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:32,080
you mean

2808
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:33,520
go to subway i'm gonna go to subway and

2809
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:34,960
be like yeah can i get some potatoes on

2810
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:37,440
my on myself

2811
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:41,199
did i have a predicting coding special

2812
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,679
and then they go then they go what do

2813
01:44:43,679 --> 01:44:46,560
you expect is gonna be on this sandwich

2814
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:49,040
it would be cool uh next week to really

2815
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:53,040
kind of dive in um more to uh

2816
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:56,320
error back back propagation predictions

2817
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:58,320
are sent you know up and

2818
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:01,119
errors sent down um or or is it the

2819
01:45:01,119 --> 01:45:03,040
other way around um

2820
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:05,440
and really kind of discuss these these

2821
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:07,199
computational graphs that they start to

2822
01:45:07,199 --> 01:45:09,440
talk about so i think next week would be

2823
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:11,280
really cool to kind of dive into what's

2824
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:14,480
inside of the of the sandwich oh awesome

2825
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:16,960
okay so we'll definitely go into some

2826
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:19,600
some so what's inside

2827
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:20,960
the sandwich

2828
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:22,000
um

2829
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,040
a back propagation

2830
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:26,719
of error

2831
01:45:26,719 --> 01:45:30,159
biological evidence and examples

2832
01:45:30,159 --> 01:45:32,400
so i think there's a ton of uh exciting

2833
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:34,719
stuff that we'll be able to talk about

2834
01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:35,920
next week

2835
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:38,159
um like the different paradigms like we

2836
01:45:38,159 --> 01:45:39,920
could cover over figure three the

2837
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:42,480
paradigms of predictive coding and

2838
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:43,600
um

2839
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:46,320
the normalizing flows so we definitely

2840
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:49,440
um we covered the bread today

2841
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:51,119
uh yes

2842
01:45:51,119 --> 01:45:52,719
um

2843
01:45:52,719 --> 01:45:54,000
um well

2844
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,760
anyone who is listening we really

2845
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:57,760
appreciate it look forward to your

2846
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:59,760
comments on the video or joining us next

2847
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:01,600
week if that's gonna work

2848
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:02,560
and

2849
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:04,080
blue this was like

2850
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:05,520
super

2851
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:08,239
interesting and very helpful so i think

2852
01:46:08,239 --> 01:46:09,440
it's a great

2853
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:10,719
dot one

2854
01:46:10,719 --> 01:46:13,600
and it's funny because like dot one it's

2855
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:16,000
it's the meat and potatoes of the zero

2856
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,440
one two

2857
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:18,800
sandwich

2858
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:20,000
so it's like

2859
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,480
our middle of the bottom of the bathtub

2860
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:24,880
phase the dot one where we're opening up

2861
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:27,600
all these ideas and just trying to like

2862
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:29,440
give a second coat of paint on a few

2863
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:31,679
things go into a few technicalities

2864
01:46:31,679 --> 01:46:34,639
re-represent some knowledge it's like

2865
01:46:34,639 --> 01:46:36,159
that was

2866
01:46:36,159 --> 01:46:38,159
in a very

2867
01:46:38,159 --> 01:46:42,400
paradoxical or delightful way about

2868
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:44,639
not the potatoes itself but rather about

2869
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:46,400
the beginning and the end

2870
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:48,480
well to be fair for those of you who

2871
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:50,480
haven't yet read the paper there's like

2872
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:54,480
60 equations and like 55 pages plus an

2873
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:55,600
appendix

2874
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:56,320
so

2875
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:59,040
uh no surprise that we covered

2876
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:01,440
the bread um but it would be cool to

2877
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:04,080
tear apart a little bit of what's inside

2878
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:05,760
of

2879
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:07,119
the paper because i think that these

2880
01:47:07,119 --> 01:47:09,360
layers are cool and important and the

2881
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:10,800
paradigms of predictive coding were

2882
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:13,360
super interesting to me and i love like

2883
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:16,480
the intersection between the brain

2884
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:18,960
and machine learning and i learned a lot

2885
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:21,520
um reading this paper especially like i

2886
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:23,119
was taking neuroscience classes i'm

2887
01:47:23,119 --> 01:47:24,480
going to you know say how old i am right

2888
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:25,920
now but i was taking like neuro in

2889
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:29,199
college at like 12 at like in 2003

2890
01:47:29,199 --> 01:47:31,280
probably maybe 2004

2891
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:32,000
um

2892
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,920
with no idea learning about you know the

2893
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:35,920
work of rao and ballard and hubel and

2894
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:38,880
weasel and and all of these um you know

2895
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:42,159
center surrounds like visual experiments

2896
01:47:42,159 --> 01:47:45,199
uh with no idea like how new they were

2897
01:47:45,199 --> 01:47:47,520
no idea like how um

2898
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:48,960
new of an idea it was like the

2899
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:51,760
processing through the visual cortex um

2900
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:53,840
really like i didn't know how cutting

2901
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:56,159
edge the work i was learning about was

2902
01:47:56,159 --> 01:47:58,639
so it's cool to kind of have that framed

2903
01:47:58,639 --> 01:47:59,600
for me

2904
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:02,560
um and put in perspective and yeah all

2905
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:04,960
the building upon that that's been done

2906
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:06,800
it's nice

2907
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:07,760
excellent

2908
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:09,840
thank you very much blue and everybody

2909
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:12,560
else who's participating and see you

2910
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:15,800
next week

2911
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,080
you
