"Speaker 1","00;00;03;17","00;00;32;26","Hello and welcome everyone to Active Lab. This is Active Lab live stream. Number 20.2. This is our second group discussion on the paper, The Emperor's New Markoff Blankets and today's April 27th 2021 welcome to Active Flav, everyone. We are a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at our links on this slide."
"Speaker 1","00;00;33;26","00;01;02;09","This is recorded and an archived live stream. So please provide us with feedback so that we can improve on our work. All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome, and we'll be following video etiquette for our group. Live streams like muting if we're not going to be talking and raising our hands so that we can hear from everyone. We're down here on the bottom of the slide in the second discussion for the Emperor's New Marcott Blankets and closing out April with this really great discussion."
"Speaker 1","00;01;02;09","00;01;35;26","So check out this link our BQE slash Kevin P.O.S. if you want to see what's upcoming for the different streams The goal of today is really just to continue this awesome exploration and learning and discussion that we've been having and really appreciative that the authors are here to be talking about it with us. So we'll be able to ask some cool questions and anyone who's watching, feel free to ask a question in the live chat and we'll relate to the group today."
"Speaker 1","00;01;35;26","00;02;01;18","We're just going to be going wherever we need to go. We'll start with introductions and then if people want to call out a specific figure or a specific question or especially reference a quotation in the text, or just something that they've prepared that would be really great. So we'll just go around and introduce everyone and say hello. Feel free to just introduce yourself however you'd like and give a short check in."
"Speaker 1","00;02;02;03","00;02;18;25","And then after we have an introduction round, we can return to these warm up questions and anyone can feel free to chime in on one of these questions, such as what they're excited about. So I'm Daniel, I'm in California, and I will pass it to Shannon."
"Speaker 2","00;02;22;12","00;02;30;01","Hey, everyone. I'm Shannon. I'm usually in California, but I'm in South Dakota for the pandemic, and I will pass it to."
"Speaker 3","00;02;32;02","00;02;51;20","Hello, I'm Stephen. I'm in Toronto, and I'm doing a practice based Ph.D. through the Solomon School of Applied Psychology, and I will pass it to Scott Blue."
"Speaker 4","00;02;52;03","00;03;12;21","Scott David from Seattle, Washington, and at the University of Washington Applied Physics Lab. And we're working on synthetic intelligence. And I will pass it to my last list. Who hasn't who hasn't chatted yet? Dean, have you had a chance hi."
"Speaker 5","00;03;13;03","00;03;28;17","I'm Dean of Calgary. I'm retired, and I just like hanging out here because I learn a few things and I'll pass to Chris I'm Chris."
"Speaker 4","00;03;29;04","00;03;40;08","I'm a post-doc at the university in Belgium, in Germany. But I'm joining from Berlin today, and I'm one of the authors on the paper, and I'll pass that to Joe."
"Speaker 6","00;03;42;06","00;03;56;03","Thanks, Chris. I'm Joe de Hurst. I'm a postdoc at the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy, also one of the authors on the paper. My background is in philosophy, neuroscience and computer science. Primarily, I'd say thanks, I'll pass together."
"Speaker 4","00;03;58;17","00;04;15;17","I'm happy to be here again. I'm also one of the authors of the paper. I am currently based in Amsterdam, although I'm supposed to be in Sydney, Australia. Yeah, happy to be here today. Today's a birthday of the Dutch thing, so it's a special day."
"Speaker 1","00;04;17;07","00;04;41;06","Happy birthday OK, I think that's everyone with the introduction. So anyone, please feel free to raise your hand and start off some of the warm up questions are What is something that you're excited about today could be related to the paper or tangentially? What's something that you liked or remembered about the paper? Or from our discussion last week?"
"Speaker 1","00;04;41;27","00;05;05;21","And what is something that you're wondering about or you'd like to have resolved by the end of today's discussion? Maybe another question would be what kind of momentum or what kind of next steps would make sense, you know, emerging from this, whatever we end up resolving or not in the next conversation, where will that take us in our research or in our practice journeys?"
"Speaker 1","00;05;05;21","00;05;12;23","I guess so, Joe. And then anyone who'd like to speak hi."
"Speaker 6","00;05;12;24","00;05;15;05","Thanks. Do I need to lower my hand again or is that done?"
"Speaker 1","00;05;16;04","00;05;16;19","It's just got."
"Speaker 6","00;05;17;14","00;05;31;23","Good, great, cool. So I missed the discussion last week, so some of this may have already been covered, but one thing which relates a little bit to something we were discussing just before we went live here and I think is kind of a broadening of the points we wanted to make in the paper, which I hate, which I wonder about is."
"Speaker 4","00;05;32;21","00;05;35;08","What what the if if."
"Speaker 6","00;05;35;08","00;05;52;17","Active inference can be kind of arbitrarily applied to any given case, given the right kind of setup up and parameters and so on. What does this mean for its future application, which is this insofar as it's too general, or is this a strength insofar as it can be used anywhere? Really, this this I think, is kind of lurking underneath some of the points we make in the paper."
"Speaker 4","00;05;53;05","00;05;54;17","So the."
"Speaker 6","00;05;55;28","00;05;56;23","That's a more general point."
"Speaker 1","00;06;01;06","00;06;17;14","Cool. So can active inference apply to anything and everything? Would that be a strength or would that be a weakness? Awesome question. Any other thoughts anyone wants to raise your hand yet?"
"Speaker 3","00;06;17;14","00;06;41;07","Stephen Yeah. I'd be interested to learn more about the way that the polar blankets and the forests and blankets interpretations might be useful in applications and how that might inform, you know, the way that modeling is done. So that's kind of exciting. For me. So that's one thing that I'm looking forward to."
"Speaker 1","00;06;44;08","00;07;03;21","Great question as well. The distinguishing different kinds of blankets and even pulling back to like what kind of metaphors will we use and how will we relate technical terms to different settings, different practices. Those are some big questions we want to address. Scott And then anyone else?"
"Speaker 4","00;07;05;14","00;07;30;20","Yeah, I'm interested in all in both of those questions or all that aspects. And then also the frizzle of the paradox of those two questions. So it's a chicken and egg question. Are Christian enough Christian attractive inference in a sense, right? We're observing something. We're projecting it out as a teleology onto the world and then asking if it's a good teleology."
"Speaker 4","00;07;31;11","00;07;55;20","Right? So it's so in a way it's like if you go through David Boehm idea that all reality is first a thought that includes the realities that we don't create entirely, that we project. So to one of the questions I have, so as I was a practicing lawyer for 30 years or 25 years ish and when I see active influence I think contracts."
"Speaker 4","00;07;55;27","00;08;39;10","And so I think of it as biomimicry of what we can do socially and project further with real intention to control systems so that so what I'm wondering is and I think both are valid but so ultimately is it a notion I'll use the word biomimicry, but obviously I don't mean in the physical sense, but for us to learn from deep time what we can do as biological organisms to better organize ourselves despite our social elements so to get back to our biology in a way and maybe organize ourselves a bit better and more resiliently with reference to that anyway."
"Speaker 4","00;08;39;11","00;08;46;25","So that's the frizzle I'm interested in is the both the cause being upward and downward with regards to active inference. Thank you."
"Speaker 1","00;08;48;24","00;09;17;19","Cool. And connecting the micro and the macro, it's sort of sometimes it's laid out abstractly like multiple spatial scales that are nested within each other or time scales. But then when we talk about action and we have the example of sort of the person in a maze and you take a step back so that you can go around, that's the kind of settings where we might want to apply active inference where the initial action might be non-linear or away from the goal in a sense."
"Speaker 1","00;09;17;29","00;09;22;10","But it's part of a policy trajectory that actually gets you where you want to be."
"Speaker 4","00;09;23;00","00;09;44;14","So and the other the other part of it is with the Markov Blanket's being a Bayesian notion because of the base. Then you say, Oh, when does Bayes, when is Bayes effective? Well, that becomes a pretty broad application, right? Because I always say to people to get them in the space, I would say if you're in a dark forest with no flashlight, you don't run full speed ahead."
"Speaker 4","00;09;44;21","00;09;56;05","You stick out your hand in front of your face. Right. And that's basically active inference. As I say, you don't you know, you want to know what's in front of you before you run into a tree, right? So anyway, good stuff. Thank you."
"Speaker 1","00;09;59;14","00;10;01;27","Any other? Yep. Yellow and then anyone else?"
"Speaker 4","00;10;03;22","00;10;30;00","Yeah. So I think last week we ended the discussion on Shannon's point on what it means to have a folk folk psychological form of active inference. And I think it related to the tension between needing to have a very deep mathematical understanding of an increasingly developing field of math and applying this kind of more broad set of ideas to a particular kind of case."
"Speaker 4","00;10;30;00","00;10;49;23","So I thought this was a point to explore further and think about how this would look like. This is more in the folk psychological wave on something of inference, using the concepts, maybe without the nitty gritty details of mathematics Shannon Yeah."
"Speaker 2","00;10;50;27","00;11;35;03","I was hoping that we could bring that up today and maybe ask Joe's take and also sort of if we're if we're talking about something like a first in blanket and that's supposed to be a real occasion of a system or a Perl blanket, which is supposed to just be how we describe the system. Then maybe in this, you know, folk psychological notion of active inference or talking about how a phenomenon appears to this person in a crowd versus another person in a crowd where both phenomenons are real, but depending on which one you decide to model, you'll get a different picture of how the crowd dynamics are changing."
"Speaker 2","00;11;35;17","00;12;08;03","And we could model that mathematically, but just as easily, someone in the crowd could have an unformed notion of what it is that they're perceiving and how it seems that the Markov blanket however, they are emerging around the crowds in certain ways. And you could start having a discussion that maybe you can translate from the scientists doing the fancy math and the person in the crowd who's just existing Thanks."
"Speaker 1","00;12;08;04","00;12;11;22","Very interesting, Stephen, than anyone else."
"Speaker 3","00;12;13;26","00;12;43;13","Yeah, just building on that, I think I'm also curious because there seems to be this two sides. There seems to be this primordial soup which is referred to in the paper as well, and the variation of free energy and how that can self-organize. And then and that happens at smaller distances. And then these long distances where you've got expected free energy because the organism is seen into the environment with sensory information."
"Speaker 3","00;12;43;22","00;13;26;09","And often it's used in these partially observable, observable Markov decision processes for modeling that. And I was just curious if those two domains of modeling which seemed to come up and I know there's more, but those two seem to come up a lot in the the literature, how that pans out, maybe with some of these questions of, you know, is there an intuitive feeling of how the morphology is moving towards a target which could be that deeper sort of knowing of the body and then there's this kind of partially observable decision process, which is kind of cognitive sort of looking in the world and which ones and more or less like Marco and in some"
"Speaker 3","00;13;26;09","00;13;40;18","ways. And how does that affect how we try and play with them which is or model them or play with them, which I think Shannon was saying in a way is in a good way is exploring these ideas logically."
"Speaker 1","00;13;42;19","00;13;45;18","Thank you, Scott. And then anyone else."
"Speaker 4","00;13;47;02","00;14;22;10","The Stevens notion got me thinking about the notion of glass in glass. They frequently talk about first order, second order, third order, order. And so you have that amorphous material. It's semi amorphous, solid, right? So it's not really crystal and not really liquid. So it has these orders that are discernable through different framings of math and it made me think about, Stephen, when you were saying that cognitive glass in a sense that we have this orders of order, that we project on to disorder."
"Speaker 4","00;14;23;14","00;14;52;08","And so we those teleology ultimately roll up into things like sovereignty which is seen as perfect order in the abstract. Right. The sovereign does not need to ask for permission, therefore liveness because it is the quintessence, the fifth element, right? It is not earthly. So we have this metaphysics that happens at the bottom or top of the turtle sect, depending on which direction you're going and so I think that's kind of nice here."
"Speaker 4","00;14;53;02","00;15;22;29","Hey, Blue, I think that's kind of nice here. When we look at order and abstraction and the last point about it is that, you know, Kandinsky, the artist said that violent societies yield abstract art. And so one of the things I always wondered is, is abstraction, the reverse of violence. So if we look at sovereignty as being a total abstraction, as I just described, maybe sovereignty is also total violence."
"Speaker 4","00;15;22;29","00;15;53;02","And Mills said that the sovereign has the monopoly of legitimated violence. So anyway, those are few ideas about maybe we're looking at cognitive glass here with different orders of order that we can project out into the system and maybe that helps us when those when we talk about order as levels of abstraction, as you get further from the first and second order into the third and fourth order, maybe it's starts to be something that starts to yield a more projective or teleological element."
"Speaker 4","00;15;53;04","00;15;53;15","Thank you."
"Speaker 1","00;15;54;25","00;16;00;21","Thank you, Scott Dean. And then anyone else yeah."
"Speaker 5","00;16;02;09","00;16;30;08","So I wasn't part of the the tile formation last week. I was kind of in the background and then lost it. But I did go back and watch the the whole thing. And I'm hoping that Chris has a few more things to say today. About Construal, because that to me is kind of the the inflection point. And I he was starting to talk about some of those things and the separation between what did he have model and target?"
"Speaker 5","00;16;31;01","00;16;54;08","I think at the end of the day, if we were to give a lay person or some, I think the term folk has been used. I think if we give them a markup blanket and a Perl blanket, a lot of people will go, how does that change my basic question, which is how do I get the world? I think that's what all of us here are trying to do."
"Speaker 5","00;16;54;17","00;17;23;00","And I think for a lot of people who aren't even aware of what a markup like it is or free energy principle is, they still want that basic question answered. So I'm really interested to find out today how the paper moves us to a place where that becomes easier, that the obstacles to getting the answer to how do I get the world suddenly flattened and become, I don't know, more familiar."
"Speaker 1","00;17;25;07","00;17;45;11","Thanks, Steve. And a thought on the cognitive glass and what you just said there. So framing it in big terms about sense, making sense, making about the world as well. As about active inference is really helpful. And Scott, when you mentioned the cognitive glass, I thought about Oobleck. It might be called different things, different places, but it's cornstarch and water."
"Speaker 1","00;17;45;24","00;18;06;07","And so when you slap it really hard, it's like a resilient boundary and your hand comes away dry and it's like you're hitting a piece of concrete but then if you go very slowly, it kind of is like a liquid. So it's an amorphous solid like the glass. Now, the boundary between the air and the oobleck is something that is real about the world."
"Speaker 1","00;18;06;14","00;18;31;04","And so there's a distinction there, but it's almost like depending on how the boundary is crossed, not even like two different types of things, they're both touch, but it's actually the dynamics of the stimuli that dictate whether the response is going to be very stubborn and more like a solid or whether it will be very giving. And again, it's not like it's light versus sound."
"Speaker 1","00;18;31;04","00;18;51;14","Two different sensory inputs. This is different quantitative differences within one interface modality, and it just shows how even when there's a clear boundary in the world, we think like between two phases. Still, the behavior of the interface can be very dependent on the type of interaction. So Scott and then anyone else."
"Speaker 4","00;18;53;18","00;19;03;28","Made me think, is it Skinnerian all the way down? Or do you have myriad skinnerian vectors intersecting and we see that as complex."
"Speaker 1","00;19;07;04","00;19;08;27","Stephen then anyone else."
"Speaker 3","00;19;11;12","00;19;48;15","I think you could also see this question around class because class a certain way of freezing or becoming solid, it doesn't crystallize, it doesn't break up, it you can still see through it. So you've got this question of it being part of the medium through which information can pass because you can see through it. But there's also that question around that Goldilocks zone when if you want something to rearrange and be the material like happens in the primordial soup, Kristen talks about there's a, you know, too low a temperature, it sort of just becomes a solid too high a temperature."
"Speaker 3","00;19;48;15","00;20;02;28","It's going to dissipate and start to so you've you've got a bit of the overlap between, you know, internal external solids, liquid map territory. It's kind of interesting. Interesting."
"Speaker 1","00;20;04;03","00;20;14;00","Yes. Different phases of the mind for sense making too rigid or too fluid. So Joe, then Scott and then anyone else who'd like to speak."
"Speaker 4","00;20;15;13","00;20;17;18","Thanks. Yeah. So this this just made me think that quite."
"Speaker 6","00;20;17;18","00;20;41;14","Quite a few of these points for me at least come back to a kind of central thing. So so Shannon's question about folks, psychologists are very interested in kind of folk inference questions about teleology and questions about, you know, whether whether it's just something simple all the way down, which makes it look like it's complex to me. Makes me think that there's an important question here about the role of perspective and kind of viewing of these systems going on."
"Speaker 6","00;20;41;14","00;20;59;02","And, and the way I see it, a lot of a lot of the most highly logical things that we projects on to be systems and some even even like a boundary perhaps isn't really something we should take to be in the system. That is rather just something we're kind of modeling the system as having. So so it comes back to that target model question as well."
"Speaker 6","00;20;59;16","00;21;09;15","So just just a central question here of what we take to be really in the world and what we take to just be part of our understanding of the system of a world Cool."
"Speaker 1","00;21;09;24","00;21;12;03","Thank you, Scott. And then anyone else?"
"Speaker 4","00;21;13;08","00;21;41;11","I love the conversation because everyone is moving so nicely and easily and with such facility back and forth between the metaphysics and the physics and appropriately. And I don't mean I don't mean this is not a diminishment right, because that we're marking those edges. One of the things here that occurred to me in the last couple of notes is the notion of seed bristles because we are talking about phase changes in system behavior."
"Speaker 4","00;21;41;11","00;22;02;00","I think there's very often a threshold kind of trigger type of thing that happens and so that notion that Stephen was bringing up about phase seems interesting. And that was implicit in what you were saying about cornstarch as well. And so one of the things I think is interesting is what are those triggers look like and how are those encoded?"
"Speaker 4","00;22;02;18","00;22;28;04","And so you're talking about popular encoding versus of some biological encoding. So let's say I'm triggered into anger, but then that anger takes on the symbol of a certain person in a political party or whatever. Right. There's different stages of phase change that are happening there, of solidity that are being offered to that glass like structure of order that are being set up by those externalities."
"Speaker 4","00;22;28;15","00;22;44;22","And it seems like one of the things we just did a paper on misinformation with a group. And one of the things that's so interesting to me is it's not a single event misinformation. It's not a binary where, oh, I got misinformation. How did I how could I have prevented it? Like, you know, getting hit on the head with a stick."
"Speaker 4","00;22;45;09","00;23;15;22","There's so many levels at which you can address misinformation and intercede and intervene. And this feels like one of those exercises that perhaps we can start to identify interventions for information integrity by looking at where might we put in the seed crystals to put in phase changes and stages of that process to redirect it in ways that are more socially or productive or whatever the goal is of the group."
"Speaker 4","00;23;15;24","00;23;16;06","Thank you."
"Speaker 1","00;23;17;20","00;23;23;20","Thank you, Scott. Steven. And then anyone else yeah."
"Speaker 3","00;23;23;20","00;23;45;20","I think this discussion also points to an important consideration, bringing in the territory and the environment, because a lot of these phase changes in the world out there, but also maybe unlike, say, the enamel of our teeth, which is maybe like glass in a sort of what you'd call an equilibrium state. OK, it's a low energy state. It's just there, right?"
"Speaker 3","00;23;45;20","00;24;12;20","I don't expect it to keep moving that much, but we're talking about these non equilibrium steady states. So you've got these kind of micro states which things can revisit from which some are more probable, from which there's attractive states, which becomes these macro states, which then the organism at different scales is visiting. So this is interesting because there's both going on."
"Speaker 3","00;24;12;20","00;24;33;03","You know, I think sometimes everything's not equilibrium, steady state, but you know, I'm told in the computer here, it's pretty thermodynamic equilibrium the objects, you know, I'm in that world even if my body has a lot of non equilibrium dynamics going on. So that may be plays out in some of these questions."
"Speaker 1","00;24;35;03","00;25;18;25","Thanks, Steven. Yep. A lot of parallels, analogies, cross mapping between information and thermodynamics. And it's unsurprising, I guess, because there's a lot of groundwork there, but it really is a fruitful intersection. Maybe we can just remind ourselves of some of the questions that we had from last week and then we can just continue walking along so anyone just raise a hand so these were like loosely structured by topic, but we had big questions how much mathematics is required to understand or work with free energy principle and active inference, and just how shall we speak and work clearly on this issue?"
"Speaker 1","00;25;21;17","00;25;53;03","Then we had a few questions. On a philosophical side, we recalled the papers of Mel Andrews and in as if Alito and Thomas Venus, which were a footnote in this paper as sort of relevance contemporary work. So definitely on the philosophical side, I'm sure we could hear any thoughts about what next steps are on that line of research and this question of how to think about blankets for groups."
"Speaker 1","00;25;53;03","00;26;11;26","You know, if it's groups all the way down, then what's wrong with throwing blankets over groups? But what kind of blankets and what kind of groups? Also blue, if you want to introduce and give any thoughts, that's cool too. And of course, questions about what's real or not."
"Speaker 1","00;26;14;26","00;26;36;05","We had a few themes arising about again, about math and about how there is there's multi-directional dialog with active inference and other fields. So what happens when we cross over between different areas, Scott and then anyone else."
"Speaker 4","00;26;38;04","00;27;09;24","So I want to talk about Markov Lags for a second. And what I mean is the flag of Amsterdam with the three X's, my understanding is from a tour guide that the X stands for Fire, Plague and Flood and so if that let's assume that for a minute. And the idea was if you see that flag, you better follow the club rules on preventing fire, plague and floods, because that's what we do here in this area in Amsterdam."
"Speaker 4","00;27;10;02","00;27;35;07","OK, so to me, that is a Markov blanket, because what you're doing is you're saying, hey, we are projecting this out, come join the club. We are doing Bayesian analysis on how to prevent cholera and floods and fire in the city limits. And that's a the signal is there on top of every building that is has an owner who conforms to the rules."
"Speaker 4","00;27;36;09","00;28;07;13","And so I wondered if we can do a Markov blanket analysis on the Amsterdam flag as a Markov flag expressing and saying all ye who come here race like Diogenes looking for an honest man. I'm looking for plague preventing and flood preventing people here. So to me that's a projection out in in any other kind of active inference we're projecting out through a flag instead of sticking our hand out to search for a tree so that's active."
"Speaker 4","00;28;08;07","00;28;26;06","And then I'm doing regulatory enforcement, which seems to me to be a body that is responding to non conformity among its members. So could you comment on whether that's a possibility in terms of projection out of social elements of Markov? Like it's possible."
"Speaker 1","00;28;28;21","00;28;36;01","Any Amsterdam residents is welcome to respond, Shannon. And then anyone else who raises their head."
"Speaker 2","00;28;40;11","00;29;02;16","But yeah so now we're talking about something like cumulative cumulative culture in our evolution of signs and symbols and how we construct meaning in space. So maybe the flag if you don't know what it means, it's just the flag. You might not even know it's a flag. If you see it painted somewhere, it's just something that looks cool and has some shapes."
"Speaker 2","00;29;03;08","00;29;40;03","But if you have been raised or taken a tour, I guess in the culture, surrounded by the symbol, surrounded by the meaning, all of those small instances negotiate meaning. And like we talked about active semantic inference. I can't exactly remember what that conversation was last week, but this seems like it could be similar sort of adding meaning. And if a flag doesn't mean to the person you're interacting with, what you thought it would mean to them, you take action in your world to make it mean the thing to them that it means to you."
"Speaker 2","00;29;41;27","00;29;44;03","It's an interesting thread. I like that idea."
"Speaker 1","00;29;45;17","00;30;05;06","Also, one thought on the flag before we go to an Amsterdam resident is like a blanket. You think about under the blanket or inside the blanket. Like there's a person or a blanket goes on a bed. But a flag is also fabric and it's flying in the wind, and the borders it delineates are not on one side of the air versus the other side of the air."
"Speaker 1","00;30;05;13","00;30;26;25","But as the flag is animated by the niche through wins, otherwise it's just on the flagpole. It delineates a social barrier or a social demarcation which is in a culture in a in a inter subjectively negotiated experience, just like you brought up Shannon. So Yalla and then Steven all right."
"Speaker 4","00;30;27;02","00;30;56;29","Thanks this fascinating. I'm not sure I know the story yet from the three crosses I think have different origin but maybe this is in the tour guide so but I'm not quite sure I think this raises also points to to one of the questions Joe was raising in the beginning right which isn't insurance I suppose we can give his analysis of the flag of Amsterdam as a medical blanket and we can give an analysis of the origin of life in terms of marking blankets and lots of things in between."
"Speaker 4","00;30;56;29","00;31;23;25","Right. So what does this multi applicability of of Michael Blanket say? It could one it could point to a very deep soul similarity that runs through nature though of possible scales or or could mean that the toolbox is, is, is in a sense to course grains to to so that it applies to everything. But, but, but you can't really make the relevant differences in a sense."
"Speaker 4","00;31;23;25","00;31;51;08","You would like to think through what are the differences indeed through a kind of signs of group memberships in social situations versus more biological signs versus a kind of self-organized self-organization in physics. I think that that's that's kind of the tension between the kind of applicability to everything and how particular you would like your your theory to be thanks."
"Speaker 1","00;31;51;08","00;31;53;21","So Stephen then Scott than anyone else."
"Speaker 3","00;31;55;16","00;32;26;22","I mean, this is also brings that question. I think light was just mentioned there around where we put things in a mark of blanket where things are part of this external states, hidden states, internal states, because in some ways from the mark or blanket perspective, the sensory states of the epithelium, the kind of sensory organs is what's being stimulated and it's inferring an external state in the world, i.e. the flag."
"Speaker 3","00;32;28;06","00;33;05;06","And that's having an additional inference that the flag has got this mean in another level. So I'm not even sure what the whole thing called in some ways because is the blank, because the blank is dependent on connecting with external and internal, but it's normally just those that part of the of the whole active inference dynamic. So I think that that becomes interesting is where what type of sensory input information is within the blanket biologically."
"Speaker 3","00;33;05;23","00;33;16;11","And maybe that isn't quite the same as what is thought of when we start talking about it. And that might be good or may be a problem thanks."
"Speaker 1","00;33;16;11","00;33;19;11","So Scott then Chris than anyone else."
"Speaker 4","00;33;21;05","00;33;47;19","This is this is fantastic, this discussion. So I realized all of a sudden I thought, oh, wait a second. I just realized that some of these folks may actually be empiricists and may believe there is a testable reality out there. I didn't because I'm not that person. So I, I made a living rhetoric and a persuasive speech, right."
"Speaker 4","00;33;47;19","00;34;14;17","As a lawyer, right? So for me, it's all projection. So I realized I was, I was too diminishing of the question of whether there exists something out there to test. And I was looking and this whole thing to me, this has been a candy store since a few months ago where I learned about active inference because to me, it's all about avoiding avoidable harms among humans."
"Speaker 4","00;34;15;14","00;34;47;19","And to the extent that active inference is universally assertive all, then it has a rhetorical power that's huge, right? So we can get people thinking this surrounded by active inference blankets. And then I say, you know, you don't have an active inference blanket yet in the way you're doing business with other people in your supply chain, or you don't have active inference blanket yet in the way that you're interacting among nation states or you don't have active inference yet in your food insecurity, supply chain or your cybersecurity."
"Speaker 4","00;34;47;19","00;35;12;10","All these other things that I'm working on right now, contact raising the level. It's information systems where because they're not within the same model, then they have conflict. And those most of those are avoidable. Homes because they're just humans working out stuff that we were separated for a hundred thousand years when we migrated out of Africa. And now we're getting back together and trying to compare notes on what we came up with."
"Speaker 4","00;35;12;28","00;35;47;16","So the question or this assertion is that it's interesting to me, it's not that troubling a question of whether these exist or not. And, and I've read lots of philosophy and I think down the road there, but ultimately it's the, the I say yes and on the on the question of whether it exists or not, to me it's a provisional truth that's functional, sufficiently functional so I'm not no longer curious about whether it has an existence separate from the human mind."
"Speaker 4","00;35;48;01","00;36;16;16","So there so take my comments with a salt lick, not a grain of salt, but a giant block of salt, because I realize I'm an old, old person and I just don't care if it actually exists. Separately. And I'm not saying that to say this conversation doesn't matter. It's awesome, but it's that that the dynamics of rhetoric are such that we can employ the thing to do good, whether or not it's real."
"Speaker 1","00;36;18;22","00;36;30;27","So Scott has litigated realism versus instrumental ism. He's serving as the judge, jury and executioner lawyer. Chris, and then Joe then blew yeah."
"Speaker 4","00;36;30;27","00;37;02;09","Thanks a lot. So I think there's a like there's a there's a useful way to to think of the flag metaphor so to speak, and to bring it a little bit closer maybe to also what Scott was saying now and the paper itself. So the question that the paper is trying to answer. Right. Is kind of to what to what extent is the precedent blanket construct or the mark of blanket construct as used by a conventional thing?"
"Speaker 4","00;37;03;05","00;37;29;23","So, you know, there are different kind of like you you can have different views, of course, about the metaphysics of mathematics and so on and so forth. But generally, there's some agreed rules about how math works or certain branches of mathematics work and that's where the mark of blanket construct comes from, right? It comes from statistics. And there is a clearly defined way of using it."
"Speaker 4","00;37;29;23","00;38;16;00","So the convention for using the Mark of Blanka is very clear. It was introduced very clearly by the DFL in his article and later his book at the break of eighties and nineties. And there's no kind of mystery or, you know, there's no question about how it should be applied productively so whether or not you you think that science is after capturing the reality as it is, or whether you think science only gives us approximate truth or some kind of, you know, approximate models of what of, of what's out there, that, that doesn't matter what's really important for us I think and maybe the guys can also speak to that is that for Mark of"
"Speaker 4","00;38;16;01","00;38;41;23","Blanka that there is a clear convention for how to deploy them and it's very clear what they are doing and what they can give you. Whereas for the way Freston applied the notion first of all, he kind of softens the convention. The convention is less codified. We can think we can say it's less clear to what extent they apply, where and similarly it's less clear what you can get out of it."
"Speaker 4","00;38;41;23","00;39;14;15","Right. So this is the this is kind of the problem. So Steven, for example, mentioned something about, you know, boundaries and the fact that whenever there's an interaction, these mark of sorry, these blankets, let's leave the micro part of the name out of it. These blankets appear and they can be found there. And it's not entirely clear whether, according to precedent, there will be found at every in every place where we have an interaction between two systems, for example, or something like that."
"Speaker 4","00;39;14;15","00;39;53;03","Right. Because there are the rules in which they are applied are not as clear as as in the case of the original mark of blanket construct. And I just wanted to also to follow up on this very quickly. In the version of the paper that's under review now, we actually realized that perhaps in the draft you read, we were a little bit too harsh on Preston because he does impose certain rules about, for example, how to individuate different kinds of nodes but there's still a question of kind of what what that means to individuate these nodes in the certain way."
"Speaker 1","00;39;56;05","00;39;59;29","Thank you. That's a joke. Thanks, Joe. If you wanted than blue and Scott."
"Speaker 6","00;40;00;23","00;40;01;29","I'm fine. Fine, actually. Thanks."
"Speaker 1","00;40;02;21","00;40;04;11","Thank you. Blue and then Scott."
"Speaker 2","00;40;06;12","00;40;40;03","So without specifying Mark, a blanket or purple blanket or first first blanket I want to touch back on what yellow was saying about group memberships and also about what Shannon was saying about cumulative culture. So I think this is a really interesting notion of like a mark of a blanket or a blanket overlying a group and and the affordances and like what it means to be part of that group, like age specific affordances or socioeconomic specific affordances under a given blanket."
"Speaker 2","00;40;40;03","00;41;11;26","And how and when this like cultural or group membership prior gets instilled and also like do blankets then overlap like I'm of this race and of this age and of this you know, so, so these overlapping blankets, I just think it's a very interesting idea about group membership and cumulative culture. And we might know that we're part of this group, but we don't know all of the specific underlying back story about why we're treated this way or we're afforded these certain things."
"Speaker 2","00;41;11;26","00;41;14;06","I just think that's a very interesting way to think about it."
"Speaker 1","00;41;17;01","00;41;22;20","Thank you, Blue Scott. And then anyone else and also anyone who's watching live is welcome to ask us a question."
"Speaker 4","00;41;24;01","00;41;49;09","So it's so interesting. Couple of things blue and what you just said. So I do a lot of sewing and with the notion of quilting is really interesting in what you just said because there's actually a bunch of quilting museums that do ethnographies of quilts. And so it really comes back around. You had this quilt which reflects a person's history, like when they did the HIV quilt, it each square represented a person, right?"
"Speaker 4","00;41;49;09","00;42;06;11","So you actually have a physical membership instantiated in this blanket. And then the blanket being the symbol of the community being knit together. I mean, all of these it's probably not the thing you want to do in a quilt, but OK, the thing I was going to mention in response to Joe I think was Joe's comment before about the."
"Speaker 4","00;42;06;21","00;42;32;24","Oh, no, sorry. It was it was Christos about the application and the alteration from the paper. That notion they have this there's something that's running as a scientific or statistical concept and it's brought out in the world one of the things who, as I mentioned before, I work in an applied physics lab, the applied physics is really funny because you're applying physics."
"Speaker 4","00;42;33;00","00;42;55;21","So that seems like maybe it has something to say about what's going on here. And, and I realize, well, what you do in applied physics and what we do in our program and specifically in our program, we take technically feasible systems. So let's say that we could describe something is technically feasible. The Princeton notion is technically feasible, and you can apply it in scientific context."
"Speaker 4","00;42;57;04","00;43;24;26","But what I do in my program and what the lab does generally is we take the stuff and make it ready for adoption in the field. So specifically in my program, I take technically feasible systems and I test them, whether they're bolts, reasonable and bolts business operating legal, technical and social so if something is technically feasible, like the O'Brien Project, where they're going to use nuclear bombs to loft weighty objects into space, that's totally technically feasible."
"Speaker 4","00;43;25;05","00;43;54;21","But it would be unreasonable socially because you'd pollute the entire atmosphere with radioactive isotopes. Right? So it works in the lab. It's theoretically good. Terrific. So my notion is maybe what's going on here is the applied physics, the applied statistics. And when you get it out there in the field, it's can be seen. You can call them compromises or we can call them realities, or we can call them affordances, or we can call them Bayesian adjustments of scientific empirical views."
"Speaker 4","00;43;55;15","00;44;14;27","Right. Which when it gets out there in the reality, maybe the folk understanding is the reality of physics in the mind of the of humans. Maybe the mind exists in society and the brain's just an antenna tuned in to it. Anyway, just a couple of thoughts to play with."
"Speaker 1","00;44;16;00","00;44;19;08","Thanks, Scott. So Steven and then anyone else who has a question."
"Speaker 3","00;44;21;26","00;44;43;11","Yeah, I'd be interested. Christof, just further on what you said about what does it mean to individual a node in a particular way and this idea of nodes and I suppose at this larger scale I'm seeing with these partially observable Markov decision process is being used in some of the modeling. They don't necessary really, from what I understand, talk about nodes in that way."
"Speaker 3","00;44;43;24","00;45;08;09","But at the primordial soup kind of cellular level, they seem to often talk about nodes in that maybe in the similar way or not. But I'd just be curious what you think thoughts are about what it means to have a node, what kind of node that might be and what's similar or different between different ways that this is implemented yet?"
"Speaker 1","00;45;08;09","00;45;12;13","Go for it. Chris and I have figure two up or let me know if you want to go to a different figure."
"Speaker 4","00;45;13;20","00;45;47;11","Sure. Thanks a lot. I mean, those two that the last two comments and the question, Stephen, really matched nicely together, I think, because so, you know, I mean, you can we can talk about the variables, right? I mean, in a in a graphical model, variables are represented as nodes basically. So but what I of course, meant is the differentiation of the differentiation between active state and the passive or perceptual states in the inner states, yeah, exactly."
"Speaker 4","00;45;47;14","00;46;10;19","Well, you can also use the loop, but yeah, internal states, external states and these things. Right. So it seems to me that and I think I mean, not only to me, it's things to all of us that there is a certain degree of arbitrariness with regards to what is what I mean, at least in the draft you've read, it seemed like that to us."
"Speaker 4","00;46;10;20","00;46;42;28","We then learned that after really reading a lot of, for instance, papers very carefully, we actually kind of extracted the implicit rules for, for how to, how to, you know, label these variables as active or passive in a graphical model. But this is still a very arbitrary distinction one which is like the rules by which you individuated. So I used individuation here."
"Speaker 4","00;46;42;28","00;47;13;24","Maybe I shouldn't have used the word individuated the way you identify the role played by a given variable. That's what I should have said previously, is that the rules that that give you this identification are still very arbitrary and they are not actually anchored in anything very substantial. And this goes back to what Scott said about the feasibility and applicability, because, of course you can take this kind of way of partitioning a system."
"Speaker 4","00;47;14;06","00;47;50;15","You can build a robot with, you know, some kind of a system which will be built on the principles of the free energy principle. And for instance, the way of thinking about the graphical models. And it will be perfectly good at doing certain things that you build it for. The problem is that when you're building a system for a particular purpose as an engineer, you kind of hold all the cards, you make all the decisions, you decide like how to what to like what kind of active states will the robot need or something like that."
"Speaker 4","00;47;50;15","00;48;35;09","And that's very that's a very different perspective, so to speak, from the perspective of you know, let's call it what then it calls the evolutionary R&D department, right? So and evolution doesn't really plan things. Evolution just throws things that the wall and whatever sticks kind of stays and goes on to reproduce and all the other things kind of fall back and and in this sense, it's very it becomes very problematic when we think of like, for instance, grand project of explaining you know, life as we know it, for example, as in the paper from which we took this diagram that's on the screen now because it slowly becomes a little bit suspicious whether we can"
"Speaker 4","00;48;35;09","00;48;57;07","actually whether the way he labels these nodes and the kind of the rules for labeling the nodes will be the same on, for example, different levels of organization, stuff like that. Right. So so whether this will be applicable to many different biological systems in the way that he hopes it will be or not."
"Speaker 1","00;48;58;25","00;49;19;29","Thanks. And just to to clarify, you all wrote that spectrograph theory is used to identify the eight most densely coupled nodes which are defined as the internal states. So for those who think that given this soup of interacting particles, which are all the same kind, they're all following the same simple rules. Yeah. Eight densely coupled ones, OK, those are internal."
"Speaker 1","00;49;19;29","00;49;38;24","And then there's some downstream consequences with which nodes influence which nodes. But it's hard to argue that choosing the eight densely coupled nodes is simply, you know, true or internal when you can look at what it is and ask whether there's a different way to partition it. So Joe and then Scott and then anyone else."
"Speaker 6","00;49;40;06","00;49;54;17","Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Daniel. That's a very clear way of putting that point. So just to pick up again on something, Chris, Chris mentioned briefly, there is a further individuation problem, I think, which is about how to identify which which nodes you had in the first place or which which variables you have. And this is a kind of great question."
"Speaker 6","00;49;54;17","00;50;13;23","So so you can always look inside a node and split up and some other nodes or some other subparts and this might not be a problem just that active inference that this forum is going to be any, any, any kind of modeling system is going to have this kind of issue, but is going to make a difference to where whether boundaries are drawn and what kinds of what kinds of things you get."
"Speaker 6","00;50;13;23","00;50;23;23","So that's just to say that there's there's already a kind of human involvement in the model and just choosing what scale you pitch your head thanks."
"Speaker 1","00;50;23;23","00;50;28;07","Joe Scott, then Dean Heller and Stephen."
"Speaker 4","00;50;29;14","00;51;20;20","So in the notion, love it this is great. And that clarification about the nodes being assigned in a sense contextually in a given system state it seems like if we start to that may be a pathway to revealing the self other or starting to unpack some self other challenges. So maybe a node that is once characterize able as internal then characterize it as external is revealing something about the paradox of membership in groups that the in fact the it's not the node that changes but the sensation of whether it's self or other."
"Speaker 4","00;51;21;23","00;51;55;16","So you start to take that always paradox loses that Hofstadter stuff and everyone else who talks about when does a group become a another group form when does it have an internal voice, when does this be connected with all that stuff. And so maybe that analysis and that reassignment possibility starts to get into that. And maybe that also informs Blue's notion before but the group the again that I'm calling it now the Markov quilt as of that last conversation but that group identity blank it was patched together."
"Speaker 4","00;51;56;01","00;52;19;07","Maybe those things are like Erving Goffman and things like that or mirror neurons where you want something to be recruited by others as an internal state. You projected to them as an external state intrinsically and so the communication you're inviting others to encode their Markov blankets similar to yours in a sense, or something like that. So that is exciting."
"Speaker 4","00;52;19;07","00;52;33;06","To me. That slipperiness of assignment there feels like something that offers a pathway to analyzing those dynamics of group and individual identity. Thanks."
"Speaker 1","00;52;33;26","00;52;39;26","Thank you, Scott. So Dean Yallop and Stephen Amplify yeah."
"Speaker 5","00;52;41;01","00;53;15;21","So back to construal and the question of how do I get the work? I think a lot of the conversation today has centered on maybe a more clunkier expression, which is how do us get the world either us as flag conformists or us as red dots versus cyan dots so even Christian Stephen shared a video where he was talking to the Santa Fe Institute."
"Speaker 5","00;53;15;29","00;53;45;02","Even Princeton said that things get a lot more interesting when we get to the combinatorial level, and they're not the same as when we're talking about how do I get the world that there is? There is a difference when complexity arises. So can we hold up Pearl and Markoff blankets and get pasta or of this or that? Because we recognize that it's a little bit different when how do us get the world?"
"Speaker 5","00;53;45;05","00;53;50;01","That's a construal question. And so that's what I'm kind of curious about."
"Speaker 1","00;53;51;24","00;54;04;21","Then, Steve, really powerful and a big difference between how do us get the world? How do we get the world? How do I get the world? How do they get the world? These are like really markedly different questions. So yellow Stephen Blue."
"Speaker 4","00;54;07;27","00;54;40;07","So I was thinking we're getting back to Blue's question and Shannon's questions on membership, but maybe somebody else wants to as well. I just got talking on a group membership so I mean, to what extent one kind of market blanket formalism applies to two groups, I think is an interesting one. And I think that's one thing that's really met us here is, is really how you conceive of a group, right?"
"Speaker 4","00;54;40;07","00;55;06;07","Me committed like a group of people I mean, we are a group of people that spread out all over the world. A grouping like a group in the more narrow sounds like a flock of birds or a as you say, squirrel fish. I think so. And these are entities in the same kind of spatial temporal location that coordinate their their their behavior with one another."
"Speaker 4","00;55;06;07","00;55;23;20","And you can think of it as a predator arriving or so as a perturbation to that system as a whole. And so in a way, that entity is coordinating. It's, it's, it's, it's in that mix with with with the rest of the environment. You might actually think that this is a group that actually to which the active inference principles do apply."
"Speaker 4","00;55;24;03","00;55;55;09","And you might in that sense might think as well that the group as a whole somehow has as as a, as a, as a micro blanket I think it's that implicit analysis is more difficult to give. If you think about group memberships also can be the greater group memberships, right? I mean I think Blue was talking about it would belong to multiple groups at the same time and not actively acting on being part of that group."
"Speaker 4","00;55;55;09","00;56;19;19","But this is a kind of label that I that I would endorse when you ask me I think there the application of micro blankets is a lot more difficult than most metaphorical. So I just want to say so exactly how to understand groups. There is, is, is, is, is, is important. It's to understand kind of crowded admixture so that that might be more applicable."
"Speaker 4","00;56;19;19","00;56;34;22","And if you want to be really understood and social membership and greater membership and membership of different groups at the same time, then yeah I find I find it more difficult to understand how kind of the active inference framework can be applied to those kind of groups."
"Speaker 1","00;56;36;25","00;56;39;19","Thanks. So Stephen Blue Scott."
"Speaker 3","00;56;42;13","00;57;32;00","Yeah, I think so. Sticking with that group idea that the could be the idea of morphology and the amount of constraints and affordances in the, the whole environment body organism dynamic that's constraining and where maybe there's not that constraint. So I'm thinking, I know some of that she's trying to do some mark of blanket meditation processes and kind of thinking someone's meditating and starting to just sense the states in a maybe a way that slowly is like a cloud that self organizes in a way I could see a more plausible way where a sort of something like not obviously anything the same as this kind of mark of a blanket in a soup could be"
"Speaker 3","00;57;32;00","00;57;56;00","emergent. However, when you're in a, you know, a more real cognitive environment where you've got these priors and the only way we were able to access it anyway is through self-reported data, which would be a much higher level of dimensionality it may be is is only in some of the temporal processes that we can get some analogies like."
"Speaker 3","00;57;56;00","00;58;08;00","But I think that, yeah, it may be very different at different scales so the way that constraints play out, I'm wondering how we think about constraints and not having constraints."
"Speaker 1","00;58;09;26","00;58;23;26","Nice question, Stephen. Are the constraints tucked into this phrasing and that or where are the constraints and how does that shape how we model things across different scales? So blue and then Scott and then anyone else."
"Speaker 2","00;58;26;04","00;58;44;15","So hopefully I won't go on too long, but I want to touch back on what Steven just said and also what Yellow said. You know, when I think about how group membership goes into active inference, like how how can we relate these two things? I think about like specifically what is the likelihood that I'm going to take a ride on a yacht today?"
"Speaker 2","00;58;44;19","00;59;11;04","Right. So my socioeconomic status doesn't really afford me the opportunity to ride around in yachts very frequently. So I'd be very surprised. And I also live in the desert, so I'd be very surprised if if I was riding around on the yacht at 3:00 this afternoon like that would that just doesn't go into my models. So perhaps our group membership goes into, you know, construction of of the prior and our model in ways that are maybe layered, right?"
"Speaker 2","00;59;11;04","00;59;30;20","Like, you know, an onion maybe. And so then I want to touch back on what Scott said, because this is what really made me raise my hand about group alignment. And we were starting to talk with Kaspar Hess when he was on the stream about inferring the status of others. So I think this group alignment, I wonder about this a lot."
"Speaker 2","00;59;30;20","00;59;54;27","And specifically with respect to communication which we've talked about in relation to active inference and cooperation and, you know, building a collective intelligence. So when we think about, you know, whether the earth is flat or not. Right, like this at one time was like a hotly debated topic and maybe still is, but this is like there's been a convergence right?"
"Speaker 2","00;59;54;27","01;00;17;09","So we all now align or like most of the people in the world agree that the Earth is round. So I wonder about this time to convergence. And this has been used to measure the information transmission and can we similarly use it to estimate collective intelligence. So like when we there's a time to convergence for a swarm or this might also represent like a phase transition, right?"
"Speaker 2","01;00;17;09","01;00;40;27","So there's a time to convergence. And if it happens rapidly, like the idea is readily adopted that now the earth is round. So I wonder if these divergent views that we have as people in groups and divergent groups in a society that do they hinder our collective intelligence or do they like actually the systems? Because without having divergence, we could never actually come to the one true answer."
"Speaker 2","01;00;41;04","01;00;50;20","So it's that resistance that hampers the evolution of intelligence or is it I just something to think about thanks."
"Speaker 1","01;00;50;20","01;00;53;26","Blue Sky, if you're good. Gotcha."
"Speaker 4","01;00;53;27","01;00;54;05","Yep."
"Speaker 2","01;00;55;06","01;00;57;15","I just repeat the question you asked right there at the end."
"Speaker 1","01;00;58;18","01;00;58;25","Yeah."
"Speaker 2","01;00;59;06","01;01;28;07","So yeah. So I just wonder about our the divergent views that we hold in society about whether the earth is flat or round. Do does this divergence help or hinder our collective intelligence and the evolution of intelligence overall, or is it resisting adoption of a new view? Right. Like, so perhaps there's, there's resistance to change even when we see something is correct, like climate change, we can clearly see the effects of climate change."
"Speaker 2","01;01;28;11","01;01;44;13","But there's a huge resistance to changing. So is it this resistance that hinders our collective intelligence? Like what? Where is the evolution of our collective intelligence helped or hindered by divergence in views or resistance to adopting new views? Sorry, Islam."
"Speaker 1","01;01;45;07","01;01;47;08","Yeah. And you want to give a thought on that and then."
"Speaker 2","01;01;47;08","01;02;42;29","Scott Yeah. So if we were going to this would be like when our system is resisting, it's a non equilibrium steady state and like moving to a different steady state and I guess that's a question I don't like. I've been seeing pop up in a lot of the papers recently is how can you define not every system is going towards like a minimized free energy gradient or not every system is trying to maintain a stable state like systems dissipate and reemerge, anticipate and reemerge so I don't know is that is that a way to re ask that question but talk about something a bit more physical then then collective intelligence and I guess collective intelligence"
"Speaker 2","01;02;42;29","01;03;06;24","maybe is like collective agreement on a certain set of of ideas or norms or something rather than like intelligence like smarter than another person is what we're talking about here. So how does that system arrive on this steady state of what we think that the world is functioning?"
"Speaker 1","01;03;06;24","01;03;46;15","And there's the convergence on shared generative model, on shared mindset. But then it made me think of ants, colony relocation and over evolutionary time, colonies are shaped to appropriately relocate, but not instantly and not just choose the first, you know, first day coming back with exciting nest location. You can't go for the first one. So how to actually bear with the process of distributed computation or distributed intelligence knowing that it looks like disagreements at multiple levels, especially when it's not just as simple as ants relocating, but cultural values and beliefs and everything like that."
"Speaker 2","01;03;47;04","01;03;48;05","Can I jump in again about."
"Speaker 1","01;03;48;11","01;03;49;29","Yeah, yeah. Oh, yes, there was me."
"Speaker 2","01;03;50;21","01;04;09;01","Yeah, there was a new paper and I don't know who was, but I saw it on Twitter but it was about ants. They travel across a scaffold and it's either it's like flat and so they just walk or they tilt it. And so some of them start to fall down and they start to build the scaffold and then when they build the scaffold, ants can all walk over it."
"Speaker 2","01;04;09;01","01;04;30;06","So they're supporting each other. And I'm thinking I might be diverging from our markup topic here, but I'm thinking that collective intelligence is like as long as the world looks flat, as long as the world is easy for us to navigate, then we can all go about our day. We don't really need to try to converge with anybody."
"Speaker 2","01;04;30;16","01;04;59;29","But as soon as the world starts to be disrupted slightly so we turn that scaffold, folk start to fall off. Like then we need to build something, build a shared collective notion of reality and then then the convergence matters. And so that could be something like as soon as there's a perturb into the system, then it's useful to try to recognize boundaries or try to have some sort of intervention."
"Speaker 2","01;04;59;29","01;05;24;00","I think Scott was mentioning to have a boundary that's suitable and helpful and productive, and that could be where it's fine to diverge all you want as long as everything's simple. And then as soon as it gets complicated or we start to like have form for people, then we need to have a system that can result in some sort of convergence."
"Speaker 2","01;05;24;24","01;05;27;25","I'm happy for someone to bring it back on topic."
"Speaker 1","01;05;28;19","01;05;45;15","It's it's a great point, and I almost interpreted as how do we help those at the fringe who might be being harmed? How do we make that the stimuli and for realignment and for re scaffolding rather than keep on cutting off more and more of the failing parts of the bridge. They got to go. They got to go."
"Speaker 1","01;05;45;20","01;05;54;29","Well, now we have no one on the bridge. Instead of seeing that those on the fringe and can be part of the recovery. So Scott, Christoph and Stephen."
"Speaker 4","01;05;55;27","01;06;21;07","So Shannon, that was the right in the middle of the discussion. There's no right to bring back anything that was perfect. Though. Admiral Rogers, the former head of the NSA, once said, don't let any emergency or disaster go unexploited. And the idea is that the disaster is that situation. People act in a disaster. You know, Hurricane Sandy, whatever people you know, Starbucks, they were putting out power strips for people to share whatever."
"Speaker 4","01;06;21;07","01;06;57;13","Right. So it's exactly that. And the rhetoric, the projects, the projection rhetoric can cause a state, right. The anticipate ocean of a disaster when people are actually experiencing, they go, oh, my God, this might happen to me or neighborhood watch. Right. People kind of you know, they go in and they want to protect property and things. So I love that that point and bringing it with the other point before I think it was Christof that was asking maybe somebody else about, you know, that active inference in a group and does it dissipate in the activity or just member of a club and it's kind of lying dormant."
"Speaker 4","01;06;57;26","01;07;24;07","Is that really describable with active inference? And it occurs to me, you know, if you look at group dynamics, it may still be usefully described that way. And here's, here's how I would think of it. If I this is Irving Goffman stuff that I project myself out as I want to be perceived by others. So if I join a club, I may join a club because I want to be like I used to be part of an entomology listserv."
"Speaker 4","01;07;24;08","01;07;47;19","I've never been a this is not about gentlemen's cakes, but insects, you know, but I was part of a listserv back in the old listserv days, and it just was fascinating. I sort of wanted to be involved in it, right? So it's projecting myself out. I started making these connections and so so in a way, you can de-risk and leverage by being a member of a group even passively, right?"
"Speaker 4","01;07;47;19","01;08;08;29","I can. I'm extending out my feelers out there into the world by having that group membership and de-risking by having those a group available to me as me being a member. If it's a group that, you know, so I wonder if the dissipation of activity itself is an appropriate gauge of whether you're a member of a group or not."
"Speaker 4","01;08;09;13","01;08;33;16","Maybe in certain leverages and certain de-risking things, there's a functional engagement that's maybe more passive by the individual but still may stand for something in the overall goals of that entity. That's one point. Then one of the point is the deleveraging, the risk in groups I keep coming back to eukaryotes and eukaryotes. You know, we it's a better deal."
"Speaker 4","01;08;33;16","01;08;53;20","We got multi-cellular, we got a lot more options. We got mitochondria, we got chloroplast, we got all the good apparatus. Instead of having just these compartments where you kind of do stuff in a single celled organism, right? So it's a better deal. And so maybe part of this thing with the groups this goes back to Blue's notion is, is it are we resist?"
"Speaker 4","01;08;53;26","01;09;22;25","I think it was a blue invasion, but we resistant to fill it resisting or facilitating the group membership, what's going on here and the divergences and the differences. And I started thinking about thermodynamics first law. If you don't have if you have isothermal, you can't perform you cannot perform work. If everyone has equal information, markets don't have trading so there may be a benefit to not having two having divergence."
"Speaker 4","01;09;23;08","01;09;49;25","Right. And maybe in fact, the that reality is there isn't a facilitation or resistance. It just is. And that paradox is what we're is the reality we're seeing is that it doesn't facilitate anything. There's no goal orientation. Individuals may have goals, but that's a more bounded goal than the super system of biology. Anyway, just a couple of thoughts that are gleaned from that last bit."
"Speaker 4","01;09;50;06","01;09;53;05","And also just to remark once again, what a fantastic conversation."
"Speaker 1","01;09;54;06","01;10;00;27","Thanks, Scott. So Christophe then Steven and then anyone else yeah."
"Speaker 4","01;10;00;28","01;10;24;08","So I just wanted this. What did I want to say? I guess two things really. So one thing goes back to blues comment about like the fact that the fact that if you have some kind of a complex network, there will be multiple Markov Blanket's in there. So it's completely feasible to understand, you know, membership to certain groups or something like that."
"Speaker 4","01;10;24;08","01;10;50;05","There are some kind of relationship structures to be overlapping in different ways. So I think it's conducive to this, but I think that we should not like we're very focused now on this idea of blanket as, as a way of in the like of thinking about some kind of boundaries again between groups perhaps, or between different kind of units of organization."
"Speaker 4","01;10;51;01","01;10;52;03","And we're not."
"Speaker 3","01;10;52;23","01;10;54;07","Like it's, it's, it's."
"Speaker 4","01;10;54;13","01;11;21;05","It's always useful, I think, to kind of go back, zoom out a little and not think about the blankets because you have the blankets whenever you have some kind of a network of, of, you know, variables interconnected in some way. But what's really interesting is that in many cases, the behavior you will get from these systems, if you project them on to the social domain will be very surprising."
"Speaker 4","01;11;21;25","01;11;52;09","So one really surprising finding is something called the total money effect. It's with the double L, and it's basically a finding that shows that if you have Bayesian agents interacting in a network, if the network is fully connected, they won't actually come to a consensus about some true belief. So so imagine you have a network of fully connected network of Bayesian scientists, and they're testing two hypotheses, right?"
"Speaker 4","01;11;52;25","01;12;27;29","And they're testing these hypotheses. They're increasing their credence to them. The communicating their credence, as with each test to their neighbors. And what's really surprising is that the tone on the text shows us that these scientists will not actually converge to do a singular credence in the true outcome. What is also surprising is that less connected network will actually eventually converge to the two, the two kind of to all the members having a very high credence in the, you know, most likely outcome."
"Speaker 4","01;12;28;12","01;12;50;06","So this kind of I just wanted to kind of throw it out there because I think that it's, you know, we're thinking now intuitively about these blanket membership, the groups and stuff like that. But the kinds of interactions we might get from using this kind of formalism and projecting it through a social domain might be quite surprising. Right."
"Speaker 4","01;12;50;11","01;13;18;01","I'm not saying it will be used this because perhaps the domain effect to go also back to what has been said about the flat earth situation and, you know, the belief in the round the surface of the earth. The third one the fact actually tells us that in a hyperconnected society like the one we are living now, that it's even rational agents might fail to converge to the to the, you know, the the most likely hypothesis."
"Speaker 4","01;13;18;01","01;13;48;13","Right. And that actually is something interesting that it's in a way that's all one effect predicts the appearance of certain conspiracy theories in a hyperconnected society. Because given the demographics, for example, of flat Earth, I believe it has been declining for decades until the advent of Internet. So it only came to a sharp rise with the with with social net, with social media when people started to communicate in a much more interconnected way."
"Speaker 4","01;13;49;08","01;14;19;18","So I'm not saying that, you know, thinking about these systems in the social domain is bad. Now, I just wanted to bring the, let's say, anecdotal effect to to say that the kinds of behaviors we will see these systems converging or it might be very surprising. Right. Or we might they might not work exactly the way we think they do on like lower scales of organization."
"Speaker 1","01;14;21;13","01;14;25;07","Thanks for those points. So Stephen and then anyone else."
"Speaker 3","01;14;27;06","01;15;09;12","Yeah, that's some good points there actually. And I think this is where active inference and the mark, the fist and blanket has some advantages over the power blanket. If it's about what action it can, there's a risk. You see the information, you start to have this thing. It's all information driven rather than action policy driven because and by keeping it with the action policy for instance, one of the things about having us on the planet in the solar system which we used to have we're now we're now in a galaxy the Milky Way, blah, blah, blah is that people have this sense of, look, we must tend to look at ourselves from space now, which"
"Speaker 3","01;15;09;12","01;15;38;15","is really only it provides a lot of modern technological perspective. People might want to be able to stay grounded in some way. That may be actually a psychological challenge with having to take this outer space perspective of us on a little ball game around the sun. You know? So there could also be an action policy perspective here around Flat Earth, gives you a way to reground yourself because it's like, well, I'm going to flat Earth so I don't have to take that."
"Speaker 3","01;15;38;22","01;15;57;04","I'm not I don't have to go imagine myself in space looking at myself. So there's a lot of interesting aspects to the action policy side once you start to have this scaling and that that could be interesting to to to keep that in mind."
"Speaker 1","01;15;58;21","01;16;03;26","Thank you, Stephen, Joe and anyone else yeah."
"Speaker 6","01;16;03;26","01;16;22;00","Thanks. Just something you said, Stephen, when you say there's an advantage to the forest and blankets over polar blankets, do you mean an advantage for real systems? Making use of these things or an advantage for us as modelers? So this is something that I but I really worry about sometimes that we slip into thinking about the practical benefits for a system of of these constructs."
"Speaker 6","01;16;22;11","01;16;33;10","Whereas what we're really concerned with is the benefit it's more accurate. And in that context, both might be good tools, but when you use one tool of the other will depend on what you're trying to do with."
"Speaker 3","01;16;35;23","01;16;55;00","I would say more for how we look at it as a modeler, although the actual thing gets called a system and then has this kind of perspective or process. So I think it's good to keep it in mind so that action doesn't get lost and it doesn't purely start to become information yeah."
"Speaker 6","01;16;55;02","01;17;13;14","Great that that makes sense. And I wasn't necessarily accusing you of this error. Sometimes I do worry that people people get mixed up over who's getting the advantage I guess, you know, who's, who's benefiting here. But, but if you mean just that it's important to keep to keep action as part of the picture problem muddles that that's a fair point."
"Speaker 4","01;17;13;23","01;17;14;00","Yeah."
"Speaker 1","01;17;14;22","01;17;36;08","And and one contribution of this paper and we look forward to the revised and published version as well is like it's almost like if all we know is miracle blanket it's like, hey, hand me the screwdriver. Well, there's different shapes. There's different sizes. If you have the hacks, it's not going to work for the Phillips and different countries or different applications need different screwdrivers."
"Speaker 1","01;17;36;19","01;18;01;20","So now we can with these adjectives ahead of blanket, we can start to differentiate Hand me the Phillips screwdriver. OK, you're talking about the fist and blanket. You're talking about the purple blanket. And so we can be specific. Now, because it's almost like enough air was pumped into the Marika blanket metaphor. It was becoming too big of a tent, too big of a blanket."
"Speaker 1","01;18;02;04","01;18;27;19","And so now we can start to be really specific and and address those kinds of questions. When are we talking about utility for the system? When are we talking about utility for the modeler, which of course, maps very closely to the distinguishing in that you raised with inference, with an inference within a model. So, Scott, if I if Joe, if you want to give thought on that."
"Speaker 1","01;18;28;01","01;18;28;10","Yeah."
"Speaker 4","01;18;30;19","01;18;31;05","Kind of can."
"Speaker 6","01;18;31;05","01;18;47;03","I just I'm really so we're already pleased with the reception. This paper has had a particular memory active inference community. And just just for the reason you said that, I think one thing we were worried about, but people have seen is that there is meant to be this more positive message that these aren't necessarily bad tools. They're just different tools for different kinds of cases."
"Speaker 6","01;18;47;03","01;18;51;05","So I'm really glad that people have seen that and kind of taken that as a helpful message."
"Speaker 1","01;18;52;06","01;19;09;26","It's it's the yes. And approach to the literature. It's not blood sports. It's not knock down, drag out with citations. We can just build upon each other and come to more useful and good ways of communicating. So Scott and anyone else?"
"Speaker 4","01;19;10;09","01;19;38;00","Well, yeah, just two points. One, along those lines in law, one of the most effective strategies for Disambiguate something is saying what it isn't right. And so even if you don't know what it is, you can at least start to say what it isn't. And so that's a handy notion along the lines here and is the last couple of comments we're observing, we have this thing out there that was very exciting and we kind of everyone was playing with it and said, Oh, yeah."
"Speaker 4","01;19;38;00","01;19;59;14","And it's the same thing has happened in privacy. The word privacy is just carrying water for all sorts of anxieties. Right now, the word trust has all sorts of procedures. So the problem with language is we got a lot of subtlety and a lot of interactions. Interactions are increasing exponentially through exponential increase in interactions globally. Is an assertion that I make at least."
"Speaker 4","01;19;59;28","01;20;21;00","And if you think about that, we still have a vocabulary that's the same as it was way down the exponential curve of interaction increase. So how do we capture our subtleties in our interactions, right? How do we expand our vocabulary? That's exactly what we're talking about here, is we take words, we use them by analogy in other areas, right?"
"Speaker 4","01;20;21;02","01;20;35;02","We've already talked about blankets. Well, these aren't really blankets at all. And in fact, we get hijacked by the notion of bike, and we've already seen that starting to use those. Is it a blanket or is it a membrane? Well, is it semi permeable with a blank? It's not really semi permeable, you know, that kind of stuff. Right."
"Speaker 4","01;20;35;06","01;21;05;25","So it's fascinating. That we have this is the appropriate and very exciting challenge to have to the taking it and running with it early on and disambiguation. And it means that there's a lot of energy, which means there's a lot of need for whatever it is that's being served by the concept. And so what you're as modelers, this is gets kind of interesting kind of gets into Manhattan Project kind of optics and science."
"Speaker 4","01;21;05;25","01;21;49;19","Right because as model you do have a responsibility and you're discharging here by saying, hey, what does this mean for society? Should we develop nuclear energy unfed or with regard to whether it can be used as a weapon? Right. Because this is this is powerful stuff here. And so that raising of the notion and the questioning of whether it's appropriate to apply these things socially is going to come up very quickly as people do things like the rhetoric that I'm talking about to start to apply it politically and start to recruit biases using these concepts that will be seen as a nefarious application of a scientific and mathematical statistical concept and so your paper and"
"Speaker 4","01;21;49;19","01;22;11;14","the questions you're raising now are starting to lay that foundation of a pause and saying to people in the future, Hey, don't be so fast to run with this and just take a minute to think about the implication. What isn't this? Right? And so starting to ask that question can be as important and sometimes more important than what it is."
"Speaker 4","01;22;11;27","01;22;12;07","Thanks."
"Speaker 1","01;22;13;15","01;22;28;12","Thank you. There's a question from the chat Sean Kelly wrote. Are there special cases of Marco blankets that shield internal states? A Markov Shield. So would any of the authors like to just give a response to that?"
"Speaker 1","01;22;33;13","01;22;35;06","Yeah. Yeah. And then go ahead, Steve."
"Speaker 4","01;22;36;10","01;22;37;22","I think I can give it a try."
"Speaker 4","01;22;41;25","01;23;33;16","Of course, this really depends on what you mean by shielding. Right. And I think in the paper and also, I mean, in the paper, we use a statistical notion of shielding that is pretty much equivalent to conditional independence. So if you if you have three nodes and there's one intermediate node such that knowing the intermediate node will will mean that knowing the third node does not mean anything, doesn't give you anything for knowing your first node, then that's the notion of shielding in this, in the sense that the second kind of epistemic shields of the activity of the third nodes from whatever happened, the first note, this is the epistemic notion of epistemic and statistical"
"Speaker 4","01;23;33;16","01;23;55;11","notion of shielding and also that one, right? I mean, there's a lot of kind of more everyday kind of connotations of this not necessarily congruent with this physical notion, but if you mean this this whole notion, then yes, the very definition is remarkable. Is that the things inside of the blanket are given the Marco Blanket seal about from the rest of the world in its physical sense."
"Speaker 1","01;23;56;19","01;24;21;05","Thank you. That was what I was thinking. An insulation, like a heat insulator is shielding it. And so that is kind of what these nodes are doing statistically. And then we're nuancing what kinds of of categories these nodes might fit into. And that's a key difference between pearls phrasing. And for instance, phrasing is the extent to which nodes are classified into different kinds."
"Speaker 1","01;24;21;25","01;24;26;27","So, Stephen and then anyone else Yeah."
"Speaker 3","01;24;26;27","01;24;58;29","I think that question about how things and when we scale up is really important and in predictive processing, in the modeling, you know, you have this hierarchical model of things going up to higher levels And yeah, there could be this implicit suggestion that each of those steps or somewhere up there, it's going to other size blankets. But it may not be that blankets are needed as much to go another layer."
"Speaker 3","01;24;59;00","01;25;21;21","It might be that there is some sort of process structure that is doing the job at lower levels. It's a more active inference process. And if I could give one metaphor, there was a metaphor I'd put on about if there's a flag stuck in some mud and it looks quite stable, but it's blowin in the wind. Okay. And then I have another flag which is stuck in some mud."
"Speaker 3","01;25;21;21","01;25;52;27","It's actually the top of an ant hill. And underneath and so swarming to hold it still. So and it's actually a little bit more still, but actually the hole is more open. So in the first case, it's energetically thought thermodynamically more an equilibrium is being held in a in a one place. The second one, do you think it's in more of a thermodynamic equilibrium because it seems more firm, but actually there's a whole swarm of ants underneath trying to hold it in place."
"Speaker 3","01;25;52;27","01;26;16;23","And but none of them have got that intention. But looking from the outside, the system is holding the flag. But from the point of view, from the ends, they're trying to enact some sort of action policy. And I suppose I wonder if there's something similar between, you know, the system as seen from the outside as a state and the kind of swarm in this going on underneath and that the two can get mixed up sometimes."
"Speaker 1","01;26;18;12","01;26;45;26","Thanks, Stephen. Always a great challenge. An eternal question, what are the ants trying to do? But what you just pointed out there is, is really it's related to this distinction they draw with these four different cases the difference between a generative model, which is like the modelers perspective on something versus the generative process. And so those are two different generative processes that are giving rise to the movement of these two different clocks."
"Speaker 1","01;26;45;27","01;27;14;06","Let's say there's two different processes underlying it. Those are realist claims about what is giving rise And then there's all different kinds of perspectives that can be taken. But if we mix up two people's perspectives or if we mix up a generative model of generative process, it's a category error. And if we're coincidentally correct, it would be miraculous because it'd be a the wrong kind of thing that's being considered."
"Speaker 1","01;27;14;19","01;27;38;25","So it is extremely important to prevent that kind of misinterpretation by really asking, are we talking about the process, generative process or the generative model? And sometimes even just that distinguishing as well as this four fold classification raised here, these go a long way towards helping model. So Scott and then anyone else."
"Speaker 4","01;27;41;01","01;28;12;24","Since we have Europeans on the line, I'd like to talk about controversy and I want to display my ignorance of Kant and the categorical imperative. So I complain about the categorical imperative because I if can one person know enough have enough situational awareness so that their good act can translate into goodness in the world. And again, maybe that's total misinterpretation of Kant or maybe just got it all wrong."
"Speaker 4","01;28;13;19","01;28;48;28","But in the same way, I wonder about Markov Blanket and this notion of not large of an awareness so that because because that one of the problems we see in the world is even a good actor if they don't have good information, can do bad things like in the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. They put in Gujarat power plant, was funded by a UN based financing agency and the cost of $1,000,000,000 or whatever."
"Speaker 4","01;28;49;06","01;29;13;18","And they were crowing about the success of sustaining sustainable development goals of energy and development were being pursued and furthered. But what they didn't talk about and they then got sued in court over is the fact that the local fishermen and local population that was pollution. And so it poisoned the local waters and the local population with the pollution."
"Speaker 4","01;29;14;00","01;29;48;06","So they didn't do a sufficient analysis even in this situation where they're trying to improve the world and listing out all these goals of the world. That's their declaration. That's their Amsterdam flag of what they're trying to do with the U.N.. Right. So but nonetheless, they pursued one goal at the expense of other goals. And one of the things I'm interested in your thoughts, you can go into kind of this one and also correct me and my bed and non interpretation there, but can you comment a little bit on awareness and knowledge?"
"Speaker 4","01;29;48;28","01;30;17;17","We talked about group in individual Marco Blankets but can we talk a little bit about that notion about sharing of knowledge and situational awareness just as a survival strategy in the ants were surviving in the shadows tilting bridge example before, which was a survival thing in Stephen's flag projection. That was a little bit more the answer, a little bit smarter about their externality than that one."
"Speaker 4","01;30;17;26","01;30;34;17","Anyway, can you comment a little bit about how do we get how might these analyzes and these models and their implementations in reality and in the lab? Help us to understand the nature of group information flow. Thanks."
"Speaker 1","01;30;36;03","01;30;42;16","Thanks for the question. So if anyone has a thought yep. Yalla, go for it and then anyone else."
"Speaker 4","01;30;43;29","01;31;29;08","Great. I'll give it a try. I'm not sure if I can throw it all the way back to the categorical imperative, but that's let's give it a go so I think the first thing that the way I understand it's the kind of active inference framework is really a theory of learning for a particular kind of environments. So in the sense organisms start to learn to adapt to the specific niche, niche that they are, that they are engaged in, and then somehow slowly build up a particular model of that particular kind of need that you can of course, and that that model you can use also for hypothetical kind of situations or counterfactuals or new kind"
"Speaker 4","01;31;29;08","01;32;20;11","of situations. But there's no guarantee that these kind of previous history I mean, if you if you if you enter a new need or if the world changes, it's not guaranteed that your previous knowledge will be will be specific to the new situation. There will be people working in the new particular kind of situation. And so I guess there that indeed the kind of active inference framework gives you a perspective on a situated situation, specific knowledge, and not on the kind of categorical domain, general knowledge and so this doesn't guarantee indeed that if you use your use your model to make inferences about new situations, that that that you will end up on the right"
"Speaker 4","01;32;20;11","01;32;42;28","results. And so that gap between what will be your best action according to whatever kind of imperative you set for yourself in reality and how it works out, that's always a gap in the knowledge that you have, which indeed is related to the difference between the kind of the causal dynamic of the world, the process and the general model of the world that you have."
"Speaker 4","01;32;43;21","01;32;58;02","And so I guess that that that's in the why perhaps, I mean, speculating that that different kind of ethical frameworks might, might, might, might fit better in such a kind of approach rather than a the logical one."
"Speaker 1","01;33;01;11","01;33;03;10","That was very. Yeah, go ahead, Chris. Chris."
"Speaker 4","01;33;05;19","01;33;32;10","Yeah. I just wanted to follow up on this a little bit, because we the notion of the distinction between the generative model and the generative process was brought up before. And now you've alluded to it. And I think it's really important to keep in mind that the free energy principle, sort of the general, maybe the generative process, right, is supposed to be the process or the causal process that produces certain sensations in an organism."
"Speaker 4","01;33;32;28","01;34;00;09","And then the generative model is supposed to be on this framework producing predictions. Right? Which which kind of explain away in the Bayesian sense, the defensive actions that the model is that the organism is experiencing. And the idea that's implicit in a lot of the literature is that, you know, you have the generative process on this side, you have the generative model that's trying to mirror the generative process."
"Speaker 4","01;34;00;22","01;34;37;01","There is the sensory sheath in the middle. And that these two, these two things will somehow hold on to each other and they will be just perfect. There will be some kind of a perfect resemblance or mapping between them and that's not entirely it's not entirely clear that this is the most successful, evolutionarily successful strategy. So the generative model only needs to recapitulate the generative process to the extent that it's successful for in a given ecological niche or even social niche, to ensure the survival and reproduction of the organism."
"Speaker 4","01;34;37;01","01;35;16;05","Right. And so so that's one thing that's I think, important to remember about this, that that, you know, the free energy principle from the get go kind of does not necessarily produce agents that are perfectly that will be always optimally informed about what's going on in their surroundings. They just kind of really they they learn just enough to stay alive And of course, the inclusion of active interest gives them an advantage over traditional Bayesian agents because they can also go and try things out and learn in this way."
"Speaker 4","01;35;17;00","01;36;01;25","But it still doesn't give them take us all the way, so to speak, to, to, to, to to kind of transcend our model and get to know the process that that that's out there in the world. And I think this is also true in the social domain in many ways. So so in the social domain, I think it's very plausible that the same thing happens and we could expect that the same thing will happen for I know groups for example, where where groups will form certain models about how society operates or how the world is, which will be optimal to their given epistemic situation and their given social situation, but will not be objective models"
"Speaker 4","01;36;01;25","01;36;04;27","of how the how society or the world operates."
"Speaker 1","01;36;06;11","01;36;33;26","Thanks. And what you just said there at the end about the cultural ways of viewing the world it's known that many cultures, their own name for their own country or homeland, might be like, this is the middle spot, or this is like the main place it makes sense. And it's it's unsurprising that it's that way. But then just like Scott said, we're all comparing notes that's the phase of our test that we're in."
"Speaker 1","01;36;34;09","01;37;01;03","And two people are mapping to a different territory with the same relative egocentric map. And so this question about how different egocentric perspectives and at which level those egocentric perspectives exist, at how those come into harmony is really an interesting question. So, Stephen, and then anyone else who'd like to speak and yeah, this is awesome times. It's been a great discussion."
"Speaker 1","01;37;01;03","01;37;03;23","We have 20 minutes or however much more people would like."
"Speaker 3","01;37;05;20","01;37;39;14","You know, just like. So I really thought that was a really interesting point there about when other approaches are maybe better than taking an ontological approach. And I suppose I think and you spoke about the epistemological approach, I suppose you get into this question of whether it's a more fuzzy. I'm interested in your thoughts on like fuzzy logic and the more fuzzy based epistemology rather than maybe the type of logical categorization of knowledge which ends up becoming ontologically at some point, and that there is this idea of ontological pluralism."
"Speaker 3","01;37;39;21","01;38;01;15","They're sort of their way around this, you know, a third wave, the third wave in active consciousness has that this idea that the mark of blankets, because it breathes with different regimes of attention, you sort of trying to get around that problem. But there is it doesn't necessarily say how they do that. So I'll just be curious. Yeah."
"Speaker 3","01;38;01;15","01;38;18;18","A bit more. And and the other thing, if it's tied in with other areas, is like, for instance, they they're talking about aspect now a lot an aspect is this kind of integration which then ties in in qualitative research where you have axial energy which is kind of the know me, this thing which is sort of down there in art space methods."
"Speaker 3","01;38;18;18","01;38;24;28","But you know, the one where it's about how people feel about things. Well now that starts to become part."
"Speaker 4","01;38;24;28","01;38;25;15","Of."
"Speaker 3","01;38;26;05","01;38;44;05","A lot of what we're understanding about the world. So it could actually have quite an implication for participatory interactive kind of research methods and making them much more central in a way. So I wonder if any of your thoughts on that about about that from the authors."
"Speaker 1","01;38;46;09","01;38;54;12","Thanks, Steven. If anyone has any thoughts on that or can raise their hand, yalla, go for it."
"Speaker 4","01;38;58;06","01;39;25;27","I mean, so so I guess what we do in a paper is a little bit before that that step, right? So on the question of ontology as it is versus epistemology, if you could go for a kind of ontological pluralism or not, I think what we try to say is that, look, here's a is a class of models that are typically used in the literature as abstractions from a target phenomenon."
"Speaker 4","01;39;25;27","01;40;10;04","Right. And so if you want to if you want to understand those in the kind of on the logical terms said that's that's fine, but you need to give it a story about how how that abstraction relates to the target phenomenon that is that that is there. So either if you go into metaphysics, you go for my kind of more blatant kind of route and you say, well, actually this mathematical model is not an abstraction from the target system, but it actually nature at its joints is somehow mathematically structured or you just say, look, no, these are these are indeed abstractions produced by us and they're useful in predicting and interpreting the world, but they're"
"Speaker 4","01;40;10;04","01;40;46;00","not themselves that the world. So in a sense, we kind of offer the kind of dilemma to anyone who wants to make a commitment, the word choice there between epistemology or ontology or ontological pluralism, saying like, look, you can go the ideological route. And of course, this is a way more challenging, interesting. Kind of exciting route. But then you either need to buy this this bullets that that these models are not really abstractions, but somehow on the reality or need to give some some other sort of story about how that's how this works."
"Speaker 4","01;40;46;15","01;41;09;19","And I mean, I'm I think personally, I'm curious to see what what what what what response from some the community will be which of those options people will take. But I mean, I don't think either of us is necessarily committed to one of those those which are not, but just saying, OK, look, if you want to do it, then these are these are the rules kind of so to say, I mean, maybe disagree with the rules, that's fine as well."
"Speaker 4","01;41;09;19","01;41;15;09","But then give it give an argument for it that thanks."
"Speaker 1","01;41;15;09","01;41;23;16","Very interesting stuff. Anyone else have any thoughts? Yeah, Stephen. And then anyone else go for it."
"Speaker 3","01;41;24;28","01;42;07;22","Yeah, I agree a lot with what you're saying there. I think there's there are some gaps in and rather than saying there's a gap sometimes that's just filled with the mark of blanket, if that makes sense. If in doubt, fill it with the mark of blanket. And I've been really curious. I'm actually looking a lot in terms of how organisms structure like the idea of very personal space and, and spatial inactive ecological approaches and the way that maybe there is a way that that space is actually and there's a field called mental space psychology which has been a very fringe field actually, a lot of it based in Holland."
"Speaker 3","01;42;07;22","01;42;40;06","And that is it seems more plausible now with this. So it was a much more practice based approach, but I thought I'd share that anyway because I'm presenting something this Friday. So but I do think there is something missing in terms of mechanisms that extend out beyond the body into the space. And it may not have to be all levels, persons, blankets in, in the traditional sense."
"Speaker 1","01;42;43;04","01;42;44;26","Shannon and then anyone else."
"Speaker 2","01;42;47;17","01;43;18;17","I'm going to talk about brains. So I know we've been extending, you know, into the world and into the body, into the body and everything. And we've been talking a lot about group dynamics and maybe how groups behave or how we feel like part of a different group and earlier we super briefly touched on mirror neurons. So is are neurons that fire when I observe an action the same as when I do an action?"
"Speaker 2","01;43;19;26","01;43;48;26","And there's been a lot of work lately, not necessarily on their neurons but on inter brain synergies or you might call them into brain coherence or across brain coherence where lots of dynamics in my brain are firing, very similar to lots of dynamics in your brain. And this could be because they can work from high sun on their cinematics."
"Speaker 2","01;43;49;06","01;44;18;21","This could be because we're watching a film and it's evoking similar responses as we're all attending to the same stimulus. But the film that we're watching, it could have a structure where the filmmaker sort of designs what you pay attention to. And so most people's gazes will fall in that direction. You'll have even more similar sort of Interbrand coherence or unstructured, where you're just sort of filming a scene."
"Speaker 2","01;44;18;21","01;44;45;03","And there's maybe some people over here, it's people over there, and your gazes will could differ a little bit more. The structures can differ a little more and this is all to say how like the film is the environment in this case and if we're talking about the rest of the world being environment, we're like us in this room being the environment."
"Speaker 2","01;44;45;27","01;45;20;24","Our gaze is structured in a certain way by there's a blue box on my screen. So it's sort of directing everyone's attention at my face. But there's also some lack of structure. I don't know that we're seeing the same tiles in every space and there's different ways that if we interacted, like if I interacted with one of you a lot in my daily life, like maybe Steve and I hang out and get coffee every day and we talk about something every single day."
"Speaker 2","01;45;21;16","01;45;49;02","So we have a propensity to pay attention to similar things in similar ways. And we've been specifically talking about Yellow's idea and how much we agree or disagree with it or something. So we are continually drawing our gaze to look to see if he understands or agrees with what we're saying. Like there might be this similar inter brain coherence between Stephen and I that's different between me and Blue because Blue and I never talk."
"Speaker 2","01;45;49;02","01;46;24;20","We're not even friends. These are all hypothetical, by the way. And these so a question. It's not in your paper necessarily, but like if we're looking for markup blankets in the world, one thing that we could look at is something like a Interbrand coherence, and that might be something real in the world, or it might be a purple blanket, something that we use to describe how people interpret something the same or how their brain activities are synergistic in a certain way."
"Speaker 2","01;46;26;08","01;47;08;18","And if you can be empirical, I know we were being rhetorical a lot of times, but if you can be empirical and look at these signatures of either you you know, conversation dynamics or brain dynamics and can relate them to how the world is structuring them, and that's the way that you can look for. You can still keep looking for markup blankets in the world or find it useful and it's definitely, I think what we keep coming back to when we're talking about these blankets as a metaphor or this blanket to something real is that we can totally have both as long as we're specific about which one we're going to."
"Speaker 1","01;47;10;22","01;47;17;08","Thank you, Shannon. Yeah. And then anyone else thank you."
"Speaker 4","01;47;17;08","01;47;52;00","And that's really interesting. And I think that there's that there's a couple of things there, right? I mean, and you need in one sense, it's two people have the same same background, same experiences. All right? They might pass a particular kind of movie or scene in a similar kind of way such that if you put them in a room separate from each other, you will indeed see a similar kind of natural than that make a going on in both both cases maybe tight indeed to attention, where you pay attention, you gaze, et cetera."
"Speaker 4","01;47;52;24","01;48;24;23","And the other one is indeed kind of on site kind of interpersonal synchronization that might be happening. Right. And then though, there's this kind of it's kind of second person neuroscience kind of approaches that that that the try to capture those kind of things in the experimental setting and see how in what particular kind of settings brainwave synchronize and et cetera, and it's kind of second perspective reminds me a lot of of the kind of discussion that's there in the conference on generalized synchronization."
"Speaker 4","01;48;24;28","01;48;58;13","So these are the kind of examples that you get when is this 22 couple of standing on a table and then synchronize after after a while. So this is a very simple causal mechanism causal structure where it where synchronization this occurs over, over, over time and and when I first started thinking about Markov blankets, I use that kind of example as a kind of reduction of sort of saying like, look, if, if these things even have a micro blanket, right, then it's an empty, empty notion."
"Speaker 4","01;48;58;13","01;49;24;18","Now, having worked with these with these philosophies of science here, I think I think need to be a bit more more specific and say, look at whether this thing has or has not a micro blanket that that that's that that's a different question. But there is a point that there is a very simple structure of kind of causal dependance and also independence, such as if you would fix the table perfectly, the things would not synchronize."
"Speaker 4","01;49;24;29","01;49;48;14","And if you would let it slide a little bit and wobble a little bit, then they would do synchronize. So there is this kind of thing like this intermediate factor that mediates a causal relationship between those those two things. Now, the question is, is that do you need to have a micro blanket for this? Does Mark do Mark blankets add anything there or is it kind of the story about kind of causal dependent causal independence?"
"Speaker 4","01;49;49;09","01;50;12;26","Eh, enough? I think that well, causal dependance there and causal independent, such as if I would do this, then there would be no synchronization. I think that's enough. And then whether you call that's a kind of Michael Blanket, it's a second kind of question. You need to translate it back to the kind of world of causal models and see how they relate to that."
"Speaker 4","01;50;14;05","01;50;27;16","But I think there's yeah, there's a clear case to be made that this is parallel between the kind of cases you're describing and the kind of synchronization settings that are there in this kind of cuckoo clock example thanks."
"Speaker 1","01;50;27;16","01;50;52;28","And one interesting aspect to kind of bring it back to this discussion about the Internet, you know, what kind of beliefs propagate culturally on what kind of connectivity just like Shannon was saying with the video chat and with the live stream, what somebody sees, it's not just like they're sitting in a different chair at the theater and they're watching the same play or they're in separate movies, you know, rooms watching the same movie."
"Speaker 1","01;50;52;28","01;51;22;21","And so cultural cues might lead somebody to look into a correlated position as another person. But when there's the customization, it's like each person is in their own theater, which takes it to another level because it goes even. It's actually different inputs, and the inputs can be targeted in interesting or new ways. So it's kind of stretching the limits of our social cognition because it's not just a bunch of people asking what they just saw with a shared event."
"Speaker 1","01;51;23;04","01;52;09;12","It's like trying to come to a shared understanding when people are seeing different events. So yeah, there's some new fun things we're learning on the Internet, I guess. Well, in the last couple of minutes, if anyone has some thoughts, I'd be curious to the authors or non authors, where do we go from 20.2? Where's our momentum or direction or curiosity one thing I'll bring up while someone is raising their hand is without buzzing in the middle of a conversation, how can we be really clear when we're intentionally or unintentionally slipping?"
"Speaker 1","01;52;09;12","01;52;45;17","The difference between a marker for Perl first in Blanket and generative model generative process with a model within a model, we don't want to police subtleties of language, but at the same time, somebody can really build a bridge that leads someone to nowhere if they're unintentionally not sure the difference between these concepts. So just curious how do we promote rigorous and accessible norms around talking about these ideas, recognizing that we're all like totally learning this and and formalizing the project around us?"
"Speaker 1","01;52;46;03","01;52;47;12","Yeah. And then anyone else."
"Speaker 4","01;52;49;22","01;53;11;03","And just a small note in the document exactly who mentioned this. But at some point we talked about kind of two faces of research, right? And one is kind of taking an idea and running along. Wishing it along is as far as you can. And then there is a new kind of phase where like, OK, now we ended up in a completely new, new place."
"Speaker 4","01;53;12;07","01;53;46;21","How are we going to kind of substantiate is how can I make and formalize these little bits? And I think this is the kind of the I guess over the last few years active inference house lots of you back to being friends has kind of been just and also also in my own earlier papers kind of running as far as possible see how far we could get this and see what would happen is a kind of creative kind of in the startup stage of of research and the thing both in this paper and in a number of other papers that are currently kind of coming out I think this kind of more kind of control"
"Speaker 4","01;53;46;21","01;54;17;25","of their fate. Consider the three phases is happening where we're like, OK, but this is where we ended up. Does it really make sense do we need to make some more fine grained demarcations to to do we need to tweak the conceptual operators to, to, to have it all make sense and it's a different kind of work. But I think that that's that's that's really important then to kind of for the next kind of face for, for, for active inference research so I hope these kind of discussions can contribute to, to doing that kind of work."
"Speaker 1","01;54;19;00","01;54;57;00","We're consolidating Bitcoin to the key $20,000 level you know, let it rest before the next yeah. Whatever metaphor works for people but any other thoughts because that's very nice the other thanks everyone for sharing. This was an awesome sequence and it really helped take our, our lab and our discussion to another level. We would always welcome any of you to come back to continue the conversation, come for a guest stream, come as a visitor to be on any conversation you'd like."
"Speaker 1","01;54;57;08","01;55;02;07","So thanks again to everyone and for listening. Peace."
