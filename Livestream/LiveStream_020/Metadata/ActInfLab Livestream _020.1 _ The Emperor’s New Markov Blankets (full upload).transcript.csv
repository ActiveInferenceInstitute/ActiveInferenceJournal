"Speaker 1","00;00;09;00","00;00;38;27","Hello and welcome to Active Lab. This is the active inference live stream number 20.1 on April 20th. 2021 so a lot of repeating digits and I'm looking forward to this conversation with all of you. So thanks for joining welcome to the Active Inference Lab, everyone. We're a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at the links that are on this slide."
"Speaker 1","00;00;39;21","00;01;11;05","This is a recorded and an archived live stream. So please provide us with feedback so that we can improve our work all backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here, and we'll be following good video etiquette for live streams like muting when we're not talking and raising our hands so we can hear from everyone on the stack hello. Greetings. Today in number 20.1, we're in the first of two discussions that we're going to be having as a group regarding this paper, The Emperor's New Marker Blankets."
"Speaker 1","00;01;11;18","00;01;40;05","And so the goal of these discussions is to learn, discuss, be curious and find out how we got here and where we're going and why we're doing that. And we're just going to be having a nice conversation with the authors, which are we're just really appreciative that they've joined. So we're going to just go to the introductions and warm up and then we will just be able to jump around and see where the conversation takes us so I'm Daniel and I'm in California."
"Speaker 1","00;01;40;17","00;01;41;28","I will pass it to Shannon."
"Speaker 2","00;01;46;03","00;01;54;14","Hey, I'm Shannon. I'm usually in California, but I'm in South Dakota. Since the pandemic, are we going straight into our questions or just names? And around the room?"
"Speaker 1","00;01;54;14","00;01;56;22","You can say hello or give a warm up thought."
"Speaker 2","00;01;57;22","00;02;27;15","OK, yeah. So I'm excited today. I am excited to explore whether or not we can use Markov blankets to describe groups of people and social dynamics and I tried to do this in a project before and abandon it pretty quickly. And reading this paper, I think if I had taken the Perl blanket formulation, which I'm sure we'll get into talking about later, it would have been a lot more helpful."
"Speaker 2","00;02;27;15","00;02;29;12","So I'm excited to discuss that today."
"Speaker 2","00;02;31;15","00;02;32;18","I'll pass that to Steven."
"Speaker 3","00;02;37;08","00;03;04;21","Hello, Stephen. Stephen, here I am in Toronto and it's nice to be here and thanks a lot for this paper because I think it's going be really interesting to have all these bits of the jigsaw put together. And I'm actually quite interested in the paper because I'm trying to work out when to use the concepts of light, the micro blanket to help describe processes and when just to maybe talk about hidden states and not focus so much on the, the blanket part."
"Speaker 3","00;03;04;21","00;03;13;25","So that's quite useful for me. And I will pass it over to Dave and Dave."
"Speaker 2","00;03;13;25","00;03;35;27","I'm in Baguio Cirillo, 120 miles north of Manila. It's the blazing summer time. We're a mile high city, so it might get as high as eight degrees Fahrenheit. I'm retired from information technology and my background is in the cybernetics of learning and teaching great."
"Speaker 1","00;03;36;07","00;03;46;25","And we have two authors here, so maybe first we'll go to Chris and then Yellow and just feel free to introduce yourself the project, the collaboration, however you'd like."
"Speaker 4","00;03;48;21","00;04;28;24","Thank you. So thanks a lot for inviting us. I'm Crystal LÃ©ger. I'm currently a postdoc at the Royal University in Bochum, Germany. I'm joining from Berlin, though, and I'm currently working on research grants on Bayesian cognition and and the conspiracy theories. I'm specifically interested in how you proponents of conspiracy theories discount new evidence that contradict their beliefs. And this paper from my perspective, grew out of a really long, I guess, friendship."
"Speaker 4","00;04;28;27","00;04;58;24","We all we can say that we've met a long time ago at a conference in the Netherlands in 2014 I believe on Bayesian cognition and we were both fascinated by this new theory framework of predictive processing. And I remember that already there there was a seed of some kind of doubt in me or kind of a worry planted because it was it was a conference on probabilistic approaches to cognition."
"Speaker 4","00;04;59;02","00;05;20;07","Everyone there was supposed to be a Bayesian in one way or another and suddenly it turned out that basically no one agrees with each other and everyone uses the terms in a different way. And I feel like this paper is in a way contextualizing that experience for us. But yeah, sorry I let you speak now."
"Speaker 4","00;05;22;14","00;06;08;29","OK, great. So I'm kind of Beth, I work at Macquarie University in Sydney, but then also due to pandemic reasons, located in Amsterdam, the Netherlands and so my, my new research project is on the philosophical foundations of the attention economy. But my piece was really in, in the on the quality principle and then for the commission and indeed this this paper grew out of a group of people who are or who are colleagues and friends and acquainted with each other's work all roughly on and on predictive processing and three energy principle and active inference, but from slightly different directions."
"Speaker 4","00;06;10;09","00;06;32;17","And I think it was sparked by a kind of combination of if I say kind of curiosity and skepticism about some of the developments that were that were happening and have been happening already since long time, since since 20, 13 or 14 when some of these papers originally came out and kind of slowly got taken up more and more have the philosophical projects."
"Speaker 4","00;06;32;21","00;06;55;00","And I think the more and more we read those papers, the more and more we grew interested and skeptical at the same time. And this was really a project to try to finally kind of nail down what what was bugging us and perhaps how it might be salvaged or what to do. And so I'm happy this is now reprinted."
"Speaker 4","00;06;55;00","00;07;17;06","I'm very happy we get to discuss this. I was this morning doing dishes and then my head to go and listening to your exposition of my paper. And that was just a very creative, mind blowing experience where somebody explicate those ideas and that being one of the authors. So I think that's the sum of all of us that that's that's just fantastic to to have happen."
"Speaker 4","00;07;17;26","00;07;28;03","I think actually there is a further alter at latent there. So I'll try to pass on the baton to Anibal and see if there's does anything of response the other way through this continue?"
"Speaker 5","00;07;29;02","00;08;00;17","Well, hello, everyone. I'm just here trying to look around for a little bit. It's in 11 p.m. in Tokyo where I am right now. So yeah, I tried to stay along for a bit. Yeah. Really. I'll leave the other two guys who are much fresher than me right now to, to lead the discussion. As for me, I have more of a background, I guess in computer science, some math here and there."
"Speaker 5","00;08;00;17","00;08;37;21","Now I'm doing some work on control theory and estimation theory apply to neuroscience and also methods probably right now. And which is the main reason I guess I started working on active inference and related ideas and yet as the other two guys I've already said, you know, this paper was kind of born out of our own curiosity and you know, questions regarding like what the framework actually does and what it can do and what it cannot do."
"Speaker 5","00;08;38;15","00;08;46;04","So, you know, then I'll leave you to lead the discussion from here on awesome."
"Speaker 1","00;08;46;04","00;09;06;26","Thanks, everyone, for joining. It's great to have just the authors and kind of read between the citations and then actually in live in between the citations so that we can ask questions that were maybe alluded to and hear your fresh perspectives, what kind of feedback you've gotten on the paper, et cetera. So yeah, yellow, where would you like to start otherwise?"
"Speaker 1","00;09;06;26","00;09;08;19","There's just a bunch of places we can jump in."
"Speaker 4","00;09;09;24","00;09;51;07","Great. I'll just briefly give some introductory comments or keep it brief because I think we're all roughly on the same page. Having read the paper so as I was saying, this this this project started out from a combination of curiosity and skepticism about some new applications of active inference and the free energy principle. And so I think as I understood it before, it was a kind of functional lens to try to understand cognitive systems and in that sense, offering a kind of unifying perspective and all sorts of different cognitive constructs in the cognitive sciences."
"Speaker 4","00;09;51;22","00;10;16;29","And there was already kind of very interested in that. And what we've what what we've seen in the last two years, I think, are, one, applications or at least attempts to apply it to the heart of the questions. So the whole question of consciousness, intentionality, cetera, which is more than this kind of functional lens and application to systems that are not necessarily cognitive."
"Speaker 4","00;10;16;29","00;10;49;14","So living systems as a whole or even like a global global systems or social systems. And and then as well, using this terminology not only to as a functional lens to to understand systems that you already deem cognitive, but also to use those tools themselves to do democratic work so to decide what is a living or not a living system and what is a cognitive or another cognitive system."
"Speaker 4","00;10;49;14","00;11;23;17","So it's to somehow employ the tools of active inference to answer these kind of questions. And I think we were yeah, we were all interested in the set of questions and seeing how that would and how that could work and what do those arguments really, really hold. And I think to do that, we needed to have a combination of one conceptual arguments, two formal arguments and three philosophical analysis and kind of combine those in the same paper."
"Speaker 4","00;11;24;02","00;11;54;27","And I think that makes it also made it a very challenging paper to write to see how all these different parts of the paper fit together. And perhaps it's also made it a challenging paper to read, but we'll probably get to that in a moment. And there's something in there, I think that that kind of books, the whole field, some of us were just a few hours ago on social media, and there's a new paper now among others, by basically DePaulo and Evan Thompson around the here."
"Speaker 4","00;11;56;04","00;12;18;27","And I think one of the more mature discussions was like how much mathematics, how much conceptual work do you need to actually contribute to the more conceptual questions you want to ask? And I think that this is something that's intrinsically in tension here within the literature, that you kind of need to have a very technical understanding to to head towards this question in the first place."
"Speaker 4","00;12;18;27","00;12;48;18","But then if you do that, perhaps you lose out on the more conceptual issues or you lose out also by the few readership because it's only a few people that understand it. So that's something exciting there about ATP as a whole. And I think we tried at least to be as accessible as possible in writing this paper while at the same time supporting our arguments with, with, with, with, with, with the formulations that we thought were necessary."
"Speaker 4","00;12;48;18","00;13;17;16","And that ultimately brought us to, to writing this and I think in the moment we have a lot of reprints that came out in the last few months, all kind of trying targets and trying to, to, to, to, to, to criticize these, these developments in principle. So I think some of you, some of them you discuss here already."
"Speaker 4","00;13;17;18","00;13;54;21","So some papers, some papers, I think epicenter that kind of has as a good paper on this as well, along with some paper. So I'm really curious to see how in the next few months how you say this this debate will will. Well, we'll find out. I think there's a number of very interesting kind of proposals now. And yeah, I also keep checking this this lab to to see how you treat this other papers and maybe we need to compare it to that that's cool."
"Speaker 1","00;13;55;22","00;14;02;09","Very interesting. Blue, do you want to just say hi, give any introductory thoughts if you'd like Sure."
"Speaker 2","00;14;02;10","00;14;17;16","Good morning. I am Blue Knight. I'm an independent research consultant from New Mexico and I really enjoyed this paper. I don't know if you got to see our contextualization video, but it was really good Cool."
"Speaker 1","00;14;17;17","00;14;40;10","So I'll be kind of taking some notes. Everybody can also jump into the document, and that was a big question that you raised there. How much mathematics is required to understand or work with free energy principle and active inference and then which are the sort of skeletal elements and the sinews, so to speak, of the math. And then which parts might be secondary or not?"
"Speaker 2","00;14;40;10","00;14;41;04","So we've lost Daniel."
"Speaker 1","00;14;41;11","00;15;13;07","Up there just a little bit. Yep. For some reason, there might be a few seconds of of just flipping, but yes, sorry just yet, what elements of the math are required to understand and work with these topics? And then, of course, the major question of your paper and some of these other recent papers we've discussed is whatever the mathematics are, what kinds of philosophical or metaphysical claims can we reach validly or in validly yeah."
"Speaker 1","00;15;14;00","00;15;22;14","Any other big questions or thoughts? People can just raise their hand with a little bottom left icon. So yeah, we'll do Stephen and then Blue."
"Speaker 3","00;15;25;01","00;15;57;29","Yeah, just one thing building on the bit. What then? You said there is active inference in biological systems could be present as a way for life to function and evolve. But there's also possibilities that the active inference process could create structures or networks which then form other systems which may not have to be so based on earth activity in the same way might be like you have a skeletal system which gives you locomotion."
"Speaker 3","00;15;58;13","00;16;21;13","So I suppose in some ways I'd be interested in that way that, you know, we're not tied to everything being an active influence in terms of how we can understand its applications, even though maybe at the core it has to be there at some level cool."
"Speaker 1","00;16;21;13","00;16;24;21","Thanks anyway. Can give a thought on that or blue go for it."
"Speaker 2","00;16;27;00","00;16;50;26","So just to kind of. Yeah, to, I don't know. So Stephen, what you just said, like active inference is present in biological systems. I think you know, we need to be careful before we pick a side over instrumental ism versus realism. Like is active inference present in the living system? Maybe not. Maybe it's just the way that we used to represent a living system or model living system or like our best guess so far."
"Speaker 2","00;16;51;05","00;17;13;10","Right. I mean, I think that the way that the science evolves, you know, in terms of how we think about biological systems processing information will, you know, I mean, active in, for instance, what we have now, but it probably won't be what we have in a hundred years if we survive 100 years. But but my question was, you know, in reading the paper, I really it was brought to my attention and and Steven's question so perfectly illustrates this."
"Speaker 2","00;17;13;19","00;17;36;03","So, so too there's a great degree of semantics that's involved. And our choice of language, I think, really shapes how we perceive the intentions of others. So it's just is that is that the caution or is that the tail or is that the the underbelly of the paper or to what role do you really think that language a lot of these things could be fixed with language."
"Speaker 1","00;17;38;00","00;17;42;04","Yes. Cool yalla. You want to go for it and then Shannon, as you're here."
"Speaker 4","00;17;43;22","00;18;01;20","Great. So I'll there's a two to two great questions. And just to to clarify the last one, when you say language, do you mean the kind of concepts that we are using or languages as a whole system?"
"Speaker 2","00;18;02;03","00;18;29;11","So I mean, like how Steven just said you know, systems have active inference like as just like systems have active inference, like I have a heart and a kidney and deliver. But I don't know that I necessarily have active inference. Right? So it's just our choice of language in that. So not language as a whole, but but language like carefully selected word choice could maybe prevent a lot of the conflict yeah."
"Speaker 4","00;18;30;19","00;19;01;01","I think so. And I guess generally you might think that lots of philosophy is actually kind of a linguistic therapy, right? Just trying to be very concise and using the right kind of terminology so that you don't slip into confusion that then will cloud your thinking. So so I think there's definitely some of that on the, the background in this paper but it's not only language, right?"
"Speaker 4","00;19;01;04","00;19;31;08","There's also the formal models and how to interpret those, those, those those formal models. And that there in the translation between the technical use, both of this terminology and the kind of everyday intuitions it gives us, I think there is in this room for a lot of mistakes and slippage. I mean, the notion of blanket is one right I mean, I have a blanket on my bed and that that has that has the spatial dimension."
"Speaker 4","00;19;31;08","00;19;50;01","And so and you can be either on top of it or below it, et cetera. And and so when you then use the notion of a micro blanket, this is the first intuition that people will have. And it turns out that actually, you know, these kind of things don't have such a kind of existence. Right. They don't they actually they're not really spatial things in the world."
"Speaker 4","00;19;50;01","00;20;10;29","They're they are just aspect of mathematical model. And so indeed, in kind of they're the language is one. But also just the particular way in which you understand your concepts either as everyday things or as technical things. I think that there's a lot of those slippages there. And I guess the whole literature is full with notions of model, of inference."
"Speaker 4","00;20;10;29","00;20;39;11","And and then it's very unclear whether something is the inference is a technical notion or inferences as a positive mind notion or inference is something else. So yeah, there are a lot of those those, those things in the background. And I think that that also points to the question that's even was asking in terms of like we can think about structures for locomotion and so like how this is related to, to active inference."
"Speaker 4","00;20;40;21","00;21;14;20","And so this is, this is, I guess this is, I mean, perhaps this is a topic that's not really there in this paper so much, but there there's a huge literature in active inference and how to understand and that notion of model and whether agents are models of the environment. And one way to want to see that is, is thinking like, well, there is an eco niche around this and we have through selection that might or might not be understood through active inference have been equipped with a particular kind of neurosis in particular kind of body that allows us to, to engage with it within the environment."
"Speaker 4","00;21;14;20","00;21;41;08","And in that sense, kind of things like the structures that facilitate locomotion could be just this part. This just as well be part of that model. But then model in a very different sense as it's typically used in cooking designs and yeah, so, so that's also very much how we understand model really shapes how you will answer these kind of questions about how active inference and locomotion also relate to each other."
"Speaker 1","00;21;43;01","00;22;04;02","Thanks for that. And it's almost like the word semantic, ironically, carries a double meaning because people will dismiss a discussion. Well, that's a semantic discussion on one sense. They mean you're talking about words, words, words, like you're kind of just saying random stuff. We're debating about a word, we're talking about the same thing. It's semantic, it's only semantic, but semantics are meaning."
"Speaker 1","00;22;04;18","00;22;22;29","And so I think I blipped out. Or maybe for some people for a second, but it just so funny how semantic refers to both the big sense of meaning and the small sense of the word, and we're all reducing our uncertainty by actually going into the details. What is the mark versus the pearl versus the forest in blanket?"
"Speaker 1","00;22;23;08","00;22;43;08","And can we just have a common reference point so that when somebody says, I'm using forest and blanket in the sense of this paper, then it will preempt some of these broader valid or sort of spurious questions so cool. Shannon and then anyone else who raises their hand yeah."
"Speaker 2","00;22;43;09","00;23;29;00","So I'll try to make this comment without too much rambling. But we've talked with with Mel Andrews with and as I'm Gippsland, I'm a scientist and we've been discussing like on what level the system implements active inference or is has markup blankets in the system versus when it's useful for us to describe it that way. So that realism versus instrumental debate and something that was came up in the conversation and it's something that's easy for me to claim, but there is no Markov blanket necessarily in a group of people that are interacting."
"Speaker 2","00;23;29;10","00;24;02;28","If we look at clusters of fans in a stadium, I might as a researcher identify this cluster of fans because they're interacting in a certain way with each other that's different from this other cluster of fans, and some game event happens and that ends up being some sort of coupling parameter. And now we can describe this as one unified system, one unified clusters of fans of people and I am pretty happy with saying that there is not a real boundary in the world between group A, Group B, or that emerges over the larger group you."
"Speaker 2","00;24;03;26","00;24;30;19","But I really want to say that that happens in the brain and I really want to say that are like the neurons in our brains are interpreting the world as if there are boundaries, and that's forming boundaries of neural processes. Like there's the specific people. We're talking about manifolds a lot lately, and there's the similar fuzziness and what it means to be a neural manifold."
"Speaker 2","00;24;30;23","00;24;59;18","Like there's a certain manifold that's associated with observing this feature of the world. And I wonder if you have any intuitions from this distinction. Can we can we be realists about Markov blankets or the fringe principle or active inference as applied to neural states? I mean, that's where this theory started while being antiracist about applying these to dynamics in the world."
"Speaker 2","00;24;59;18","00;25;04;15","Like groups of people Great question."
"Speaker 1","00;25;04;15","00;25;24;24","Also, just a technical note, like I'm not sure what is happening with the active inference YouTube or Tootsie or whatever, but clearly my Internet is working because we're having the video call, but the stream glitched so we can just continue not on live stream. And then I'll just re upload the final quality and it won't have any glitches, so I'll figure it out for next week."
"Speaker 1","00;25;24;24","00;25;50;16","But it's all good. It won't be fully live, but we can just still think of it the same way, which is the vast majority of people viewing it anyway. So yeah, sorry about that. I'll figure it out for next time. But thanks Shannon for the question about the groups. So anyone want to speak to the group question and about whether groups can be properly said to be having or bottled by these blankets or where is that?"
"Speaker 4","00;25;51;02","00;26;33;18","This is hard to think. Real sorry, David. I mean, Daniel, you guys for a second and a in the meanwhile, Eli asked if I want to enter the group question, and I think I would actually I have some thoughts about this. So I think one important thing about the free energy framework that especially how it's been developed recently is that people often like people interested in close circle like in a simulator, for example, has the cost of the paper recently with him about the mark of blankets in which they talk about the viewing different systems as agents so so they talk about a neutron as an agent, right?"
"Speaker 4","00;26;33;18","00;27;25;22","They talk about the whole organism as an agent. And and it's kind of scaffolded across multiple scales and and spatial scales. And I think our paper leaves it open to some extent. If leaves the question open, whether there is some kind of scale on which if we fix the parameters of the model, the models can be validated and they can produce new predictions or new new empirical findings in such a way where we would be forced to accept that perhaps on that particular scale, there really are blankets in the first instance, or at least that these models are so good at predicting certain events or findings or phenomena on a given scale, that we would"
"Speaker 4","00;27;25;22","00;27;52;23","be inclined to give them a realist interpretation. So I think this is still on the table and is very much open. It's just that given the ambition and the scope of the free energy framework and the fact that they start with this assumption of viewing different systems on different scales as agents, right now, it's just not really clear which level, so to speak."
"Speaker 4","00;27;52;23","00;27;57;11","The this this way of framing phenomena would be validated in a realist context."
"Speaker 1","00;27;59;27","00;28;24;13","Re Really what warrants or what licenses, what evidence will we need for realist interpretations? And it's not even just a yes no, because there's kind of a few kinds of realism, as you pointed out, like there's different notions of boundary. And so a group might be very well said to have an informational boundary like this, gypsy people who are not in the gypsy are not part of this informational boundary."
"Speaker 1","00;28;24;22","00;28;33;24","But then in some other sense, the group may not fall so neatly under the definition of a realist interpretation of a blanket."
"Speaker 5","00;28;34;29","00;29;27;21","Manuel Yeah. So I was a bit slow, I guess after Steven Blue actually asked a couple of questions earlier. So I'm briefly going to go back to that and then try to reconnect to what Shannon was actually talking about. So as for, I guess, the in the loose sense in which we might want to interpret active inference, I think there is I don't know relatively low risk means just, I don't know, waving our hands and saying the systems do some sort of active inference as long as we know we keep it loose, losing in such a way that in my opinion, it might just lose entirely like any meaning we're just saying, well, you know,"
"Speaker 5","00;29;27;22","00;30;09;08","there is some active inference happening there in the same sense that there is some active inference happening in I don't know, planets orbiting around stars or galaxies having some particular physical behavior. And and so we might end up just not having anything to say it's safe, but it's also not very useful in a sense. So in that direction, I think that our work is trying to, you know, go in the direction where we want to say what active inference is, not in a way it is important to say, well, you know, this is what it is right now and this is what it cannot be."
"Speaker 5","00;30;09;21","00;30;52;00","And if you want it to be something else, well, you you have to tell me exactly what else you need or for that thing to even work to begin with. And then related to that, there is also so I think I might have heard this from Alex Shunts before, and I don't know who else before him might have mentioned this, the idea of, say, an active inference coming from the I don't know, highway and an active inference coming from a more normal, if we can call it like that path, the highway is for them has been trying to do more recently, you know, starting from first principles, as he claims, like from the physics of,"
"Speaker 5","00;30;52;01","00;31;33;00","you know, longevity equations and, you know, stochastic systems and then trying to say derive notions that are already established the non equilibrium physics and from there get all the way to say a definition of what agents might be. There is also say the the I don't know the normal way which I think is what Shannon alluded to you know at some point because you know, this active inference theory was originally brought out in neuroscience with no ambition to be a first principle theory starting from, you know, longevity equations that might describe any physical system in this universe."
"Speaker 5","00;31;33;10","00;32;18;29","It was just supposed to be some sort of helpful framework that in some way was going to generalize reinforcement learning, which is an absolutely fair I guess, goal and ambition, but has also nothing to do with all of the physics that is more recently being plotting to active inference. And one could safely go say to the second roads and just forget about all of the physics in might leave it, I don't know to a different I don't know a different status but it would still be potentially useful and it would still be something that we might look forward to and that I guess lead me to leads me to something that Shannon was mentioning about"
"Speaker 5","00;32;19;00","00;32;50;15","manifolds and in some sense, the question about Markov blankets, real or not, is similar to yes. Manifolds, real or not. And here, you know, I don't want to say I'm not really sure, you know, how to to go about this in in the same way that, I don't know, physicists generally don't think too much about well, you know, is this energy landscape real or not?"
"Speaker 5","00;32;51;00","00;33;14;06","Is my you know, is my ball actually trying to fall to the ground or is it just well, you know, it is a good metaphor. It works really well. We tend to use some, you know, genitive language in there. But I guess that if you hard pressed a physicist, you will probably hardly get an answer about, you know, oh, is this energy scape like real?"
"Speaker 5","00;33;14;10","00;33;36;12","Is there an energy escape inside the bowl? That the ball is using to actually roll down the hill? Well, probably no. It is the kind of question that, you know, well I will still be using a grinder mechanics, I will still be using Hamiltonian mechanics, but I will not be, you know, opening up a ball looking for the energy landscape."
"Speaker 5","00;33;36;12","00;33;53;26","There in the same way I will still be using manifolds. Well personally because, you know, population codes are revealing data to be pretty useful in neuroscience. But I will not say like start looking inside the brain like, well, where's the manifold there, if that makes sense."
"Speaker 1","00;33;55;29","00;34;20;07","Yes, totally makes sense and real and useful. When they're aligned, people celebrate and when they're not aligned, there's often another story why something is still really useful, even though it's just a useful fiction or something like that. And I think that vector alignment is really what we want to nuance. We want to have like an hour hand and a second hand and a minute hand."
"Speaker 1","00;34;20;07","00;34;38;18","We want to be clear where are we just specifying a partially observable Markov decision process and fitting data? And then where are we in the interpretive frame and where are we in the metaphysical frame even beyond the interpretive Stephen and then anyone else raising that."
"Speaker 3","00;34;41;03","00;35;14;11","I think as well as where we say if it's real or not, there's the sense of at what scales. And I like the fact that he talks about scales is what scales and those scales, how much plausibility is there for certain types of inference processes to be possible I suppose that's where if there's no work and this isn't present or things do very little at certain scales, then maybe it's less likely that that mechanism is an active inference mechanism or that there may be some elements of it."
"Speaker 3","00;35;14;25","00;35;43;01","So I think that that also changes the way that the realist aspect can be brought in it's like how much could it be a blanket aspect? Or maybe like you say that other scales, unlike, say, a single cell which is diffuse in chemicals over a membrane and there'd be some wheat mixing process going on. There's some yeah. There's some ways that variation or expected free energy are not the only mechanisms."
"Speaker 1","00;35;45;05","00;36;10;08","Even suggesting that it's a mechanism is something that's mechanical. So it's these are what we want to understand and these are the discussions. And then are they equivalent and do mechanisms have to be real things or can a mechanism be something that doesn't exist in the world or a conceptual mechanism? Or could it be just a pattern that doesn't exist in one measurable thing we can put on a scale like a machine."
"Speaker 1","00;36;11;04","00;36;15;05","So cool questions, Dave, and then anyone else raising their hands."
"Speaker 2","00;36;16;27","00;36;49;21","OK, sometimes the math is trusted too far, and that's allowed to do a whole lot of work, but sometimes the math gets crippled. Now I'm a student of Gordon Pask and Cyclosarin and self stabilizing feedback is really critical to everything he did in learning theory and biology system science. And what's the very first thing you do when you mention Markov process is you stomp out the cycles, you rip out those cycles."
"Speaker 2","00;36;49;21","00;37;12;14","You are just not allowed to have loops in a Markoff network. Well, then they come back in because that's what people are looking for. They're looking for social stabilization and using the environment in the environment, using you to enrich itself. And and then as you point out, at the end of your paper, will, then Dr. Freston finds there's cycles in there, and then he goes up, rips them out all over again."
"Speaker 2","00;37;13;02","00;37;27;26","What has anybody ever just left the cycles in come up with a formalism that's richer than a Markovich and three and then see if maybe things get easier and simpler."
"Speaker 1","00;37;30;19","00;37;54;19","Great question, Dave. And I think the big question is what are the inputs? What do we want to get out of this math are we looking to make analytical claims or are we looking to have very general frameworks for control theory or for estimation theory? Even like Manuel mentioned, so anyone can raise their hand. But Chris."
"Speaker 4","00;37;57;01","00;38;19;07","Thinks so. I just wanted to follow up on the last two questions, but I see that there's already a theme emerging in a way. So one thing is about the math and you know, already the question that was posed at the beginning, how much the understanding of math informs research that people can do into the predictive processing framework."
"Speaker 4","00;38;19;24","00;38;45;01","And I think and now we return to this question in a way with this question of cycles and the fact that we actually analyze, you know, we leave the cycles out. And I think it's in some ways useful to think about our paper in many ways and what's happening with the free energy framework as a kind of a pyramid where, you know, formulas and mathematical formulas are stacked."
"Speaker 4","00;38;45;14","00;39;06;00","One on another. And finally, the free energy principle really lies at the top. And what we've been trying to do in some ways is to lead our readers, you know, through the steps going up to the free energy principle and like, well, how it's supposed to work. But the thing is that, of course, there are many different ways to get there."
"Speaker 4","00;39;06;00","00;39;31;22","So, you know, someone might have like you can think about the cycles, like the the topological method that we took with with directed graphs and the way of thinking about dynamical coupled systems and loops and stuff like that. You can think about this as different slopes of the same pyramid, right? In the end. The point is that you want to get to the free energy principle."
"Speaker 4","00;39;31;22","00;40;14;15","Exactly. Yeah. You want to get the, the free energy principle. And the free energy principle lies on top of a lot of work done in many different formal fields where and I think I think that the last question asked by Dave pointing to the possibility that perhaps if we leave the question of that, the cyclical graphs aside and just focus on cyclical systems, perhaps we could arrive at a new formal construct that could later turn out to be somewhat equivalent to the Markov blanket, but wouldn't be so easily conflated with Michael Blankets."
"Speaker 4","00;40;14;15","00;40;50;05","I think that's a very interesting possibility that probably should be explored in the literature. And the other thing I wanted to address very briefly is the fact that the other thing that seems to be emerging here in the discussion is the theme of patterns and and what's real and what's not real. And I think here it's useful to bring back are kind of points that Dan Bennett has already done some important work in the past on this with his work on real patterns and what does it mean for a pattern to be real and what's the difference between the pattern being real and not being right?"
"Speaker 4","00;40;51;17","00;41;15;23","One interesting thing, if we think about active inference, for example, is that if we think about the social dynamics, we can think, for example, about the dynamics in the Army right through a platoon it clearly has some kind of a blanket, like the platoon is trying to maintain its homeostasis. They are all trying to stay alive, especially in a hostile environment far away from the equilibrium."
"Speaker 4","00;41;15;23","00;41;38;29","Right. The interesting thing about the example of a platoon, if I and I hope I'm not getting that wrong now, but I'm sure many women would correct me if I do, is that we don't actually assume that the that that the platoon would be statistically ergodic because it's definite we shouldn't shouldn't visit some of its possible safe spaces."
"Speaker 4","00;41;38;29","00;42;06;23","Right. The portions of the of its base like the whole point of putting people into a platoon is so that they won't visit certain regions of the state space. So those are interesting questions here. And of course, the question about like our platoon is real, you know, are they it's an interesting it's an interesting question to ponder. And then it previously has the question about money, right?"
"Speaker 4","00;42;06;23","00;42;39;00","So is the value of money real obviously, it has direct impact on our lives. We be it. It has a direct impact on how we behave in virtue of the kind of social construct and the social scaffolding on which you dressed. But we all kind of agree that, you know, the the existence of value of money is just a is just some kind of a fiction that we all buy into, especially now that the gold parity is no longer a thing nice."
"Speaker 1","00;42;40;15","00;43;04;04","Cool points. And it's really remarkable how this what is real. I mean, in some sense, it makes sense to a classic philosophy question, Plato's Cave and what's real. And it's hard to differentiate it sometimes because it's used in very many senses and so sometimes like the pyramid, it's almost like we're surfacing it like an iceberg to mixed metaphors."
"Speaker 1","00;43;04;14","00;43;28;21","And then people can visibly attack a formalism well, the directed acyclic graph doesn't represent reality because reality has cyclic elements. And then we have to sort of change the formalism a little bit like could we run it in a sequential way? Could a message passing algorithm emulate a cyclic system, even though locally computationally it's linearized but you lose some other attribute?"
"Speaker 1","00;43;28;21","00;43;34;18","Is that real then with the model, be real. So fun questions. Yeah. And then Steve."
"Speaker 4","00;43;36;19","00;44;13;14","Great. So I think a question kind of related orthogonal to two to the real question is a question about what we in the paper call we ification. Right? So it's a fact that if you make a mathematical formalization of something that mathematical formalization might, it's quite often idealization of the target phenomenon that you're investigating. And then as long as you treat that mathematical structure as an idealization of the target phenomenon and don't automatically transfer the properties of the acquisition to the target phenomenon, then that's completely fine."
"Speaker 4","00;44;14;03","00;44;39;00","And then the what, where it gets the upside down is if you suddenly take that mathematical formalization as somehow being at the root of the appearance of the target phenomenon that you're investigating. So we make this case for, for the kind of graphical model example where there is a complicated system. You make a graphical model of it, which is by all means the kind of simplification of that very system."
"Speaker 4","00;44;39;17","00;45;09;12","And then if you start to say, look, Michael, banks were actually in that system you're also implying that no, actually the mathematical idealization of, of, of the system was actually already in the target system. That you were that you were investigating. And that's that's, I think, also a move that you make the mathematics itself more real than you're then you're supposed to make it and of course, I think we said this towards the end of the paper, you can bite the bullet, right."
"Speaker 4","00;45;09;12","00;45;40;07","And say, look, no reality at its very core is mathematical. So so so we're fine. But that that is something that doesn't itself come from the formalism but requires actually a pretty strong metaphysical assumptions and so the question about that sends a question about the reality of a mathematical structure is also intertwined with this question about reification, about how do you see the relationship between the target phenomenon that you're investigating and the mathematical formalization of the target phenomenon."
"Speaker 4","00;45;41;02","00;45;48;00","I think these two questions kind of go, go go hand in hand and then thank you."
"Speaker 1","00;45;48;14","00;45;52;29","Steven, than anyone else yeah."
"Speaker 3","00;45;53;12","00;46;14;20","I think this, this mathematical piece is important as well because I think there's often the assumption that we're always inferring this model of the world and how to adapt and interact with the world. But one of the key things, particularly higher order animals and humans like Platoon is at times they want to be this ordered or this coherent self."
"Speaker 3","00;46;14;20","00;46;38;19","But ultimately when they're in the field, yes, they want to get into the most optimal ways to shoot and do things, but they need to game the system. They need to not do what the other people think they're going to do, and they have to guess what someone else might do, which is non ergodic something which is you basically gain in each other's environment so that you're basically like prey and predator."
"Speaker 3","00;46;38;28","00;46;54;26","You're you're also then taking another stance. So you step outside of what would be that normal dynamic, all free energy minimization process. And that is sort of sitting on top of the other process. So I think that's a kind of an interesting confusion."
"Speaker 1","00;46;56;16","00;46;58;25","Cool Dave than anyone else."
"Speaker 2","00;47;00;12","00;47;38;24","I think the question of what is or wasn't, what isn't Ergodic seems to interact a lot with scale and this is something that can be manipulated in an organization sometimes to what seem like contradictory or paradoxical effects. For a long time, the US military officer corps has had an up or out policy. If you didn't get promoted within a certain amount of time, you were invited to leave the military and go do something else with your life, which sometimes didn't work well."
"Speaker 2","00;47;38;24","00;48;01;25","You started running into the oh, you know, the the British sociologist from the fifties with the famous the the most famous organizational law such and such as law. Yeah. If people are young, they end up in the they're at the level of incompetence. Well, much more recently."
"Speaker 1","00;48;02;13","00;48;03;26","Just over 20 years ago."
"Speaker 2","00;48;03;26","00;48;56;24","The US Department of Justice started adopting an up or out policy, which quite likely is a lot more toxic than having that in the military, because the military has usually a fairly narrow kind of purpose if it's being used at all in the Department of Justice, the FBI, especially if you're a local investigator, you're expected over a period of years, not just to know your colleagues and the cops and the prosecutors and the reporters and the informants and the way the underworld works, whether you're stopping them or not, you're expected to develop an enormous amount of highly differentiated knowledge of South Cincinnati or the East Bronx."
"Speaker 2","00;48;57;06","00;49;19;04","Well, then in the late nineties, somebody decided, oh, no, no, wait a minute, this has this leave a possibility of local corruption where we're allowing nests of incompetence and nests of bribery. So we're going to require people to leave no matter how much you love working in the South Bronx, you either get."
"Speaker 1","00;49;20;07","00;49;21;20","Promoted to Washington."
"Speaker 2","00;49;21;24","00;49;51;18","Or you get out so some of the intention presumably was to keep a nice smooth pipeline, a clear flowing stream. But you end up requiring incompetence in state is there a larger scope at which you become scale independent and that sort of thing? And oh yeah, it looks muddy at a low level, but it's actually ends up being clearer."
"Speaker 2","00;49;51;18","00;49;57;20","Or is it just screwing up who question?"
"Speaker 1","00;49;57;20","00;50;21;03","There's a lot there. One piece I kind of heard is like there's systems that we can actually control, like a software program we can write a program with a strictly defined typology of variables. And so it's easier to take a realist interpretation of a program where we can define all the pieces and we can know everything that's happening."
"Speaker 1","00;50;21;16","00;50;59;15","But once we're dealing with systems that we didn't directly control, we know that we're dealing with a map territory distinction, which I guess is something I'll flip to because this was just a great in a very accessible point, which is wherever we go down the rabbit hole with the math, we have to keep that map territory embodied metaphor in mind, whether it's a phone you're looking at and it's deep learning and it's maps and recommendations, or whether it's a hand-drawn map that your friend made or whether it's a historical painting, it's a map, and we can all see how that differs."
"Speaker 1","00;50;59;15","00;51;23;25","Then the actual, quote, realism of the territory, which isn't even like what we see it's actually something a little bit else. So going and holding to this map territory distinction is kind of a useful thing. And so it's great that you brought it up also on the sort of symbolic and evocative wavelength, what about the title or what inspired the title?"
"Speaker 1","00;51;24;19","00;51;34;05","How did you see that story or that narrative play out? Because you see a lot with a few words yeah."
"Speaker 4","00;51;35;13","00;51;45;14","I think we stumbled upon the title and just thought it was too good not to use, but in terms of the what you have in there, oh goodness."
"Speaker 4","00;51;48;17","00;52;29;19","And I heard you explain the story during the pre recording, which is very nice. But I think there was one element there that you, that you that you didn't mention and that's there, that there are somehow these, these swindlers in this story fell do the rest of the the and so in the palace like these are sort of clothes that you can only that you can't that you can only see if you're very clever if you if you if you to dump you won't be able to see these clothes so there is and all the lackey's and everybody involved in the story there there is a kind of doubts like is this me?"
"Speaker 4","00;52;29;19","00;52;49;05","Am I too stupid or is something fishy going on here? And I think that kind of state of suspense of not really knowing, I think that's perhaps the, the key to the title without knowing for the suggest that there were swindlers in this story is so but that anybody like hey, am I am I too stupid to get this or is something weird going on."
"Speaker 4","00;52;49;05","00;53;03;14","And I think everybody everybody working on energy principle has or at least should have had that feeling to to to some extent. And so I think that's the key to the the title without giving away too much about the rest of the story."
"Speaker 1","00;53;04;20","00;53;05;19","Yes. Shannon."
"Speaker 2","00;53;08;11","00;53;34;11","I somehow missed that nuance from from the title, but it seems really prescient for the new paper that just came out to and the Twitter post. Response on it, too, is maybe certain technical aspects of the free energy principle weren't described with the specific mathematics and formalism that you need to properly criticize the free energy principle, which maybe maybe you do."
"Speaker 2","00;53;34;12","00;54;20;13","Maybe you need to have that much detail to properly criticize it. But if it's a principle that we want to know that our empirical science and our understanding of whatever subject matter we're looking at and also something that we want to use, I I assume that in science we want to use this to also inform the world about something that we know about the system that we're studying, whether it's something like this is a true real fact of the system, or this is the most useful way that we can understand the system so that we can apply treatments, you know, maybe translate to applied clinical practice or something like that."
"Speaker 2","00;54;21;03","00;54;51;29","Then at some point it needs to be possible to abstract away from the formalism without losing the detail or without losing the assumed detail that the formalism brings in. And maybe it's just maybe like we have to work through this nitty gritty stuff and we have to fight over very small mathematical details and people that are better at math than I have to make that fight before we can bring it in."
"Speaker 2","00;54;51;29","00;55;22;04","And people in applied practices and maybe even the greater public can start understanding exactly what this means. But I don't know when when is the point that we can get there? What is the point that we can say, OK, we're done arguing about the formalism. We know there's subtle differences, but I can still have a conversation with my friend who's just interested in my Ph.D. work but hasn't done a Ph.D. themselves or something like that."
"Speaker 2","00;55;22;10","00;55;27;19","I'm going to stop talking as I start trailing off with less points here, but just throwing that out there, I think."
"Speaker 1","00;55;27;20","00;55;29;27","Shannon, cool points meanwhile."
"Speaker 5","00;55;31;16","00;56;02;14","So I hope this doesn't come along. Guys say like negative perspective in a way. But I guess that beyond what Shannon mentioned already as being part of the problems, which are real, which are absolutely real, like when do when can we stop? Like getting into the nitty gritty stuff so that we can actually do some work on top of that and here I'm going to break allowance life in like for free."
"Speaker 5","00;56;02;15","00;56;50;28","Some like for once where I say that, you know, part of what makes his job difficult is also like the JDA of dealing with definitions that use the same words across different fields. So we have an example here. Our way there go DCT. So dear God, this is the definition that physicists study is. Yeah, this idea of having an assistant the visits or this all of the states in a state space such that you can replace time average with ensemble averages if you look at it from the perspective of Markov processes, which I think they've actually brought out at some point a periodicity actually becomes a part of the definition."
"Speaker 5","00;56;52;01","00;57;14;05","If you look at it from the perspective of Ergodic theory, which is this field born like 78 years ago, and that actually is supposed to just be to just deal with the recorded city, then what they've actually suggested in their field is week mixing. So you can have systems that are not a Gothic, sorry, that are Gothic, but not with mixing."
"Speaker 5","00;57;16;02","00;57;42;22","So all in all, without going like too much into details, I'm just trying to suggest that there is also a level of misunderstanding that comes from people having different backgrounds. So on top of just say, understanding what is going on, we also need to have, I don't know, a paper or two that just list definitions as you know, I'm using this definition from this specific field."
"Speaker 5","00;57;42;26","00;58;09;16","You can find it in this book. Different people might want to say Well, this is not really how I was taught this, this specific concept, but at least it is something that I can engage with. So a lot of the confusion, especially on this issue, actually comes out just of people having different backgrounds. None of them are wrong because all of them are just using different definitions."
"Speaker 5","00;58;10;22","00;58;11;16","Unfortunately."
"Speaker 1","00;58;12;13","00;58;47;28","I totally agree with that. It's almost like a scientific project. And what we're seeing is that there's an enormous desire to contribute to a shared scientific project and to make these ideas not just something that rests in the head of an expert but something in our exo cortex, in our informational niche, something where we can all just see the affordances in a bigger project like Wikipedia and improve it and then in service of that, we need alignment on really the tools and the people and the ideas and the ideas are more on the philosophical side."
"Speaker 1","00;58;47;28","00;59;32;01","And the tools as we're seeing are more on the technical side. And something that's right at the intersection of tools, people and ideas are really the terms and their definitions and that pursuit of clarity as well as improved ability to translate and generate introductory material is really key and that active inference ontology type work is one of the things we're working on in Active Lab because we totally agree when there are multiple definitions, then it's either a don't ask, don't tell policy on definitions, or people do go into the details and then the paper is criticized for providing a specific detailed take, or they make nine out of ten points."
"Speaker 1","00;59;32;01","00;59;51;20","But then it leaves a shadow of doubt about the 10th of 10th point because it seems like it's going too technical. And when people do a linear regression or a time series model, even when lives are on the line, no one says, Wait a minute, I need the least squares error to be real. But we're seeing criticisms about what's real here."
"Speaker 1","00;59;52;07","01;00;16;06","And so that's such a fascinating pattern that really will be explored, I think, in the coming months and years. This line of research has brought us to some fundamentals, and we are bringing up some new questions and connecting ideas in terms, new ways. So it's fun to be a part of. And I hope that those who are listening can see that they're a part of this active conversation."
"Speaker 1","01;00;16;11","01;00;32;20","And it's not like they the authors released this paper and now the conversation is over. This is sort of their opening call and I hope that we can hear a few more pieces about what does that call entail for those who take it up."
"Speaker 4","01;00;33;03","01;01;20;21","The other yeah, great. I just want to briefly follow up on Shannon's point and saying that at least I think our aim is also to a the kind of these apart a little bit, the kind of empirical research program of of inference and DCM and so and the more kind of what we in the paper in general, the kind of most ambitious version of blanket oriented pathology and and and show that you don't need to buy into that heavy duty metaphysical framework in order to do empirical, interesting empirical work with an inference or with with with, with ECMO."
"Speaker 4","01;01;20;21","01;01;42;22","So, so that kind of association back and forth, that might be a good fit. But there's, there's, I think there's very good reasons to just say, well, micro blanket, stay my toolkit as a scientist and I can use them and employ them every once in a while. But I'm not going to speculate about how that my toolkit fits on to reality, et cetera."
"Speaker 4","01;01;42;23","01;02;11;19","Right. That's a different ballpark. But as having it in your toolkit, you can still do basically all the signs that that that that it's there already. So if you want to be clear that at no point do we want to say like people should do empirical work differently or so, but it's really like if you want to use this toolkit to dove into a different set of questions rather than the traditional empirical ones, you can ask with questions about demarcation of agents or so that that might look a lot like the empirical one."
"Speaker 4","01;02;11;19","01;02;33;11","We actually are not really. And then you are confronted with a different set of questions, namely about how does mathematics relate to reality? And so but by no means do we want to kind of block that. And I think, I mean, a long time ago I studied physics, right? And then if you if you would be if you could, discussions about are atoms real and so right."
"Speaker 4","01;02;33;22","01;02;56;28","And these are kind of these are the kind of questions that I guess that that is funny to raise. And some people have more or less patience with them. But by no means do any of those questions block book the actual research in physics they're orthogonal to each other. And I think the same holds for for for for neuroscience at least to some extent if you if you want to interpret data."
"Speaker 4","01;02;56;29","01;03;10;15","So you just use a mathematical toolbox for that then that that's completely and metaphysically innocent in that. So to say it's just this this transition that has happened that we yeah. Have doubts about that issue it."
"Speaker 5","01;03;12;06","01;03;12;16","All."
"Speaker 1","01;03;13;06","01;03;45;08","Thanks and anyone can raise their hand. One thought on that is that the structure of the implementation of active inference models with a partially observable Markov decision processes helps us separate out. For example, our priors about different variables, our generative model, our affordances and our preferences. So using that model helps us distinguish for example, our aspirational beliefs about how the world should be or what we prefer from the sort of reality on the ground with what our affordances are."
"Speaker 1","01;03;45;20","01;04;19;19","And almost at a higher level. This is where this discussion is coming. Can we separate out our technological affordances from our preferences, for example, that an integrated theory of everything would be preferable. That just makes a theory better for it to be more explanatory, more predictive, more universal, more transferable, across different systems. Those are preferences we might have over distributions of scientific theories, but that's not quite the same thing as what our affordances and we don't know all the affordances yet."
"Speaker 1","01;04;19;19","01;04;41;09","There's theories that haven't been invented. There's frameworks that don't exist yet. So how how do we make sense at the lower level and then also at sort of a higher meta scientific level, have a discussion across different frameworks without traipsing into essentially unknowable metaphysical questions. Stephen And then anyone else."
"Speaker 3","01;04;43;21","01;05;17;17","Now be interested. One of the sort of relates a bit to what they were saying there about feedback loops. And we had in the last session, we had Casper Hesse talking about some of the modeling. And then you have these kind of cyclical iterative dynamics at different scales of how, you know, how fast or slow the kind of the churn of observations and sensory states and maybe states of belief and such things."
"Speaker 3","01;05;18;00","01;05;42;08","So there's kind of a cyclical pattern sort of in there. So just be curious how that cyclical pattern relates also to other types of feedback, which is maybe a bit more dynamic OK, or just other types of feedback loops that you might think might need to be thought of yet."
"Speaker 1","01;05;42;25","01;05;45;04","I see Chris and Manuel both with Henry's."
"Speaker 4","01;05;46;11","01;05;48;11","Yeah, and I can."
"Speaker 1","01;05;48;25","01;05;49;04","Go ahead."
"Speaker 4","01;05;50;12","01;05;56;14","Manuel, if you have if you want to say something directly to the last question, then go ahead."
"Speaker 5","01;05;58;18","01;06;53;05","Right. So my bad for actually not covering that before, but the idea, I guess that they've previously brought out and now Stephen kindly reminded us about this idea of feedback loops. There is so let's say I would say them my background might be more from control theory in some sense. So I do see the need of considering feedback loops because, you know, that's the sort of my bread and butter in control theory there is also a sense, however, in which I guess usually in control theory we draw diagrams, but they are kind of, you know, representations that will live there as being like, well, this is the type of system and dealing with it is"
"Speaker 5","01;06;53;05","01;07;22;04","some sort of like picturesque say our view of what is actually happening out there. We are not doing maps on the satellite. The diagram that we are drawing in, I guess what is happening with Bayesian networks and why people are so much, say, inclined to use them is, is the fact that I guess we can actually use Bayesian network to do calculations."
"Speaker 5","01;07;22;22","01;08;16;17","So the word paper, which we briefly mention in our paper, clearly not giving enough justice to the entire say, framework, you know, is something that can be used on this models themselves. So in a way, the the directionality, the the unrolling of time, the idea of an arrow of time there makes all of these calculations possible. It is by no means a way to say that there will be say system, that there will be different systems, necessarily different systems at different times we may still choose to group certain variables and say, well, this is just how the environment is evolving over time or how an agent is evolving over time."
"Speaker 5","01;08;16;17","01;08;59;28","And we might just call that environment. We might just call that agent. That's fine, I guess. But when it comes to say, do calculations with that graph, if we just start drawing loops, then time disappears and time is what makes a lot of this calculations actually work. At least, say the algorithms that Dana also mentioned with message passing on Bayesian networks, that is what makes them work, like the fact that it is clearly there are also algorithms for cyclic networks, but they are more limited to have some say that has some stronger assumptions."
"Speaker 5","01;09;00;21","01;09;26;09","So I'm rolling time. I think is not an incredibly crazy assumption or an incredibly crazy saying method to use there. It is probably something quite reasonable we are still saying there a there's there's an agent that talks to an environment and an environment that talks to an agent. We're just trying to make that say interaction explicit as a process that happens over time."
"Speaker 1","01;09;29;11","01;09;31;21","Thank you, Steven, than anyone else."
"Speaker 3","01;09;34;06","01;10;03;18","Yeah. Thanks for that that that feedback. And I suppose one thing that the question that can come up is and I'm not sure if the polar blankets could do this or something that the first in brackets gives you the possibilities if you're dealing with entropic information and noisy kind of data that's coming in and entropy can be like zero dimensional, it doesn't actually need to have a dimension and you can extract from that."
"Speaker 3","01;10;04;04","01;10;34;02","Whereas in other cases you always working with something which is like a channel coming in like a dimensional data source, which is somehow like saying something about the thing out there as opposed to something which can be completely untethered from the environment. So I wonder you know, how that that idea of being able to extract channel entropy information might be a unique property of the forest and blanket or whether that could be done in other ways."
"Speaker 5","01;10;37;14","01;11;11;25","So I guess there are a couple of considerations there, like exactly what would be extracting information from what because I mean, this sounds a lot like the sort of like Maxwell's Daemon type of scenario, which, you know, it's a well-studied field but it's also say possibly controversial in some sense because while in physics you don't need to ask certain questions, you just want sediment and I don't and I'm not going to tell you what this thing is."
"Speaker 5","01;11;12;09","01;11;39;24","I'm not going to tell you how he does his thing. He just does it. And this is how, you know, things will happen. Um, the thing about, you know, extracting information in the blanket sense, well, here I want to say I'm a very fine line by saying that, Dean, there are possibly issues with this definition of the phrase some blanket."
"Speaker 5","01;11;39;24","01;12;15;18","And they have been raised before. And I think Martin Beale has pointed out in a recent paper, Fernando Rosas has also mentioned them in his work on causal blankets as a way to fix, I would say, for instance, blankets in the sense that the information that can be extracted dead in those blankets is not passed. Information is just information that one's specific times that because of this unrolling, it makes calculations easier."
"Speaker 5","01;12;15;29","01;12;48;12","But the sort of conditional independence is not only are in within a time step, is also across time slips because of the Markov property of of this processes. And I want to make sure this is not something that I first raised. This came from people I Martin, Bill, Fernando, Rosa was and probably in first place, Nathaniel Virga, so and again, all the credit goes to them."
"Speaker 5","01;12;48;23","01;13;00;26","So this idea of extracting information is really feeble for now. It is not it is not something that I would actually bank on in any way."
"Speaker 1","01;13;04;03","01;13;27;17","Or so. It's almost like it's said to be a strength of the Markov blanket or any kind of blanket concept that it's just one time slice at a time, but you don't get to have the blanket and eat it too, because you can't have that through time benefits and then say that you're simplifying with something that's only reading one value at a time, though there's also probably a lot of technical details, too."
"Speaker 1","01;13;27;26","01;13;34;04","So Chris, then anyone else raising their hands on you."
"Speaker 4","01;13;37;28","01;14;25;12","Here we go. Sorry. So that was a really nice exchange. And I think it also ties things back to, to, to to your point about the map and the territory distinction, because one thing that we like, I think one of the intentions we had at least definitely me and Joe, who unfortunately isn't here but is very interested in these topics then is the philosophy of science behind the notion of a scientific model and one thing that we have to like, if we frame things in this way, it becomes very interesting how we understand precedence, formalism, such as Markov blankets, for example, because in philosophy there's often the distinction made between the model, the control and"
"Speaker 4","01;14;25;12","01;14;50;14","the target system of the model, right? So the target system of the model is a phenomenon we're trying to investigate in the world. The model itself is some kind of formal construction usually usually described in some formal language. And then the construal is kind of the interpretive link that connects the formal structure to the concrete real world phenomenon."
"Speaker 4","01;14;50;29","01;15;14;21","And one interesting thing about this is that the same formal structure, the same model can be applied in different fields by different scientists successfully using different constructs. Right. And this also goes back to something that Manuel mentioned before about the multiplicity of backgrounds from which people come to the Free Energy Framework, Active Inference Framework. And it's not unproductive."
"Speaker 4","01;15;14;21","01;15;49;20","I mean, we have good examples in the history of science, in the history of computers, and specifically of people parting certain notions from physics, specifically into computer science and making breakthroughs. So one very nice example of this is the so-called, I think, model of magnetism, which has been reported by William Little and John Field into the neural network domain, where they basically use the same formal structure to and again, gave it a different construal all right."
"Speaker 4","01;15;49;21","01;16;17;26","To model a different a different world we phenomenon. So how field networks and later Boltzmann networks have been very successful, for example, in modeling a memory at least back when they were introduced. Now we have much more sophisticated models, of course, but it's a nice example of this kind of cross insemination between fields where people can actually take a formal structure, a notion from one field and successfully make progress in a different domain."
"Speaker 4","01;16;18;23","01;16;46;12","But one thing that's important to keep in mind is that, you know, little our field never, never, never, never published their neural network model instead. Like, look, it's a thermodynamic model of memory or something like that because it's not I mean, in a sense, of course it is because the formal structure that has been mapped onto the target, the phenomenon is the same as in the icing model or the spinning glass model."
"Speaker 4","01;16;46;29","01;16;54;16","And the thing is, though, that the controls are very different. And I think it's very useful to, to, to keep this in mind."
"Speaker 4","01;16;56;24","01;17;15;09","If I would like to boil my point down, I guess, to two sentences, it can be productive doing this. It's just something that we really wanted to bring to the surface, that we have to be aware of the distinction between the thing in the world and the mathematical formula that we're using to describe this."
"Speaker 1","01;17;15;09","01;17;15;27","Thing in the world."
"Speaker 1","01;17;18;18","01;17;52;28","Awesome. Thanks for this summary. And as people, I think learn and read these papers they'll see that there are these expanding levels of analysis like the one sentence, don't confuse the map with the territory or what you just said there. It can be productive. You just have to raise this discussion to the surface. And then there's more and more and more to uncover, kind of like chipping away at the base of the pyramid almost and finding out what are our assumptions and OK, all these people criticizing elements of free energy principle or active inference, what's their preference?"
"Speaker 1","01;17;53;07","01;18;08;29","What do they want to see or are we all on the same aspirational team in that we all want to see a collaborative, formal framework that also might help us with real world questions and also philosophical ones variously, Stephen, than anyone else."
"Speaker 3","01;18;12;28","01;18;40;11","I think this is this is a really good conversation. And I think when I've heard other approaches say in the psychology fields, which are kind of looking at how people do sense making, they often outside of work with the free energy principle, it tends to be energy gradients, people, you know, what's the root to least action or whether you notice the energy is lower."
"Speaker 3","01;18;40;16","01;19;30;29","So then you know how to act on the environment and who has the ability to also bring in entropic kind of noisy statistical regularities, which you wouldn't necessarily know why they're there. Well, you wouldn't know why they we no one knows they're there. We can't even understand it. There's something quite interesting in that. And that seems to be where, to my understanding, I don't know if there's any other models that are able to integrate the the energy landscape with this kind of action, you know, way to infer something plausibly from the entropic dynamics that are played out."
"Speaker 1","01;19;34;07","01;19;37;01","Thanks, Steven Blue than anyone else for the question."
"Speaker 2","01;19;40;22","01;20;01;29","So I just to go back to what Daniel was saying about incorporating the active inference framework. Do we want this really to be a framework that is concrete and definite and stable? Do we want to come to some kind of absolute endpoint here with active in France? Or is this something that we want to be constantly evolving, growing, changing?"
"Speaker 2","01;20;01;29","01;20;22;14","Do we want to try try applying it like in several different fields, seeing what works and what doesn't to then then one. So we have to think as we ask ourselves and as we, you know, discourage and encourage how the active inference framework is used. What do we really want as scientists? I think it's important to think about that great question."
"Speaker 1","01;20;22;14","01;20;29;08","Blue. Really something we could all think a little bit about. Shannon, then anyone else."
"Speaker 2","01;20;30;19","01;21;02;06","Sort of following up a little bit tangential what we just mentioned and maybe Joe can be here next week would be great. But I'm wondering if we're having sort of an emerging folk active inference. So we have a I like folk psychological intuitions about the world, about how other people behave. Science uses slightly different, maybe more complex intuitions to describe how people perceive interact, to describe the psychology of individuals."
"Speaker 2","01;21;02;24","01;21;29;06","I'm wondering if this active inference concept is really great, how Daniel talks about how we work in teams and how we're working together to resolve our uncertainty, and we're coming together in this this mark blanketed group of us compared to everyone who will be watching this livestream later. And these are fruitful to making good team dynamics and to help learn."
"Speaker 2","01;21;29;06","01;21;50;03","And some of us who aren't here right now, we're applying this to systems, to business and organization. And this is super useful. It's not the goal of the scientists, perhaps, but maybe we can bring this up again next week and just talk about how that's useful and how that's sort of emerging at the same time as these Formalisms."
"Speaker 1","01;21;51;06","01;22;15;00","Thanks, Shannon. And I agree that the team and the project and the mission sometimes sidestep or at least ward off the philosophical questions. It's like, well, let's finish this project with this data set we have get the publication in or get this next checkpoint and then we'll see where we're at. We'll have a new perspective on these eternal philosophical questions."
"Speaker 1","01;22;15;09","01;22;29;09","And so it won't be resolved in 20, 21 maybe not even in 20, 22, but we'll be working together and we'll be more productive and we'll have stabilized our informational niche. Our financial niche Dave, than anyone else."
"Speaker 1","01;22;35;07","01;22;50;11","On Dave Dave But he's still muted. But OK, OK, anyone else want to add something."
"Speaker 5","01;22;55;16","01;23;31;16","I was just going to say something very briefly concerning what Blue brought out which I think is very fair, I guess view of a very fair perspective of the current status of people that might choose to work on active inference. There is a good cluster, I guess, of people from different backgrounds that have some more or less shared goal that are ready to, you know, engage with each other and try to, I guess, like to create something good with each other."
"Speaker 5","01;23;31;16","01;24;22;26","So if anything else, that's great. I mean, what else would you actually need to do? Science, if not just a bunch of, you know, motivated people that get together and try to to work towards something all together. I'm something that, you know, might have just on the other hand, push people away like at different stages in time was you know, the idea of promising something that was not really there yet in a way like the nobody would blame, I guess anyone for for a project that is just in the workings for something that is evolving, for something that is still, you know, that has still not reached its final form."
"Speaker 5","01;24;24;08","01;24;54;29","I guess that the idea of reading, you know, a theory, a unifying theory of this, a unifying theory of that as well, might have discouraged other people from from actually engaging with it. So probably some sort of balance that I think is now in place is conducive to, I guess, an even better research environment because I think more people can engage more people can see that there are, you know, constructive criticisms."
"Speaker 5","01;24;55;16","01;25;27;06","More people can see that, you know, is not just, you know, a sort of environment completely detached from from reality. There is there is a sense in which, you know, improvements happen when people engage and all the people listen and propose new stuff, which, you know, just the scientific method. That's absolutely fine. That's great. I think we we had some very welcoming feedback from different people."
"Speaker 5","01;25;28;07","01;25;34;25","Like regardless of what we said, which I thought, you know, is good for a healthy community."
"Speaker 1","01;25;37;01","01;25;37;24","Nice, I think."
"Speaker 2","01;25;38;10","01;25;38;17","Yeah."
"Speaker 1","01;25;38;20","01;25;58;23","Thank you. Yeah. A mentor in writing told me that the three stages were the mad man, the architect and the interior designer. So someone has to envision there could be a skyscraper here or there could be a stadium here, and then it has to get planned out and interior design has to be kept in mind. But it actually applied."
"Speaker 1","01;25;59;05","01;26;24;23","And so not that those are the stages of a scientific theory, but we're closer to the beginning. And you're right, that now there actually is enough to kind of take a bite out of and to build within. And then for those who think that there's like little grounding or they want to make almost hyper Bolick claims about how little is known, my questions would be, first off, relative to which body of literature that's ongoing."
"Speaker 1","01;26;25;02","01;26;55;02","And the second question would be have you read the 2007 SPM textbook? Because that was 14 years ago and it demonstrates in a little bit like a textbook form which is more classical than the pre print back and forth. That's a lot of the basis. And so there isn't any philosophy in that textbook, but you'll find a lot of new approaches for thinking about cause and effect and dynamic systems modeling and what we can do with neuroimaging and behavioral data and heterogeneous data sets."
"Speaker 1","01;26;55;20","01;27;10;09","So awesome points, Dave, if you want to unmute and try again and then blue I'm not sure why you're still muted. Dave. There we go. OK, yeah."
"Speaker 2","01;27;10;26","01;28;09;24","OK. One of the really crucial benefits of doing the de-confliction that you are correctly insisting on is that the real essence of what's in scientific thinking or technical thinking or skill development is the analogies among different realms of thought, realms of action. If you conflate entropy with the universal tendency you don't see, you can't think about the actual differentiations of instruments that that measure entropy, cosmological ideas that discuss and structure our thinking about a different realm of activity."
"Speaker 2","01;28;10;01","01;28;58;09","And you certainly aren't going to see the analogy between those analogies but once you start pulling stuff apart, then you can start doing mapping in detail and find what applications you can relate through the instrumental or realistic interpretation of any of these meta concepts you can start listing tables of correspondences. You can make Gadahn an expert on that, and you can make literally lab tests and draw out paradoxes where the prediction from one wing of the metaphor looks like it ought to align with another with the results in another wing and don't at that point."
"Speaker 2","01;28;58;09","01;29;26;05","Now you can start thinking about what it is that we don't know yet. So yeah. Yeah. Could we keep keep ripping the stuff apart when it's been conflated. Phlogiston model a lot of real stuff and it was also harmful. The notion that things fall because they belong down, that predicts a lot of things. It model a lot of stuff and it interfered with work that needed to be done."
"Speaker 2","01;29;26;15","01;29;26;27","Thank you."
"Speaker 1","01;29;27;25","01;29;30;13","Thanks, Dave. Nice points. Blue."
"Speaker 2","01;29;32;03","01;29;54;26","This is great because it just ties in everything that Dave said, but I really wanted to respond to Manuel. So, you know, I don't necessarily have a perspective on whether we want active inference to be something solid and concrete like a lot or something that's continually growing and evolving. And so I just posed as a question like where do we really want it to to end?"
"Speaker 2","01;29;55;21","01;30;15;24","I think that just like Dave said, you know, there's always like we had the laws of physics, right? Like Newtonian physics. We had all of these laws they were in place. They worked for a long time and then quantum, right? So so I mean, we don't know what is going to be underneath when we when we finally define an absolute there could be another layer that we just aren't seeing that."
"Speaker 2","01;30;16;06","01;30;41;05","So I think that, you know, just like Newtonian physics and quantum physics, we need to look at where the context is. Right. And so there might be an act of inference, a contextual barrier that we can say, you know, active inference is this version of active inference is applicable in this context. And there might be some other deeper, different version that applies in other contexts."
"Speaker 2","01;30;44;25","01;30;45;06","Too."
"Speaker 1","01;30;45;16","01;31;13;04","And I think that's partly how the the specific projects and deliverables and questions are about ground us like with Dave's example about entropy. Yeah, you can probably abstract entropy and start applying it to different domains. And what would psychological entropy, what would spiritual entropy be? Or you might be concerned with the car that you're building and you're like, OK, I have a preference for the more miles per gallon and less of this other emission."
"Speaker 1","01;31;13;09","01;31;47;23","And then entropy in an applied context is being pursued instrumentally with literal instruments and scientists are not just all purpose thinkers. When the scientist hat is on, we're instrumentalists. And actually that makes me curious about one of your other papers. The anticipating brain is not a scientist. So what was that about? Because the part in this paper about how the cognitive scientist is in a unique position, as the meta modeler reminded me a lot of this line of research."
"Speaker 1","01;31;47;23","01;31;53;19","So maybe could you summarize that or what was that paper about and how has that been developed and what you're exploring now?"
"Speaker 4","01;31;55;11","01;32;49;12","Oh, great. Yeah, so yeah, I think you hear me say, yeah, I'm to come in and I only now realize that they use the scientist metaphor in both this paper and in the, in the old words and I think here it's very clear to distinguish between models and models of models, models and animals, models and scientists models. And they have different kind of properties and in the anticipating brain paper and we make the same distinction between a scientist model of the environment and animals models of environment, and that the distinction is more in terms of what are the, the aims, so to say, of the model and where you might say, well, in the epistemic"
"Speaker 4","01;32;49;12","01;33;13;27","practice of science, then the aim of the scientist model is to get as accurate representation or inference or whatever. And from the outside world as possible. So it's kind of a more epistemic process in which the ultimate aim is to to figure out something about the world. And now transposing that question to the, to the animal, the problem is a different one."
"Speaker 4","01;33;13;27","01;33;51;09","It's not like depending on what's out there in the world is secondary to how can you make what's out there in a world compatible with the kind of existence that I am having or am and so there the epistemic story stand in the surface of something like flourishing or staying alive or homeostasis or so. And there might be cases where actually and I think this is also related to the kind of the theory of action that's there, like where inferring what's the exact state of the world is not actually the right thing to do, but changing the world so as to make it conform to your expectations is the better way to do that."
"Speaker 4","01;33;51;09","01;34;20;23","So so the kind of the epistemic aims in both settings, the scientist setting and the animal in these environments I think are or the scientists in everyday life setting are slightly different. And so that was also the counter the kind of a very prevalent kind of Helmholtz ion models of perception that are there in the radical literature in it and the processing mixture where you say like, well, first and foremost the problem for an agent or any agent is to infer what's out there in the world."
"Speaker 4","01;34;20;27","01;34;30;17","And I think ATP shows they know that that's, that's the secondary problem. The problem is staying alive and interesting."
"Speaker 1","01;34;30;17","01;34;44;16","And that's so funny because what do they say in Legacy Science, publish or perish. So it's also not thrive and communicate and mentor. It's actually still phrased in a life or death way."
"Speaker 4","01;34;45;04","01;34;49;01","That's all it might be. And then the heat wave on the setting signs. Indeed, that might be true. Yeah."
"Speaker 1","01;34;49;28","01;35;21;29","Yes. Alliteration plus competition, just irresistible. Any other thoughts otherwise? There's a couple of other points that would be awesome to kind of just in the last 20 minutes open up and then I'll re upload this full video we can all think about some questions that we're having. I guess one distinction that is clearly key from where you place it in the paper and the emphasis and everything is inference with versus inference within a model."
"Speaker 1","01;35;22;19","01;35;43;01","And this is going to sound like a subtlety because it's two letters that you're appending to the word, but there are two letters that make a big difference. So what would be sort of the map territory distinction? How do we think about inference with and within a model? How do we speak clearly about different things that are happening."
"Speaker 4","01;35;49;02","01;36;06;09","Who's going to take their word like, OK, OK, I think I insist on keeping in this distinction throughout all phases of the co-writing process. So I guess I'm responsible for not also explaining it coherently."
"Speaker 4","01;36;09;00","01;36;43;00","I think the key distinction there is, is the distinction between a kind of everyday wave understanding and modeling of saying, well, a model can be used by something external to the model to model something that's even external to that. Right? So I guess perhaps the notion of construal might actually also be something, right? There is, there is, there is, there is a scientist or there is a practice or so that that construes and relates a model to some target phenomenon so that you can and will predict analysis or whatsoever."
"Speaker 4","01;36;44;03","01;37;22;27","And I think that's our everyday way of thinking about scientific inference and then especially in the, in the life as we know it, it to the person who hasn't written a paper or something quite different is is happening right. So so in most of the processing literature this distinction that really made it explicit but in 2013 that analysis is is not making clear how an agent or an animal can use a model to do something but shows makes a model and shows how somehow within that model identification between agent and environment starts to emerge."
"Speaker 4","01;37;23;11","01;37;53;08","And because of the demo case and a an inferential relationship between agent and environment starts to emerge. So there's now there's not there's not a user of that model but somehow within a model there inferential relationship starts to starts to emerge. And so that's where the inference within a model that the emergence of the inferences within that model and the other one is something outside of the model is using the model to predict something or something that that's supposed to be this distinction."
"Speaker 4","01;37;53;10","01;38;02;21","Maybe, maybe you think about a better clearer semantic separation between those two concepts that that should be could be a path."
"Speaker 1","01;38;04;11","01;38;52;14","For the for different kinds of I guess I want to say processes, but the four different ways in which inference is sometimes deployed to be talking about generative processes and generative models. You know, the generative process is what actually the air moving through the house in the temperature as it's actually changing and then the generative model, the predictive thermometer and there's other work that I know some of you have done about connecting systems that are probably less than lifelike and realizing that we can frame them in a cybernetic context using these same constructs which is really an argument by demonstration almost about the philosophical points that you're trying to show."
"Speaker 1","01;38;53;04","01;39;15;21","It's like if somebody were making big claims about cybernetic systems and then someone said, Oh, but it applies to a thermometer, so either you need to pull back your claims a little bit or it's fine if you think thermometers have this attribute like regret that you're going to be studying, but you don't get to say that the thermometer is of course, incentive, and yet it's doing what you say is granting us sentiments."
"Speaker 1","01;39;16;11","01;39;46;28","And these kinds of distinctions are not within active inference proper. It's actually just about clarifying and research directions and learning about how we work on these projects that go beyond the understanding of one person. Because there are a lot of technical elements who kind of remind us of that earlier thread, which is how are we all going to be learning about this and working within it and communicating within it when one could go deep into variational inference."
"Speaker 1","01;39;46;28","01;40;26;11","But, you know, I'm not going to be the one to find that there are some deep quirk or assumption in variational inference that invalidates some other technical piece of the puzzle. So how do we almost kind of like the doors in the Titanic, like separate different parts of our model so that we at least know if one of them is going to be unsupported at this moment or is is apt to even fail, that there isn't a cascading failure for our actual direction, but rather there's something that's modular that could be pulled out yet."
"Speaker 4","01;40;26;17","01;41;05;01","I think there's lots of things that are lots of things about principle that are actually pretty trivial. And so lots of things that actually pretty speculative and and high stakes. And indeed, having some of the demarcations that we make in our paper, I guess allows you to separate some some empirical methods that there are that are useful and a kind of non non non-controversial, a separated indeed from from what we call bu the kind of blanket oriented ontology, which is a big idea which which we are kind of skeptical about at least I am."
"Speaker 4","01;41;05;01","01;41;36;22","I'm not sure I speak for all the coauthors, but at least it has need, has a different epistemic status than the everyday bread and butter ecosystem. Inference that that people are using. And so separating those out a little bit, using the different concepts and different assumptions that are made by each each approach probably also can give us a better overview of the field and the things you need to buy into it and don't necessarily need to buy into if you want to work with that tool."
"Speaker 1","01;41;37;10","01;41;39;03","Dave, then anyone else raising that?"
"Speaker 2","01;41;41;00","01;42;00;27","Yeah, I'm going to ask a question not about status or stature or number of papers. What influence has the personality of Carl Freston had on the development of these fields?"
"Speaker 5","01;42;06;26","01;42;57;26","I want to go and break another lance light in in his favor I haven't worked like directly with Carl unless like on really small projects, but is just an extremely nice and kind person. I think it is as simple as that. Like it is really hard not to to get along with him on some level so I mean, I want to be positive in a sense that to say that it is really hard not to not to want to work with such a nice person if we want to joke about that, like trying to stay away from from his influence and his, you know, his status across fields he's just an incredibly nice person."
"Speaker 5","01;42;58;09","01;43;11;19","And even if sometimes there are some misunderstandings in communications, there is I don't know. There is a sense in which you feel like you want to work with that person."
"Speaker 1","01;43;14;09","01;43;25;15","I agree. And also beyond niceness is reflected through action and and mentorship and collaboration. But also it's. Yes. Yeah. And and anyone else as well."
"Speaker 4","01;43;26;19","01;43;52;00","You know, I can only second that I spend some time in and at UCLA in in this group, I guess for for for outsiders and for brand things. And so you might think sometimes that that those able to speak a bit too well right. So listen to him if you don't really understand what he's saying, it sounds it sounds enigmatic."
"Speaker 4","01;43;52;00","01;44;32;06","It sounds it sounds fascinating and it sounds it is. But it also sounds incredibly clever. Right. And so I guess in terms of branding, right? I mean, what what what what we see a lot now is that there is a kind of a circle of people who really understand the stuff that's going on and the group of people who are also put off by it a little bit because it seems so intimidating from the outside and and I think that that's something that MPP as a whole can do struggles with a little bit, that it might seem a little bit esoteric if you're if you're not familiar with with with with key works or with"
"Speaker 4","01;44;32;06","01;44;48;13","with Evan working that for a while. And I think that that's partly sparked by just this this kind of synthetic that the lectures that Kyle's able to get there are all over YouTube. And so and they're they're hard to get on the first go. Yeah."
"Speaker 1","01;44;49;10","01;45;24;10","And it's also notable that the 2013 single author paper life as we know it it serves as a lightning rod for a lot of critique as does his 2010 paper unified brain theory and they're both I hesitate to call them old because they're less than a decade old in some cases. But in terms of our current environment there's been a lot between then and now and also their single author and so let him speak and represent what he wants to share."
"Speaker 1","01;45;24;28","01;45;45;01","Just like every author and collaboration and then there's a ton of nuance and a lot of development that's happened. And I totally also resonate with the criticism that many raise, or at least the point that it is a rapidly developing field. So it's like, Oh, active inference can't deal with long time steps. Aha. But then have you thought about sophisticated active inference?"
"Speaker 1","01;45;45;07","01;46;11;08","And so it does become a little bit of this sort of like criticism, development, criticism development, which actually reminds me of Daniel Tenet's book, Darwin's Dangerous Idea. And he says evolution by natural selection is the theory that's describing itself because it is improving itself. And someone says, well, evolution doesn't include ecology or development or evolution. OK, well then we make eco evil and then we go from there."
"Speaker 1","01;46;11;17","01;46;47;05","And so there's sort of a little bit of a blurriness between who's the detractor and who's actually out in front pulling theory where it needs to be. And that's also where cognitive diversity comes into play. And just we're all simple blue. And then anyone else."
"Speaker 2","01;46;50;09","01;47;29;03","So just to kind of piggyback off of what you said, I always think, you know, especially in our culture, we have like this idea that there's a leader or a creator. And in this situation, it's called Christian, right? So is there a leader or a creator of the field or has it become it's singlehandedly invented the light bulb?"
"Speaker 2","01;47;29;03","01;47;41;06","That's not how it happened. But but, you know, we kind of think this way and we've kind of placed first Preston in the leadership role here. But but really, I think that there's a lot going on underneath the curtains or underneath the blankets. Right."
"Speaker 1","01;47;42;20","01;48;29;09","I agree. And it's it's a meta problem with science communication, like the 2018 Wired article, which the title a singular person and about something about their Indo cortex, not this dedicated researcher has built a network and tools for 30 years that are inspiring the next generation of researchers to make impact does it fit quite as well in the headline."
"Speaker 1","01;48;29;18","01;49;01;02","And so it's like a communication and a meta communication question communicating about how these fields actually work and yeah there's going to be a lot of interesting times ahead on those frontiers I think any sort of closing thoughts or maybe we could go around and just give a last little thought or something that we're excited or curious about for next week's discussion when I'll fix it and we'll be able to include participants live also."
"Speaker 1","01;49;01;02","01;49;14;23","Thanks again. Well, for for staying up late we'll have Martin Beale on April 28th and that will be at a better time. I think it's 2 hours earlier than this one so Stephen than anyone else."
"Speaker 3","01;49;16;12","01;49;45;12","Yeah I'd just like to thank you for a really powerful presentation and answering a lot of difficult questions. And also I suppose what I will take away is this question about the blanket orientated ontology. I think it's really good to have that, to have that, to have that, to have that, to have that, to have that, to have that to have that, to have that, to have that, to have that."
"Speaker 3","01;49;46;05","01;49;46;12","It's a."
