we'll be able to

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,680
ask some cool questions and anyone who's

45
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,600
watching feel free to ask a question in

46

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,720
with introductions

51
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,880
and then if people want to call out a

52
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,240
specific figure

53
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,520
or a specific question uh or especially

54
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,759
reference a quotation in the text

55
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,280
or just something that they've prepared

56
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,119
that would be really great

57
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,600
so we'll just go around and introduce

58

introduction so anyone

120
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,680
please feel free to raise your hand and

121
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,600
start off some of the warm-up questions

122
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,360
are what is something that you're

123
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,360
excited about today could be related to

124
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,080
the

125
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,479
paper or tangentially what's something

126
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,479
that you liked or remembered about the

127
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,600
paper

128
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,240
or from our discussion last week and

129
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,759
what is something that you're

130
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,520
wondering about or you'd like to have

131
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,199
resolved by the end of today's

132
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,240
discussion

133
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,560
maybe another question would be what

134
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,919
kind of momentum

135
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,560
or what kind of next steps would make

136
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,360
sense you know

137
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,360
emerging from this whatever we end up

138
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,800
resolving or not

139
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,680
in the next conversation where will that

140
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,800
take us

141
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,280
in our research or in our practice

142
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,000
journeys i guess

143
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,479
so joe and then anyone who'd like to

144
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,479
speak

145
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,240
uh thanks um do i need to lower my hand

146
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,840
again or is that done

147
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,720
uh it's just good good great uh cool so

148
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,320
i missed the discussion last week so

149
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,440
some of this may have already been

150
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,240
covered but

151
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,919
one thing which relates a little bit to

152
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,280
something we were discussing just before

153
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,520
we went live here and i think is kind of

154
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,520
um a broadening of the points we wanted

155
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,800
to make in the paper which i which i

156
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,440
wonder about

157
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,639
is uh what what the

158
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,720
if if active inference can be kind of

159
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,400
arbitrarily applied to any given case

160
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,680
given the right kind of setup and

161
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,960
parameters and so on

162
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,960
um what does this mean for its future

163
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,880
application

164
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,560
is this so far as it's too general or is

165
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,080
this a strength insofar as it can be

166
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,639
used

167
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,479
anywhere really um and this this i think

168
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,520
is kind of lurking underneath some of

169
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,560
the points we make in the paper

170
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,639
that's a more general

171
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,800
cool so can active inference apply to

172
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,960
anything and everything would that be a

173
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,560
strength or would that be

174
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,840
a weakness awesome question

175
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,880
any other thoughts anyone wants to

176
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,080
raise your hand yet steven

177
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,520
i'd be interested to um learn more about

178
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,639
the way that

179
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,199
the pearl blankets and the fristen

180
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,080
blankets

181
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,680
um interpretations might be useful

182
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,440
in applications and how that might

183
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,919
inform you know the way that modeling's

184
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:36,319
done

185
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,479
so that that's kind of exciting for me

186
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,720
so that's one thing that i'm i'm looking

187
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,199
forward to

188
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,759
great question as well the um

189
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,080
distinguishing different kinds of

190
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,000
blankets and even pulling back to like

191
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,400
what kind of metaphors will we use and

192
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,720
how will we relate technical terms

193
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,720
to different settings different

194
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,240
practices those are some

195
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,560
big questions we want to address scott

196
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,440
and then anyone else

197
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,160
yeah i'm interested in all in both of

198
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,680
those questions or all that

199
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,039
aspects and then also the frizzle of the

200
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,479
paradox of those two

201
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,680
questions so it's a chicken and egg

202
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,039
question of frist and

203
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,680
enough first of active inference in a

204
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,479
sense

205
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,479
right we're observing something we're

206
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,120
projecting it out as a teleology onto

207
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,080
the world

208
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,360
and then asking if it's a good teleology

209
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,919
right so it's so in a way it's like if

210
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,680
you go for david bowm idea that

211
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,800
all reality is first a thought that

212
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,880
includes the realities that we don't

213
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,280
create entirely but that we project

214
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,360
so to one of the questions i have so as

215
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,160
a i was a practicing lawyer for 30 years

216
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,759
or 25 years ish and when i see active

217
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,319
inference

218
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,120
i think contracts and so i think of it

219
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,080
as biomimicry

220
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,440
of what we can do socially and project

221
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,240
further with real intention to control

222
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,759
systems

223
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,240
so that so what i'm wondering is and i

224
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,759
think both are valid

225
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,479
but because so ultimately is it a notion

226
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,919
i'll use the word biomimicry but

227
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,199
obviously i don't mean in the physical

228
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,319
sense

229
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,840
but from us to learn from deep time

230
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,720
what we can do as biological organisms

231
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,440
to better

232
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,919
organize ourselves despite our social

233
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,559
elements so to get back to our biology

234
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,599
in a way and and

235
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,000
maybe organize ourselves a bit better

236
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,440
and more resiliently

237
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,760
with reference to that anyway it's a

238
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,360
that's the frizzle i'm interested in is

239
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,799
the both the cause

240
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,519
being upward and downward with regard to

241
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,399
active inference

242
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,680
thank you cool and

243
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,080
connecting the micro and the macro it's

244
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,800
sort of

245
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,279
sometimes it's laid out abstractly like

246
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,040
multiple spatial scales that are nested

247
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,640
within each other or time scales

248
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,880
but then when we talk about action and

249
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,920
we have the example of

250
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,240
sort of the person in a maze and you

251
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,839
take a step back so that you can go

252
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,120
around

253
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,519
that's the kind of settings where we

254
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,399
might want to

255
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,399
apply active inference where the initial

256
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,440
action

257
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,920
might be non-linear or away from the

258
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,480
goal

259
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,080
in a sense but it's part of a policy

260
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,519
trajectory that actually gets you where

261
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,920
you want to be so and the other

262
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,680
the other part of it is with the markov

263
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,680
blankets being a bayesian

264
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,120
notion because of the beige then you say

265
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,399
oh when does bayes

266
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,640
when is bayes effective well that

267
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,000
becomes a pretty broad

268
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,320
application right because i always say

269
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,000
to people to get them in the space i

270
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,279
always say if you're in a

271
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,279
dark forest with no flashlight you don't

272
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,640
run full speed ahead

273
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,080
you stick out your hand in front of your

274
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,640
face right and that's basically active

275
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,200
inference

276
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,040
as i say you don't you know you want to

277
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,240
know what's in front of you before you

278
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,760
run into a tree

279
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,160
right so anyway good stuff thank you

280
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,680
any other yep yellow and then anyone

281
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,680
else

282
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,800
yeah so uh i think last week we ended

283
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,279
the

284
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,480
uh discussion on shannon's point on what

285
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,320
it means to have a folk

286
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,920
book psychological form of active

287
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,079
inference and i think it related to the

288
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,560
uh to the tension between needing to

289
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,839
have a very deep mathematical

290
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,600
understanding of an increasingly

291
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,240
kind of developing field of mass and

292
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,200
applying

293
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,480
these kind of more broad set of ideas uh

294
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,399
to a particular kind of case so i

295
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,640
thought this was a a point to explore

296
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,320
further and and think about how this

297
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,240
would look like this uh this

298
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,079
more folk psychological way of

299
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,360
understanding active inference

300
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,240
using the concepts maybe without the

301
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,800
nitty-gritty details of mathematics

302
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,920
shannon yeah

303
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,800
um i was hoping that we could bring that

304
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,360
up today

305
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,279
and maybe ask joe's take um and

306
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,600
also sort of if we're if we're talking

307
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,800
about something like

308
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,399
a fristen blanket and that's supposed to

309
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,440
be a real demarcation of a system

310
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,240
or a pearl blanket which is supposed to

311
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,880
just be

312
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,240
how we describe the system

313
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,880
um then maybe in this you know folks

314
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,079
psychological notion

315
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,720
of active inference or talking about how

316
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,360
a phenomenon appears to

317
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,560
this person in a crowd versus another

318
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,480
person in a crowd where both phenomenons

319
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,440
are real

320
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,279
but depending on which one you decide to

321
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,120
model you'll get a different picture of

322
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,680
how the crowd's dynamics are changing

323
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,720
and we could

324
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,320
model that mathematically but just as

325
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,839
easily someone in the crowd could have

326
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,519
an informed notion of what it is that

327
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,480
they're

328
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,440
receiving and how it seems that the

329
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,040
markov blankets

330
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,639
however they are are emerging around the

331
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,399
crowds in certain ways

332
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,839
and you could start having a discussion

333
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,200
that

334
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,600
maybe you can you know translate from

335
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,760
the scientists doing the fancy math

336
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,920
and the person in the crowd who's just

337
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,319
existing

338
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,200
thanks very interesting steven than

339
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,760
anyone else

340
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,480
yeah just building on that i think i'm

341
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:16,959
also

342
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,000
curious because there seems to be

343
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,079
there's two sides there seems to be this

344
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,480
primordial soup which is referred to in

345
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,279
the paper

346
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,240
as well and the variational free energy

347
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,600
and how that can

348
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,800
self-organize um and then and that

349
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,639
happens at smaller distances

350
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,880
and then these longer distances where

351
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,560
you've got expected free energy because

352
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,399
the organism is seen

353
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,720
into the environment with sensory

354
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,680
information

355
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,519
and often it's used in these partially

356
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,160
observable observable markov decision

357
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,200
processes

358
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,120
for modeling that and i'll be just

359
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,800
curious if

360
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,040
those two domains of modeling which seem

361
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,639
to come up and i know there's more but

362
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,040
those two seem to come up a lot in the

363
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,320
literature how that pans out maybe with

364
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,839
some of these questions of

365
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,079
you know is there an intuitive feeling

366
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,279
of how

367
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,200
the morphology is moving towards a

368
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,959
target which could be that deeper sort

369
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,480
of knowing of the body

370
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,519
and then there's this kind of partially

371
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,440
observable decision process which is

372
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,279
kind of cognitive

373
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,600
sort of looking in the world and which

374
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,240
ones are more or less

375
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,279
like markovian in some ways and how does

376
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,360
that affect how we try and

377
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,639
uh play with them which is

378
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,639
or model them or play with them which i

379
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,320
think shannon was saying in a way is

380
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,600
in a good way is exploring these ideas

381
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,560
phenomenologically

382
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,040
thank you scott and then anyone else

383
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,440
the stevens notion got me thinking about

384
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,360
the notion of glass

385
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,120
in glass they frequently talk about

386
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,199
first order second order third order

387
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,160
order um and so you have that amorphous

388
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,160
material it's semi-amorphous solid right

389
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,079
so it's not really crystalline

390
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,519
not really liquid so it has these orders

391
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,839
that are discernible through different

392
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,120
framings of

393
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,480
maths and it made me think about stephen

394
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,920
when you were saying that cognitive

395
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,120
glass

396
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,240
in a sense that we have this orders of

397
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,680
order that we project onto

398
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,120
disorder and so we those

399
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,639
teleologies ultimately roll up into

400
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,560
things like sovereignty

401
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,279
which is seen as perfect order in the

402
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,279
abstract right the sovereign does not

403
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,639
need to ask for permission or

404
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,600
forgiveness

405
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,000
because it is the quintessence the fifth

406
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,959
element

407
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,600
right it is not earthly so we have this

408
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,480
metaphysics that happens at the

409
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,000
bottom or top of the turtle stack

410
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,279
depending on which direction you're

411
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,160
going

412
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,920
and so and i think that's kind of nice

413
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,000
here hey blue

414
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,600
i think that's kind of nice here when we

415
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,040
look at order

416
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,399
and abstraction and the last point about

417
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,199
it is that

418
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,399
you know kandinsky the artist said that

419
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,079
violent societies yield abstract art

420
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,199
and so one of the things i always

421
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,519
wondered is is abstraction the reverse

422
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,199
of violence

423
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,320
so if we look at sovereignty as being a

424
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,760
total abstraction

425
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,120
as i just described maybe sovereignty

426
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,920
is also total violence and mills said

427
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,399
that

428
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,320
sovereign has the monopoly of legitimate

429
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,440
violence

430
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,680
so anyway those are few ideas about

431
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,600
maybe we're looking at cognitive glass

432
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,639
here with different

433
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,320
orders of order that we can

434
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,639
project onto the system and maybe that

435
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,000
helps us

436
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,240
when those when we look at that order as

437
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,160
levels of abstraction as you get further

438
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,839
from the first and second order into the

439
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,360
third and fourth order

440
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,600
maybe it starts to be something that

441
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,040
starts to yield a more

442
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,360
projective or teleological element thank

443
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,800
you

444
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,440
thank you scott dean and then anyone

445
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,600
else

446
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,079
yeah so i i wasn't part of the

447
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,040
the tile formation last week i was kind

448
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,480
of in the background and then

449
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,120
lost it but i did go back and watch the

450
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,040
the whole thing and

451
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,839
i'm hoping that uh chris has a few more

452
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,839
things to say today about construal

453
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,279
because um

454
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,240
that to me is kind of the the inflection

455
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:22,880
point and

456
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,399
he was starting to talk about some of

457
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,360
those things and the separation between

458
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,040
uh what did he have model and target

459
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,240
i think at the end of the day um if we

460
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,040
were to give a lay person or some i

461
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,680
think the

462
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,160
term folk has been used i think if we

463
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,079
give them a mark off blanket and a pearl

464
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,199
blanket

465
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,199
um a lot of people will go how does that

466
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,000
change my basic question which is how do

467
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,600
i get the world

468
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,519
i think that's what all of us here are

469
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,519
trying to do and i think

470
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,680
for a lot of people who aren't even

471
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,240
aware of what a markup like it is

472
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,120
or free energy principle is they still

473
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,359
want that basic question answered

474
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,919
so i'm really interested to find out

475
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:08,959
today

476
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,640
how the paper moves us to a place where

477
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,240
that becomes easier

478
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,160
that the obstacles to getting the answer

479
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,319
to how do i get the world

480
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,359
suddenly flatten and become

481
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,958
i don't know more familiar

482
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,119
thanks dean and a thought on the

483
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,039
cognitive glass and what you just said

484
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,360
there so framing it in big terms about

485
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,679
sense making sense making about the

486
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,120
world as well as about

487
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,360
active inference is really helpful and

488
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,799
scott when you mentioned the cognitive

489
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,679
glass

490
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,160
i thought about oobleck it might be

491
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,679
called different things different places

492
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,760
but it's cornstarch and water

493
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,480
and so when you slap it really hard it's

494
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,160
like a resilient boundary and your hand

495
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,600
comes away dry and it's like you're

496
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,720
hitting a piece of

497
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,360
concrete but then if you go very slowly

498
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,440
it kind of is like a liquid so it's an

499
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,160
amorphous

500
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,799
solid like the glass now the boundary

501
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,080
between the air

502
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,960
and the oobleck is something that is

503
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,480
real about the world

504
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,559
and so there's a distinction there but

505
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,240
it's almost like depending on how the

506
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,760
boundary is crossed

507
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,840
not even like two different types of

508
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,440
things they're both touch

509
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,280
but it's actually the dynamics of the

510
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,600
stimuli that dictate

511
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,120
whether the response is going to be very

512
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,480
stubborn and more like a solid

513
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,960
or whether it will be very giving and

514
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,640
again it's not like it's light versus

515
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,120
sound

516
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,880
to different sensory inputs this is

517
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,520
different quantitative differences

518
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,080
within one interface modality and it

519
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,760
just shows how even when there's a clear

520
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,280
boundary in the world we

521
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,880
think like between um two phases still

522
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,960
the behavior of the interface can be

523
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,799
very dependent on the type of

524
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:49,840
interaction

525
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,439
so scott and then anyone else

526
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,240
made me think is it schenerian all the

527
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,960
way down

528
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,080
or do you have myriad schenerian

529
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,200
vectors intersecting and we see that as

530
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,840
complex

531
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,360
stephen then anyone else

532
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,080
i think you could also see this question

533
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,360
around the glass

534
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,640
because glass at a certain way of

535
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,600
freezing or becoming solid it doesn't

536
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,679
crystallize it doesn't break up it

537
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,520
you can still see through it so you've

538
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,039
got this question of it being part of

539
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:27,919
the medium

540
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,400
through which information can pass

541
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,440
because you can see through it but

542
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,559
there's also that

543
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,120
question around that goldilocks zone

544
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,679
when

545
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,240
if you want something to rearrange and

546
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,240
be the material like happens in the

547
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,840
primordial soup

548
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,679
kristen talks about there's a you know

549
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,919
too lower temperature it sort of

550
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,000
just becomes a solid too higher

551
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,679
temperature it's going to dissipate and

552
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:50,880
start to

553
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,480
so you've you've got a bit of the

554
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,880
overlap between you know internal

555
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,240
external solid

556
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,840
liquid um map territory it's kind of

557
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,159
interesting

558
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,520
yes different phases of the mind for

559
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,720
sense making too rigid or too fluid so

560
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,360
um joe then scott and then anyone else

561
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,200
who'd like to speak

562
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,039
uh thanks yeah so this this just made me

563
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,240
think that quite quite a few of these

564
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,840
points for me at least come back to a

565
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,960
kind of central

566
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,799
thing so so shannon's question about

567
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:23,760
folk psychology which i'm very

568
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,360
interested in or kind of folk

569
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,320
inference um questions about teleology

570
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:28,880
and

571
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,240
uh questions about you know whether

572
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,520
whether it's just something simple all

573
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,039
the way down which makes it look like

574
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,400
it's complex um

575
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,520
to me makes me think there's an

576
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,760
important question here about the role

577
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,159
of

578
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,400
um perspective and kind of viewing of

579
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,919
these systems going on and

580
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,159
and the way i see a lot of a lot of the

581
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,760
more teleological things that we project

582
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,960
onto these systems

583
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,440
um some even even like a boundary

584
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,960
perhaps it isn't really something we

585
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,480
should uh take to be in the system that

586
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,240
is rather just something we're

587
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,039
uh kind of modeling the system as having

588
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,480
so so it comes back to my target model

589
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,520
question as well um

590
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,039
so just just a central question here of

591
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,480
what we take to be really in the world

592
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,840
and what we take to just be

593
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,080
part of our understanding of the system

594
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,480
of a world

595
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,840
cool thank you scott and then anyone

596
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,280
else

597
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,840
i love the conversation because everyone

598
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,400
is moving

599
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,760
so nicely and easily and

600
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,480
with such uh facility back and forth

601
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,400
between the metaphysics and the physics

602
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,320
and appropriately and i don't i don't

603
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,840
mean this is not a diminishment right

604
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,039
because that

605
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,919
we're we're demarking those edges one of

606
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,679
the things here that occurred to me in

607
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,360
the last couple of notes is the notion

608
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,280
of seed crystals

609
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,720
because we are talking about phase

610
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,480
changes in system

611
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,520
behavior i think there's very often a

612
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,159
threshold

613
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,799
kind of trigger type of thing that

614
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,080
happens and so

615
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,159
that notion that stephen was bringing up

616
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,679
about phase

617
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,280
seems interesting and that was implicit

618
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,799
in what you were saying about cornstarch

619
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,760
as well

620
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,200
and so one of the things i think is

621
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,880
interesting is what do those

622
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,280
triggers look like and how are those

623
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,640
encoded

624
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,400
and in so when you're talking about

625
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,679
popular encoding

626
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,159
versus of some biological encoding so

627
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:08,720
let's say

628
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,600
my i'm triggered into anger but then

629
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
that anger takes on the symbol of a

630
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,240
certain

631
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,320
person in a political party or whatever

632
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,440
right there's different

633
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,080
stages of phase change that are

634
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,919
happening there of solidity

635
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,200
that are being offered to that

636
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,280
glass-like structure of order that are

637
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,640
being set up

638
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,360
by those externalities and it seems like

639
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,200
one of the things we just did a

640
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,600
paper on misinformation with a group and

641
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,280
one of the things that's so interesting

642
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,400
to me is it's not

643
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,440
a single event misinformation it's not a

644
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,000
binary

645
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,919
where oh i got misinformation how did i

646
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,280
how could i have prevented it like you

647
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,400
know getting hit on the head with a

648
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,360
stick

649
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,520
there's so many levels at which you can

650
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,000
address misinformation and intercede and

651
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,200
intervene

652
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,799
and this feels like one of those

653
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,039
exercises that perhaps

654
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,919
we can start to identify interventions

655
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:58,799
for

656
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,840
information integrity by looking at

657
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,240
where

658
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,720
might we put in seed crystals to put in

659
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,200
phase changes at stages

660
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,039
of that process to redirect it

661
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,360
in ways that are more socially or

662
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,360
productive or whatever the goal is of

663
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:15,840
the group

664
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,960
thank you thank you scott

665
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,440
steven and then anyone else

666
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,679
yeah i think this discussion also it

667
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,120
points to

668
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,440
an important consideration it brings in

669
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,200
the territory and the environment

670
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,039
because a lot of these phase changes

671
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,159
in the world out there but also maybe

672
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,919
unlike say the enamel of our teeth which

673
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,200
is maybe like glass

674
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,840
in a sort of what you would call an

675
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,400
equilibrium

676
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,799
state okay it's at a low energy state

677
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,640
it's just there right i don't expect it

678
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,559
to keep moving that much

679
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:49,840
but we're talking about these

680
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,120
non-equilibrium steady states

681
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,799
so you've got this kind of micro states

682
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,400
which things can revisit

683
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,600
from which some are more probable from

684
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,080
which

685
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,520
there's attractor states which becomes

686
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,520
these macro states which

687
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,559
then the organism at different

688
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,480
scales is visiting so this is

689
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,240
interesting because there's both going

690
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:12,640
on

691
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,120
you know i think sometimes everything's

692
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,880
non-equilibrium steady state but

693
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,559
you know i'm holding the computer here

694
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,919
it's pretty thermodynamic equilibrium

695
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,640
object you know i'm i'm in that world

696
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,840
even if my body

697
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,039
has a lot of non-equilibrium dynamics

698
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,480
going on so

699
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,480
that maybe plays out in some of these

700
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,960
questions

701
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,400
thanks steven yep a lot of uh

702
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,720
parallels analogies cross mapping

703
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,440
between

704
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,640
information and thermodynamics

705
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,520
and it's unsurprising i guess because

706
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,360
there's a lot of groundwork there but it

707
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,880
really is a fruitful

708
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,919
intersection maybe we can just remind

709
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,279
ourselves of some of the questions that

710
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:55,919
we had

711
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,039
from last week and then we can

712
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,880
just continue walking along so anyone

713
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,120
just raise a hand

714
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,840
so uh these were like loosely structured

715
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,240
by

716
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,559
topic but we had big questions how much

717
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:09,440
mathematics

718
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,159
is required to understand or work with

719
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,600
free energy principle

720
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,080
and active inference and just how shall

721
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:16,880
we speak

722
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,799
and work clearly on this issue

723
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,960
then we had a few questions on a

724
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,000
philosophical side we recalled

725
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,039
the papers of mel andrews and

726
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,760
anes hippolyto and thomas vanesse which

727
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,159
were

728
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,279
a footnote in this paper as sort of

729
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,000
relevant contemporary work so definitely

730
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,840
on the philosophical side i'm sure we

731
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,320
could

732
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,520
um hear any thoughts about

733
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,240
what next steps are on that line of

734
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,440
research

735
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,760
and this question of how to think about

736
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,039
blankets for groups

737
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,279
you know if it's groups all the way down

738
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,440
then what's wrong with

739
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,080
throwing blankets over groups but what

740
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,520
kind of blankets

741
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,559
and what kind of groups also blue if you

742
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,200
want to

743
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,960
introduce and give any thoughts that's

744
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,640
cool too and

745
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,520
of course questions about what's real or

746
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,760
not

747
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,080
um we had a few themes arising

748
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,360
about again about math and about

749
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,720
how there is um

750
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,200
there's multi-directional dialogue with

751
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,559
active inference and other

752
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,600
fields so what happens when we

753
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,720
cross over between different areas

754
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,080
scott and then anyone else

755
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,279
so i want to talk about markov flags for

756
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,320
a second

757
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,039
and what i mean is the flag of amsterdam

758
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,520
with the three x's

759
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,559
my understanding is from a tour guide

760
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,799
that the x's stand for fire plague

761
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,919
and flood and so

762
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,080
if that let's assume that for a minute

763
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,880
and the idea was if you see that flag

764
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,880
you better follow the club rules on

765
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,880
preventing fire plague and flood

766
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,720
because that's what we do here in this

767
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,080
area in amsterdam

768
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,159
okay so to me that is a markov blanket

769
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,919
because what you're doing is you're

770
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,600
saying hey

771
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,559
we are projecting this out come join the

772
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,440
club

773
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,840
we are doing beijing analysis on how to

774
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,279
prevent cholera

775
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:29,120
and floods and fire in the city limits

776
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,600
and that's a the signal is there on top

777
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
of every building that is has an owner

778
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,320
who conforms to the rules

779
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,640
and so i went i wondered if we can do a

780
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,600
markov

781
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,120
blanket analysis on the amsterdam flag

782
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,039
as a markov flag

783
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,559
expressing and saying all ye who come

784
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,240
here right it's like diagon he's looking

785
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,000
for an honest man i'm looking for plague

786
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,240
preventing and flood preventing people

787
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,600
here so to me that's a

788
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,039
projection out in in in any other kind

789
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,720
of active inference we're projecting out

790
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,320
through a flag instead of sticking our

791
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,120
hand out to

792
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,240
search for a tree so that's active

793
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,080
and then i'm doing regulatory

794
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,600
enforcement

795
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,880
which seems to me to be a body that is

796
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,520
responding to non-conformity

797
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,760
among its members so could you comment

798
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,760
on whether that's a possibility

799
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,320
in terms of projection out of social

800
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,158
elements of markov blankets possible

801
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,919
any amsterdam resident

802
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,640
is welcome to respond uh shannon and

803
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,000
then anyone else who raised their hand

804
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,840
um but yeah so now we're talking about

805
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,720
something like

806
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,840
human of cumulative culture and our

807
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,559
evolution of signs and symbols and how

808
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:49,279
we

809
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,320
co-construct meaning in space so maybe

810
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,240
the flag if you don't know what it means

811
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,399
it's just the flag

812
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,799
um you might not even know it's a flag

813
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,080
if you see it painted somewhere it's

814
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,760
just something that looks cool and has

815
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,279
some shapes

816
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,120
but if you have been

817
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,320
raised or taken a tour i guess um

818
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,480
in the culture surrounded by the symbol

819
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,000
surrounded by the meaning

820
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,279
all of those small instances of

821
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,480
negotiating meaning and

822
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,480
like we talked about active semantic

823
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,919
inference i can't exactly remember what

824
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,600
that conversation was last week but this

825
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,840
seems like it could be similar sort of

826
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,840
adding meaning and if the flag doesn't

827
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,600
mean to the person you're interacting

828
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,640
with what you thought it would mean to

829
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,080
them you take

830
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,840
action in your world to make it mean the

831
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,039
thing to them that it means to you

832
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,120
um it's an interesting thread i like

833
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,600
that idea

834
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,720
also one thought on the uh flag before

835
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,480
we go to an amsterdam resident is like a

836
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,919
blanket you think about under the

837
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,440
blanket or inside the blanket like

838
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,039
there's a person or a blanket goes on a

839
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:55,679
bed

840
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,640
but a flag is also fabric and it's

841
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,000
flying in the wind

842
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,720
and the borders it delineates are not on

843
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,320
one side of the air versus the other

844
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,520
side of the air

845
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,320
but as the flag is animated by the niche

846
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,440
through winds

847
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,840
otherwise it's just on the flagpole it

848
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,399
delineates a social

849
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,520
barrier or social um demarcation

850
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,600
which is then cultured in a

851
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,279
intersubjectively negotiated

852
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,559
experience just like you brought up

853
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,559
shannon so yellow and then stephen

854
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,840
all right thanks um it's fascinating uh

855
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,000
i'm not sure i i i know this story yet

856
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,600
from the three crosses i i think i have

857
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,120
a different origin for it but maybe this

858
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,080
is the tour guide so

859
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,200
i'm not quite sure um i

860
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,440
i think this race is also points to to

861
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,880
one of the questions uh

862
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,559
joe was writing in the beginning right

863
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,159
which is in turn like

864
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,399
suppose we can give this analysis of the

865
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,799
flag of amsterdam at the markle blanket

866
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,200
and we can give an analysis of uh the

867
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,640
origin of life in terms of market

868
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,279
blankets

869
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,279
and and lots of things in between right

870
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,320
so what what what does this

871
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,559
multi-applicability

872
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,240
of uh micro blankets say it could one it

873
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,679
could point to a very

874
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,679
deep self similarity that runs through

875
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,840
nature at all possible skills

876
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,760
uh or or could mean that the toolbox is

877
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,080
is is in a sense to cause grains to to

878
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,919
so that it applies to everything but but

879
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,679
but you can't really make

880
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,279
uh the relevant differences right i mean

881
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,640
in a sense you would like to think

882
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,919
through what are the differences

883
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,279
indeed through a kind of uh uh

884
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,919
signs of group memberships in in in

885
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,240
social situations versus

886
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,360
uh more biological science versus a kind

887
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,880
of self-organization self-organization

888
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,080
in physics and i think that that's

889
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,600
that's kind of the tension between the

890
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,320
kind of

891
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,600
applicability to everything uh and and

892
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,200
how particularly you would like your

893
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,080
your theory to be

894
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,519
thanks so steven dan scott than anyone

895
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,600
else

896
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,919
i mean this is also brings that question

897
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,600
i think like we just mentioned there

898
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,000
around

899
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,799
where we put things in a markov blanket

900
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,120
where things are part of this

901
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,039
uh external states um hidden states

902
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,000
internal states because in some ways

903
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
from the markov blanket perspective the

904
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,360
sensory

905
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,320
states of the epithelia that the kind of

906
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,120
sensory organs is what's been stimulated

907
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,080
and it's inferring an external state in

908
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,600
the world

909
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,120
i.e the flag and that's

910
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,200
having an additional inference that the

911
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,360
flag has got this meaning

912
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,640
another level so um i'm not even sure

913
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,480
what the whole thing's called in some

914
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,679
ways because

915
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,279
is the blanket because the blanket is

916
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,000
dependent on connecting with external

917
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,360
and internal

918
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,159
but it's normally just those that part

919
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,360
of the

920
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,919
of the whole active inference dynamic

921
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,840
so i think that that becomes interesting

922
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,440
is where

923
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,440
what type of uh sensory

924
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,159
input information is within the blanket

925
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,840
biologically

926
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,159
and maybe that isn't quite the same as

927
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,039
what is

928
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,960
thought of when we start talking about

929
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,720
it and that might be good or maybe a

930
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,120
problem

931
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,200
thanks so scott then chris than anyone

932
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,200
else

933
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,440
this is uh this is fantastic this

934
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,480
discussion so

935
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,440
um i realized all of a sudden i thought

936
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:27,840
oh

937
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,120
wait a second i just realized that some

938
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,159
of these folks may

939
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,279
actually be empiricists and may believe

940
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,720
there is a a testable reality

941
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,640
out there i didn't because i'm not that

942
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,559
person

943
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,919
so i i made a living rhetoric

944
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,919
and a persuasive speech right as a

945
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,279
lawyer right

946
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,480
so for me it's all projection so i

947
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,039
realized

948
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,000
i was i was too diminishing of the

949
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,720
question

950
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,200
of whether there exists something out

951
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,480
there to test

952
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,080
and i was looking at and this whole

953
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,159
thing to me this has been a candy store

954
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,519
since a few months ago where i learned

955
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,320
about active inference because to me

956
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,839
it's all um about avoiding

957
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:15,520
avoidable harms among humans

958
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,239
and to the extent that active inference

959
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:18,960
is

960
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,800
universally uh assertable

961
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,119
then it has a rhetorical power that's

962
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,399
huge

963
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,839
right so if we can get people thinking

964
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,440
they're surrounded by active

965
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,159
inference blankets and then i say you

966
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,520
know

967
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,879
you don't have an active inference

968
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,399
blanket yet in the way you're doing

969
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:37,679
business with other people in your

970
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,280
supply chain or you don't have active

971
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,719
inference blanket yet in the way that

972
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,879
you're interacting among nation states

973
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,399
or you don't have active inference yet

974
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,639
in your food insecurity supply chain or

975
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,239
your cyber security all these other

976
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,679
things that i'm working on right now

977
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,760
contact tracing it's information systems

978
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,440
where because they're not within the

979
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,879
same

980
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,560
model then they have conflict

981
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,800
and those most of those are avoidable

982
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,240
harms because they're just humans

983
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,359
working out stuff

984
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:06,800
that we were separated for a hundred

985
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,400
thousand years when we migrated out of

986
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,680
africa and now we're getting back

987
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,520
together and trying to compare notes on

988
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,960
what we came up with

989
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,280
so the question or this assertion

990
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,320
is that it's interesting i to me

991
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,599
it's not that troubling a question of

992
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:24,320
whether these

993
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,800
exist or not and i'm and i've read lots

994
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,920
of philosophy and

995
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,079
i've been down the road there but

996
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,520
ultimately

997
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,640
it's the the i say yes and

998
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,560
on on that question of whether it exists

999
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,760
or not to me it's a provisional truth

1000
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,520
that's functional sufficiently

1001
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,440
functional so i'm not

1002
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,440
no longer curious about whether it has

1003
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,119
an existence separate from the human

1004
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,000
mind

1005
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,040
so that so take my comments

1006
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,240
with a salt lick not a grain of salt but

1007
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,920
a giant block of salt

1008
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,400
because i've realized i'm an old old

1009
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,320
person and i just don't care

1010
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,040
if it actually exists separately and i'm

1011
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,839
not saying that

1012
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,680
to say this conversation doesn't matter

1013
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,359
it's awesome but it's

1014
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:10,480
that that the dynamics of rhetoric

1015
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,599
are such that we can employ the thing to

1016
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,119
do good

1017
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,400
whether or not it's real

1018
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,359
so scott has litigated realism versus

1019
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:22,400
instrumentalism

1020
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,000
he's serving as the judge jury

1021
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,480
executioner lawyer

1022
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,640
um chris and then joe then blue

1023
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,359
yeah thanks a lot so um i think there's

1024
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,400
a

1025
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,280
like there's a there's a useful way to

1026
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,079
to think of the flag metaphor

1027
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,480
so to speak and to bring it a little bit

1028
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,240
closer maybe to to also what

1029
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,800
scott was saying now and and the paper

1030
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,480
itself

1031
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,720
so the question that the paper is trying

1032
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,760
to answer right

1033
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,800
it's kind of to what to what extent

1034
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,680
is the pristine blanket construct or the

1035
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,640
markov blanket

1036
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,640
construct as used by fristen a

1037
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,920
conventional

1038
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,599
thing so you know there are different

1039
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,240
kind of

1040
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,920
like you you can have different views of

1041
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,359
course about the metaphysics of

1042
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,440
mathematics and so on and so forth but

1043
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,680
generally there's some agreed rules

1044
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,079
about how maths works

1045
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,359
or certain branches of mathematics work

1046
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,920
and that's where the mark of blanket

1047
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,000
construct comes from right it comes from

1048
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,200
statistics and

1049
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,520
there's a clearly defined way of using

1050
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,680
it so the convention for using the mark

1051
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,800
of blankets

1052
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,640
is very clear it was introduced very

1053
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,560
clearly by judea pearl in

1054
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,680
his article in later his book at the

1055
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,960
break of 80s and 90s and there's no

1056
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,839
kind of mystery or you know there's no

1057
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,599
question about how it should be applied

1058
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,280
productively so

1059
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,359
whether or not you you think that

1060
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,200
science is after

1061
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,000
capturing the reality as it is or

1062
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,960
whether you think

1063
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,440
science only gives us approximate truths

1064
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,720
or some kind of

1065
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,400
you know approximate uh

1066
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,200
models of one of of what's out there

1067
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,200
that that doesn't matter

1068
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,119
what's really important for us i think

1069
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,280
and maybe the guys can also

1070
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,000
speak to that is that for mark of

1071
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,079
blankets there's a clear convention

1072
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,359
for how to deploy them and it's very

1073
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:21,920
clear

1074
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,680
what they are doing and what they can't

1075
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,440
give you whereas for

1076
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,599
the way fristen applies the notion first

1077
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:28,960
of all he kind of

1078
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,200
softens the convention the convention is

1079
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,079
less codified

1080
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,440
we can think we can say it's less clear

1081
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,400
to what extent they apply where and

1082
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,200
similarly

1083
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,599
it's less clear what you can get out of

1084
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,599
it right so this is the

1085
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,839
um this is kind of the problem so so

1086
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:48,000
stephen for example mentioned something

1087
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,839
about you know boundaries and the fact

1088
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,000
that whenever there's an interaction

1089
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,200
these ma mark of bl sorry these blankets

1090
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,320
let's leave the mark of part of the name

1091
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:58,960
out of it

1092
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,440
these blankets appear and or they can be

1093
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,480
found there

1094
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,119
and it's not entirely clear whether

1095
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,720
according to pristine there will be

1096
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,680
found

1097
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,680
at every uh in every place where we have

1098
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,520
an interaction between two systems for

1099
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,200
example or something like that right

1100
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,119
because the the the the rules uh

1101
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,640
in which they are applied are not as

1102
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,160
clear as as

1103
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,720
in the case of the original markov

1104
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,000
blanket construct

1105
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,400
and i just wanted to also to follow that

1106
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,000
up on this very quickly

1107
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,960
in the version of the paper that's under

1108
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,920
review now

1109
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,160
we actually realized that perhaps in the

1110
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,880
draft you've read we were a little bit

1111
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,920
uh too harsh on tristan because he does

1112
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,760
impose certain rules about for example

1113
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,599
how to individuate different kinds of

1114
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:46,960
nodes

1115
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,520
but there's still a question of kind of

1116
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,160
what

1117
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,240
what it means to individuate these nodes

1118
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:56,160
in a certain way

1119
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,160
thank you thank you joe thank you joe if

1120
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,880
you wanted then blue and scott

1121
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,880
i'm fine for now actually thanks thank

1122
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,400
you blue and then scott

1123
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,319
so without specifying markov blanket or

1124
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:12,400
pearl blanket or fristen blanket i want

1125
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,200
to touch back

1126
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,599
on what yellow was saying about group

1127
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:16,400
memberships

1128
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,640
and also about uh what shannon was

1129
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,440
saying about

1130
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,839
cumulative culture so i think this is

1131
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,800
like a really interesting notion of um

1132
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,680
like a markov blanket or a blanket

1133
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,040
overlying a group

1134
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,839
and and the affordances and like what it

1135
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:33,839
means to be part of that group like age

1136
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,960
specific affordances or socioeconomic

1137
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,880
specific affordances

1138
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,640
under a given blanket and how and when

1139
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,599
this like cultural or group membership

1140
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:46,160
prior

1141
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,800
gets like instilled and also like do

1142
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,240
blankets then overlap

1143
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,800
like i'm of this race and of this age

1144
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,760
and of this

1145
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,440
you know so so these overlapping

1146
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,640
blankets i just think it's a very

1147
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,280
interesting

1148
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,839
um idea about group membership and

1149
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,520
cumulative culture and we might know

1150
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,119
that we're part of this group

1151
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,520
but we don't know all of the specific

1152
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,240
underlying

1153
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,480
backstory about why we're treated this

1154
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,599
way or

1155
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,920
were afforded these certain things i

1156
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,359
just think that's a very interesting

1157
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,240
way to think about it

1158
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,440
thank you blue scott and then anyone

1159
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,119
else and also anyone who's watching

1160
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,240
lives welcome to ask us a question

1161
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,760
so it's so interesting couple of things

1162
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,680
blue on what you just said so i do a lot

1163
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,880
of sewing

1164
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,599
and with the notion of quilting is

1165
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:32,000
really

1166
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,440
interesting in what you just said

1167
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,720
because they're actually a bunch of

1168
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,240
quilting museums

1169
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,000
that do ethnographies of quilts

1170
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,079
and so it really comes back around you

1171
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,000
had this quilt which reflects a person's

1172
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,720
history

1173
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,040
like when they did the hiv quilt each

1174
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,040
square represented a person

1175
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,560
right so you actually have a physical

1176
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,960
membership instantiated in this blanket

1177
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,880
and then the blanket being the symbol of

1178
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,720
the community being knit together i mean

1179
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,200
all these

1180
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,560
knits probably not the thing you want to

1181
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,640
do in a quilt but anyway okay the the

1182
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,560
thing i was gonna

1183
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,880
mention in response to joe i think was

1184
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,640
joe's comment before about the

1185
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,839
oh no sorry it was um it was kristoff's

1186
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,440
about the um application

1187
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,200
and the alteration from the paper that

1188
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,720
notion they have this

1189
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,960
um this something that's running as a

1190
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,040
scientific a statistical concept that is

1191
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,800
brought out in the world

1192
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,400
one of the things who as i mentioned

1193
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,720
before i work in an applied physics lab

1194
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,960
now applied physics is really funny

1195
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,000
because you're

1196
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,160
applying physics so that seems like

1197
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,440
maybe it has something to say about

1198
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,560
what's going on here and i

1199
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,480
and i realized well what you do in

1200
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,160
applied physics and what we do in our

1201
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,280
program

1202
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,280
in specifically in our program we take

1203
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,280
technically feasible systems

1204
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,280
so let's say that we could describe

1205
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,960
something as technically feasible

1206
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,760
the chris the fristen notion is

1207
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,680
technically feasible and you can apply

1208
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,160
it

1209
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,839
in scientific context but what i do in

1210
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:58,079
my

1211
00:42:58,079 --> 00:42:59,839
program and what the lab does generally

1212
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:01,200
is then we take the stuff and make it

1213
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,280
ready for adoption in the field

1214
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,520
so in specifically in my program i take

1215
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,680
technically feasible systems and i test

1216
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,000
them for whether they're bolt reasonable

1217
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,359
and bolts is business

1218
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:14,800
operating legal technical and social

1219
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,040
so if something is technically feasible

1220
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,640
like the orion project where they were

1221
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,720
going to use nuclear bombs to loft

1222
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,200
weighty objects into space that's

1223
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,119
totally technically feasible

1224
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,960
but it would be unreasonable socially

1225
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,319
because you'd pollute the entire

1226
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,240
atmosphere with radioactive isotopes

1227
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,599
right so it works in the lab it's

1228
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:33,440
theoretically good terrific

1229
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,240
so what i'm my notion is maybe what's

1230
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,680
going on here

1231
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,880
is the applied physics

1232
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,480
applied statistics and when you get it

1233
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,000
out there in the field it's

1234
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,280
it can be seen we can call them

1235
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,359
compromises or we can call them

1236
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:48,480
realities

1237
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,720
or we can call them affordances or we

1238
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,920
can call them beijing

1239
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,079
adjustments of scientific empirical

1240
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:55,599
views

1241
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,040
right which when it gets out there in

1242
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,839
the reality maybe the folk understanding

1243
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:03,359
is the reality

1244
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:06,560
of physics in the mind

1245
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,680
of the of humans maybe if the mind

1246
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,440
exists in society and the brain's just

1247
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,200
an antenna tuned into it

1248
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,720
anyway just a couple thoughts to play

1249
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,800
with thanks scott

1250
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,880
so stephen and then anyone else who has

1251
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,960
a question yeah i'd be interested

1252
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,640
christoph just further in what you said

1253
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,200
about

1254
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,359
what does it mean to individuate a node

1255
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,040
in a particular way in this idea of

1256
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,480
nodes and

1257
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,680
i suppose at this larger scale um

1258
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,000
i'm seen with these partially observable

1259
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,880
markov decision processes being used in

1260
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,160
some of the modelling they don't

1261
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,000
necessarily from what i understand talk

1262
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:42,319
about

1263
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:45,599
nodes in that way but at the primordial

1264
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:46,480
soup

1265
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,760
kind of cellular level they seem to

1266
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,040
often talk about

1267
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,560
modes in that maybe in in the similar

1268
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,920
way or not but i'd just be curious what

1269
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,400
you think

1270
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,280
thoughts are about what it means to have

1271
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,280
a node what kind of node that might be

1272
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,520
and what's similar or different between

1273
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,759
different ways that this is implemented

1274
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,319
yep go for it chris and i have figure 2

1275
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:11,760
up or let me know if you want to go to a

1276
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,280
different figure

1277
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,480
uh sure thanks a lot i mean those

1278
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,400
two the last two comments and the

1279
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,520
questions even

1280
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,079
really match nicely together i think

1281
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:23,280
because

1282
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,839
so you know i mean you can we can talk

1283
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:27,359
about variables right

1284
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:30,400
i mean in a in a graphical model

1285
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,640
variables are represented as nodes

1286
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,680
basically

1287
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,760
so what but what i of course meant is

1288
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,880
the differentiation of

1289
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,800
the differentiation between active

1290
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,640
states and the

1291
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,280
passive of or perceptual states inter

1292
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,160
inner states

1293
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,480
uh yeah exactly well you can also use

1294
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,920
the loop but yeah

1295
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,280
internal states external states um

1296
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,920
these things right so it seems to me

1297
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,640
that

1298
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,280
uh and i think i mean not only to me it

1299
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,079
seems

1300
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,880
to all of us that there's a certain

1301
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,800
degree of arbitrariness

1302
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,119
with regards to what is what i mean at

1303
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:08,720
least in the draft you've read

1304
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,359
it seemed like that to us we then

1305
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:11,839
learned

1306
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:15,200
that after really reading

1307
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,040
for a lot of tristan's papers very

1308
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,880
carefully we actually

1309
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,079
kind of extracted the implicit rules

1310
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,119
for for how to how to you know label

1311
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:28,160
these variables as active or passive

1312
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,240
in a graphical model but

1313
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,280
this is still a very arbitrary

1314
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,400
distinction one which is uh

1315
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,800
like the rules by which you individuate

1316
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,440
so i

1317
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,280
i used individuation here maybe i

1318
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,200
shouldn't have used the word individuate

1319
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,040
the way you identify

1320
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,760
the role played by a given variable

1321
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,200
that's what i should have said

1322
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,240
previously is that the rules that

1323
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,400
that give you this identification are

1324
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,280
still

1325
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,160
very arbitrary and they are not actually

1326
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:00,800
anchored

1327
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,680
in anything very substantial and this

1328
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,400
goes back

1329
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,440
to what scott said about the feasibility

1330
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,960
and applicability

1331
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,000
because of course you can take this kind

1332
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,160
of way of partitioning a system

1333
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,560
you can build a robot with you know some

1334
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,520
kind of

1335
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,720
ai system which will be built on the

1336
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,760
principles

1337
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,559
of the free energy principle and

1338
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:25,520
pristin's

1339
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,359
way of thinking about graphical models

1340
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,359
and it will be perfectly

1341
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:31,119
you know good at doing certain things

1342
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,480
that you build it for

1343
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,680
the problem is that when you're building

1344
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,119
a system for a particular purpose as an

1345
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,160
engineer you kind of hold all the cards

1346
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,240
you make all the decisions you know you

1347
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,839
decide like how to what like what kind

1348
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:49,760
of active states will the robot need or

1349
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:50,559
something like that

1350
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:52,160
and that's very that's a very different

1351
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,000
perspective so to speak from this

1352
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,800
perspective

1353
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,160
of you know let's call it the what then

1354
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,040
it calls the

1355
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,400
evolutionary r d uh department right so

1356
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:02,720
an

1357
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:06,000
evolution doesn't really plan things

1358
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,400
evolution just throws things that the

1359
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,640
wall and whatever sticks kind of stays

1360
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,640
and goes on to reproduce and all the

1361
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,880
other things kind of fall back

1362
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,480
and um in this sense it's it's very it

1363
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:18,960
becomes

1364
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,359
very problematic when we think of like

1365
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:22,079
pristine's

1366
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,319
grand project of explaining you know

1367
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,920
life as we know it for example

1368
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,480
as in the paper from which we took this

1369
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,480
diagram that's on the screen now

1370
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,040
because it's it slowly becomes a little

1371
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,480
bit suspicious

1372
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,079
whether we can actually whether the

1373
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:41,440
the the way he labels these nodes and

1374
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,599
the the kind of the rules for labeling

1375
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:44,720
the nodes

1376
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,960
will be the same on for example

1377
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,040
different levels of organization

1378
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,800
stuff like that right so so whether this

1379
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,319
will be applicable

1380
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,720
uh to many different biological systems

1381
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,800
in the way that he hopes it will be

1382
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,400
or not thanks and just to

1383
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,280
to clarify um you all wrote that

1384
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,720
spectral graph theory is used to

1385
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,640
identify the eight most densely coupled

1386
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,240
nodes which are defined

1387
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,319
as the internal states so for those who

1388
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,079
think that given this soup of

1389
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:13,680
interacting particles which are all the

1390
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,520
same kind they're all following the same

1391
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,040
simple rules

1392
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,040
yeah eight densely coupled ones okay

1393
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,640
those are internal and then

1394
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,240
there's some downstream consequences

1395
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,319
with which nodes influence which nodes

1396
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:26,880
but it's hard to argue that choosing the

1397
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,839
eight densely coupled nodes is

1398
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:32,960
simply you know true or internal when

1399
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,480
you can look at what it is and ask

1400
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,359
whether there's a different way to

1401
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:36,079
partition it

1402
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,559
so joe and then scott and then anyone

1403
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,160
else

1404
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,440
yeah thanks thanks daniel that's a very

1405
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,520
clear way of putting that point um

1406
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,880
so just to pick up again on something

1407
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,720
chris chris mentioned briefly there is a

1408
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,480
further individuation problem i think

1409
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,280
which is about

1410
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,119
how to identify which which nodes you

1411
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:52,640
have in the first place or which which

1412
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,920
variables you have and this is a kind of

1413
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:54,640
growing question

1414
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,720
so so you can always you know look

1415
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,160
inside a node and split up in some other

1416
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,040
nodes or some other

1417
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,280
subparts and this this might not be a

1418
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,319
problem just

1419
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:03,680
that active inference suffers from it's

1420
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,760
going to be any any any kind of modeling

1421
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,160
uh system is going to have this kind of

1422
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:08,800
issue but

1423
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,480
it is going to make a difference to

1424
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,319
where the boundaries are drawn and what

1425
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:13,599
what kinds of what kinds of things you

1426
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:15,040
get so that's just to say that there's

1427
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,280
there's already a kind of human uh

1428
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,880
involvement in the model and just

1429
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:19,680
choosing

1430
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,440
what scale you pitch your nodes at

1431
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,880
thanks joe uh scott and then dean

1432
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,000
yella and stephen so

1433
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,480
in that notion love it this is great and

1434
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,920
that clarification

1435
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,280
about the nodes being assigned in a

1436
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,520
sense contextually

1437
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,119
in a given system state um

1438
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:46,160
it seems like if we start to that may be

1439
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,760
a pathway to revealing

1440
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,960
the self other ch or starting to unpack

1441
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:53,599
some self

1442
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:56,640
other challenges so maybe

1443
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:00,079
a node that is once characterizable

1444
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:02,960
as internal then characterizable as

1445
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,240
external

1446
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,839
is revealing something about the paradox

1447
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:09,920
of

1448
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,040
membership in groups that

1449
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,480
the in fact it's not the node that

1450
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,119
changes

1451
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,400
but the sensation of whether itself or

1452
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,760
other

1453
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,480
so you start to take that always

1454
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,000
paradoxical this is that hofstetter

1455
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,520
stuff and everyone else who talks about

1456
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,119
when does a group become a

1457
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:31,680
when does a group form when does it have

1458
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,200
an internal voice when does it speak an

1459
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,040
extra voice all that stuff

1460
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,240
and so maybe that analysis and that

1461
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,280
reassignment possibility starts to get

1462
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:41,839
into that

1463
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:44,160
and maybe that also informs blue's

1464
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,520
notion before about the group

1465
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,520
you know kind of the again that i'm

1466
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,280
calling it now the markov quilt

1467
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,680
as of that last conversation but that

1468
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,960
group identity

1469
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,160
blanket where it's patched together

1470
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,200
maybe those things are

1471
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,680
like irving goffman and things like that

1472
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,200
or mirror neurons where you want

1473
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,960
something to be recruited by others

1474
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,200
as an internal state you project it to

1475
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,480
them as an external state

1476
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,200
intrinsically and so the communication

1477
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,640
you're inviting

1478
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,119
others to encode their markov blankets

1479
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:17,040
similar to yours in a sense or something

1480
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,079
like that

1481
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:20,319
so that is exciting to me that

1482
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:21,359
slipperiness

1483
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:25,040
of assignment there feels like something

1484
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,800
that offers a pathway to analyzing

1485
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,240
those dynamics of group and individual

1486
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,599
identity thanks thank you scott so

1487
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:39,520
dean yellow and stephen and blue

1488
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:44,480
yeah um so back to construal

1489
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,960
and the question of how do i get the

1490
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:47,839
world i think

1491
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:51,520
a lot of the conversation today has

1492
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,839
centered on maybe a more clunkier

1493
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:55,040
expression which is

1494
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,240
how do us get the world either

1495
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:02,319
us as flag conformists

1496
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:08,079
or us as red dots versus cyan dogs

1497
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:12,240
um so even pristin

1498
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,079
stephen shared a video where he was

1499
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:16,000
talking to the santa fe institute

1500
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,079
even pristin said that things get a lot

1501
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:19,440
more interesting when we get to the

1502
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,119
combinatorial level

1503
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:24,000
and they're not the same as when we're

1504
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,040
talking about

1505
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,160
how do i get the world that there is

1506
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,160
there is a difference when complexity

1507
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,599
arises so

1508
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:34,400
can we hold up pearl and mark off

1509
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,359
blankets and

1510
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:39,760
get past the ore of this or that

1511
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,400
because we recognize that it's a little

1512
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,680
bit different when

1513
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,599
how do us get the world that's a

1514
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,359
construal question

1515
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:49,760
and so that's what i'm kind of curious

1516
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,839
about

1517
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:54,000
thanks dean really powerful and a big

1518
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,200
difference between how do

1519
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,960
us get the world how do we get the world

1520
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,559
how do i get the world

1521
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:00,160
how do they get the world these are like

1522
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,319
really markedly different

1523
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:06,640
questions so yellow stephen blue

1524
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,920
um so i was thinking getting back to

1525
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:10,880
blue's question

1526
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,559
and shannon's questions on group

1527
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:14,160
membership but maybe if somebody else

1528
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,079
wants to

1529
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:21,119
uh well i i i i i just get talking on

1530
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:24,720
a group membership um

1531
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,760
so i mean to what extent one the kind of

1532
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,680
marker blanket formalism applies

1533
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,559
to to groups uh i think it's an

1534
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:34,079
interesting one

1535
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:37,040
and i think that's one thing that really

1536
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,040
matters here is is really how you

1537
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,720
conceive of a group right i mean you can

1538
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,440
lead like a group of people i mean we

1539
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,040
are a group of people that are spread

1540
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:45,760
out

1541
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,680
all over the world and you could think

1542
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,359
like a group in a more narrow sense like

1543
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:50,319
a flock of birds

1544
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:53,839
or a

1545
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,640
these are entities in the same kind of

1546
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,240
spatial temporal

1547
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,119
location that coordinate their their

1548
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:06,720
behavior with one another and you can

1549
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,440
think of

1550
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,280
as a predator arriving also as a

1551
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,280
perturbation to that system as a whole

1552
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,359
right so in the way that entity is

1553
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:14,400
coordinating it's

1554
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,640
it's it's it's dynamics with with the

1555
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,920
rest of the environment you might

1556
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,200
actually think that no this is a group

1557
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,880
that actually too weak

1558
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,079
the active inference principles do apply

1559
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:25,680
and you might in that sense might think

1560
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,799
as well that the group as a whole

1561
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:28,319
somehow has a

1562
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:33,440
as a as a as a marker blanket

1563
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:37,359
um i think it's that another analysis is

1564
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:38,880
more difficult to give if you think

1565
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:39,520
about

1566
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,559
uh group memberships

1567
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:44,960
uh also kind of the graded group

1568
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,720
memberships right i mean

1569
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,599
uh i think blue was talking about uh

1570
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,200
yeah we belong to multiple groups at the

1571
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,000
same time

1572
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,799
uh and not actively acting on being part

1573
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:56,079
of that group but just as a kind of

1574
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:57,839
label that i would

1575
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:01,520
uh endorse uh when you ask me i think

1576
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,520
there the application of markup blankets

1577
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,520
is a lot more difficult and

1578
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:09,119
at most more metaphorical so i just want

1579
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:10,079
to say

1580
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:11,760
so exactly how to understand groups

1581
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,119
there is is is

1582
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,599
is is is important if if shannon wants

1583
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:16,319
to understand

1584
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:18,160
kind of crowded damage or so that that

1585
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,599
might be more applicable

1586
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:21,359
and if you want to really understand

1587
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:23,280
kind of social membership and graded

1588
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:23,920
membership

1589
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,520
and membership of different groups at

1590
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,079
the same time then uh

1591
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,559
yeah i find it more difficult to

1592
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:31,839
understand how kind of the active

1593
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:34,000
influence framework can be applied to

1594
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,520
those kind of groups thanks

1595
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:41,599
so steven blue scott

1596
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,559
yeah i think so sticking with that group

1597
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:46,160
idea that

1598
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,400
there could be the the idea of

1599
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,359
morphology and the amount of constraints

1600
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:54,960
and affordances in the the whole

1601
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,160
environment body organism dynamic that's

1602
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,839
constraining

1603
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:01,119
and where maybe there's not that

1604
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:02,799
constraint so i'm thinking i know

1605
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:04,400
someone that she's trying to do some

1606
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,440
markov blanket meditation processes i'm

1607
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,200
kind of thinking if someone's meditating

1608
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:09,839
and

1609
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:13,200
starting to just sense their states in a

1610
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,240
maybe a

1611
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,319
a way that slowly is like a cloud that

1612
00:57:17,319 --> 00:57:18,480
self-organizes

1613
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,640
in a way i could see a more plausible

1614
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:21,599
way where

1615
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:25,200
sort of something like not

1616
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,599
obviously anything the same as this kind

1617
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:29,200
of markov

1618
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:33,040
blanket in a soup could be emergent

1619
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:36,960
however when you're in a you know a more

1620
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,799
real cognitive environment where you've

1621
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:40,400
got these priors

1622
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,920
and and the only way we're able to

1623
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,240
access it anyways through self-reported

1624
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,799
data which we a much higher level of

1625
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:48,559
dimensionality

1626
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:52,480
it may be is is only in some of the

1627
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,799
temporal processes that we can get some

1628
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:55,680
analogies

1629
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,960
like but i think that yeah it may be

1630
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,640
very different at different scales

1631
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,440
so the way that constraints play out i'm

1632
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,839
wondering how we think about constraints

1633
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:09,839
um and not having constraints

1634
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:12,640
nice question steven are the constraints

1635
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,000
hooked into this

1636
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,040
phrasing and then or where are the

1637
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,880
constraints and how does that

1638
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,319
shape how we model things across

1639
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:22,079
different scales so blue

1640
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,839
and then scott and then anyone else

1641
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:27,839
so hopefully it won't go on too long but

1642
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:29,359
i want to touch back on what stephen

1643
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:30,880
just said and also what um

1644
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,200
yela said you know when i think about

1645
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,160
how

1646
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,799
group membership goes into active

1647
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:38,559
inference like how can we relate these

1648
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:40,319
two things i think about

1649
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:42,640
like specifically what is the likelihood

1650
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,160
that i'm gonna take a ride on a yacht

1651
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:44,640
today

1652
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,200
right like so my socioeconomic status

1653
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,160
doesn't really

1654
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,160
afford me the opportunity to ride around

1655
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,079
in yachts very frequently so i'd be very

1656
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:52,960
surprised

1657
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,119
and i also live in the desert so i'd be

1658
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:56,000
very surprised

1659
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
if if i was riding around on a yacht at

1660
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,280
three o'clock this afternoon like that

1661
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,280
would that just doesn't go into my

1662
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,760
model so perhaps our group membership um

1663
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,520
goes into you know construction of

1664
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,480
of the prior um and our model in ways

1665
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,040
that are

1666
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,839
maybe layered right like you know an

1667
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,040
onion maybe

1668
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,720
um and so then i want to touch back on

1669
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,480
what scott said because this is what

1670
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,880
really made me raise my hand about group

1671
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:19,760
alignment

1672
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,000
and we were starting to talk with casper

1673
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
hesp when he was on the stream about

1674
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,119
um inferring the states of others so

1675
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:29,920
i think this group alignment i wonder

1676
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,599
about this a lot and and

1677
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:34,319
uh specifically with respect to

1678
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:36,319
communication which we've talked about

1679
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,000
in relation to active inference and

1680
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,599
cooperation

1681
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:42,000
and you know building a collective

1682
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
intelligence so when we think about

1683
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,760
you know whether the earth is flat or

1684
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,839
not right like this at one time was like

1685
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:48,559
a hotly

1686
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:52,400
debated topic and maybe still is but um

1687
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,640
this is like there's been a convergence

1688
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,319
right so we all now align

1689
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:58,319
our like most of the people in the world

1690
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:00,240
agree that the earth is round

1691
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,319
so i wonder about this time to

1692
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:04,240
convergence and this has been used to

1693
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,280
measure

1694
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,040
information transmission and can we

1695
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,960
similarly move it through

1696
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,359
estimate collective intelligence so like

1697
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:13,119
when we there's a time to convergence

1698
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:13,520
for

1699
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,599
a swarm or this might also represent

1700
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:17,119
like a phase transition

1701
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:18,799
right so there's a time to convergence

1702
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:20,559
and if it happens rapidly like the idea

1703
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:22,319
is readily adopted that now the earth is

1704
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:23,040
round

1705
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,280
so i wonder if these divergent views

1706
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,079
that we have

1707
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:28,720
as people in groups in divergent groups

1708
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,000
in a society

1709
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,880
that do they hinder our collective

1710
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:33,599
intelligence

1711
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:36,160
or do they like actually assist it

1712
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,079
because without having divergence

1713
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:39,920
we could never actually come to the one

1714
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,200
true answer

1715
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,440
so is it resistance that hinders the

1716
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,599
evolution of intelligence or

1717
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:48,160
is it um i just it's something to think

1718
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,319
about

1719
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:53,440
thanks blue um scott if you're

1720
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,480
go ahead yep i just repeat the question

1721
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,720
you asked right there at the end

1722
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,440
yeah repeatedly yeah so i just wonder

1723
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:01,839
about

1724
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:05,520
our um the divergent views

1725
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,040
right that we hold in society about

1726
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,440
whether the earth is flat or round

1727
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,799
do does this divergence help or hinder

1728
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:14,640
our collective intelligence and the

1729
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,559
evolution of intelligence overall

1730
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:19,520
or is it resisting adoption of a new

1731
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:20,160
view

1732
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,920
right like so perhaps there's there's

1733
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,599
resistance to change

1734
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:25,280
even when we see something is correct

1735
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,200
like climate change we can clearly see

1736
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,400
the effects of climate change

1737
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,359
but there's a huge resistance to

1738
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:31,920
changing

1739
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:33,680
so is it this resistance that hinders

1740
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,680
our collective intelligence like what

1741
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,359
where is the evolution of our collective

1742
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:39,119
intelligence helped or hindered

1743
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:41,839
by divergence and views or resistance to

1744
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:43,680
adopting new views

1745
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,160
sorry goes along yeah shane you want to

1746
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,480
give a thought on that and then scott

1747
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:53,760
yeah um so if we were going to

1748
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,240
talk this would be like whether a system

1749
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:57,839
is

1750
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:00,079
resisting it's a non-equilibrium steady

1751
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:01,119
state and like

1752
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:04,839
moving to a different steady state um

1753
01:02:04,839 --> 01:02:07,839
and

1754
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:10,480
i guess that's a question i don't i like

1755
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:11,839
i've been seeing pop up in a lot of the

1756
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:13,760
papers recently is how can you define

1757
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,880
not every system is going towards like

1758
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,880
a minimized free energy gradient or not

1759
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,000
every system is

1760
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,039
trying to maintain a stable state like

1761
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,240
systems dissipate and

1762
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:28,880
re-emerge and dissipate and re-emerge um

1763
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,240
so i don't know is that just a way to

1764
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,119
re-ask that question

1765
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:36,079
but talk about something a bit more

1766
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:37,039
physical

1767
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:40,960
than than collective intelligence

1768
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,039
um and i guess collective intelligence

1769
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:44,319
maybe

1770
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:46,839
is like collective agreement on a

1771
01:02:46,839 --> 01:02:49,119
certain

1772
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:51,280
set of of ideas or norms or something

1773
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,400
rather than like

1774
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,440
intelligence like smarter than another

1775
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,079
person

1776
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:57,440
is what we're maybe talking about here

1777
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,640
so how does that system arrive on this

1778
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:03,119
steady state of what we think that the

1779
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:05,680
world is

1780
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:07,359
thanks shannon and there's the

1781
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:09,440
convergence on shared

1782
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,599
generative model on shared mindset but

1783
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:12,880
then it made me think of

1784
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:15,760
ants colony relocation and over

1785
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,119
evolutionary time

1786
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:19,839
colonies are shaped to appropriately

1787
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:20,640
relocate

1788
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,400
but not instantly and not just choose

1789
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,760
the first um

1790
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,359
you know first aid coming back with

1791
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:27,200
exciting nest location you can't go for

1792
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,240
the first one

1793
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:31,359
so how to actually bear with

1794
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:34,079
the process of distributed computation

1795
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:35,680
or distributed intelligence

1796
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:38,720
knowing that it looks like disagreements

1797
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,119
at multiple levels especially when it's

1798
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:42,640
not just as simple as ants

1799
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,359
relocating but cultural values and

1800
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:47,119
beliefs and everything like that

1801
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:49,200
can i jump in again about aunt yeah yeah

1802
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,359
oh yes

1803
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:52,880
there was a new paper and i don't know

1804
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,720
who was by i saw it on twitter

1805
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,799
um but it was about ants they travel

1806
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:58,559
across a scaffold and it's either it's

1807
01:03:58,559 --> 01:03:58,880
like

1808
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,200
flat and so they just walk or they tilt

1809
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,119
it and so some ants start to fall down

1810
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:05,599
and they start to build this scaffold

1811
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:07,760
um and then when they build a scaffold

1812
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,200
ants can all walk over it so they're

1813
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,559
supporting each other

1814
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:13,839
um and i'm thinking um

1815
01:04:13,839 --> 01:04:15,359
i might be diverging from our markov

1816
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:17,359
blanket topic here but i'm thinking

1817
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:19,359
um that collective intelligence is like

1818
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:21,520
as long as the world

1819
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,599
looks flat as long as the world is easy

1820
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:25,520
for us you know to navigate

1821
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,160
then we can all go about our day we

1822
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,599
don't really need to try to converge

1823
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:30,480
with anybody

1824
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,079
but as soon as the world starts to be

1825
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:33,760
disrupted slightly so we turn that

1826
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:34,960
scaffold

1827
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,720
folks start to fall off like then we

1828
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,400
need to build

1829
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,760
something build a shared collective

1830
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,799
notion of reality and then

1831
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:47,599
then the convergence matters and so that

1832
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:49,119
could be something like as soon as

1833
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:51,760
there's a perturbance to the system

1834
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:55,599
then it's useful to try to

1835
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:58,720
recognize boundaries or try to

1836
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,559
have some sort of intervention i think

1837
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:02,079
scott was mentioned to

1838
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:03,839
have a boundary that's suitable and

1839
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:05,119
helpful and productive

1840
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:08,480
and that could be where it's fine to

1841
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:11,200
diverge all you want as long as

1842
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,760
everything's simple and then as soon as

1843
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,119
it gets complicated

1844
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:17,839
or we start to like have harm for people

1845
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:19,280
then we need to

1846
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:22,400
have a system that can

1847
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,599
result in some sort of convergence happy

1848
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:26,559
for someone to bring me

1849
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:30,160
back on topic it's it's a great point

1850
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,240
and i almost interpreted as how do we

1851
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,079
help those at the fringe who might be

1852
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:35,200
being harmed

1853
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,400
how do we make that the stimuli and

1854
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,160
um for realignment and for

1855
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,760
re-scaffolding rather than keep on

1856
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,280
cutting off more and more oh the failing

1857
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:44,079
parts of the bridge

1858
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:46,079
they gotta go they gotta go well now we

1859
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:47,760
have no one on the bridge

1860
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,359
instead of seeing that those on the

1861
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:51,440
fringe and can be part of

1862
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,640
the recovery so scott kristoff and

1863
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:55,920
steven

1864
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,079
so shannon that was right in the middle

1865
01:05:58,079 --> 01:05:59,440
of the discussion there's no

1866
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:00,559
you don't have to bring back anything

1867
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:03,119
that was perfect so

1868
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:05,039
admiral rogers the former head of the

1869
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:07,440
nsa once said don't let any

1870
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,559
emergency or disaster go unexploited and

1871
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,599
the idea is

1872
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:14,480
that the disaster is that situation

1873
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,319
people act in a disaster you know

1874
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:17,039
hurricane

1875
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:18,880
sandy whatever people you know starbucks

1876
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,240
they were putting out power strips for

1877
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,160
people to share whatever right so

1878
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:25,280
it's exactly that and the rhetoric the

1879
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:26,079
projected

1880
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:28,960
projection rhetoric can cause a state

1881
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:29,920
change

1882
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,000
right the anticipation of a disaster

1883
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,200
when people are actually experiencing

1884
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,720
they go oh my god

1885
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,640
this might happen to me or neighborhood

1886
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,319
watch right people kind of you know they

1887
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:39,680
go in and they want to protect

1888
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,920
property and things so i love that that

1889
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:42,720
point

1890
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:45,119
and bringing it with the other points

1891
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,880
before i think it was kristoff that was

1892
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,039
asking maybe somebody else about

1893
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:51,280
you know that active inference in a

1894
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:52,079
group

1895
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:54,160
and does it dissipate in the activity if

1896
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:55,520
you're just a member of a club and it's

1897
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:56,480
kind of

1898
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,520
lying dormant is that really describable

1899
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:00,880
with active inference

1900
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,799
and it occurs to me you know if you look

1901
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:06,000
at group dynamics it may still be

1902
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,200
usefully described that way and here's

1903
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,799
here's how i would think of it

1904
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:13,920
if i uh this is irving goffman's stuff

1905
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:14,400
that i

1906
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,319
i project myself out as i want to be

1907
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:18,079
perceived by others

1908
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:20,400
so if i join a club i may join a club

1909
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,520
because i want to be

1910
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,680
like i used to be part of an entomology

1911
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,359
listserv i've never been a

1912
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:27,039
this is not about enterman's cakes but

1913
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:29,359
insects you know

1914
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:30,880
but i was part of a lister back in the

1915
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,480
old listserv days and i just was

1916
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:33,440
fascinating

1917
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,520
i sort of wanted to be involved in it

1918
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:36,960
right so i was projecting myself out and

1919
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,240
i started making these connections with

1920
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:39,280
folks

1921
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:42,880
so in a way you can de-risk and leverage

1922
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:45,039
by being a member of a group even

1923
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:47,280
passively

1924
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:49,760
right i can i'm extending out my feelers

1925
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,760
out there into the world by having that

1926
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,119
group membership

1927
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:54,880
i'm de-risking by having those that

1928
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,720
group available to me as me being a

1929
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:57,200
member

1930
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,680
if it's a group that you know so so i

1931
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:00,720
wonder

1932
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:04,559
if the dissipation of activity

1933
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:07,280
itself is an appropriate gauge of

1934
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:08,640
whether you're a member of a group or

1935
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:09,440
not

1936
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:12,880
maybe in certain leverages and certainty

1937
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,000
riskings

1938
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,238
there's a functional engagement that's

1939
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:18,479
maybe more passive by the individual but

1940
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:20,319
still may stand for something in the

1941
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:21,920
overall

1942
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,920
goals of that entity that's that's one

1943
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:26,000
point and the other one other point

1944
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,158
is the the leveraging the risk in groups

1945
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:31,040
i keep coming back to eukaryotes

1946
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,198
and eukaryotes you know we it's a better

1947
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:34,719
deal we got multi-cellular got a lot

1948
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:35,520
more options

1949
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,359
we got mitochondria we got chloroplasts

1950
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:38,880
we got all the good apparatus instead of

1951
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,000
having just these

1952
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,839
compartments where you kind of do stuff

1953
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:43,679
in a single cell organism right

1954
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:46,158
so it's a better deal and so maybe part

1955
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:47,040
of this thing with

1956
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,080
the groups this goes back to blue's

1957
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:51,040
notion

1958
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:54,319
is is it are we resisting i think it was

1959
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:54,719
a blue

1960
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:57,600
maybe but are we resistant to is this

1961
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,279
resistance

1962
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:02,238
or facilitating the group membership

1963
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:03,759
what's going on here

1964
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:05,520
and you know the divergences and the

1965
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:06,960
differences and i started thinking about

1966
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,560
thermodynamics first law if you don't

1967
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,319
have if you have isothermal you can't

1968
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:10,880
perform

1969
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,000
cannot perform work if everyone has

1970
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,040
equal information

1971
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:18,158
markets don't have trading

1972
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:21,439
so there may be a benefit to not having

1973
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:25,198
to having divergence right and maybe

1974
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:28,479
in fact um the

1975
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:31,359
that reality is there isn't a

1976
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:34,719
facilitation or resistance it just is

1977
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:36,960
and that paradox is what we're is the

1978
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,640
reality we're seeing is that it doesn't

1979
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,120
facilitate anything there's no goal

1980
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,040
orientation individuals may have goals

1981
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:44,158
but that's a

1982
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:46,319
more bounded goal than the super system

1983
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:47,198
of biology

1984
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:48,560
anyway just a couple of thoughts that i

1985
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,799
gleaned from that last bit and also just

1986
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:52,479
to remark once again what a fantastic

1987
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:54,158
conversation

1988
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:56,960
thanks scott so kristoff then stephen

1989
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,760
and then anyone else

1990
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:03,600
um yeah so i just wanted this

1991
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,400
well what did i want to say uh i guess

1992
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,679
two things really

1993
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:10,480
so one thing goes back to blue's comment

1994
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:10,960
about

1995
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,360
like the fact that the fact that if you

1996
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:14,800
have some kind of a

1997
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,360
complex network there will be multiple

1998
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,280
markov blankets in there so it's

1999
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:20,080
completely

2000
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,000
feasible to understand you know

2001
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,679
membership to certain groups or

2002
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:24,960
something like that or some kind of

2003
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,800
relationship structures

2004
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,520
to be overlapping in different ways so i

2005
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:30,000
think

2006
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,120
it's conducive to this but i think that

2007
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,239
we should not

2008
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:37,120
like we're very focused now on this idea

2009
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:37,760
of

2010
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:41,360
you know blankets as um

2011
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,840
as a way of intervi like of thinking

2012
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,920
about some kind of boundaries again

2013
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,760
between groups perhaps or between

2014
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:51,120
different kind of units of organization

2015
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:54,800
and we're not like it's it's it's a it's

2016
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:57,280
always useful i think to kind of go back

2017
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,280
you know zoom out a little and not think

2018
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,560
about the blankets because you have the

2019
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,159
blankets whenever you have some kind of

2020
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:04,640
a network

2021
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:08,239
of you know variables um

2022
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:10,080
interconnected in some way but what's

2023
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,440
really interesting is that

2024
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:14,560
in many cases the

2025
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:17,440
behavior you will get from these systems

2026
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,000
if you

2027
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,080
project them onto the social domain will

2028
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,840
be very surprising

2029
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,239
so one really surprising finding is

2030
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:26,320
something called the solman effect

2031
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:29,280
it's with a z and double l and it's

2032
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,000
basically

2033
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,719
a finding that shows that if you have

2034
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:33,280
bayesian

2035
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:36,320
agents interacting in a

2036
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,320
network if the network is fully

2037
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:39,760
connected they won't

2038
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:43,440
actually come to a consensus

2039
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,679
about some true belief so so imagine you

2040
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:47,600
have a network of

2041
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,440
fully connected network of bayesian

2042
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:50,640
scientists and they're

2043
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:53,280
testing two hypotheses right and they're

2044
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,800
testing these hypotheses they're

2045
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,560
increasing their credences and they're

2046
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,800
communicating their credences with each

2047
01:11:58,800 --> 01:11:59,679
test

2048
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:02,159
to their neighbors and what's really

2049
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:03,600
surprising is that

2050
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:06,560
the talmud effects shows us that these

2051
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,719
scientists will not actually converge

2052
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:11,679
to uh to a singular credence in in the

2053
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:13,440
true outcome

2054
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:16,560
what is also surprising is that a less

2055
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,480
connected network will actually

2056
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,199
eventually

2057
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:22,239
converge to the to the to kind of to all

2058
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:22,800
the

2059
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:25,600
members having a very high credence in

2060
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:25,920
the

2061
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:29,440
you know most likely outcome so

2062
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,520
this kind of i just wanted to kind of

2063
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:32,640
throw it out there

2064
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:35,199
because i think that it's you know we're

2065
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:36,960
thinking now intuitively about these

2066
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,320
blankets as

2067
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,560
membership to groups and stuff like that

2068
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,880
but the kind of interactions we might

2069
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:43,440
get

2070
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,640
from using this kind of formalism

2071
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,800
and projecting it to a social domain

2072
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,000
might be quite surprising

2073
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,040
right i'm not saying it will be useless

2074
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:55,840
because perhaps the talmud effect to go

2075
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:56,719
also back

2076
01:12:56,719 --> 01:12:58,880
to what has been said about the flat

2077
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,480
earth situation

2078
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,480
and you know the belief in the roundness

2079
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:03,760
or flatness of the earth

2080
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:06,800
the solemn effect actually tells us that

2081
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,800
in a hyper-connected society like the

2082
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,400
one we are living now

2083
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:13,679
there it's even rational agents

2084
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:15,920
might fail to converge to the to the you

2085
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:16,960
know the most

2086
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,560
likely hypothesis right and that

2087
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,719
actually is something interesting

2088
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:23,920
that it's in a way that solomon effect

2089
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:24,719
predicts the

2090
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:26,320
appearance of certain conspiracy

2091
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,320
theories in a hyper-connected society

2092
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,520
because

2093
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,000
uh given the demographics for example of

2094
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,199
flat earth

2095
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:36,080
uh belief it has been declining for

2096
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:36,960
decades

2097
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:40,080
until the advent of internet so it only

2098
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:42,239
came to a sharp rise with the with with

2099
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:44,480
social net with social media when people

2100
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:47,440
started to communicate in a much more

2101
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:50,000
interconnected way so i'm not saying

2102
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:50,480
that

2103
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,480
you know thinking about these systems in

2104
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:54,239
a social domain is bad

2105
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:57,920
no i just wanted to bring this

2106
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:01,199
let's say anecdotal effect to

2107
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:05,199
to say that uh the the kind of

2108
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:08,560
behaviors we will see these systems uh

2109
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:10,239
converging towards might be very

2110
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:12,320
surprising right or we we might

2111
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:15,120
they might not work exactly the way we

2112
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:15,840
think

2113
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:18,880
they do on like lower scales of

2114
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:21,440
organization

2115
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:24,239
thanks for those points so steven and

2116
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:24,640
then

2117
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:28,480
anyone else yeah that's some good points

2118
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:29,600
there actually and

2119
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,560
i think this is where active inference

2120
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:32,960
um

2121
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:36,000
and the mark the fristen blanket has

2122
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,440
some advantages

2123
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:40,400
over the pearl blanket if it's about

2124
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,400
what action it can

2125
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,480
there's a risk you see the information

2126
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,159
you start to have this thing that's all

2127
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:48,000
information driven rather than action

2128
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,520
policy driven

2129
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,360
because it and by keeping it with the

2130
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:53,120
action policy

2131
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:56,480
um for instance one of the things about

2132
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:57,280
having

2133
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:00,000
us on the planet in the solar system

2134
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,040
which we used to have

2135
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:03,679
well now we know in a galaxy in a milky

2136
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:05,120
way blah blah blah is that

2137
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,880
people have this sense of look we almost

2138
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,560
meant to look at ourselves from space

2139
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:09,120
now

2140
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:12,239
which is really only a proviso of modern

2141
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:13,199
technological

2142
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:15,840
perspective people might want to be able

2143
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,199
to stay grounded

2144
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:18,960
in some way there may be actually a

2145
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,640
psychological challenge

2146
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,679
with having to take this outer space

2147
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:25,760
perspective of us on a little ball going

2148
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:26,719
around the sun

2149
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:28,640
you know so there could also be an

2150
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:31,920
action policy perspective here around

2151
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:34,159
flat earth gives you a way to re-ground

2152
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:35,679
yourself because it's like well i'm on a

2153
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:37,199
flat earth so

2154
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:39,600
i don't have to take that i don't have

2155
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,360
to go and imagine myself in space

2156
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,320
looking at myself

2157
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:45,440
so there's a lot of interesting aspects

2158
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:46,239
to

2159
01:15:46,239 --> 01:15:49,360
the action policy side once you start to

2160
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,640
have this scaling

2161
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:54,000
and that that could be interesting um

2162
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,640
to to to keep that in mind

2163
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:03,360
thank you steven joe and anyone else

2164
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,520
uh yeah thanks um just something you

2165
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:06,960
said for steven uh when you say there's

2166
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:09,040
an advantage to the frist and blankets

2167
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,480
over the pearl blankets

2168
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,480
do you mean an advantage you know for

2169
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,239
real systems making use of these things

2170
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:15,679
or an advantage for us as modelers

2171
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:16,960
this is something that i really worry

2172
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,239
about sometimes that we slip into

2173
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:19,679
thinking about the practical benefits

2174
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:20,800
for a system

2175
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,800
of of these constructs whereas what

2176
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,080
we're really concerned with is

2177
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,640
the benefit

2178
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:29,120
it's for accurate and and in that

2179
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:30,880
context both might be good tools but

2180
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,000
when you use one tool or the other will

2181
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,360
depend on what you're trying to do with

2182
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,679
them

2183
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:38,640
i would say more for how we look at it

2184
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,960
as a modeler

2185
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,040
although the actual thing gets called a

2186
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:45,080
system and then has this kind of

2187
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:46,400
perspectival

2188
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,800
process i think it's good to keep it in

2189
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:49,600
mind

2190
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:52,080
so that action doesn't get lost and it

2191
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,520
doesn't purely start to become

2192
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,159
information yep great now that that

2193
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:57,520
makes sense and um

2194
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:58,960
i wasn't necessarily accusing you of

2195
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,640
this error but sometimes i do worry that

2196
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:02,320
people uh

2197
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,840
people get mixed up over who who's

2198
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,120
getting the advantage i guess you know

2199
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:05,520
who's

2200
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,679
who's benefiting here but but if if you

2201
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:09,920
mean just that it's important to keep

2202
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:11,600
to keep action as part of the picture

2203
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,040
and part of our models that that's a

2204
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:13,679
fair point

2205
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:17,760
yeah and one contribution of this

2206
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,920
paper and we look forward to the um

2207
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,840
revised and published version as well is

2208
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:22,400
like

2209
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,560
it's almost like if all we know is

2210
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:25,600
markov blanket

2211
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,520
it's like hey hand me the screwdriver

2212
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:29,040
well there's different shapes there's

2213
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,719
different sizes if you have

2214
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:32,400
the hex it's not going to work for the

2215
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,000
phillips and different countries or

2216
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,120
different applications

2217
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:38,000
need different screwdrivers so now we

2218
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:38,640
can

2219
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:42,400
with these adjectives ahead of blanket

2220
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,320
we can start to differentiate hand me

2221
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:46,400
the phillips screwdriver okay

2222
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,880
you're talking about the fristen blanket

2223
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:50,400
you're talking about the pearl blanket

2224
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,040
and so

2225
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:54,159
we can be specific now because it's

2226
01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:56,320
almost like enough air was pumped into

2227
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:56,719
the

2228
01:17:56,719 --> 01:17:59,520
markov blanket metaphor it was becoming

2229
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:00,719
too big of a tent

2230
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:03,760
too big of a blanket and so now we can

2231
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:06,880
start to be really specific and and

2232
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:08,159
address

2233
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:09,360
those kinds of questions when are we

2234
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,360
talking about utility for the system

2235
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:12,880
when are we talking about utility for

2236
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,640
the modeler which of course

2237
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:17,280
maps very closely to um the

2238
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:18,239
distinguishing

2239
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:21,600
in uh that you raised with inference

2240
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:22,640
with an inference

2241
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:26,000
within a model so scott oh yeah

2242
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,199
if any of joe if you want to give a

2243
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:30,159
thought on that and then yeah

2244
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,640
can i can i just i'm really so we're

2245
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,000
already pleased with the reception this

2246
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,040
paper's had this particularly my

2247
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,560
reactive inference community and just

2248
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:38,159
just the reason you you said that i

2249
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:39,120
think

2250
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,640
one thing we were worried about but

2251
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,080
people have seen is that there is meant

2252
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,600
to be this more positive message that

2253
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:44,880
these aren't necessarily bad tools

2254
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,000
they're just different tools for

2255
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:46,719
different kinds of

2256
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:48,560
cases so i'm i'm really glad that people

2257
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,080
have seen that and kind of taken that as

2258
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:50,480
a

2259
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:53,600
helpful message it's it's the yes

2260
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,960
and approach to the literature it's not

2261
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:59,840
blood sports it's not a knock down drag

2262
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,360
out with citations

2263
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:04,000
we can just build upon each other and uh

2264
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:04,800
come to more

2265
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:08,400
useful and good ways of communicating

2266
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,440
so scott and anyone else yeah just two

2267
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:13,120
points one along those lines

2268
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,520
in in law one of the most effective

2269
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:17,600
strategies for disambiguating something

2270
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:20,239
is saying what it isn't

2271
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:21,760
right and so even if you don't know what

2272
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,840
it is you can at least start to say what

2273
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,120
it isn't

2274
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:28,640
and so that's a handy notion along the

2275
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:29,840
lines here and as

2276
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:32,320
last couple of comments we're observing

2277
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:33,760
we had this thing out there that was

2278
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:34,719
very exciting

2279
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:36,400
and we kind of everyone was playing with

2280
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,560
it and said oh yeah and it's the same

2281
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,080
things happened in privacy

2282
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,320
the word privacy is just carrying water

2283
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,800
for all sorts of anxieties right now

2284
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,040
the word trust has all sorts of

2285
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:48,000
precision so

2286
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,640
the problem with language is we got a

2287
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:51,840
lot of subtlety and a lot of

2288
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,440
interactions interactions are

2289
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,679
increasing exponentially through

2290
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:57,280
exponential increase in interactions

2291
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:59,199
globally is an assertion that i make at

2292
01:19:59,199 --> 01:20:00,000
least

2293
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,480
and if you think about that we still

2294
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,080
have a vocabulary that's

2295
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:06,159
the same as it was way down the

2296
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:07,679
exponential curve of interaction

2297
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,560
increase

2298
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:11,440
so how do we capture our subtleties in

2299
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:12,400
our interactions

2300
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,280
right how do we expand our vocabulary

2301
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:16,880
what's exactly what we're talking about

2302
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,239
here is we take words

2303
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:20,800
we use them by analogy in other areas

2304
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:21,760
right we've already talked about

2305
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,040
blankets well these aren't really

2306
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,960
blankets at all and in fact we get

2307
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,560
hijacked by the notion of blanket we've

2308
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:27,520
already seen that

2309
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,440
it's starting to use those is it a

2310
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,120
blanket or is it a membrane

2311
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,639
well is it semi-permeable well a

2312
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:34,159
blanket's not really semi-permeable you

2313
01:20:34,159 --> 01:20:35,280
know that kind of stuff right

2314
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:38,560
so it's fascinating that we

2315
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:42,080
have this is the the appropriate and

2316
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:46,000
um very exciting challenge to have

2317
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,800
to the taking it and run running with it

2318
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:49,360
idea

2319
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:52,800
early on in disambiguation and it means

2320
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,320
that there's a lot of energy which means

2321
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,840
there's a lot of need

2322
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,600
for whatever it is that's being served

2323
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,520
by the concept

2324
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,000
and so what you're as modelers this gets

2325
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,199
kind of interesting kind of gets into a

2326
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:05,280
manhattan project kind of ethics of

2327
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:06,719
science right

2328
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:08,880
because as modelers you do have

2329
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,560
responsibility and you're discharging it

2330
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:12,159
here by saying hey

2331
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:14,560
what does this mean for society you know

2332
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:17,199
should we develop nuclear energy

2333
01:21:17,199 --> 01:21:19,520
unfettered with regard to whether it can

2334
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:20,880
be used as a weapon

2335
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,639
right because this is this is powerful

2336
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:24,800
stuff here and so that

2337
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,560
raising of the notion and the

2338
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:28,239
questioning of whether it's appropriate

2339
01:21:28,239 --> 01:21:29,920
to apply these things

2340
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:32,080
socially is going to come up very

2341
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:33,440
quickly as

2342
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,199
people do things like the rhetoric that

2343
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:36,480
i'm talking about and start to apply it

2344
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:37,600
politically

2345
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:40,560
and start to recruit biases using these

2346
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:41,520
concepts

2347
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,199
that will be seen as a nefarious

2348
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:45,440
application of a scientific and

2349
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:47,679
mathematical statistical concept

2350
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:50,719
and so your paper and the questions

2351
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:52,239
you're raising now

2352
01:21:52,239 --> 01:21:54,840
are starting to lay that foundation of

2353
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,440
pause and saying to people in the future

2354
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:58,239
hey

2355
01:21:58,239 --> 01:22:00,320
don't be so fast to run with this and

2356
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,760
just take a minute

2357
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,600
to think about the implications what

2358
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,520
isn't this

2359
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,199
right and so starting to ask that

2360
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:09,760
question can be as important and

2361
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,920
sometimes more important than what it is

2362
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:13,520
thanks

2363
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,760
thank you there's a question from the

2364
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:17,040
chat

2365
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:19,600
sean kelly wrote are there special cases

2366
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,360
of markov blankets that shield

2367
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:25,199
internal states a markov shield so

2368
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:27,199
would any of the authors like to just

2369
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:30,400
give a response to that

2370
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:36,480
yeah yellow and then go ahead stephen i

2371
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:36,880
think

2372
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:40,639
i can give it a try um

2373
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:43,920
of course this really uh depends on what

2374
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:45,040
you mean by shielding

2375
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:48,000
uh right and uh i think in the paper and

2376
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:48,639
also

2377
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:50,880
i mean in the paper we use a statistical

2378
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:53,199
notion of shielding

2379
01:22:53,199 --> 01:22:55,520
that is pretty much equivalent to

2380
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:57,360
conditional independence

2381
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:00,560
right so if

2382
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:02,400
if you have three nodes and there's one

2383
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:03,840
intermediate node

2384
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:07,360
such that knowing the intermediate node

2385
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:07,760
will

2386
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:10,080
will will mean that knowing the third

2387
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:10,800
node doesn't

2388
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:13,360
not mean anything doesn't give you

2389
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:13,920
anything

2390
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,880
for for knowing your first node uh then

2391
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:18,639
that's a notion of shielding in this

2392
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:21,520
in in the sense that the second node

2393
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:22,639
kind of epistemically

2394
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:25,760
shields off uh the the

2395
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:28,080
activity of the at the third node from

2396
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,920
from whatever happens at the first node

2397
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,560
and this is an epistemic notion of

2398
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:33,920
epistemic and statistical notion of

2399
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:36,320
shielding and also that one right i mean

2400
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,600
shielding has a lot of kind of more

2401
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,280
everyday kind of connotations that are

2402
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:40,639
necessary not necessarily can be

2403
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:42,320
congruent with this physical

2404
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,960
uh notion but if you mean a statistical

2405
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:45,840
notion then

2406
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:47,600
yes the very definition of a markov

2407
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,040
blanket is

2408
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:51,040
that the things inside of the blanket

2409
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:53,280
are given the marker blink it's shielded

2410
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:54,639
off from the rest of the world in that

2411
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:56,719
statistical sense

2412
01:23:56,719 --> 01:23:58,719
thank you that was what i was thinking

2413
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:00,320
insulation like a

2414
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:03,040
heat insulator is shielding it and so

2415
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:04,480
that is kind of what these

2416
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,679
nodes are doing statistically and then

2417
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:09,280
we're nuancing what kinds

2418
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:12,000
of of categories these nodes might fit

2419
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,760
into

2420
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:15,199
and that's a key difference between

2421
01:24:15,199 --> 01:24:17,840
pearls phrasing and fristen's phrasing

2422
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,600
is the extent to which nodes are

2423
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,840
classified into different kinds

2424
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:25,600
so steven and then anyone else

2425
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:28,880
yeah i think that question about how

2426
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:32,080
things and when we scale up

2427
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:37,120
is really important and in predictive

2428
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,679
processing and the modeling you know you

2429
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:41,920
have this hierarchical model

2430
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:45,520
of things going up to higher levels and

2431
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,920
yeah there could be this implicit

2432
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:50,320
suggestion that each of those steps or

2433
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,080
somewhere up there it's going to other

2434
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:52,480
size

2435
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:55,920
blankets but it may not be that blankets

2436
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:56,560
are needed

2437
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:59,280
as much um to go another layer it might

2438
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:00,159
be that there's

2439
01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:03,520
some sort of process structure that

2440
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,560
is doing the job at lower levels it's a

2441
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:07,520
more

2442
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:09,440
active influence process and if i could

2443
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,360
give one metaphor there was a metaphor

2444
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:12,400
i'd put on about

2445
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,960
if there's a flag stuck in some mud and

2446
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:16,719
it looks quite stable but it's blowing

2447
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:17,520
in the wind

2448
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:20,719
okay and then i have another flag which

2449
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:22,080
is stuck in some mud it's actually the

2450
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:22,560
top of an

2451
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:25,040
ant hill and underneath the ants are all

2452
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:27,679
swarming to hold it still

2453
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:29,600
so and it's actually a little bit more

2454
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:32,639
still but actually the hole is more open

2455
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:36,840
so in the first case it's energetically

2456
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:40,480
thermodynamically more an equilibrium

2457
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:43,840
is being held in a sp in one place

2458
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,600
the second one you think it's in more of

2459
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:48,239
a thermodynamic equilibrium because it

2460
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:49,679
seems more firm but actually there's a

2461
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:51,520
whole swarm of ants underneath

2462
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:53,920
trying to hold it in place and but none

2463
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:55,199
of them have got that intention but

2464
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:56,800
looking from the outside the system is

2465
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:58,400
holding the flag

2466
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:01,280
but from the point of view from the ants

2467
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:03,199
they're trying to enact some sort of

2468
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:05,360
action policy and i suppose i wonder if

2469
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,440
there's something similar between

2470
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,120
you know the system as seen from the

2471
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:11,120
outside as a state

2472
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,760
and the kind of swarming that's going on

2473
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,600
underneath and that the two can get

2474
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:18,400
mixed up sometimes

2475
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:21,520
thanks steven um always a great uh

2476
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:22,960
challenge an eternal question what are

2477
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:25,040
the ants trying to do but what you just

2478
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:28,080
pointed out there is is really it's

2479
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:29,679
related to this distinction they draw

2480
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:30,719
with these four

2481
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:33,280
different cases the difference between a

2482
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:33,920
generative

2483
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,400
model which is like the modeler's

2484
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:37,679
perspective on a

2485
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:40,639
something versus the generative process

2486
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:41,199
and so

2487
01:26:41,199 --> 01:26:42,480
those are two different generative

2488
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:43,920
processes that are giving rise to the

2489
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:45,360
movement of these two different

2490
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,360
flags let's say there's two different

2491
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:48,719
processes underlying it

2492
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:50,560
those are realist claims about what is

2493
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:51,760
giving rise

2494
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:54,880
and then there's all different kinds of

2495
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:56,800
perspectives that can be taken

2496
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:00,080
um but if we mix up two people's

2497
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,280
perspectives or if we mix up a

2498
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:04,159
generative model a generative process

2499
01:27:04,159 --> 01:27:07,120
it's a category error and if we're

2500
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:08,000
coincidentally

2501
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,560
correct it would be miraculous because

2502
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:11,440
it'd be a

2503
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,679
the wrong kind of thing that's being

2504
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:14,639
considered

2505
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:18,480
so it is extremely important to um

2506
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:21,199
prevent that kind of misinterpretation

2507
01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:21,840
by really

2508
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:24,080
asking are we talking about the process

2509
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:25,840
degenerative process or the generative

2510
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:26,560
model

2511
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:28,080
and sometimes even just that

2512
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:30,320
distinguishing as well as this four-fold

2513
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:31,679
uh

2514
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:34,239
classification raised here these go a

2515
01:27:34,239 --> 01:27:35,679
long way towards helping

2516
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:40,800
model so scott and then anyone else

2517
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:43,520
since we have europeans on the line i'd

2518
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:45,520
like to talk about kant for a second and

2519
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:46,239
i want to

2520
01:27:46,239 --> 01:27:49,840
display my ignorance of kant

2521
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:53,120
um and the categorical imperative

2522
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:57,199
so i i i complain about the categorical

2523
01:27:57,199 --> 01:27:57,920
imperative

2524
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:01,040
because i if can one person

2525
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,880
know enough have enough situational

2526
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:05,520
awareness so that their good acts

2527
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:08,400
can translate into goodness in the world

2528
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:09,600
and again maybe that's total

2529
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:10,960
misinterpretation of con

2530
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:13,840
or maybe just got it all wrong but in

2531
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:14,719
the same way

2532
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:17,920
i wonder about markov blankets and

2533
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:23,840
this notion of knowledge of an awareness

2534
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:27,679
so that because because that one of the

2535
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:29,920
problems we see in the world is even a

2536
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:31,760
good actor

2537
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:35,280
if they don't have good in information

2538
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:36,639
can do bad things like in the

2539
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:38,239
sustainable development goals of the

2540
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:40,000
united nations

2541
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,880
they put in a gujarat power plant was

2542
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:44,400
funded by a un

2543
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:47,679
based financing agency and it cost a

2544
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:49,199
billion dollars or whatever

2545
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:51,440
and they were crowing about the success

2546
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:52,639
of sustaining

2547
01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:55,199
sustainable development goals of energy

2548
01:28:55,199 --> 01:28:56,000
and development were

2549
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,880
being pursued and furthered but what

2550
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,679
they didn't

2551
01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:02,639
talk about and they then got sued in in

2552
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:03,120
the

2553
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:06,239
court over is the fact that the local

2554
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:07,840
fishermen and local population was

2555
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:08,960
pollution

2556
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:11,679
and so it poisoned the local waters and

2557
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:14,000
the local population with the pollution

2558
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,280
so they didn't do a sufficient analysis

2559
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:19,120
even in this situation where they're

2560
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:20,639
trying to improve the world

2561
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:22,560
and listing out all these goals of the

2562
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,159
world that's their

2563
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:26,159
declaration that's their amsterdam flag

2564
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:27,280
of what they're trying to do with the

2565
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:27,760
u.n

2566
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:31,280
right so but nonetheless they pursued

2567
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:32,560
one goal

2568
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:35,520
at the expense of other goals and one of

2569
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:36,159
the things i'm

2570
01:29:36,159 --> 01:29:38,239
interested in your thoughts you can go

2571
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:39,760
into contact one and also

2572
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:42,440
correct me on my bad county and

2573
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:44,080
non-interpretation there

2574
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:46,719
but um can you comment a little bit on

2575
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:48,960
awareness and knowledge

2576
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:50,800
we talk about group and individual

2577
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:52,480
markov blankets but can we talk a little

2578
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,000
bit about

2579
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,320
that notion about sharing of knowledge

2580
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:57,840
and situational awareness

2581
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:00,239
just as a survival strategy the ants

2582
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:02,080
were surviving in the

2583
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:05,360
um shannon's tilting bridge

2584
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:08,639
example before um which was

2585
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:11,360
a survival thing in stephen's flag

2586
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:12,880
projection that was a little bit more

2587
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,560
the answer a little bit

2588
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:17,280
smarter about their externalities than

2589
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:17,840
that one

2590
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:19,440
anyway but can you comment a little bit

2591
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:21,360
about how do we get

2592
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:24,000
how how might these analyses and these

2593
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:24,560
models

2594
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:27,679
and their implementations in reality and

2595
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:28,560
in the lab

2596
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:31,600
help us to understand the nature

2597
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:36,080
of group information float thanks

2598
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:39,440
thanks for the question so if anyone has

2599
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:40,159
a

2600
01:30:40,159 --> 01:30:42,000
thought yep gala go for it and then

2601
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
anyone else

2602
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
great i i'll give it a try i'm not sure

2603
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,679
if i can tie it all the way back to the

2604
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:48,480
categorical

2605
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:51,520
imperative but that's uh let's give it a

2606
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,239
go

2607
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:56,080
um so i think the first thing

2608
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:58,480
that the way i understand it uh the kind

2609
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:00,400
of active inference framework is really

2610
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:02,480
a theory of learning for a particular

2611
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:04,159
kind of

2612
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:07,520
environments so in a sense organisms

2613
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:09,440
start to learn to adapt to the

2614
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:11,600
specific niche niche that they are that

2615
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:13,520
they are

2616
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:16,719
engaged in and then somehow

2617
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:18,560
slowly build up a particular model of

2618
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:20,400
that particular kind of niche

2619
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:23,120
that you can of course and that that

2620
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:24,719
model you can use also

2621
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:27,199
for hypothetical kind of situations or

2622
01:31:27,199 --> 01:31:28,639
counter factuals or

2623
01:31:28,639 --> 01:31:30,320
or new kind of situations but there's no

2624
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:31,920
guarantee that this kind of previous

2625
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,280
history

2626
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:36,159
uh uh i mean if you if you if you enter

2627
01:31:36,159 --> 01:31:38,320
a new niche or if the world changes

2628
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:40,239
it's it's not guaranteed that your

2629
01:31:40,239 --> 01:31:41,760
previous knowledge

2630
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:44,400
will be uh uh will be specific to the

2631
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:46,080
new situation and we'll be we'll work in

2632
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:46,400
that

2633
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:49,920
in a new particular kind of situation um

2634
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,080
so i guess there that indeed the the

2635
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:53,280
kind of

2636
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:55,760
active inference framework gives you a

2637
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:56,719
perspective

2638
01:31:56,719 --> 01:31:59,120
on

2639
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:02,880
situated situation specific knowledge

2640
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:06,000
and not on the kind of categorical the

2641
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,639
domain general knowledge and so this

2642
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:09,280
doesn't

2643
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:12,480
guarantee indeed that if you use your or

2644
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:14,639
use your model to make inferences about

2645
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:18,800
new situations that that you will

2646
01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:22,480
end up on on the right result and so

2647
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:25,760
that gap between what will be your best

2648
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:26,560
action

2649
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:28,159
according to whatever kind of imperative

2650
01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:30,239
you set for yourself in reality and how

2651
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:32,480
it works out that's always a gap in in

2652
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:34,320
in in the knowledge that you have

2653
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:35,679
uh what you need is related to the

2654
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:37,040
difference between the kind of the

2655
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:38,239
causal dynamic of the world

2656
01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:40,719
the generative process and the general

2657
01:32:40,719 --> 01:32:42,400
model of the world that you

2658
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:45,520
that you have and so i get that that

2659
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:46,480
that's indeed

2660
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:49,600
why perhaps i mean speculating that that

2661
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,199
different kind of

2662
01:32:51,199 --> 01:32:54,000
ethical frameworks might might might fit

2663
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,600
better in such a kind of approach rather

2664
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:55,850
than

2665
01:32:55,850 --> 01:32:57,199
[Music]

2666
01:32:57,199 --> 01:33:00,159
the other logical one

2667
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:03,040
that was very oh yeah go ahead chris

2668
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:04,880
chris

2669
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:07,120
uh yeah i just wanted to follow up on

2670
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:08,000
this a little

2671
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,320
bit because we the the notion you know

2672
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,080
the the distinction between the

2673
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:13,679
generative model and the generative

2674
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:14,639
process was

2675
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:16,560
brought up before and now yella alluded

2676
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,800
to it and i think it's really important

2677
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:20,960
to keep in mind that

2678
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:22,719
the free energy principle so so the

2679
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:24,639
generals maybe let's start differently

2680
01:33:24,639 --> 01:33:26,000
the generative process right

2681
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,880
is supposedly the process or the the the

2682
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:30,719
causal process that produces certain

2683
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:32,960
sensations in an organism

2684
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:34,800
and then the generative model is

2685
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:36,320
supposed to be

2686
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:39,760
on this framework producing predictions

2687
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:41,760
right which which kind of explain away

2688
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:43,760
in the bayesian sense

2689
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:46,000
uh the differentiations that the model

2690
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,040
is the

2691
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:50,159
the the organism is experiencing

2692
01:33:50,159 --> 01:33:52,639
and the idea that's implicit in a lot of

2693
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:54,320
the literature is that you know you have

2694
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:56,159
the generative process on this side you

2695
01:33:56,159 --> 01:33:57,840
have the generative model that's trying

2696
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:01,040
to mirror the generative process there's

2697
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:03,199
the sensory sheath in the middle

2698
01:34:03,199 --> 01:34:05,120
and that these two these two things will

2699
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:06,880
somehow you know fall down to each other

2700
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:08,639
and they will be just perfect

2701
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:10,320
uh there will be some kind of a perfect

2702
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:13,199
resemblance or mapping between them

2703
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:15,760
um and that's not entirely it's not

2704
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:17,360
entirely clear that

2705
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,320
this is the most successful evolutionary

2706
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:22,239
successful strategy so

2707
01:34:22,239 --> 01:34:25,360
the generative model only needs to

2708
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,679
recapitulate the generative process to

2709
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:29,760
the extent that it's successful

2710
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:32,719
for in a given ecological niche or even

2711
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:34,080
social niche

2712
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:36,320
to ensure the survival and reproduction

2713
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:38,400
of the organism right

2714
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:41,679
um and so so that's one thing that's i

2715
01:34:41,679 --> 01:34:42,800
think important to

2716
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:45,360
remember about this that that you know

2717
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:46,639
the free energy principle

2718
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:49,360
from the get-go kind of does not

2719
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:50,320
necessarily

2720
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:53,520
produce agents that are perfectly

2721
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:56,480
that will be always um optimally

2722
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:58,320
informed about what's going on

2723
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:00,480
in their surroundings they just kind of

2724
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,560
really they they learn just enough to

2725
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:04,400
stay alive

2726
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:07,840
and of course the inclusion of active

2727
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:09,760
influence gives them an advantage over

2728
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:12,320
traditional bayesian agents because they

2729
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,880
can also go and try things out

2730
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:17,760
and learn in this way but it still

2731
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:18,800
doesn't

2732
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:21,280
give take us all the way so to speak uh

2733
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:23,520
to to to to kind of transcend

2734
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:26,480
our model and and and and get to know

2735
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:27,760
the the process that

2736
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:30,320
that that's out there in the world and i

2737
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:32,400
think this is also true in the social

2738
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:34,159
domain in many ways so

2739
01:35:34,159 --> 01:35:35,920
so in the social domain i think it's

2740
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:37,840
very plausible that the same thing

2741
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:38,880
happens

2742
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:40,800
and we could expect that the same thing

2743
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,000
will happen for i

2744
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,360
know groups for example uh

2745
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:47,679
where where groups will form certain

2746
01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:48,960
models about how

2747
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:51,760
society operates or how the world is

2748
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,520
which will be optimal to their

2749
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:56,400
given epistemic situation and they're

2750
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:59,920
given social situation but will not be

2751
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:02,880
objective uh models of how the how

2752
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:06,320
society or the world operates

2753
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:08,719
thanks and what you just said there at

2754
01:36:08,719 --> 01:36:09,600
the end about

2755
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:12,000
the cultural ways of viewing the world

2756
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:12,960
it's um

2757
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:15,119
known that many cultures their own name

2758
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:16,159
for their own

2759
01:36:16,159 --> 01:36:18,560
country or homeland might be like this

2760
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:20,400
is the middle spot or this is like the

2761
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,000
main place

2762
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,440
it makes sense and it it's um

2763
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:28,320
it's unsurprising that it's that way but

2764
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:28,960
then

2765
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:30,719
just like scott said we're all comparing

2766
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:32,639
notes that's the phase of our

2767
01:36:32,639 --> 01:36:36,480
test that we're in and two people

2768
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:39,119
are mapping to a different territory

2769
01:36:39,119 --> 01:36:40,560
with the same

2770
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:43,440
relative egocentric map and so this

2771
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:45,360
question about how different egocentric

2772
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:46,400
perspectives

2773
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:49,199
and at which level uh those egocentric

2774
01:36:49,199 --> 01:36:50,560
perspectives exist at

2775
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:53,760
how those come into harmony is really an

2776
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:54,400
interesting

2777
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:57,119
question so stephen and then anyone else

2778
01:36:57,119 --> 01:36:58,239
who'd like to speak

2779
01:36:58,239 --> 01:37:00,239
and yeah this is awesome times it's been

2780
01:37:00,239 --> 01:37:01,679
a great discussion we have

2781
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:03,280
20 minutes or however much more people

2782
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:05,600
would like

2783
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:07,600
yeah i'd just like to i really thought

2784
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:08,880
that was a really interesting point

2785
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:09,760
there about

2786
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:11,600
when other approaches are maybe better

2787
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:13,440
than taking an ontological approach and

2788
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:14,480
i suppose it

2789
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:16,480
i think and you're talking about the

2790
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:18,320
epistemological approach

2791
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:19,840
i suppose that you get into this

2792
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:21,360
question of whether it's

2793
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:23,119
a more fuzzy i'd be interested in your

2794
01:37:23,119 --> 01:37:25,600
thoughts on like fuzzy logic and a more

2795
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:29,119
fuzzy based epistemology um

2796
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:32,000
rather than maybe the type of logical

2797
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,080
categorization of knowledge which ends

2798
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:36,480
up becoming ontological at some point

2799
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:37,760
and that there is this idea of

2800
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:39,520
ontological pluralism

2801
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,760
but they're sort of their way around

2802
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:42,560
this you know or

2803
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:45,199
third wave is that the third wave

2804
01:37:45,199 --> 01:37:46,960
inactive consciousness

2805
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:49,440
has that this idea that the mark of

2806
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:50,960
blankets because it breathes with

2807
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:53,040
different regimes of attention you

2808
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:55,119
it's sort of trying to get around that

2809
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:56,320
problem but

2810
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:58,800
there is it doesn't necessarily say how

2811
01:37:58,800 --> 01:37:59,760
they do that

2812
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:02,719
so just be curious yeah a bit more and

2813
01:38:02,719 --> 01:38:04,159
and the other thing if it's tying in

2814
01:38:04,159 --> 01:38:06,080
with other areas is like for instance

2815
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:07,920
they're talking about affect now a lot

2816
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:10,400
and affect is this kind of integration

2817
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:12,800
which then ties in in qualitative

2818
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:14,800
research where you have axiology which

2819
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,000
is kind of the the

2820
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,119
normally this thing which is sort of

2821
01:38:17,119 --> 01:38:19,040
down there in arts-based methods but you

2822
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:19,679
know the

2823
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:21,440
the one where it's about how people feel

2824
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:23,360
about things well now that starts to

2825
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,560
become

2826
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:27,679
part of a lot of what we're

2827
01:38:27,679 --> 01:38:29,760
understanding about the world so it

2828
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:31,600
could actually have quite an implication

2829
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:35,600
for participatory interactive kind of

2830
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:38,320
research methods and making them

2831
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:40,960
much more central in a way so i wonder

2832
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:42,159
any of your thoughts on that

2833
01:38:42,159 --> 01:38:46,080
about about that from the authors

2834
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:49,840
thanks steven if anyone has

2835
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:52,560
any thoughts on that or can raise their

2836
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:52,960
hand

2837
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:58,159
yeah yell it go for it um

2838
01:38:58,159 --> 01:39:00,880
i mean so so i guess what what we do in

2839
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:02,239
our paper is a little bit

2840
01:39:02,239 --> 01:39:05,600
before that that step right so uh on the

2841
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:07,040
question of

2842
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:09,440
uh uh ontology phases versus

2843
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:10,800
epistemology

2844
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:12,639
should you go for a kind of ontological

2845
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:14,400
pluralism

2846
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:16,880
or not i think what you tried to say is

2847
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:18,159
that

2848
01:39:18,159 --> 01:39:20,239
luke here's a is a class of models that

2849
01:39:20,239 --> 01:39:22,560
are typically used in literature

2850
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:25,920
as abstractions from a target phenomenon

2851
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:26,719
right

2852
01:39:26,719 --> 01:39:28,800
and so if you want to enter if you want

2853
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:30,639
to understand those

2854
01:39:30,639 --> 01:39:33,360
uh uh in kind of on the logical terms

2855
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:33,920
that that's

2856
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:36,480
that's fine but you need to give a story

2857
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:38,000
about how

2858
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,400
how that abstraction relates to the

2859
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:41,760
target phenomenon

2860
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:44,800
uh uh that is that that is there so

2861
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:45,520
either

2862
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:47,199
uh if you go to into metaphase you go

2863
01:39:47,199 --> 01:39:48,960
from a kind of more

2864
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:50,800
uh platenese kind of root and you say

2865
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:52,880
well actually this mathematical model is

2866
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:54,239
not an abstraction from the target

2867
01:39:54,239 --> 01:39:55,920
system but it actually

2868
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:57,760
nature at its jones is somehow

2869
01:39:57,760 --> 01:39:59,600
mathematically structured

2870
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:03,360
um or you you say look no these are

2871
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:05,040
these are indeed abstractions

2872
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:07,440
produced by us and they they're useful

2873
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:09,440
in predicting and interpreting the world

2874
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:11,440
uh but they are not themselves the the

2875
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:12,480
the world

2876
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:15,280
uh so in a sense we we kind of offer the

2877
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:17,119
the kind of dilemma to anyone who

2878
01:40:17,119 --> 01:40:18,480
who wants to make a commitment or a

2879
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:20,239
choice there between epistemology or

2880
01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:22,800
ontology or anthropological pluralism

2881
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,280
um saying like look you you can go the

2882
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:26,960
ontological route

2883
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:29,119
and uh of course this is the way more

2884
01:40:29,119 --> 01:40:31,040
challenging interesting kind of exciting

2885
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:33,920
uh route but then you either need to

2886
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:34,560
bite this

2887
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:37,280
this this bullets that that these models

2888
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:38,080
are not really

2889
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:39,679
abstractions but somehow underlying

2890
01:40:39,679 --> 01:40:42,080
reality or need to give some some

2891
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:45,360
other sort of story about how that

2892
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:48,880
how it works and uh i mean i'm i think

2893
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:50,639
personally i'm curious to see what what

2894
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:52,400
what what the response from from the

2895
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:53,679
community will be

2896
01:40:53,679 --> 01:40:56,239
uh which of those uh options people will

2897
01:40:56,239 --> 01:40:56,960
take but

2898
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,199
i mean i don't think either of us is

2899
01:40:59,199 --> 01:41:00,960
necessarily committed to one of those

2900
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:03,119
those which are not but just saying okay

2901
01:41:03,119 --> 01:41:06,000
look if you want to do it then these are

2902
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,080
these are the rules kind of so to say

2903
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:09,119
maybe disagree with the rules that's

2904
01:41:09,119 --> 01:41:10,880
fine as well but then give an argument

2905
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:11,440
for

2906
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:13,599
that

2907
01:41:14,719 --> 01:41:18,080
thanks very interesting stuff

2908
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:21,199
anyone else have any thoughts

2909
01:41:21,199 --> 01:41:23,280
uh yeah stephen and then anyone else go

2910
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:25,040
for it

2911
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:27,360
yeah i think that i i agree a lot with

2912
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:28,639
what you're saying there i think there's

2913
01:41:28,639 --> 01:41:30,000
there are some gaps

2914
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,880
in um and and rather than saying there's

2915
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:33,920
a gap sometimes

2916
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:36,880
it's just filled with the markov blanket

2917
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:38,239
if that makes sense

2918
01:41:38,239 --> 01:41:40,560
um if in doubt fill it with a markov

2919
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:41,280
blanket

2920
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:43,040
and i've been really curious i'm

2921
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:44,639
actually looking a lot

2922
01:41:44,639 --> 01:41:47,760
in terms of how organisms structure

2923
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:50,320
like the idea of parry personal space

2924
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:52,480
and and spatial

2925
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:54,800
inactive ecological approaches and and

2926
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:55,679
the way that

2927
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:59,280
maybe there's a a way that that space

2928
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:01,119
is actually um and there's a field

2929
01:42:01,119 --> 01:42:03,040
called mental space psychology which has

2930
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:04,320
been a very fringe

2931
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:07,280
field um actually a lot of it based in

2932
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:08,560
holland and that

2933
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:12,639
um is uh it seems more plausible now

2934
01:42:12,639 --> 01:42:15,040
with this so it was a much more practice

2935
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:16,480
based approach but

2936
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:18,719
um i thought i'd share that anyway

2937
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:20,239
because i'm presenting something this

2938
01:42:20,239 --> 01:42:21,440
friday so

2939
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:23,440
um but it's i i do think there's

2940
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:25,360
something missing in terms of

2941
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:28,639
um mechanisms that extend out

2942
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:31,280
beyond the body into the space and it

2943
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:33,199
may not have to be

2944
01:42:33,199 --> 01:42:37,280
um at all levels pristine's

2945
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:43,199
blankets in in the traditional sense

2946
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:46,480
shannon and then anyone else

2947
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:49,679
um i'm gonna talk about

2948
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:53,360
brains so i know we've been

2949
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:55,040
extending you know into the world into

2950
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:57,199
the body into the body and everything

2951
01:42:57,199 --> 01:43:00,080
um and we've been talking a lot about

2952
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:00,719
group

2953
01:43:00,719 --> 01:43:03,040
dynamics and maybe how groups behave or

2954
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:04,320
how we feel like

2955
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:07,360
part of a different group um and

2956
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:11,360
earlier we super briefly touched on

2957
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:14,159
mere neurons um so these are neurons

2958
01:43:14,159 --> 01:43:15,280
that fire when

2959
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:17,760
i observe an action the same as when i

2960
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,840
do an action

2961
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:23,520
and there's been a lot of work lately

2962
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:26,800
not necessarily on near neurons

2963
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:30,320
but on inter brain synergies or you

2964
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:31,600
might call them interbrain

2965
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:35,360
coherence or cross brain coherence where

2966
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:38,639
lots of dynamics in my brain are firing

2967
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:40,880
very similar to lots of dynamics in your

2968
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:42,159
brain

2969
01:43:42,159 --> 01:43:45,280
um and this could be because they can

2970
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:47,280
work from mary hassan

2971
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:49,679
on neuro cinematics this could be

2972
01:43:49,679 --> 01:43:50,960
because we're watching

2973
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:54,239
a film and it's

2974
01:43:54,239 --> 01:43:56,480
evoking similar responses because we're

2975
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:58,719
all attending to the same stimulus

2976
01:43:58,719 --> 01:44:02,000
but the film that we're watching

2977
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,480
it could have a structure where the

2978
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:06,000
filmmaker sort of

2979
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,639
designs what you pay attention to um and

2980
01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:09,440
so

2981
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:11,280
most people's gazes will fall in that

2982
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:13,040
direction um

2983
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:14,880
you'll have even more similar sort of

2984
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:16,400
inter-brain coherence

2985
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:17,760
or unstructured where you're just sort

2986
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:19,280
of filming a scene and there's maybe

2987
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:20,719
some people over here some people over

2988
01:44:20,719 --> 01:44:21,600
there and

2989
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:23,920
your gazes will could differ a little

2990
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:25,360
bit more these structures could differ a

2991
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:25,840
little

2992
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:29,679
more um and

2993
01:44:29,679 --> 01:44:33,280
this is all to say how

2994
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:35,040
like the film is the environment in this

2995
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:36,639
case

2996
01:44:36,639 --> 01:44:38,960
and

2997
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:42,000
if we're talking about the rest of the

2998
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,760
world being the environment or like us

2999
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:46,239
in this room being the environment our

3000
01:44:46,239 --> 01:44:48,080
gaze is structured in a certain way by

3001
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:50,400
there's a blue box on my jitsi screen

3002
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:52,400
so it's sort of directing everyone's

3003
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:54,320
attention at my face

3004
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:58,159
um but there's also some

3005
01:44:58,159 --> 01:44:59,760
lack of structure i don't know that

3006
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:01,679
we're seeing the same

3007
01:45:01,679 --> 01:45:05,040
tiles in every space

3008
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:11,040
and there's different ways that

3009
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:13,040
if we interacted like if i interacted

3010
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:14,239
with one of you

3011
01:45:14,239 --> 01:45:16,719
a lot in my daily life like maybe steve

3012
01:45:16,719 --> 01:45:18,719
and i hang out and get coffee every day

3013
01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:20,480
and we talk about something every single

3014
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:22,760
day so we have

3015
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:25,520
a propensity to pay attention to similar

3016
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:27,040
things in similar ways

3017
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:29,440
and we've been specifically talking

3018
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:32,000
about yella's idea and how much we agree

3019
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,600
or disagree with it or something

3020
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:35,520
so we are continually like drawing our

3021
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:38,000
gaze to yellow to see if he understands

3022
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,239
um or agrees with what we're saying like

3023
01:45:40,239 --> 01:45:42,080
there might be this similar inter-brain

3024
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:44,560
coherence between stephen and i

3025
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:47,199
that's different between me and blue

3026
01:45:47,199 --> 01:45:48,000
because

3027
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,600
blue and i never talk we're not even

3028
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:52,239
friends um these are all hypothetical by

3029
01:45:52,239 --> 01:45:53,119
the way

3030
01:45:53,119 --> 01:45:56,960
um and these so a question it's not you

3031
01:45:56,960 --> 01:45:59,280
know um

3032
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:01,280
in your paper necessarily but like if

3033
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:02,400
we're looking

3034
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:05,920
for markup blankets in the world

3035
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:08,000
one thing that we could look at is

3036
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,920
something like a

3037
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:11,760
inter brain coherence and that might be

3038
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:13,920
something real in the world or it might

3039
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:15,920
be a pearl blanket something that we use

3040
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:19,440
to describe how people

3041
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:20,960
interpret something the same or how

3042
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:22,719
their brain activities

3043
01:46:22,719 --> 01:46:26,320
are synergistic in a certain way

3044
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:29,520
and if you can be

3045
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:31,199
empirical i know we were being

3046
01:46:31,199 --> 01:46:32,719
rhetorical a lot of times but if you can

3047
01:46:32,719 --> 01:46:34,239
be empirical

3048
01:46:34,239 --> 01:46:37,520
and look at these signatures of either

3049
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:39,360
you know conversation dynamics or brain

3050
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:40,560
dynamics

3051
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:42,800
and can relate them to how the world is

3052
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:43,679
structuring them

3053
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:45,679
then that's a way that you can look for

3054
01:46:45,679 --> 01:46:47,920
you can still keep looking for

3055
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:50,159
markup blankets in the world or find it

3056
01:46:50,159 --> 01:46:51,280
useful

3057
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:54,560
um it's definitely i think

3058
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:56,560
what we keep coming back to when we're

3059
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:57,920
talking about

3060
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:00,639
um these blankets as a metaphor these

3061
01:47:00,639 --> 01:47:02,080
blankets is something real is that we

3062
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:04,080
can totally have

3063
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:07,360
both as long as we're specific about

3064
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:10,480
which one we're referring to

3065
01:47:10,719 --> 01:47:13,600
thank you shannon yeller and then anyone

3066
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:15,840
else

3067
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:18,480
thanks shannon that's really interesting

3068
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:20,159
um

3069
01:47:20,159 --> 01:47:23,119
and i think that there there there's

3070
01:47:23,119 --> 01:47:24,639
there's a couple of things there right

3071
01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:27,040
i mean and and in either one sense if

3072
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:28,159
two people

3073
01:47:28,159 --> 01:47:31,600
have the same same background same

3074
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:33,119
experiences all right they might they

3075
01:47:33,119 --> 01:47:33,520
might

3076
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:35,840
parse a particular kind of movie or

3077
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:37,119
scene in in

3078
01:47:37,119 --> 01:47:38,800
in in a similar kind of way such that if

3079
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:41,040
you put them in in room separate from

3080
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:42,000
each other

3081
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:45,119
you you will indeed see a similar kind

3082
01:47:45,119 --> 01:47:46,960
of neurodynamic

3083
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:49,119
going on in both both cases maybe tight

3084
01:47:49,119 --> 01:47:50,480
indeed to attention where you pay

3085
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:52,800
attention your gaze etcetera

3086
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:57,040
um the other one is indeed kind of

3087
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:59,440
on-site kind of interpersonal

3088
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:01,040
synchronization that might be happening

3089
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:02,880
right and i know there's this kind of

3090
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:04,560
it's kind of second person neuroscience

3091
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:06,480
kind of approaches that that try to

3092
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:07,679
capture those kind of things in the

3093
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:09,119
experimental setting

3094
01:48:09,119 --> 01:48:11,600
and see how how how in what particular

3095
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:12,960
kind of settings

3096
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:16,840
brainwaves synchronize and uh et cetera

3097
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:19,119
um and that kind of second perspective

3098
01:48:19,119 --> 01:48:19,920
reminds me a lot

3099
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:22,159
of uh uh of the kind of discussion

3100
01:48:22,159 --> 01:48:23,440
that's there in active inference on

3101
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:25,199
generalized synchronization right so

3102
01:48:25,199 --> 01:48:26,400
these are the kind of examples that you

3103
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:29,040
get when as there's uh

3104
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:30,960
uh two coupled clocks standing on the

3105
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:32,960
table and is tend to synchronize after

3106
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:34,880
after a while so this is a very simple

3107
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:36,480
causal mechanism

3108
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:38,239
uh causal structure where

3109
01:48:38,239 --> 01:48:40,080
synchronization just occurs over

3110
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:43,920
or over over time um

3111
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:46,159
and when i first started thinking about

3112
01:48:46,159 --> 01:48:48,080
uh uh marco blankets

3113
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:50,080
i i i used that kind of example as a

3114
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:51,520
kind of reduction that

3115
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:54,080
absurd him saying like look if if these

3116
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:55,440
things even have a marker blanket right

3117
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:56,400
then it's an empty

3118
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:59,440
uh uh empty notion now

3119
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:00,800
having worked with these with these

3120
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,239
philosophers of science here i think i

3121
01:49:02,239 --> 01:49:02,639
think

3122
01:49:02,639 --> 01:49:04,800
need to be a bit more more more specific

3123
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:05,679
and indeed say

3124
01:49:05,679 --> 01:49:07,920
look okay whether that thing has or has

3125
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:10,320
not a michael blanket that that that's

3126
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:11,920
that that's a different question but

3127
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:13,599
there's there is a point that there is a

3128
01:49:13,599 --> 01:49:15,119
very

3129
01:49:15,119 --> 01:49:18,239
uh uh simple structure of kind of

3130
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:20,000
causal dependence and causal

3131
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,679
independence such as if you would fix

3132
01:49:21,679 --> 01:49:22,400
the table

3133
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:23,920
perfectly the things would not

3134
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:26,159
synchronize and if you would let it

3135
01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:27,360
slide a little bit and wobble a little

3136
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:29,599
bit then they would they do synchronize

3137
01:49:29,599 --> 01:49:30,719
so there is a kind of thing

3138
01:49:30,719 --> 01:49:32,639
like this intermediate factor that

3139
01:49:32,639 --> 01:49:34,320
mediates a causal relationship between

3140
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:35,199
those

3141
01:49:35,199 --> 01:49:38,320
uh uh those two things now the question

3142
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:38,639
is

3143
01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:40,719
is that do you need to have a markup

3144
01:49:40,719 --> 01:49:42,080
blanket for that does mark

3145
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:44,239
do market blankets add anything there or

3146
01:49:44,239 --> 01:49:45,599
is it kind of

3147
01:49:45,599 --> 01:49:47,360
a story about kind of causal dependence

3148
01:49:47,360 --> 01:49:50,239
and causal independence

3149
01:49:50,239 --> 01:49:54,799
enough i think that well

3150
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:57,280
causal dependence there and cults are

3151
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:59,760
independent such that if i would do this

3152
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:01,920
then there would be no synchronization i

3153
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:03,360
think that's enough and then

3154
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:06,239
what do you call that a kind of markov

3155
01:50:06,239 --> 01:50:06,800
blanket

3156
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:08,639
is is a second kind of question you need

3157
01:50:08,639 --> 01:50:09,840
to translate it back to the kind of

3158
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:10,800
world of

3159
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:12,320
causal models and and see how they

3160
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:14,080
relate to them uh

3161
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:15,599
but i think there's yeah there's a clear

3162
01:50:15,599 --> 01:50:17,520
case to be made that this is parallel

3163
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:18,320
between

3164
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:19,920
the kind of cases you are describing and

3165
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:21,440
the kind of synchronization settings

3166
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:22,159
that are there

3167
01:50:22,159 --> 01:50:26,480
in in this kind of couple clock examples

3168
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:30,159
thanks and one interesting aspect to

3169
01:50:30,159 --> 01:50:30,639
kind of

3170
01:50:30,639 --> 01:50:32,239
bring it back to this discussion about

3171
01:50:32,239 --> 01:50:33,679
the internet you know what kind of

3172
01:50:33,679 --> 01:50:35,679
beliefs propagate culturally on what

3173
01:50:35,679 --> 01:50:38,800
kind of connectivity uh

3174
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:41,520
just like shannon was saying with the

3175
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:43,280
video chat and with the live stream

3176
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:45,360
what somebody sees it's not just like

3177
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:46,800
they're sitting in a different chair

3178
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:48,560
at the theater and they're watching the

3179
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:51,040
same play or they're in separate movies

3180
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:52,560
uh you know rooms watching the same

3181
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:55,119
movie and so cultural cues might lead

3182
01:50:55,119 --> 01:50:55,679
somebody

3183
01:50:55,679 --> 01:50:57,840
to look into a correlated position as

3184
01:50:57,840 --> 01:50:59,280
another person

3185
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:01,920
but um when there's the customization

3186
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:03,760
it's like each person is in their own

3187
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:04,560
theater

3188
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:07,280
which takes it to another level because

3189
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:08,159
it goes even

3190
01:51:08,159 --> 01:51:10,400
it's actually different inputs and the

3191
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:11,920
inputs can be targeted in

3192
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:15,040
interesting or new ways so

3193
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:17,119
it's kind of stretching the limits of

3194
01:51:17,119 --> 01:51:18,719
our social cognition

3195
01:51:18,719 --> 01:51:20,480
because it's not just a bunch of people

3196
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:22,320
asking what they just saw with a shared

3197
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:23,119
event

3198
01:51:23,119 --> 01:51:24,560
it's like trying to come to a shared

3199
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:26,560
understanding when people are seeing

3200
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:28,080
different events

3201
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:32,239
so yeah there's some new

3202
01:51:32,239 --> 01:51:33,440
fun things we're learning on the

3203
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:36,080
internet i guess

3204
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:39,920
well in the last couple of minutes

3205
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:41,840
if anyone has some thoughts i'd be

3206
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:43,040
curious

3207
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:45,840
to the authors or non-authors where do

3208
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:46,159
we

3209
01:51:46,159 --> 01:51:49,599
go from 20.2 where's our

3210
01:51:49,599 --> 01:51:54,800
momentum or direction or curiosity

3211
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:58,320
one thing i'll bring up while someone's

3212
01:51:58,320 --> 01:51:59,599
raising their hand is

3213
01:51:59,599 --> 01:52:02,800
uh without uh buzzing

3214
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:04,400
in the middle of a conversation how can

3215
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:06,239
we be really clear

3216
01:52:06,239 --> 01:52:07,920
when we're intentionally or

3217
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:10,560
unintentionally slipping the difference

3218
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:13,440
between a markov for pearl frist and

3219
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:14,000
blanket

3220
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,239
and generative model generative process

3221
01:52:16,239 --> 01:52:18,159
with a model within a model

3222
01:52:18,159 --> 01:52:21,679
we don't want to police subtleties

3223
01:52:21,679 --> 01:52:23,679
of language but at the same time

3224
01:52:23,679 --> 01:52:24,880
somebody can really

3225
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:27,840
build a bridge that leads someone to

3226
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:28,880
nowhere

3227
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:32,000
if they're unintentionally uh not sure

3228
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,119
the difference between these concepts so

3229
01:52:33,119 --> 01:52:34,320
i'm just curious

3230
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:36,960
how do we promote uh rigorous and

3231
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:38,880
accessible norms around talking about

3232
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:39,840
these ideas

3233
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:42,239
recognizing that we're all like totally

3234
01:52:42,239 --> 01:52:43,360
learning this and

3235
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:46,159
and formalizing the project around us

3236
01:52:46,159 --> 01:52:49,360
yela and then anyone else

3237
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:52,800
uh yeah just a small uh uh note and

3238
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:54,639
i'm not i don't remember exactly who who

3239
01:52:54,639 --> 01:52:55,840
mentioned this but

3240
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:58,000
uh at some point we talked about kind of

3241
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,040
two phases

3242
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:00,560
of research right and one is kind of

3243
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:02,560
taking a lot an id

3244
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:04,800
and running along pushing it along as as

3245
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:05,840
far as you can

3246
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:07,520
and then there's a new kind of phase

3247
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:09,679
where like okay now we ended up in a

3248
01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:10,400
completely new

3249
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:13,760
new uh how how how are we gonna kind of

3250
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:15,280
substantiate this how can i make kind of

3251
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:16,880
formalizes a little bit

3252
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:19,119
and i think this is the the kind of the

3253
01:53:19,119 --> 01:53:20,800
i guess over the last few years

3254
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:22,320
active inference knows the philosophy of

3255
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:23,599
active influence has kind of been just

3256
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:24,400
and also i mean

3257
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:26,080
also in my own earlier papers kind of

3258
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:27,679
been running as far as possible see how

3259
01:53:27,679 --> 01:53:29,199
far we could get this and see what would

3260
01:53:29,199 --> 01:53:29,760
happen

3261
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:32,960
as a kind of creative kind of kind of

3262
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:36,560
startup stage of of research

3263
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:39,040
and i think both in this paper and then

3264
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:40,320
a number of other papers that are

3265
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:40,960
currently

3266
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:44,320
kind of come coming out um

3267
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:46,400
uh i think this kind of more kind of

3268
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:48,560
consolidatory fake consolidatory phase

3269
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:50,239
is is happening where we're like okay

3270
01:53:50,239 --> 01:53:52,400
but okay this is where we ended up does

3271
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:54,000
it really make sense

3272
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,639
need do we need to make some more

3273
01:53:56,639 --> 01:53:58,480
fine-grained demarcations to

3274
01:53:58,480 --> 01:54:00,320
to do we need to tweak the conceptual

3275
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:01,840
apparatus to to

3276
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:05,280
to have it all make sense uh and that

3277
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:07,199
it's a different kind of work but but i

3278
01:54:07,199 --> 01:54:08,639
think that that's that's that's really

3279
01:54:08,639 --> 01:54:09,679
important in the kind of

3280
01:54:09,679 --> 01:54:11,520
for the next kind of phase for for for

3281
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:14,000
active inference uh research so i hope

3282
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,760
these kind of discussions can contribute

3283
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:18,960
to uh uh to doing that kind of work

3284
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:21,280
we're consolidating bitcoin to the key

3285
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:22,320
20 000

3286
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:24,719
level you know let it rest before the

3287
01:54:24,719 --> 01:54:27,040
next uh

3288
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:30,400
maybe whatever metaphor works for people

3289
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:31,760
but um any other

3290
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:36,639
thoughts because that's very nice yellow

3291
01:54:36,639 --> 01:54:38,880
thanks everyone for sharing this was an

3292
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:40,239
awesome sequence

3293
01:54:40,239 --> 01:54:43,760
and it really helped take our our lab

3294
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:44,239
and our

3295
01:54:44,239 --> 01:54:46,880
discussion to another level we would

3296

always welcome any of you to come back

3297
01:54:49,119 --> 01:54:51,599
