00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,800
hi i'm blue knight i'm an independent

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,840
research consultant out of new mexico

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,160
thanks for being on blue and looking

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,479
forward to this conversation

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,239
welcome to the active inference lab

12
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,200
everyone we are a participatory online

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,680
lab

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,680
that is communicating learning and

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,600
practicing applied active inference

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,360
you can find us at the links here on

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,640
this page

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,640
this is a recorded and an archived live

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,079
stream so please provide us with

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:48,719
feedback

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,280
so that we can improve on our work all

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,000
backgrounds

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,320
and perspectives are welcome here and

24
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,360
we'll be following

25
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,399
good video etiquette for live streams

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,760
20.0 is a contextualizing stream

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,600
for the upcoming discussions that we'll

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,438
have on april 20th

29
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,640
and 27th about this paper

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,880
the emperor's new markov blankets and

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,040
we'll have some of the authors join us

32
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,799
as well so this will be an awesome

33
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,920
discussion here we are in

34
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,119
number 20.0 and the goal of this

35
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,960
discussion as stated is to set the

36
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,720
context for the upcoming

37
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,960
discussions that we'll have on number 20

38
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,439
and number 20.1

39
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,280
and that is about the paper the

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,119
emperor's new markov blanket

41
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,320
by yella brunberg at all and the link is

42
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,200
provided here

43
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,680
the video is just an introduction and us

44
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,799
kind of working through

45
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,799
the paper so that we're ready to

46
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,159
interact with authors and

47
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,640
really grasp what they're discussing and

48
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,159
we'll be going through the usual

49
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,600
sections of the paper um

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,320
any uh just overall thoughts before we

51
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,920
sort of lead into it blue just what did

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,240
you

53
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,840
like about it or what drew you to the

54
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,360
paper

55
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,200
i liked this paper i thought it really

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,200
provided an overarching view

57
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,240
of the markov blanket and its

58
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,440
use throughout like historical use and

59
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,720
also throughout the the first in context

60
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,480
so i thought it was really thorough and

61
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,080
gave a good treatment to

62
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,840
all of those topics nice agreed

63
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,000
so the paper is emperor's new markov

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,040
blankets

65
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,680
and the links provided here the aims of

66
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,040
the claims of the paper that's where

67
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,720
we're going to start with the aims and

68
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,480
the abstract and the roadmap

69
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,720
to just see how the authors laid out

70
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,920
what they're going to be

71
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,560
trying to do so we're going to evaluate

72
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,280
their

73
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,360
aims and then see whether the claims

74
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,560
they make are valid

75
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,519
and whether they support their aims that

76
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,720
they laid out

77
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,040
and they write i'll read the first one

78
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,160
blue

79
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,640
the aim of the paper is twofold first we

80
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,599
want to explain

81
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,400
how it has been possible for such an

82
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,519
innocuous

83
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,000
technical concept as a markov blanket to

84
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,840
come to be used in order to settle

85
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,040
central debates

86
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,959
in the philosophy of biology and

87
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,080
cognition

88
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,120
so that's the main key aim here is how

89
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,400
did we get here

90
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,599
how did we get to debating a statistical

91
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,680
technical concept like the markov

92
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,840
blanket and having people talk about

93
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,680
consciousness and emotion

94
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,680
and multi-skill systems so how did we

95
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,840
get here with the markov blanket

96
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,280
and then blue you can go for the second

97
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,680
name and what you thought it meant

98
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,680
they say we will trace the development

99
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,879
of markov blankets

100
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,560
starting from their standard application

101
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,000
in bayesian networks

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,280
through the role that they play in

103
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,920
variational inference to use

104
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,760
to their use in the literature on active

105
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,440
inference which is what i had said about

106
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,519
the paper that i liked

107
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,040
they say we will argue that in the

108
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,640
course of this transition

109
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,400
a new and largely independent

110
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,400
theoretical construct has emerged

111
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,239
one that is more closely aligned with

112
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,879
the notions of sensory motor loops

113
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,120
and agent environment boundaries do you

114
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,599
have any thoughts on that daniel

115
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,599
it's gonna be the core distinction that

116
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,760
we're going to hit probably 50 times

117
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,879
is that there's two ways to talk about

118
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,519
boundaries maybe the ones that really

119
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,799
are there and then the ones that we

120
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:09,680
infer

121
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,040
and that's what this paper's about

122
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,399
so here we go to the abstract

123
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,478
markov blankets have been used to settle

124
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,079
disputes central to

125
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,560
philosophy of mind and cognition their

126
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,639
development from a technical concept

127
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,479
in bayesian inference to a central

128
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,320
concept within the free energy principle

129
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,440
is analyzed

130
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,759
so that's the historical component of

131
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,120
the paper

132
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,919
then there's the sort of distinguishing

133
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,199
part of the paper

134
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,199
we propose to distinguish between

135
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,600
instrumental pearl blankets and realist

136
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,840
fristen blankets pearl blankets are

137
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,440
substantiated by the empirical

138
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,479
literature but

139
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,040
can do limited philosophical work first

140
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,800
in blankets can do philosophical work

141
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,400
but require strong theoretical

142
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,600
assumptions

143
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,120
both are conflated in the current

144
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,440
literature on the free energy principle

145
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,280
and then their conclusion is

146
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,880
consequently we propose that

147
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,680
distinguishing

148
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,440
between an instrumental and a realist

149
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,360
research program will help clarify

150
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,919
the literature

151
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,000
good good on to the road map which now

152
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,680
has a

153
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,000
55 miles per hour speedway on the left

154
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,360
side

155
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,800
for the rapid run through they

156
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,280
start with introducing bayesian

157
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,400
inference

158
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,039
and really walk through it in a nice way

159
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,039
that we're going to walk through

160
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,880
as well and go from kind of the simplest

161
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,120
form of bayesian inference to

162
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,160
surprisingly

163
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,160
nuanced forms that introduce

164
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,720
networks like bayesian networks and

165
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,720
that's where we get to this concept of a

166
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,320
pearl blanket

167
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,280
and then it's by tracing the history and

168
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,440
the citations and the formalisms around

169
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,560
the pearl blanket and the markov blanket

170
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,960
that we find out where it intersects

171
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,479
with active inference

172
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,319
which is where the authors propose that

173
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,919
this fristen blanket

174
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,560
concept sort of surreptitiously or

175
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,000
without being noticed

176
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,440
starts getting deployed in a way that's

177
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,840
um sort of sometimes one way sometimes

178
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,720
the other way

179
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,560
but it's actually the looseness around

180
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,880
the definition that in their opinion

181
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,919
gives rise to

182
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,440
uncertainty which is not what we're

183
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,360
about here

184
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,479
and in section

185
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,280
five they really just provide more

186
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,240
examples with

187
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,880
walkthroughs and graphs and figures that

188
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,639
we're going to walk through today

189
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,880
with how is the pearl blanket different

190
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,080
than the first and blanket

191
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,880
sense of the markov blanket and then how

192
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,160
does that relate to this

193
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,560
key distinction at the end between

194
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,000
inference with a model

195
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,160
versus inference within a model so kind

196
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,600
of like generative models versus

197
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,280
generative processes

198
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,800
that's going to come back and um

199
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,280
it's a great paper so we hope that you

200
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,240
listen to these

201
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,880
discussions and also read it any

202
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,720
thoughts on the road map nope it's going

203
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,840
to go fast

204
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,199
yes it's a long period yeah so

205
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,479
the title of the paper uh is an allusion

206
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,039
to the story called the emperor's new

207
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,319
clothes

208
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,720
so people can read through the way that

209
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,360
it's written

210
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,280
here but um the emperor's new clothes

211
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,319
is a interesting story it's a polycymous

212
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,720
story there are many meanings of it so

213
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,880
what is the emperor's new clothes about

214
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,120
blue in general or what

215
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,479
what is it doing here in the title and

216
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,919
we can definitely ask the authors but

217
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,759
what do you think it's doing here

218
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,639
so in my understanding of the emperor's

219
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,560
new clothes it's definitely like

220
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,960
without reading the screen it's a story

221
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,720
about an emperor who wants who goes to

222
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,520
like the best

223
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,520
you know clothes maker in town gives

224
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,639
them all kinds of money

225
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,720
and the clothes maker proceeds to make

226
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,479
them clothes that are invisible and then

227
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,599
when the emperor he

228
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,520
sees essentially maybe what he wants to

229
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,599
see in the clothes like sees this you

230
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:00,800
know and dresses himself in them and

231
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,240
then goes parading throughout the town

232
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,960
naked

233
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,240
because the clothes are invisible

234
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,280
and then the child says hey that guy's

235
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,319
naked

236
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,560
yeah and then here's what part i had

237
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,479
forgotten was although startled

238
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,160
the emperor continues the procession

239
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,080
walking more proudly than ever

240
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,280
so it's like it's not like oh and then

241
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,280
he was so embarrassed that he stopped

242
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,639
doing it so

243
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,639
maybe it's a story we'll keep in mind

244
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,560
and we'll ask who are these

245
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,400
characters or what do the authors mean

246
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,000
by that

247
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,719
but also at this sort of general level

248
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:35,120
why

249
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,479
why does this paper matter why are we

250
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,159
talking about it and studying it and

251
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,919
discussing the implications

252
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,720
because it's good to be clear when we're

253
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,680
talking about

254
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,040
science or philosophy and

255
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,760
uh an unfortunate reality of science is

256
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,160
that

257
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,120
it's easy to slip in metaphysical claims

258
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,560
into

259
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,720
uh so-called facts of the world or even

260
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,560
just measurements of the world

261
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,279
and it's not good to slip in ungrounded

262
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,880
metaphysical claims

263
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,399
and then also this realism

264
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,040
instrumentalism distinction

265
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,519
is something that has been dealt with

266
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,480
basically

267
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,800
in every field oh is it the model of

268
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,399
language you're talking about or are you

269
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,120
really talking about language or

270
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,560
those kinds of differences between

271
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,480
systems as they are and systems as we

272
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,519
model them

273
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,480
is something that is a nomadic concept

274
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,200
so to see

275
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,240
it appear in active inference is cool

276
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,800
but also it's exciting to be involved

277
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,480
with the authors and see

278
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,880
how the scientists and the philosophers

279
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,000
are actually

280
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,920
dealing with this question in a new way

281
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,839
at a new time scale

282
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,120
because of maybe the way that they're

283
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,519
communicating with each other

284
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,519
the big questions in the paper like sort

285
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,640
of beyond

286
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,399
just what they set out to address would

287
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,480
be like how is physics related to

288
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,600
metaphysics

289
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,080
what what can we study about electrons

290
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,760
and temperature and

291
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,160
mass that would tell us anything about

292
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,560
whether a spirit exists or

293
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,720
what's really out there beyond plato's

294
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,200
cave how is scientific modeling related

295
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,480
to reality

296
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,160
and then a big question for a lot of us

297
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,920
and a lot of people outside of our

298
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,200
active inference community

299
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,760
is like what does the free energy

300
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,600
principle and active inference

301
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,440
really say about pragmatic concerns

302
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,440
and then totally independently what do

303
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,680
they say about philosophical concerns

304
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,440
and it'd be awesome if they were 10 out

305
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,880
of 10 on both but

306
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,440
what is the actual reality of what these

307
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,800
frameworks tell us about

308
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,720
pragmatic concerns and philosophical

309
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,839
questions

310
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,680
what big questions resonated with you

311
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,000
blue

312
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,839
uh the biggest question really that

313
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,240
resonated with me i think is is are we

314
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,800
you know using the right tools to study

315
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,440
the right

316
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,440
things so i think that you know when we

317
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,800
think about um

318
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,279
active inference and cognition and

319
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,279
statistics like are these all

320
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,360
you know should these all be represented

321
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,120
by a markov blanket like is this the

322
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,519
right

323
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,519
the right thing to study this with i

324
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,880
don't know

325
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,160
how how unified do we want models and

326
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,880
systems to be

327
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,440
on that this is sort of the last little

328
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,160
general

329
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,800
signpost before we plunge into the free

330
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,920
energy principle and

331
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,839
active inference and everything it's

332
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,040
just a little distinction

333
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,920
on maps and territories because realism

334
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,120
and instrumentalism

335
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,959
it sounds really philosophical and

336
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,720
there's isms and it sounds like a belief

337
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,279
system

338
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,360
but it really boils down to this map

339
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,200
territory distinction

340
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,839
and so the authors wrote in our view the

341
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,040
free energy principle

342
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,360
literature so whatever it is even if

343
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,360
you've never heard of this idea

344
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,000
it consistently fails to distinguish

345
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,440
between the map

346
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,120
a representation of reality and the

347
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,279
territory reality itself

348
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,959
this slippage becomes most apparent in

349
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,399
their treatment of the concept of a

350
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,760
markov blanket

351
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,760
so if we're ever getting lost in the

352
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,440
weeds with fristen and pearl and

353
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,880
instrumentalism realism

354
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,600
we think like map in territory and then

355
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,360
what's really cool about

356
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,440
this topic especially in the active

357
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,639
inference

358
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,959
setting is that two of the papers that

359
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,639
are cited in this paper

360
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,920
as relevant prior work are mel

361
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,200
andrews's paper and also thomas van s

362
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,279
and ns hibilito's paper

363
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,320
and these were on active inference 14

364
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,279
and 15 and now we're here in number 20

365
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,320
so it's kind of like

366
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,560
we're going quickly and we're speaking

367
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,079
with a lot of the authors

368
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,880
and then also on the left is um a paper

369
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,399
that i co-authored with

370
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,920
rj and another colleague mikhail and we

371
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,959
kind of stepped back

372
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,120
even further than active inference and

373
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,160
just asked

374
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,760
what does it mean to map across systems

375
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,720
and we highlighted that sometimes when

376
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,560
mapping across systems and using

377
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,959
the complexity science approach people

378
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,880
use bayesian statistics

379
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,880
networks and predictive and counter

380
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,240
factual approaches

381
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,560
those are kind of like three key ideas

382
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,519
in making some

383
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,279
systems similar to each other or

384
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,959
comparing different systems

385
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,440
and those are um citations to the active

386
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,240
inference

387
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,320
literature because active inference is

388
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,519
drawing together

389
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,880
a lot of these different domains that

390
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,399
might be seen as different like bayesian

391
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,279
statistics

392
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,160
network science cybernetics ecological

393
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,880
psychology

394
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,079
i mean there's different words because

395
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,839
they're different areas but we're

396
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,839
actually coming at it in a new way

397
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,360
and that is why we're thinking about

398
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,519
maps and territories in a new way

399
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,440
because it's not just like cognitive

400
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,800
maps yes or no

401
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,680
or maps in the city yes or no it's a lot

402
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,000
of new

403
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,920
things coming together which is why it's

404
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,240
good to clarify

405
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,399
adding on to that uh is the fields and

406
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,240
glaze book paper that we did

407
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,480
that um you know mapped the the two

408
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,399
spaces right from one to the other

409
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,440
like the cat the category theory yes

410
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,639
nice the mapping

411
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,519
and so and then what if the map is the

412
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,399
territory

413
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,079
so let's get to fep

414
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,839
so for this breakdown every time in

415
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,120
reading a paper we get to

416
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,600
reintroduce the free energy principle

417
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,519
because it's always good to start

418
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,639
with sort of a first pass

419
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,199
on what it is because this video might

420
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,320
be someone's

421
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,760
first time hearing about free energy

422
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,360
principle and also it's a good

423
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,440
opportunity to see how the authors

424
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,079
frame free energy principle and then use

425
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,000
that as a scaffolding for our

426
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,480
understanding and our curiosity instead

427
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,320
of us trying to get to the best

428
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,639
explanation week after week after week

429
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,839
we can

430
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,760
develop our understanding week by week

431
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,600
but then always be inspired by the way

432
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,279
that authors have phrased it in their

433
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,399
writing

434
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,600
so on the right side with the colors

435
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,079
i kind of broke down into like almost

436
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:44,720
haiku

437
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,000
or just short sentence a little bit what

438
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,639
they were

439
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,440
saying and what it comes down to is that

440
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,240
the fep

441
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,639
is a normative mathematical framework so

442
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,320
normative like it says what should

443
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,279
happen like evolution by fitness

444
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,240
maximization

445
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,160
says that it should be maximizing its

446
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,000
fitness that's kind of similar

447
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,440
it's not saying what you should do but

448
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,680
it's saying how systems should be

449
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,360
and it's about systems that are

450
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,720
self-organizing

451
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,240
and how they fit into their niche

452
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,199
fep is drawing on physics inspired

453
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,160
machine learning

454
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,199
approaches and so part of the appeal

455
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,199
and the excitement of the free energy

456
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,000
principle is that it brings together

457
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,560
machine learning and physics and math

458
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,759
with also

459
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,639
potentially some qualitative dimensions

460
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:32,959
but

461
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,560
even without dipping into the

462
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,480
qualitative or the aesthetic or the

463
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,360
embodied

464
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,240
or the inactive at the very least from a

465
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,720
control

466
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,279
theoretic perspective the free energy

467
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:43,839
principle

468
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,600
adds in a lot of features that are

469
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,680
absent from other frameworks like

470
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,720
network theory alone bayesian alone or

471
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,120
predictive systems alone

472
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,160
combining those types of approaches

473
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,560
in a really interchangeable way with

474
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,160
system properties like learning

475
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,800
attention and action planning is very

476
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,320
powerful

477
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,480
active inference is a theory that is a

478
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,680
corollary to

479
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,199
or it's a compatible implementation of

480
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,399
systems that are broadly construed

481
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,040
under the free energy principle and then

482
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,759
they kind of

483
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,120
close the authors do with the

484
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,600
recognition of a of a claim that you'll

485
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,880
see

486
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,240
in a lot of places that if we could have

487
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,160
a theory of everything or a multi-scale

488
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,600
system then it would be

489
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,959
great so that's what motivates people to

490
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,040
work on the fep and why a lot of people

491
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,920
are excited about it

492
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,160
anything to add on that blue okay

493
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,680
it would be great i'm excited about it a

494
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,279
unifying theory of everything let's get

495
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,000
to it

496
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,079
let's get to it now we wanna just like

497
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,680
you said with are we studying the right

498
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,199
systems with the right tools

499
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,720
so this is what the fep is and um very

500
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,680
um intentionally it appeals to things

501
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,959
like control theory and

502
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,800
measurement let's take it into the deep

503
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,199
end with metaphysics

504
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,319
so the author's right the fep has been

505
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,119
applied to

506
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,679
metaphysical questions so these are very

507
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,240
different than

508
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,880
action planning learning attention these

509
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,599
are going to be

510
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,039
related to questions that are

511
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,720
metaphysical like what are the

512
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,559
boundaries of the mind and the citations

513
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,839
are in the paper

514
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,119
what are the boundaries of living

515
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,280
systems so what's really there

516
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,599
ontologically what's the relationship

517
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,960
between mind and matter

518
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,880
like what is experience all these kinds

519
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,080
of philosophical

520
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,280
questions about qualia um and even

521
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,240
things like is

522
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,360
gaia real or is there a scientific uh

523
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,919
basis for talking about gaia or sort of

524
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:42,720
earth level

525
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,640
awareness or at what level could

526
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,160
awareness exist

527
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,280
and more we're probably all curious

528
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,400
about a lot of questions and

529
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,080
it's not like we need to a priori

530
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,919
classify them into physics or

531
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,679
metaphysics

532
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,960
um but that shouldn't make us think

533
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,000
there's no distinction

534
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,200
the questions that come to our mind

535
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,400
we're curious probably about a lot of

536
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,120
stuff

537
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,679
so we want to be open to questions as

538
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:08,240
they come in

539
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,919
especially ones that are framed in new

540
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,600
ways and then

541
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,440
also be trying to approach them

542
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,720
rigorously

543
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,559
because as they raise here

544
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,160
it's a web of formalisms it's true

545
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,760
that it is a web because we're gonna

546
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,120
walk through it in the order that the

547
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,400
authors laid it out

548
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,240
but it is a web of concepts and so

549
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,039
even for those who are experienced in

550
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,760
the field but especially those who are

551
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,080
new to the area or as they call it a

552
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,520
layperson

553
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,960
not only are there distinctions

554
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,840
that are unconventional but their

555
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,919
implications are not always obvious

556
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,760
like assumptions or axioms or

557
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,960
relationships that have

558
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,760
maybe very non-obvious conclusions or

559
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,400
implications

560
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,240
especially when combined and then

561
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,280
the two risks here are it might

562
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,320
appear to be and actually mathematically

563
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,280
unjustified

564
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,600
but at the very least appear to be and

565
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,320
that might

566
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,520
warrant the unintended smuggling in of

567
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,960
metaphysical assumptions

568
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,200
like i have information theory i can

569
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,120
calculate it and here's who's conscious

570
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,080
and who's not conscious

571
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,120
i would say that's completely

572
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,678
unwarranted

573
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,240
what do you think good example yeah i

574
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,760
think that's i mean that's like the main

575
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,600
critique right of of iit

576
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,000
so i don't know i think that it's a good

577
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,200
example and

578
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,640
how can we say who's conscious and who's

579
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,760
not when you can't even give

580
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,480
consciousness an

581
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,640
adequate definition i think i don't know

582
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,799
but we're solving unanswerable questions

583
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,200
but that's the joy of it

584
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,799
cool yep we talked about the

585
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,240
consciousness side in

586
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,559
some of our other discussions but

587
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,160
suffice to say that there's kind of a

588
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,520
distinction between the questions on

589
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,520
this slide which are related to

590
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,919
stochastic systems and action in the

591
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:54,880
niche

592
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,480
and then the metaphysics which are

593
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,000
things that you could imagine

594
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,039
even robots would debate over like

595
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,520
who is really a robot like us or

596
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,200
whatever they ask

597
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,080
so how does the fep relate to active

598
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,679
inference

599
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,480
they write active inference is a process

600
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,120
theory

601
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,640
derived from the application of

602
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,400
variational inference to the study of

603
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,960
biological and cognitive systems

604
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,880
and we're not going to read this whole

605
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,240
piece but

606
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,720
active inference is a process theory so

607
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,039
it specifies how processes play out

608
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,400
which we're going to go into a lot of

609
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,280
detail

610
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,720
and it sort of takes something that's

611
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,039
initially static

612
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,960
and it figures out how to take a bunch

613
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,360
of equations just there on the page

614
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,400
and actually link them in a way where it

615
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,080
helps us think about how systems

616
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,559
work in their flow so we take a bunch of

617
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,480
equations that relate variables

618
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,760
like estimates and action states and

619
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,880
sensory states

620
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,120
that are all happening at once as

621
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,720
analytical equations

622
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,640
in the fvp and then active inference is

623
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,280
a

624
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,200
compatible architecture like a skeleton

625
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,200
or a style of model that implements

626
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,400
processes compatible with fep

627
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,280
what would you say about that

628
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,320
i think that you summed it up well uh i

629
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,520
mean the authors you have a couple

630
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,039
points here that are highlighted so

631
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,039
the fundamental imperative of active

632
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,360
inference is to minimize free energy

633
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,280
so this is the fep the free energy

634
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,400
principle

635
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,559
um and and then the other point is that

636
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:29,440
uh you know

637
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,440
this is also the the question that i had

638
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,120
at the beginning are we using the right

639
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,480
tools to study these

640
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,720
these phenomena right more specifically

641
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,400
we can ask what role

642
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,880
the pearl blankets might play in active

643
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,840
inference

644
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,559
so yep we're going to be seeing how this

645
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,159
technical concept entered the discussion

646
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,760
of metaphysical questions and it's

647
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,520
almost like active inference as applied

648
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,679
to biological creatures

649
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,000
is where we see a lot of it coming into

650
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,360
play

651
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,760
and yep we talk about active inference

652
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,000
throughout so we'll kind of return to it

653
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,640
so now let's that's like the modern

654
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,360
stuff right

655
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,480
fep and active inference let's

656
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,919
pull back to base

657
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,760
and to bayesian statistics and build up

658
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,640
in a new way how we're going to go from

659
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,080
simple base

660
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,200
to modern base so

661
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,360
blue what would you how would you start

662
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,280
us off or what do we need to know as we

663
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,120
go on this like little base

664
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,880
uh several slide journey so like the one

665
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,720
sentence or maybe like this the short

666
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,240
summary that i give about

667
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,039
baze like bayesian statistics versus

668
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:41,600
frequent

669
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,760
statistics and frequent to statistics

670
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,640
which is like what

671
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,640
most people are taught um in school like

672
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,559
when you flip a coin the probability of

673
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,600
it coming up heads

674
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,360
half right 50 percent of the time it

675
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,799
comes up half

676
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,600
bayesian statistics accounts for the

677
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,679
fact that like the previous

678
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,360
12 flips have all been heads right

679
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,280
like so what would you if you have

680
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,799
flipped a coin and you know it's a fair

681
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,559
coin if it's come up heads 12 times in a

682
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,200
row like

683
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,559
the next time you flip it don't you

684
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,559
think it's more likely to come up tails

685
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,559
right like so the bayesian accounts for

686
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,919
what has happened

687
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,640
in the past uh when it's it's not

688
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,760
accounted for in frequent

689
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,120
statistics at all nice and

690
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,400
um just to go through the notation

691
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,840
because we are going to be kind of going

692
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,080
through the notation as they write it's

693
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,200
a recipe

694
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,360
for calculating the posterior

695
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,240
probability

696
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,039
so that's the probability of x given y

697
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:35,600
and

698
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,520
x is the hidden state of the world

699
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,960
like let's just say that the hidden

700
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,919
state of the world is the true

701
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,200
temperature

702
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,200
um it uh it's actually a hypothesis

703
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,080
about the world

704
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,080
that's why bay's in bayesian statistics

705
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,679
it's like a hypothesis that you're

706
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:52,799
testing

707
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,039
and uh the observational data the

708
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,080
measurement is

709
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,679
y and this is uh

710
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,080
posterior two data so like prior and

711
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,240
posterior are referring to when

712
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,720
new information comes in prior to the

713
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,919
new data coming in

714
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,919
and then it's updated and then you have

715
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,840
a posterior which has been updated

716
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,960
by the new data and

717
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,159
in very rapid here

718
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,240
in this paragraph they make the move

719
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,600
from doing

720
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,440
inference basing inference on a hidden

721
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,360
variable like the temperature of the

722
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,039
world

723
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,480
into this idea of the model evidence

724
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,400
with a normalization that keeps things

725
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,520
adding up to one

726
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,080
so instead of having like an uncertainty

727
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,279
distribution of how

728
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,279
the temperature might be in the world

729
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,039
and then taking in new data and updating

730
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:41,600
that

731
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,240
another way might be um i have two

732
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,000
hypotheses it's colder

733
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,120
than 20 or it's warmer than 20.

734
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,520
and then i can always be judging

735
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,039
relatively which one of those

736
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,360
is more accurate so even if the

737
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,120
temperature distribution is like very

738
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,080
gnarly

739
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,840
it's possible sometimes to have a

740
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,080
simpler thing that you're trying to

741
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,240
hypothesize about the world like is it

742
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,320
over or under a certain number

743
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,480
that helps you guide action and then

744
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,000
also when you do this

745
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,120
model um comparison

746
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,880
you can keep the relative uh

747
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,919
basically the the relativation you can

748
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,520
keep models being compared relative to

749
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,480
one another

750
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,120
and that can sum to one so you can do

751
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,559
probability type

752
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,080
estimates on different model classes

753
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,600
even without knowing whether any

754
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,960
specific model is likely or unlikely

755
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,760
so like in phylogenetics which is an

756
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,360
area that blue and i have both

757
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,480
worked you can use bayesian statistics

758
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:42,880
to

759
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,080
relatively evaluate what the most likely

760
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,400
tree is for species but that tree's

761
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,760
likelihood might be like

762
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,480
super low but that's not what matters

763
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:52,799
it's

764
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,279
whether it's more likely than other

765
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,840
hypotheses

766
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,279
so that's kind of what they write a

767
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,120
little bit about here

768
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,279
is when you have types of models

769
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,480
that are computationally or analytically

770
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,880
intractable so there's no closed form

771
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,640
solution for the posterior

772
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,880
like there's no clean way how you're

773
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,760
going to update

774
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,919
your model of the phylogenetic tree

775
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,000
given the next new genome that's added

776
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,480
in

777
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,559
it's just not something smooth like

778
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,559
signal processing might be

779
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,559
so how are you going to deal with that

780
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,559
and that's the big challenge

781
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,480
so it's kind of this rapid bayesian

782
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,919
acceleration from like

783
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,120
you're trying to estimate something

784
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,279
about the world that's unknown okay well

785
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,000
what's unknown

786
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,400
is which model is better and then the

787
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,279
challenge is

788
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,400
we want to update our ongoing estimate

789
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,720
of what the best model of the world is

790
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,080
but there aren't really update rules

791
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,720
for how new data coming in should help

792
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,880
us update which model it is

793
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,279
like night and day it's clear more light

794
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,279
it's likely to be daytime

795
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,679
but again think about the phylogenetics

796
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,919
or something where as new data comes in

797
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,559
it's really hard to know how exactly to

798
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,279
update your models

799
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,039
so in that uh the phylogenetic analysis

800
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,559
if you have new data coming in

801
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,080
literally like you want to add a new

802
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,919
branch to your phylogenetic tree

803
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,320
the the computational way that that's

804
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,600
calculated is by

805
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,279
switching in and out in and out in and

806
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,799
out each branch to see

807
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,760
the likelihood of the least likely or

808
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,480
the

809
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,559
the best evidence for that tree that's

810
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,760
existence but it literally

811
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,120
makes every single tree and then

812
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,679
calculates that which is computationally

813
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,880
a really intense um and time-consuming

814
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,080
effort so that's why variational base is

815
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,240
so neat and swift in comparison

816
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,240
yep exactly it's these red and blue on

817
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,320
the bottom it's like a continuum of

818
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,360
approaches

819
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,279
uh before enter variational the

820
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,399
continuum being

821
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,159
we have some simple cases where we have

822
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,240
a closed form solution for exactly how

823
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,120
to update

824
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,440
the model's evidence as new data comes

825
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,360
in and then there's sort of this wild

826
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,080
west

827
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,880
where you need to use customized schemes

828
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,720
and sometimes you have to resort to just

829
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,360
extremely costly like almost brute force

830
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,600
like swapping or doing the markov chain

831
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,960
monte carlo

832
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,480
however maybe there's another way

833
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,279
which is what brings us to variational

834
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,640
base

835
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,360
and variational base as the authors

836
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,640
write on the bottom

837
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,480
the trick of variational base and we're

838
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,559
going to come back to the kl divergence

839
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:30,960
but

840
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,840
here's the trick up front is consists in

841
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,960
letting go

842
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,520
of trying to minimize the kl divergence

843
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,360
in equation 3 directly

844
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,279
shifting the objective to optimizing a

845
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,960
different functional which bounds the

846
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,559
model evidence

847
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,720
so what would you say the variational

848
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,200
trick is

849
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,360
i mean that's it so if you bound the

850
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,480
model evidence

851
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,880
then you like so you know that the

852
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,480
answer can't be outside of these

853
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,240
parameters if you that's like bounding

854
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,360
the model evidence

855
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,200
then you're not calculating or trying to

856
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,399
you know calculate things that are

857
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:03,360
outside of those

858
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,559
parameters i would say yep and maybe

859
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:07,919
there's another way to read this

860
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,440
equation on three but

861
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,640
the underlined red part d sub kl

862
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,200
is the kl divergence so it's about the

863
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,159
divergence between

864
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,799
two different distributions and the

865
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:21,760
double line

866
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,480
is like what the two distributions are

867
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,200
so that

868
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,720
p x given y we saw that back here

869
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,440
that's what we want to calculate so even

870
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,760
though we're kind of accelerated on base

871
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,240
we're still back on equation one doing

872
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,919
inference on the world but it's going to

873
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:38,799
look

874
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,039
more complex now so we're looking for

875
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,240
the difference between

876
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,559
that thing that we really want to find

877
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,559
out p x given y

878
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,600
and then the magical q distribution

879
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,640
that we're in control of and then we

880
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,080
want the divergence between

881
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,360
those two distributions to be zero

882
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,240
and distance is always positive there's

883
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:00,640
no

884
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,679
negative distance and so we just have to

885
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,200
minimize

886
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,720
this divergence so that we can get at

887
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,159
what we really want

888
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,640
and again one part we don't know and

889
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,919
it's hard and the other part we're

890
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,360
totally in control of

891
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,520
so the whole question and trick is going

892
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,120
to be can we design

893
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,240
a queue so that by reducing

894
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,679
the kl divergence on q versus p

895
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,960
we're getting out what we truly want so

896
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,600
that is kind of what threads the needle

897
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,080
between

898
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,039
these two approaches the the red being

899
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,480
like the elegant and simple and

900
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,760
effective and then the blue

901
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,120
being like the extremely messy and

902
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,559
simulation based variational base is

903
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,840
elegant and also it helps us potentially

904
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,240
deal

905
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,360
with complex underlying distributions

906
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,440
cool good okay

907
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,559
now here we return in five

908
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,600
there's d sub k l between q

909
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,640
of what we want to know and p of x given

910
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:06,960
y

911
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,320
so it's the same as it was on the

912
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,799
previous equation three

913
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,080
and that is going to be

914
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,519
given another equivalency and it's

915
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,880
restated as

916
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,480
uh the natural log of p of y

917
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,080
minus big l of x so

918
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,799
what what do you think about l of x blue

919
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:29,440
or what

920
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,720
did you see here

921
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,640
um or sorry no worries

922
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:42,000
okay i'm like i'm lost in the map

923
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,679
i was just like thinking oh you know

924
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,679
there's two lines that's an equal sign

925
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,360
here's one line is a minus and here's

926
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,559
three lines

927
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,480
yeah i was i was lost at the three lines

928
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,399
like what why is that an equal

929
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,720
sign like this yeah i'm confused at that

930
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,000
three triple line

931
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,120
thing um i think three lines can mean

932
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:01,600
that it

933
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,480
is defined as like it's strictly defined

934
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,200
as or but

935
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,559
let's find out i don't want to say

936
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,399
anything that's incorrect that's what i

937
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:09,360
was thinking of that

938
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,519
um i'm like no no i'm i'm opting out in

939
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:12,720
the past yeah

940
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,760
but um the uh

941
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,880
restatement here is this value that we

942
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,760
want to go

943
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,960
low low low with the divergence between

944
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,480
what we can control and what we can't

945
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,039
control we're going to restate it

946
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,159
in terms of two different pieces a sort

947
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:30,799
of

948
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,919
log uh this is just the likelihood model

949
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,600
of the observations

950
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,880
so this is just y it's p here p x given

951
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,600
y was like

952
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,120
the true x given the y observation

953
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,480
like the true temperature given the

954
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,480
thermometer and here we're just going to

955
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,039
have

956
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,159
the likelihood of the

957
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,720
measurement so this is a lot easier to

958
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,399
calculate than x given y

959
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,880
because it's not a conditional and then

960
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,840
we're going to

961
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,039
penalize that by big l of x

962
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:05,360
which is an expectation of

963
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,480
q what q thinks is going to be

964
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,320
a likely value for x

965
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,399
plus a joint distribution of x and y

966
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,080
of p not the conditional so

967
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,760
it's a little past me y reframing it in

968
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,919
each of these nuanced ways

969
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,320
helps you do it but i just think of it

970
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,159
like mathematical pinball

971
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,880
like you gotta like bring some wall down

972
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,799
so that you can go up another ramp

973
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,640
and do something different but let's

974
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,480
definitely ask the authors about it

975
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,799
and this the negative is like baffling

976
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,159
like i think like the point of

977
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,000
when you are getting into the logarithm

978
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,760
the logarithmic scale like

979
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,440
so that you like eliminate any

980
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,799
possibility of a negative and then like

981
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,159
they put the negative on the front of it

982
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:50,960
i'm like

983
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,960
that's a little strange to me yep and

984
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,240
then also it's like

985
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,799
the it's like the negative variational

986
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,080
free energy

987
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,120
and so

988
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,279
we push on though um

989
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:09,040
they are able to uh

990
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,679
say that basically free energy this is

991
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,440
by analogy to the variational free

992
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,399
energy

993
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,440
they're going to bring that's where they

994
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,359
bring in the f they say basically the

995
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,480
free energy

996
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,000
that you might want to minimize we'll

997
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,760
get there in a few equations

998
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,639
but the free energy function of x that

999
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,399
hidden state of the world like which

1000
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,679
model is best or what's the real

1001
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,879
temperature

1002
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,560
it is the negative of this l

1003
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,480
because here what l was defined this way

1004
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,679
and it's almost like we we don't we can

1005
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,399
separate out

1006
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,760
l from p at all so here

1007
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,000
we had like sort of a hybrid with q's

1008
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,359
and p's

1009
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,679
and here there's like a p here but now

1010
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,359
when we

1011
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,800
get l all alone now we've kind of

1012
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,079
encapsulated p in a

1013
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:01,119
way where it's like all q centric i'm

1014
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,040
not even sure if that's true so i don't

1015
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,920
go too down the rabbit hole but now it's

1016
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,839
framed in a way

1017
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,040
where we can do our work on

1018
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,800
cue but um

1019
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,160
but but but get to where we want to get

1020
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,839
on p

1021
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,440
and i think that is the rub that's

1022
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,440
what the question is about is okay it's

1023
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,040
a approach

1024
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,880
and i would love to ask somebody with

1025
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,880
more variational inference especially

1026
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,400
actually on this

1027
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,280
uh i think these are the ones where we

1028
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,280
were like blue and i were just like okay

1029
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,560
these are we're going to raise more

1030
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,280
questions than we uh answer

1031
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,359
but what does it look like to make the

1032
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:44,640
variational version

1033
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,000
of a model and what do you sit down and

1034
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,040
do

1035
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,280
so that you can calculate this or is it

1036
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,920
all carried out beneath the hood

1037
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,359
so uh

1038
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,680
minimizing free energy as defined in

1039
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,280
this way

1040
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,560
on the q which is the function that we

1041
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,760
control

1042
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,720
the goal is that that will also get us

1043
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,160
to the right value on p

1044
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,079
the function we don't control so i have

1045
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:13,760
my internal model

1046
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,440
of temperature and i want to be doing

1047
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,359
inference on that finding what's the

1048
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:18,480
most likely

1049
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,560
the most free energy minimized internal

1050
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,839
model of temperature

1051
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,240
and then if that is attuned properly

1052
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,040
that should be

1053
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,720
accurate in terms of the external as

1054
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,720
well

1055
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,320
so in my like limited understanding of

1056
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,280
making a variational model um i think

1057
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:35,839
that

1058
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,800
these models instead of like using

1059
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,520
values

1060
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,560
they use distributions right so so

1061
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,680
in that's the kind of the the key

1062
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,200
difference i think between

1063
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,680
um the variational like model

1064
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,760
construction versus the

1065
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,160
the like non-variational variety of a

1066
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,280
bayesian model

1067
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,480
in my limited understanding nice point

1068
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,200
that previously we were like looking at

1069
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,079
passing

1070
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,480
uh like a number through a function and

1071
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,119
then

1072
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,520
when we're going variational we're

1073
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,800
talking about like passing functions

1074
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,240
through each other

1075
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,359
um this one we're not going to go into

1076
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,119
the technical details

1077
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,320
but it's about mean field approximations

1078
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,599
and this is a super interesting topic

1079
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,800
because a lot of statistical models will

1080
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,680
assume

1081
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,760
that there's like a homogeneous field or

1082
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,079
that a gas is well mixed

1083
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,000
or that all types of a certain

1084
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,680
interaction are equally likely to happen

1085
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,520
amongst all

1086
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,640
molecules bouncing around but because

1087
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,079
we're interested in applying

1088
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,680
free energy principle not just to the

1089
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,320
burning candle or to a chemical reaction

1090
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,280
but to

1091
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,000
active inference agents to cybernetic

1092
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,320
and

1093
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,680
goal-oriented agents how does the mean

1094
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,040
field approximation

1095
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,240
work like if we want to explain culture

1096
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,000
is there a mean field approximation for

1097
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,760
culture or

1098
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,680
how are we going to apply this to the

1099
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,599
systems where we know we're kind of

1100
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:04,240
extending

1101
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,599
into analogy land

1102
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,400
but at the same time maybe reality is

1103
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,640
really multi-scale so it's not just

1104
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,200
uh an analogy to say like when chris

1105
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,960
field talked about quantum

1106
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,680
and communication at our scale not just

1107
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,000
as bubbling up from electrons

1108
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,680
and not just as a metaphor but actually

1109
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,760
as like a third way that it really

1110
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,240
was based upon those principles at our

1111
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,920
scale

1112
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,200
that's what this makes me think about

1113
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,119
like do we need

1114
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,880
are or will there be mean field

1115
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,960
approximations at a lower level

1116
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,119
and then we're just experiencing a sort

1117
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,040
of non-mean field

1118
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:47,839
at our level

1119
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,599
and okay 21 anything else say they're

1120
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,200
blue

1121
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,680
so i think like that the the mean field

1122
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,040
approximation

1123
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,480
um i i think it's like i don't know

1124
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,000
it's it limits

1125
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,440
the interactions between different

1126
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,119
variables so you're interacting with the

1127
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,880
density instead of

1128
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,800
each individual variable interacting

1129
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,440
with each variable so it's like um

1130
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,000
it's like a course it's a course grading

1131
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,720
like

1132
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,040
having this mean field approximation i

1133
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:23,920
think yep

1134
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,440
and we'll return to it when we look at

1135
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,520
the um figures related to fristen's

1136
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,160
paper

1137
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,320
but yes it's related to partitioning

1138
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,839
variables and yes

1139
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,400
now this part i thought was really

1140
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,520
interesting

1141
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,760
and kind of like basic statistics so

1142
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,960
maybe you'll be familiar

1143
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,839
to some but they're seeing it in a new

1144
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:42,240
way

1145
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,880
that the difference between the

1146
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,400
different relationships that variables

1147
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,200
can have

1148
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,800
and we're seeing it here written out

1149
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,160
with math but we're actually going to

1150
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,280
come back to it

1151
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,640
with figures and so it will potentially

1152
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,599
be

1153
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,079
a little bit clearer but there's a few

1154
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,920
different situations

1155
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,640
the nicest situation for a statistical

1156
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,319
inference is when you can cleanly

1157
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:04,880
separate

1158
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,200
inference on the two variables so here

1159
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:07,920
it's like p

1160
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,560
x1 and x2 the joint distribution of x1

1161
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,400
and x2

1162
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,359
it can be separated very cleanly because

1163
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:16,000
they're

1164
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,480
independent so it's like you flip a coin

1165
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,079
and you roll a die

1166
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,760
the way that you get the probability of

1167
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,359
a head and a 4

1168
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,119
is basically you just multiply that

1169
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,280
probability of head times probability of

1170
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,960
getting a four

1171
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,920
and so that's the clean case and sort of

1172
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,440
almost by analogy that's how i

1173
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,000
understand

1174
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,359
variational inference like it just clean

1175
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,119
the variables cleanly separate

1176
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,440
so that you can do restricted

1177
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,400
optimization

1178
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,560
on subsets of variables in a little bit

1179
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,680
more principled way

1180
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,960
but um back to the stats there's

1181
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,880
often a time where the joint

1182
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,359
distribution that you care about

1183
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,560
is conditionally dependent so

1184
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,920
conditional dependence conditional

1185
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,000
independence two sides the same coin

1186
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,119
it's conditionally independent on or

1187
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,960
conditionally dependent on a third

1188
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,880
variable x3

1189
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,319
and so here we're gonna separate x1 and

1190
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:11,920
x2 just like we did above

1191
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,240
but now we have like x1 conditioned on

1192
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,040
three and

1193
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,319
x2 conditioned on three and there's

1194
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:18,720
actually

1195
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,359
all kinds of situations where we're

1196
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,760
really interested in these interactor

1197
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,720
variables and so there's there's one

1198
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,760
reason it might be

1199
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,800
latent cause estimation like i want to

1200
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,160
know why is it that some people

1201
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,000
take this drug and have this side effect

1202
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,240
and other people don't

1203
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,000
sometimes you want to know all three

1204
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,520
factors like how

1205
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,680
three different nodes of a computer

1206
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,599
network or genetic network are related

1207
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,119
so you actually might be interested in

1208
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:49,839
how all three of these nodes are linked

1209
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,079
and then other times the mediator might

1210
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,920
be useful for like a statistical

1211
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,560
analysis or like an interaction effect

1212
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,880
in an anova like okay there's an effect

1213
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,960
of age and there's an effect of height

1214
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,800
but is there a height by age interaction

1215
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,920
so those kinds of questions they're not

1216
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,680
the that anova questions not in the

1217
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,200
bayesian framework that's from the

1218
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,480
frequencies framework but it's an

1219
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,359
example

1220
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,599
of when you want to know about

1221
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:16,480
interactor

1222
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,440
variables but it turns out that this is

1223
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,800
going to facilitate

1224
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,359
the variational inference because you

1225
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,400
can like use this hidden variable 3

1226
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,440
to shield or separate

1227
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,960
x1 from x2 and x2 from x1

1228
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,440
so that's the the move of pearl and then

1229
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,000
that's what we're gonna dive into from

1230
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,040
then on so we

1231
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,760
we went from basically bazon states

1232
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,359
bayes on models

1233
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:49,839
to variational bays variational bays

1234
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:52,240
gives us this free energy minimizing way

1235
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,200
to work

1236
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,720
the variational inference contingent on

1237
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,800
a few assumptions that we would love

1238
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,839
clarification and education on

1239
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:05,280
and that's going to help us separate out

1240
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,240
in a way that's tractable different

1241
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,839
parts of the world model that we care

1242
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:12,079
about

1243
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,000
so an easy way to think about this

1244
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,079
conditional dependence

1245
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,119
is is if you're like thinking about the

1246
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:20,000
probability

1247
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,040
of mary and mo both eating at the

1248
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,880
frontier restaurant in albuquerque

1249
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,480
it's independent of one another right

1250
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,319
like mary and mo they eat periodically

1251
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:29,599
at the frontier restaurant this is like

1252
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,040
an independent probability that they go

1253
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,079
there whatever

1254
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:33,599
and then they have another friend that

1255
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,359
they go with so mary and mo

1256
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,079
go with sally they if sally eats at the

1257
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:39,680
frontier restaurant then the probability

1258
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,319
that

1259
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:41,680
mary and mo will be there together

1260
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,599
because they'll all go together is

1261
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,359
you know they'll all be there at the

1262
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,040
same time if sally's there because then

1263
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,480
they'll all go eat together but they're

1264
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,079
not independently friends they're only

1265
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:50,640
friends

1266
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,560
they only go as a trio when sally's

1267
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,760
involved

1268
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,040
nice our variables just hanging out with

1269
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,000
each other

1270
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,359
so let's take it from

1271
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:04,800
doing inference on like one variable

1272
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,319
states and the variational and

1273
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:08,000
everything to two variables that's with

1274
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,599
this joint inference and then here we

1275
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,599
brought in the third variable

1276
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:15,040
let's generalize that beyond three

1277
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,800
because we're not just interested in x1

1278
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,480
and x2 in their relationship or how

1279
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,079
three influences it

1280
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,000
we want to be actually open to all

1281
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,960
graphical relationships and that just

1282
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,880
means everything you can draw

1283
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,400
as a network with nodes and edges

1284
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,240
is graphical or that's a network

1285
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,440
analysis

1286
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,839
so they bring in now the notion of a

1287
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:38,560
bayesian

1288
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,640
network beta and it is defined as

1289
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,760
containing g and p

1290
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,000
so g is sub defined with vertices uh

1291
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,280
and edges v and d so g is really like

1292
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,240
edges and notes so g is the network

1293
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,000
itself and that's kind of the matrix

1294
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,280
form the two space

1295
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,319
form that we're familiar with

1296
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:05,520
and then p is as they write a collection

1297
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,880
of tables containing

1298
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,839
dependencies between the variables as a

1299
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:10,160
set

1300
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,520
of matrices with structure but it's kind

1301
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,000
of like

1302
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,480
g is the social network like who are the

1303
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,240
people and what are the edges

1304
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,960
and then p is describing their

1305
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,079
relationship

1306
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,839
in a way and uh

1307
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,000
they also then they write the the tables

1308
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,200
p

1309
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,200
uh the graph g is often represented by

1310
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,720
an adjacency matrix

1311
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,359
so that's a you know nodes by nodes and

1312
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,640
then the cells are whether they're

1313
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,760
connected or not

1314
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,440
and that's exactly what we were getting

1315
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,280
at with the two spaces so yeah it is

1316
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,400
pretty interesting

1317
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,839
and then the tables p contain the

1318
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:46,079
factorization

1319
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,720
for the joint probability distribution

1320
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,359
over the

1321
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:52,000
variables characterized for the uh

1322
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,560
directed acyclic graph the dag

1323
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,560
and so there's an equation that we're

1324
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,839
going to use to

1325
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,720
jointly consider like the network nodes

1326
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,440
and edges

1327
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,720
g and all the dependencies on the

1328
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,280
network

1329
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,040
p and so you can imagine if there was

1330
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,960
like if you had a matrix of 100 people

1331
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,720
and these 50 all knew each other like

1332
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,720
they had dependencies between each other

1333
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,319
and then these 50 people all knew each

1334
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:16,000
other they had dependencies between each

1335
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:16,800
other

1336
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,040
we would want a method that could

1337
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,480
decompose that

1338
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,800
matrix into a more factorizable

1339
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,839
potentially nicer to deal with form

1340
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,839
okay so here we visually see it

1341
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,920
and i think that the circles are all

1342
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,359
meant to be complete

1343
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,119
but they look like like i was wondering

1344
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,280
if it was a dashed line or something but

1345
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,000
i think it's all yeah so here we have a

1346
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:44,880
bunch of variables

1347
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,720
t w y x u and z

1348
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,920
and then the authors very helpfully

1349
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,839
go through a few of the kinds of

1350
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:56,240
relationships

1351
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,520
that can link motifs of three

1352
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:03,520
variables and so here's w

1353
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,560
and y and so it's like notice how w and

1354
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,359
y

1355
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:10,400
are unconnected but they both have a

1356
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,079
dependency towards x

1357
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,079
so it's like w and y are marginally

1358
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:15,839
independent

1359
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:17,839
but only conditionally dependent if x is

1360
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:19,839
observed so if you didn't see

1361
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,240
x you wouldn't know that w and y had a

1362
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,359
dependency

1363
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,839
but then when you do observe x you can

1364
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:26,559
see that oh

1365
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:28,240
x is actually being influenced by both

1366
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,760
of them

1367
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,200
that's called um the head to head w

1368
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,240
and z marginally dependent

1369
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,800
because you could tell that potentially

1370
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,200
through latent interactor variable x

1371
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,680
if you had w and z measured you could

1372
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,240
tell that there was an influence

1373
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,119
um but you wouldn't know as much about

1374
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:50,559
the influence of w

1375
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,520
on z unless you knew about x and then

1376
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,160
there's x

1377
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,480
and u which is kind of like the

1378
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,319
backwards example of w

1379
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:01,359
and y because x and u would be

1380
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:03,200
correlated in the real world

1381
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,640
like you'd be pulling out x's and

1382
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,440
pulling out u's and they'd be correlated

1383
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,240
so they're marginally dependent but then

1384
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,079
if you measured y

1385
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,040
if you observed y you would make them

1386
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,960
conditionally independent

1387
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,599
because you'd be able to correct for y

1388
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:20,240
and then

1389
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,880
as you pulled out corrected x's and u's

1390
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,480
they would be

1391
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,960
conditionally independent so the

1392
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,280
bayesian graphical form

1393
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,400
allows us to go from that p of t w

1394
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,319
et cetera et cetera so think about that

1395
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:35,680
there's six variables

1396
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,400
that could be six times six variables to

1397
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,880
consider like 36

1398
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,480
connections but we can factor it

1399
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,760
into like the function of z

1400
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,480
given x because that's the only thing

1401
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:50,800
that

1402
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,920
z is conditioned on x

1403
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,599
is conditioned on w and y use uh

1404
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,160
u is conditioned on y and then t is an

1405
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,200
alone variable

1406
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,559
so we've gotten all six variables

1407
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:08,079
into a way that is like a lot

1408
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,319
sparser it only specifies the parts that

1409
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:11,599
we actually need to care about

1410
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:12,880
in terms of the dependencies that

1411
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,880
actually exist so that's kind of the

1412
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,079
bayes network

1413
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:18,720
it's just using network thinking to talk

1414
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,200
about

1415
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,480
the really nuanced relationships between

1416
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,839
sets of variables so this could be like

1417
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:28,400
six demographic factors of a person and

1418
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,720
z could be the health outcome

1419
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,880
and so then we can use this analysis to

1420
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,599
do statistical inference

1421
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:37,040
just like we would with any other

1422
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,800
technique anything to add on it

1423
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,160
blue uh just the final

1424
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,760
formula down at the bottom really

1425
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,880
specifies uh like it separates out like

1426
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,240
b z given x right and so and t is

1427
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,599
independent of everything so you can

1428
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:52,720
really see like the

1429
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,800
the conditional dependencies down here

1430
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,079
in this final equation

1431
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:00,319
x given w and y and then u given y

1432
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,559
so yeah it's almost like there's the

1433
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:04,400
graph representation

1434
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,559
then there's the adjacency matrix

1435
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:08,079
representation and then here's

1436
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:11,359
an equation representation so it's like

1437
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:12,000
a rosetta

1438
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,240
stone if you could have a technique that

1439
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,160
works on matrices and then you wanted to

1440
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,680
apply it to a network

1441
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,280
well then you need to connect networks

1442
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,400
and matrices but then you could

1443
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,359
definitely apply it there

1444
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:25,599
what about the pearl blanket with this

1445
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:28,240
cute picture yeah

1446
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:32,800
so the pearl blanket is really um

1447
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,200
traditionally is described by the set of

1448
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,160
nodes

1449
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,720
that shields a variable so in this case

1450
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,640
variable a that's in the middle

1451
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,359
from the other nodes in the network so a

1452
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:45,599
can't interact with these nodes that are

1453
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:46,319
outside

1454
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,640
of the pearl blanket which is the

1455
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,680
represented by this

1456
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,000
circular blanket so a can't interact

1457
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,079
with these other nodes without going

1458
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,520
through the nodes that are contained in

1459
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,200
the circle

1460
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,680
yep and if you notice it has uh like the

1461
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,680
ones that are to the sides of a

1462
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,280
it's because all these kinds of

1463
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,920
relationships are relevant

1464
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,240
so even the one that a it does not

1465
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,760
directly connected to a

1466
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,359
but it still is included within the

1467
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:14,000
blanket that's kind of important to note

1468
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,400
all right so now we're gonna get to this

1469
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,000
figure and it's kind of clever how i

1470
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,200
think the authors did it because they

1471
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,520
introduced this in figure two

1472
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,920
uncolored and then we're gonna talk

1473
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,240
through some fristen simulations

1474
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,319
and then active inference in figure six

1475
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:29,839
and then we're gonna return to this in

1476
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:30,720
figure seven

1477
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,359
with a new color scheme that will help

1478
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:35,200
really make their point clear

1479
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,359
so here they're taking this simple

1480
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:38,559
example and they're just

1481
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:42,079
giving another example and um

1482
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:45,280
here is their their legend

1483
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,160
the grays are the observables so y is

1484
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:48,800
observable

1485
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,520
y1 y2 we're observing two things about

1486
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,000
the world

1487
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,480
measuring two things all the x's are

1488
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,400
hidden states

1489
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,440
the arrows are that bayes net directed

1490
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,559
acyclic graph

1491
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:04,000
representation the dashed node

1492
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,559
is this special node a10 that's like our

1493
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:07,200
focal

1494
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,880
node and then the thick nodes

1495
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,240
are the blankets around x10

1496
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,000
so here just like you had a and it was

1497
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,359
like its neighborhood

1498
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:20,559
was the blanket here we're gonna have

1499
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:22,240
the pearl blanket

1500
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,079
as they write thick lines are used for

1501
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:25,760
nodes constituting the pearl blanket for

1502
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,040
selected node x10

1503
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,040
depicted here with a dash border so it's

1504
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,359
kind of like a legal argument

1505
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:34,079
they're like saying you know uh would

1506
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:34,800
you agree

1507
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,559
that this is the appropriate use of the

1508
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:38,640
pearl blanket because if you do think

1509
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,480
that this is a pearl blanket

1510
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,319
you might find yourself in a trap in

1511
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:44,240
figure seven when they

1512
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,960
show you what this actually represents

1513
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,000
so it's like

1514
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,240
okay good this is what a pearl blanket

1515
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,280
is there's no

1516
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,599
real dissension this is where we're at

1517
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:54,880
with pearl blanket

1518
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,280
thinking and we've just specified some

1519
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,720
arbitrary network

1520
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,800
you know nothing in mind just specified

1521
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,319
it

1522
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:06,880
and then they also um define in 4.1

1523
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,079
uh a little bit about how pearl blankets

1524
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:14,079
play a role in active inference and

1525
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:16,720
it's a super fascinating topic that is

1526
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:17,920
something we want to return to

1527
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,400
with the authors but if you notice that

1528
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:20,960
this q

1529
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,000
distribution that was the one that we

1530
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,599
were in control of

1531
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:28,160
and then that minimization previously we

1532
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:28,640
were looking

1533
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,359
at f of x it was free energy

1534
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:32,640
minimization on

1535
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,680
states hypotheses but here

1536
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:39,119
we're also including policies pi

1537
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:41,839
sequences of action so now we're doing

1538
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:44,240
free energy minimization

1539
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:48,240
on policy and so that's what allows us

1540
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,760
to include

1541
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,160
the action in the loop with active

1542
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,200
inference

1543
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,680
so active inference isn't like just a

1544
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,960
two-stroke engine

1545
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,240
where we're going to do inference on

1546
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,040
states and then action selection

1547
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,400
in a second step it's actually a loop

1548
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,240
that integrates action and inference

1549
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,680
into functions in a co-equal way

1550
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,280
and that's what one of the special

1551
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,119
pieces of active inference is

1552
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:17,200
as they write um something that

1553
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,359
classical formulations of variational

1554
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:20,800
inference in statistics and machine

1555
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,319
learning do not consider

1556
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:24,319
instead assuming fixed observations or

1557
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:26,800
data so you read in the big data set

1558
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,720
you do the free energy minimization and

1559
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:29,920
there's your answer

1560
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,920
and then if you get new data what do

1561
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,119
these companies do

1562
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:35,680
they re-run the optimization with the

1563
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,720
new data

1564
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,559
but this is actually like real time in

1565
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:40,319
the loop and it's also

1566
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:43,520
taking action okay

1567
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,920
any thoughts or on figure three do you

1568
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,280
want to

1569
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,400
intro it or what yeah so this uh figure

1570
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:52,799
i think

1571
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:54,480
the papers on the next slide actually

1572
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,400
the the figure that came out

1573
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,839
of the um it came out of this first in

1574
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,319
2013 paper and there's like a set of

1575
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:04,000
figures in this paper that were

1576
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,559
accepted from that paper and so this is

1577
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:07,040
the

1578
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,240
it's a primordial soup simulation

1579
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,839
that was done in in the article by

1580
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:13,599
firstin and the larger

1581
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:15,839
cyan dots represent the location of each

1582
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:16,640
particle

1583
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,480
and then there are three smaller blue

1584
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,079
dots associated with

1585
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:21,880
each particle representing the

1586
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,280
electrochemical

1587
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,319
state of the particle so this is like

1588
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:28,880
on on how life came to came to kind of

1589
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:29,520
be

1590
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,760
right so that's the the what's going to

1591
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,440
happen in the simulation so this is just

1592
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,319
the first

1593
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:37,200
and then we go on into the into the next

1594
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,640
figures from the paper

1595
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,680
nice so take this one yeah

1596
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,839
yep yep so the simulation is just like

1597
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:45,599
the cyan it's kind of like the nucleus

1598
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:46,720
of an atom

1599
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,880
and then the blue dots the little ones

1600
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,559
are like electrons floating around

1601
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,799
okay so just it's it's not trying to be

1602
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:54,559
a physics simulation but that's kind of

1603
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,319
what's happening

1604
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:59,440
figure four um

1605
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,000
here is oh and and they're electrically

1606
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:02,720
charged

1607
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,920
that's the electrochemical part here's

1608
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,280
what they write

1609
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,520
um you can take so let's just say each

1610
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,200
of these cyan dots had a number

1611
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,040
you know number one through 100 like an

1612
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,640
agent-based model

1613
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,359
now we're going to element 1 through 120

1614
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:18,400
i guess

1615
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,200
you can plot the adjacency matrix a

1616
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,799
based upon the coupling that is

1617
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:24,160
dependencies

1618
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,760
between the different particles at the

1619
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,079
final simulation t

1620
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,319
so you're going to start this simulation

1621
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:31,520
let it run out

1622
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,000
and then okay this one is very closely

1623
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,520
coupled to that one and this one is

1624
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,960
closely coupled to that one so

1625
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,880
number one is talking to four and number

1626
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,799
fours talking to 22.

1627
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:44,079
and then you can take that matrix and

1628
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:46,799
you can just put a dot where you saw a

1629
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:47,920
dependency

1630
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,599
so if you saw some sort of behavioral

1631
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:51,280
dependency between the two like in

1632
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,079
adjacency

1633
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:53,680
you're gonna add a dot and then you're

1634
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,280
gonna rearrange

1635
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,440
the rows and the columns by swapping

1636
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,680
which preserves the information

1637
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,280
rearrange them

1638
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,640
so that they're sort of uh falling out

1639
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,559
there's actually several there's there's

1640
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,640
a pattern that falls out

1641
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,720
we see that there's a broad region of

1642
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,319
interactions over here

1643
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:16,640
and then in the bottom right there's

1644
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,359
like another

1645
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:19,839
kind of sub area of interaction and then

1646
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:21,760
on the very bottom right is like a very

1647
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,880
tight

1648
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,319
area of interaction where you see a

1649
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:27,119
bunch of dots over the 120.

1650
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:29,440
so as they write the adjacency matrix is

1651
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,559
a representation

1652
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:32,319
of the electrochemical interactions

1653
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:34,799
between particles because it's drawn

1654
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:36,079
because the adjacency is on the

1655
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:39,280
simulation but can be interpreted as an

1656
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,720
abstract depiction of a bayesian network

1657
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,640
and so we're taking the dependencies

1658
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,480
between these particles as they

1659
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,480
jostle around and this is what we're

1660
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,400
trying to do we're trying to almost like

1661
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,200
factorize it separate nature at the

1662
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,000
joints

1663
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,920
you know map in the territory okay

1664
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,839
there's a border on the map

1665
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:00,799
but is there a border on the territory

1666
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:01,359
and then

1667
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:04,640
um plot it as a matrix and then

1668
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,319
there's some shading that's going to be

1669
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:07,680
suggestive

1670
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:12,000
of what role those

1671
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,119
nodes are hypothesized to be playing so

1672
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:16,400
here's what they did just in a little

1673
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,680
more formal

1674
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:21,040
on slide 30. they used spectral well

1675
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:21,599
this is

1676
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:24,400
i think what frist in 2013 did yeah uh

1677
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,480
spectral graph theory was used

1678
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,480
to identify the eight most densely

1679
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,240
coupled nodes which are defined as the

1680
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,119
internal states

1681
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:34,880
so y eight y dense cup okay

1682
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,359
right that's the question that's what

1683
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:38,960
we're discussing

1684
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,319
and those are going to be defined as

1685
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:42,799
internal states

1686
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:44,480
just to skip to the slide those are

1687
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,000
those blue ones right in the middle

1688
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,839
here so those are those core states back

1689
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:51,680
here given those internal states

1690
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,480
the markov blanket is then found through

1691
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,920
tracing the parents

1692
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,839
children and co-parents of children in

1693
00:58:57,839 --> 00:58:59,280
the network

1694
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:03,040
sounds like a preschool

1695
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,839
um as an extra interpretive step and

1696
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:06,559
that's

1697
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:08,079
part of what this discussion is about

1698
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:09,520
how interpretive is this like

1699
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,200
interpretive dance interpretive

1700
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,640
or like interpreter at the un um

1701
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,720
the nodes in this mark called blanket

1702
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,000
can be further separated

1703
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,040
into sensory and active states the

1704
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,040
sensory states correspond to the parents

1705
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,480
of the internal states

1706
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,359
so that's incoming info not that they

1707
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:29,200
birthed the internal states but the

1708
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,960
sense states are the ones that have an

1709
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,960
upstream dependency on the internal

1710
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,000
states

1711
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,760
and the active states correspond to the

1712
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,359
children of the internal states and

1713
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:38,480
their co-parents

1714
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,160
so again not that the active states are

1715
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,640
simply birthed by internal states

1716
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:45,040
but that they have downward flowing

1717
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,359
statistical dependency

1718
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:49,040
states that are not internal states or

1719
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,400
part of the markov blanket are then

1720
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,160
called external states

1721
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,799
so we're using this partitioning where

1722
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:57,520
first you identify dense couplings

1723
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,760
then traced out parents and co-parents

1724
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:00,880
and children

1725
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,480
and then everything that's left is

1726
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,079
external states and so you

1727
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:06,960
recolor that simulation from figure

1728
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:07,359
three

1729
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:09,680
here it is uncolored and now we're gonna

1730
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,799
recolor it

1731
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:13,359
with this new color code where we've

1732
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:14,559
identified

1733
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:17,040
the blue densely coupled nodes and then

1734
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,319
the active states

1735
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:21,520
and then the um sensory states which are

1736
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,760
sort of on a frontier

1737
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:27,680
with the uh teal states the cyan

1738
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,760
the external so it's almost like you

1739
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:30,960
have the internal you know let's just

1740
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,160
imagine it's like

1741
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,559
the nervous system and then it's

1742
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:36,799
swaddled in the active state

1743
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,319
and then on the outside of the sense of

1744
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:40,160
the active states or the sensory states

1745
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,319
and those interface directly with the

1746
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:43,359
world

1747
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:46,400
so that's kind of the tantalizing

1748
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,400
nature of this model would be like wow

1749
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,079
if it really just fell out

1750
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:51,440
of a simulation that you can get

1751
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,520
self-organization like that

1752
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,599
wouldn't that be cool but what is the

1753
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:58,319
issue here blue

1754
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:01,760
well i mean it's kind of arbitrary um

1755
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,079
like so you know they said a third of

1756
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:05,040
the

1757
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,040
of the electrochemical states from the

1758
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,480
very beginning of the simulation

1759
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,640
were not did not interact right so it's

1760
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:13,440
that establishes this non-equilibrium

1761
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,480
system um and and i think that

1762
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,200
uh you know the the issue then comes

1763
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,319
from

1764
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:24,160
assigning these interactions to

1765
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,640
internal external active and sensory

1766
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,880
states that may or may not

1767
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:32,000
have some kind of dependence on

1768
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,760
one another yes

1769
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,920
as they write here the simulation

1770
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:38,960
assumes

1771
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,480
that by viewing the system through the

1772
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,559
formalism of the markup blanket

1773
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:44,720
plus some additional assumptions about

1774
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,240
the separation of states the ones that

1775
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,440
we kind of walked through just a second

1776
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,400
ago

1777
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,880
you can uncover hidden properties of the

1778
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,240
target system

1779
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,160
which is then said to quote instantiate

1780
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,240
or possess a markov blanket

1781
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,799
and then this is the map territory the

1782
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:00,319
procedure of attributing to the

1783
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:02,799
territory which is the actual dynamical

1784
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:04,160
system

1785
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:07,359
what is a property of the map which is

1786
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:09,520
the scientist doing inference on the

1787
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:10,880
dependencies and then

1788
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,200
cutting it at eight nodes and then using

1789
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,319
this other approach

1790
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:17,039
to make the markov blanket it's a

1791
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:18,240
property of the map

1792
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,599
and it's a clear example of the

1793
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:21,520
reification fallacy

1794
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,680
treating something abstract as something

1795
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,760
concrete without further justification

1796
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,839
that's not the only way reification

1797
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:30,400
works but it's one key piece of it and

1798
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:31,760
so in other words it's like you go in

1799
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:33,760
with a marcotte blanket hammer

1800
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:36,799
and your secondary pipeline for

1801
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,799
identifying parents and children

1802
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:41,280
and then you find it because it's

1803
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:42,960
defined for any system you're going to

1804
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,119
be able to get a markov blanket using

1805
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:46,480
that protocol

1806
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,119
and then look at this have you really

1807
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:50,880
discovered something about this

1808
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:54,160
dynamical system by separating it into

1809
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,880
this partition when actually all of the

1810
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:57,760
particles

1811
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,640
are doing the same jostling motion so

1812
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,960
it's not like we have uh the influencer

1813
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:03,520
nodes

1814
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:06,079
here these are just densely coupled ones

1815
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:06,960
and so

1816
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,079
um they propose

1817
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:13,359
in this same paragraph proposed to

1818
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:15,599
distinguish between pearl blankets

1819
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:18,319
to refer to the standard epistemic or

1820
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:19,359
like statistical

1821
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:22,079
use of the markov blankets and first in

1822
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:23,760
blankets to refer to this new

1823
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,960
metaphysical construct

1824
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,720
and they also give a shout out to martin

1825
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,200
beale in the paper

1826
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,520
and so we're kind of coming back to this

1827
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,599
map territory distinction

1828
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:38,720
on the map side we have epistemic

1829
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,839
pearl blankets bayesian statistics

1830
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:45,599
but no philosophical power and then

1831
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:48,160
what they're attributing to the

1832
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,440
territory

1833
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,839
would be metaphysics and it would be the

1834
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:53,599
kinds of things that the fristen blanket

1835
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,000
is making claims about

1836
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,039
and i think my question was

1837
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:02,000
can we do that action in the loop

1838
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:02,720
without

1839
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,520
metaphysics because it seems like

1840
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,880
there's two

1841
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,680
innovations in or differences between

1842
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:10,079
the

1843
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,799
pearl blanket in its sort of normal

1844
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:14,319
statistical use and the way frison's

1845
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:15,039
using it

1846
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:17,280
first he separates sense and action but

1847
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,520
also he's making metaphysical or

1848
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,039
ontological claims

1849
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:23,680
so i'm just wondering like are the

1850
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,039
ontological claims

1851
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:28,480
separable from taking a control theory

1852
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:32,240
perspective on bayesian statistics

1853
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,680
that's what we would like to find out

1854
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,880
so then blue you copied this image over

1855
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,000
what do you like about

1856
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,160
it or what did you see in it so i just

1857
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,359
thought it was like a nice

1858
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:45,920
pictorial representation as opposed to

1859
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:47,680
this primordial soup that gets a little

1860
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:48,799
bit hairball

1861
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:52,160
of what we have as internal states

1862
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,160
which were back in the in the christian

1863
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:55,920
picture the the central

1864
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:59,520
um dark blue most highly connected nodes

1865
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,280
so we have the internal states and then

1866
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:02,720
the external states

1867
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,280
which are separated from these blanket

1868
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,079
states

1869
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:08,000
and so that's this where this pink

1870
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,680
dashed line is surrounded

1871
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,280
that that's labeled with the bees so

1872
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,599
this is like the fristen blanket

1873
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:15,839
contains the active states and the

1874
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:16,960
sensory states

1875
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,599
that may be interacting with each other

1876
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:21,680
uh and then this fristen blanket is what

1877
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:22,720
separates

1878
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:25,839
the internal states from the external

1879
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:26,720
states

1880
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:29,839
um and they take it in quite a literal

1881
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:32,960
sense like the boundary of a cell

1882
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:36,480
and and um so forth so separating the

1883
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,000
the internal from the external is the

1884
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,680
first and blanket

1885
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:43,039
nice and let's connect this to figure

1886
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,200
four and then the kinds of things that

1887
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,880
we wanted to discover there

1888
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:49,839
looking at this as a graph of bayesian

1889
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:51,039
variables

1890
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:53,599
it's like active states they influence

1891
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:54,880
external states

1892
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,359
so this is that coupling so it's almost

1893
01:05:57,359 --> 01:05:58,640
like external states

1894
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,400
they don't connect to internal states at

1895
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,319
all that's kind of like

1896
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:05,520
missing a corner on the graph so we have

1897
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,760
nodes everywhere you know there's cells

1898
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,240
in your hand and there's cells across a

1899
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,119
wall

1900
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:13,440
but how can we separate nature at the

1901
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:14,799
joints

1902
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:18,000
maybe we could make measurements

1903
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,880
find the statistical dependencies and

1904
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:21,760
then

1905
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,720
carve those dependencies into densely

1906
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,720
connected internal states

1907
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,480
and then incoming states that are

1908
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:30,880
upstream and outgoing states

1909
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,920
that are downstream and then we might

1910
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,280
have a new way

1911
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,480
to do bayesian modeling on systems

1912
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:42,000
that are on a continuum

1913
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,280
or as part of a really uh complex

1914
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,839
process

1915
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:50,319
and figure five yep we already had that

1916
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:51,520
i guess we put it

1917
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:54,319
put it twice

1918
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:58,880
and yes 4.3

1919
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:02,720
this is sort of the uh

1920
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,200
man's search for meaning why and how

1921
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,720
have marcon blankets

1922
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,559
been reified to act as parts of the

1923
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:10,160
target system

1924
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:13,200
how did we get here and uh

1925
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:16,960
where this technical idea became reified

1926
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,480
so people thinking that there's support

1927
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:19,359
in the literature

1928
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:21,039
saying oh yeah markup blankets it's in

1929
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:22,640
the literature there's real measurement

1930
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,720
support for markow blankets

1931
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:28,400
that's reification um of delineating

1932
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,319
spatial temporal boundaries

1933
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:32,480
rather than formal tools intended for

1934
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:33,920
scientific representation and

1935
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,839
statistical analysis

1936
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:37,599
when did the map become conflated with

1937
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,880
the territory

1938
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,720
because like everyone's familiar how we

1939
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,720
use linear regression

1940
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,520
on healthcare data but then no one goes

1941
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,960
back and says well then you're

1942
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,839
a linear regression so it's a little bit

1943
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:50,319
like

1944
01:07:50,319 --> 01:07:52,160
if somebody were using markov blankets

1945
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,440
on health data

1946
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,119
and then said now you're a markov

1947
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:57,520
blanket

1948
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,680
or is it i'm not saying it's exactly the

1949
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,359
same but that's the rhetoric

1950
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:05,359
of what is being uh put out here

1951
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:07,359
it would be like the line delineating

1952
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:08,640
the healthy from the sick

1953
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:11,839
is a markov blanket it's a line

1954
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:15,038
there's actually a line

1955
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:18,319
and then they write

1956
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:21,839
so again people should read these

1957
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:23,759
papers they're fun to think about and

1958
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:24,960
there's a lot more that we're not

1959
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:25,679
getting to

1960
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:29,120
go into in the um zero but they write

1961
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,399
basically

1962
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:33,040
perhaps surprisingly many authors in the

1963
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:35,040
field are seemingly not aware of this

1964
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,399
process of reification

1965
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:38,158
and this has led to the conflation of

1966
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:39,920
several different kinds of boundaries in

1967
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,120
the literature

1968
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:42,880
markov blankets are characterized

1969
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,319
alternatively as

1970
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:47,359
statistical boundaries causal boundaries

1971
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:50,319
spatial boundaries epistemic boundaries

1972
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:51,600
and autopoetic

1973
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,839
boundaries each characterization is

1974
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:55,439
treated as somehow equivalent to

1975
01:08:55,439 --> 01:08:58,000
and interchangeable with the others now

1976
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,679
it's rare that someone does the grand

1977
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:00,560
slam

1978
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:03,120
where they totally conflates all of them

1979
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:03,759
but then

1980
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:05,920
there are papers here and there where oh

1981
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,759
it's causal and it's spatial

1982
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:09,679
and then it's spatial and it's epistemic

1983
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:11,920
and it's statistical and it's causal

1984
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:16,000
and through this web of formalisms

1985
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,439
we can get in a tangle

1986
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,719
to kind of any thoughts about that yeah

1987
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:25,198
just that the paper itself contains like

1988
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:26,080
many quotes

1989
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,880
from other papers where they use the

1990
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,279
markov blanket or the fristen blanket

1991
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:34,960
in very much um like a statistical

1992
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,679
and um instrumentalist sense and then

1993
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:39,439
turn around and use it in a very

1994
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:40,640
realistic sense

1995
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:43,279
so there's many uh like examples of that

1996
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,120
illustrated through the paper that trace

1997
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:49,040
back through the literature good

1998
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,198
point and those are the parts that we

1999
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:52,080
didn't quote

2000
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,080
in this dot zero but there's many pages

2001
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,280
so if someone's reading it and they're

2002
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:55,840
like

2003
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,040
wait they don't do that in the

2004
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:59,360
literature read the paper

2005
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,280
because that's where they mention it and

2006
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,480
this is from

2007
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:06,480
the live stream number 15 where we had

2008
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:09,280
uh we were discussing the paper of fan s

2009
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,880
and hippolyto

2010
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:13,920
and we introduced this discussion around

2011
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,600
realism and instrumentalism

2012
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:19,840
and what those authors had written was

2013
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,320
basically realism and instrumentalism

2014
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,320
concern the models and statistical

2015
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,360
manipulations that make up the fep

2016
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:28,880
whether they are thought to be used and

2017
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,320
manipulated by the systems under

2018
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:31,199
scrutiny

2019
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:33,679
independent of scientific inquiry

2020
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:34,400
realism

2021
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,640
the tree falls in the forest does it

2022
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,239
make a sound

2023
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:40,400
realism yes there's a real tree it

2024
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,239
really did fall it really did make a

2025
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:43,120
sound

2026
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:44,640
or conversely whether they are thought

2027
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,960
to be scientific tools wrought by humans

2028
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,960
in specific socio-cultural environments

2029
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,400
to study particular systems

2030
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:51,600
instrumentalism

2031
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,040
so that's like well no a sound means

2032
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,120
somebody has to hear it so

2033
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,719
you don't know if the tree is real or it

2034
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:58,239
really didn't make a sound

2035
01:10:58,239 --> 01:11:00,239
and the whole question is where does

2036
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:01,600
free energy principle

2037
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,840
is it about what systems are doing

2038
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,920
realism when we don't look

2039
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:10,320
or is it about us modeling systems

2040
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,320
no matter how they look that's

2041
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:15,040
instrumentalism

2042
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:19,360
and that brings us to figure six

2043
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:23,199
where they show a classic sensory motor

2044
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:24,320
loop

2045
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,239
so it looks like it's an active

2046
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:27,840
inference loop and that's where they're

2047
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,040
going with this

2048
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:32,640
but their whole point is that um

2049
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,159
it although the figure does not use

2050
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:36,080
directed edges to signify causal

2051
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:36,960
influence

2052
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,880
it is not strictly a bayesian graph as

2053
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,640
it depicts cyclic sets of circular

2054
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:41,920
dependencies

2055
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,840
some between pairs and an overall loop

2056
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,320
compo containing all components

2057
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:49,040
now this was quite interesting because

2058
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:49,840
first off

2059
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,760
it points out that yeah octave inference

2060
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,440
didn't invent

2061
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,840
the internal external or the action

2062
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,360
sense idea

2063
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,040
we're using different models and we're

2064
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,560
recombining them

2065
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:03,679
but there is this cycle right there's

2066
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:04,480
also

2067
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,480
in active inference more of an emphasis

2068
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,560
on the internal states and the external

2069
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:09,360
states

2070
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:10,800
as they have their own endogenous

2071
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,040
dynamics but that could be part of these

2072
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:14,800
models too

2073
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,600
and then it's true that it's not a

2074
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,360
directed acyclic graph if there are

2075
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:20,080
loops

2076
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:23,320
local or global loops but what about

2077
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:25,840
implementations

2078
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:29,440
that have time steps where you can

2079
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,600
break these loops like if you compute it

2080
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,360
in this order

2081
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:36,880
just a thought like does it really

2082
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:40,080
violate how how badly does it violate

2083
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,440
some of the assumptions of directed

2084
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,120
acyclic graphs

2085
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:46,880
but i don't know any thoughts are good

2086
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:47,760
for seven

2087
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,159
i don't know yeah i don't have the

2088
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:52,000
answer for you if i did i mean i don't

2089
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,920
know that necessarily putting a blanket

2090
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:57,120
over the sensation and the action

2091
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,800
states the sensory in the active states

2092
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,640
like putting that in a box like does

2093
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:00,960
that

2094
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,679
break the acyclic graph thing i mean i

2095
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:05,280
don't know that that necessarily

2096
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,679
breaks it enough to to make it somehow

2097
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:08,480
valid either

2098
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:11,520
right like i don't know it is a cycle

2099
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:15,360
i think good question so now

2100
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:18,960
we return to the figure that we saw

2101
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,480
before

2102
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:23,840
and this is where they now strike so

2103
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,480
figure two remember it was like surely

2104
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,159
you agree this is how a pearl blanket

2105
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:29,679
would be deployed on this

2106
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:32,239
graph now speak now or forever hold your

2107
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:33,120
peace

2108
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:35,199
and then now it's going to come back to

2109
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:36,560
bite some people who may have not

2110
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,640
expected where it was going to come

2111
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,880
so before they were highlighting that

2112
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:41,840
x10

2113
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:44,800
node and now they're going to color

2114
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:45,600
according to

2115
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,400
fristen's scheme they're going to color

2116
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,120
the notes

2117
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:52,640
so it's colored like figure 5

2118
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,520
but on the figure that they introduced

2119
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:56,239
earlier

2120
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:59,360
with x10 still as a focal note

2121
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:00,719
but then they're going to show that if

2122
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:03,199
you have a different focal node

2123
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:08,560
x9 not only are different nodes included

2124
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:10,880
but they're just they're categorized

2125
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,239
differently

2126
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:14,480
which isn't a problem for the pearl

2127
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:15,440
blanket

2128
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:18,560
because it's like oh if you if you're uh

2129
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:19,440
if you measure

2130
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:21,679
variable a and b then this one is the

2131
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:23,280
child or the parent depending on you

2132
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:24,880
know what you measured in that bigger

2133
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:28,159
graph and then but if you're going to

2134
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:29,760
have a realist interpretation

2135
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,640
of what these nodes are you're out of

2136
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:33,520
luck

2137
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,280
because one is going to be an active

2138
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,719
state for one in a sensory state for

2139
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:37,600
another

2140
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,960
and then if you are going to say well it

2141
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,159
doesn't matter if it's an active state

2142
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:41,280
or a sensory state like they're all

2143
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:42,000
doing it for each

2144
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,400
other it's equivalent to the pearl pearl

2145
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,040
blanket

2146
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:48,239
phrasing so what they write is if you're

2147
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:49,440
going to have a sensory motor

2148
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:50,480
interpretation

2149
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:53,360
which is not the only option this

2150
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,280
suggests that the sensory motor blankets

2151
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:56,880
are markup blankets applied under

2152
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,719
specific set of assumptions

2153
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:00,560
and it can't be traced to standard uses

2154
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,560
of markov blankets in variational

2155
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:06,159
inference so basically depending on

2156
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:09,040
what your hidden variable of interest is

2157
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,480
you compute

2158
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:13,760
a different blanket around it so that

2159
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:15,440
is problematic for realist

2160
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,840
interpretations because depending on

2161
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:19,760
what you're doing inference on

2162
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,320
you might variously find that the

2163
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:23,440
membrane of a cell

2164
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:24,960
or a measurement from the membrane of a

2165
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,520
cell was a sensory state

2166
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:29,520
because it was incoming for something

2167
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:31,120
else but it could also be an

2168
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,480
action state because it's outgoing of

2169
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,000
something else but then it would be

2170
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:34,960
internal

2171
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:37,280
to another set of things and so if we

2172
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:38,960
want to make realist claims or

2173
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:39,920
interpretations

2174
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,400
about blanket states and internal

2175
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:43,520
external states

2176
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:46,159
that's an issue

2177
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,440
so is the issue like that we haven't

2178
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,360
figured figured out how to like nest

2179
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:52,159
these models

2180
01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:54,080
yet i mean i i think that it makes sense

2181
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:55,440
that the outgoing is

2182
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,640
incoming for another agent

2183
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:00,159
right in the in the model so that we

2184
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:01,760
just haven't figured out the nesting

2185
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:04,480
pro properly yet appropriately or like

2186
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,000
that each nest is its own

2187
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,320
like blanket state i don't know

2188
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:13,440
i agree i'm an optimist as well

2189
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,520
let's see eight but this is this is

2190
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:16,480
where they

2191
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,800
they really go for it and this one i

2192
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,320
thought was just very clever and funny

2193
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:20,800
so

2194
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,199
the delayed figure you know with the

2195
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:24,800
intermission to convince you

2196
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:27,199
lull you now eight so now they're going

2197
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:27,920
to go into

2198
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:30,400
a graph that oh total coincidence it

2199
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,239
looks like the left side

2200
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:34,880
so here on the right side you know we

2201
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,080
were talking oh x10

2202
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:38,480
x9 but we never talked about this left

2203
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:39,440
one that looks like

2204
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:42,890
california but let's look at it now

2205
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:45,520
[Laughter]

2206
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:49,040
so california exactly um on the left

2207
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:53,199
a bayesian network where id and i sub p

2208
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:55,280
denote the motor intentions of a doctor

2209
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,040
and the patient respectively

2210
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:00,000
so that's this these ones on the top too

2211
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:00,320
h

2212
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:03,199
is a medical intervention with a hammer

2213
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:03,600
c

2214
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,159
is a cortical motor column and s are

2215
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:07,600
spinal neurons

2216
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,560
movement is m and then k is a different

2217
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,199
way

2218
01:17:11,199 --> 01:17:13,040
that the leg could have been observed to

2219
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,800
move like somebody could have moved it

2220
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:18,000
or gravity could have changed so again

2221
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,159
m is the movement that's the observable

2222
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:21,520
movement

2223
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,840
this is the abstract bayesian net on the

2224
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,040
left

2225
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:28,159
in a in b is

2226
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:31,520
one possible action pattern which is

2227
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:32,239
that the

2228
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:35,520
the patient goes to the

2229
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:39,280
cortical motor command the ip

2230
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:42,560
and then h is the medical intervention

2231
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:43,760
with a hammer

2232
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:47,600
and then that results in no

2233
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:51,520
motor behavior but then here

2234
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,560
you do have um the motor behavior

2235
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,239
observed

2236
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:57,920
but it comes about a different way

2237
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:59,360
rather than h

2238
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:02,080
the intervention as a co-parent you have

2239
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:02,400
k

2240
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,920
this other way like somebody picking up

2241
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:06,000
the leg and moving it in the middle

2242
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,600
and on the right the same network is

2243
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,199
partitioned using a naive

2244
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:10,640
first and blanket with different choice

2245
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:12,239
of internal states c

2246
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:15,280
and s respectively so if your internal

2247
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:16,560
state is the cortical

2248
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:19,920
neurons you're going to

2249
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,960
think that the uh basically active

2250
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:25,199
states are the spinal neurons

2251
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:27,280
which is how people talk about it so

2252
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,560
it's not like this is like a

2253
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,159
the theory is blown out or anything it's

2254
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:32,960
like saying the spinal neurons

2255
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:35,040
are the active states of the cortical

2256
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,000
neurons

2257
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
and then the movement is if your focal

2258
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,880
node internal is the spinal neurons

2259
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:43,840
then the active state is what we would

2260
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:44,239
call

2261
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:47,360
in realism the real active state

2262
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:50,159
so it's kind of like saying again

2263
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:52,880
depending on what node you're focused on

2264
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,000
different nodes are going to be

2265
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
categorized as a sense

2266
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,880
active internal and external i want to

2267
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:00,719
say that's how we've been thinking about

2268
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:00,960
it

2269
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,520
that depending on which side of the line

2270
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:04,960
you're on that's going to be internal

2271
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:06,080
external

2272
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:10,239
but the point is it provides um problems

2273
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:12,239
for realist interpretations of any

2274
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:14,159
single markov blanket

2275
01:19:14,159 --> 01:19:15,920
because we have to acknowledge that the

2276
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:18,239
markov blankets and especially how the

2277
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:19,120
states are

2278
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:22,239
classified is conditional so it's like

2279
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:24,960
is the bicep an active state or is this

2280
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,320
an active state it's like well if you're

2281
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:27,360
doing inference on this

2282
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,280
yes but if you're doing inference on

2283
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,280
that no

2284
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:32,800
so it's hard to have a realist

2285
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,320
interpretation

2286
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:37,440
even though there are times where if you

2287
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:38,480
define something

2288
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,560
internally as something that's truly on

2289
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:42,000
the inside of something

2290
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,920
it might be that the active states truly

2291
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:46,239
line up with what's on the outside of it

2292
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:49,520
but that isn't the full generality

2293
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:52,400
of this bayesian network approach and

2294
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,159
that's like a broken clock is right

2295
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:55,360
twice a day

2296
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,199
and it doesn't actually get as general

2297
01:19:57,199 --> 01:19:59,678
as it could be

2298
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:01,520
this makes me think of like the broken

2299
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,040
knee like the phantom limb

2300
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:04,960
it takes me back to that like what if

2301
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,560
the you know sensory

2302
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,159
neurons are activated for the leg to

2303
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:10,239
move but there is no leg to move

2304
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:15,040
right like then what nice

2305
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:18,480
so okay next um one

2306
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,880
uh they give a little bit of recent

2307
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,239
history

2308
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:24,960
so if twitter's too fast and textbooks

2309
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,719
are too slow

2310
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:30,239
this is the the history speed for you

2311
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:33,440
beal pollock and canai 2020 questioned

2312
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:34,800
some of the technical assumptions

2313
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,719
underlying the use of markov blankets by

2314
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:38,080
fristen

2315
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,000
and since then the idea of the fristen

2316
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,760
blanket being understood as a distinct

2317
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,199
construct has gained traction in

2318
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:44,080
literature

2319
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:46,000
and we're actually looking forward to

2320
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,360
having martin

2321
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:50,719
discuss that with us in about two weeks

2322
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:52,480
so again it will be really interesting

2323
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,960
to hear like

2324
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:57,280
how did you come to the position where

2325
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,040
you were getting at these technicalities

2326
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,400
and critiquing it and

2327
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,320
where does action fit in where does

2328
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,520
philosophy fit in

2329
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:06,159
where do these other things that fristen

2330
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:06,719
is bringing

2331
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:08,750
in and um

2332
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:10,320
[Music]

2333
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:14,000
any anything to say on this this part or

2334
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,520
only the question that i raised at the

2335
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,440
beginning where does language begin

2336
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,679
right like to what to what extent is the

2337
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:20,639
the problem

2338
01:21:20,639 --> 01:21:22,800
or or the issue that's being raised like

2339
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,480
a function of the language that we're

2340
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,920
using

2341
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:28,880
yes and in this paragraph they make

2342
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:29,920
another

2343
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:31,600
subtle point that shows why when the

2344
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,120
language is uncertain there can be a lot

2345
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:33,920
of drift

2346
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:36,320
underlying they say in a recent paper

2347
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,480
fristen blankets are formalized

2348
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:40,080
in terms of constraints on sparse

2349
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,880
couplings and then they're identified

2350
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:46,320
using read the technical details

2351
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,239
the non-zero components of the hessians

2352
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:49,360
using some other

2353
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:52,320
last names and that is taking it the

2354
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,159
construct according to the authors

2355
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:57,280
far away from the pearl blanket origins

2356
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,440
and so they're saying you wouldn't make

2357
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:01,360
that kind of swap

2358
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:03,360
in the underlying mechanics unless you

2359
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:04,960
were working

2360
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,280
with the physical domain of what's

2361
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:10,159
really there

2362
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:12,560
um so that's an interesting point would

2363
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:15,840
be cool to hear from the authors

2364
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:19,040
here on the next slide is a kind of a

2365
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:19,760
closing

2366
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:23,040
remark by the authors

2367
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:26,239
and this is kind of a meta point and the

2368
01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:28,080
meta point is actually

2369
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:30,719
the relationship between action and

2370
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:31,679
inference

2371
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:34,800
like of an organism and then

2372
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:38,080
scientists modeling their world so

2373
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:40,239
it's not the first person who's made

2374
01:22:40,239 --> 01:22:41,600
that comparison you know

2375
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,199
you got physical foraging you got

2376
01:22:43,199 --> 01:22:45,120
information foraging but they're saying

2377
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:45,840
basically

2378
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,440
there's a lot of similarities between

2379
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:49,360
perceptual inference and scientific

2380
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:50,480
inference

2381
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:52,320
both use a previously learned model of

2382
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:54,719
the world and set of observations to

2383
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:56,320
infer the causal structure of the

2384
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:58,320
unobserved outside world

2385
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:01,520
and this was like the triple meta is

2386
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,760
model-based cognitive neuroscience is in

2387
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:05,199
a special place

2388
01:23:05,199 --> 01:23:07,360
it makes models of how animals model

2389
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:08,960
their environments

2390
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:11,120
a cognitive neuroscientist uses both

2391
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:13,199
behavioral and neural data to infer the

2392
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:15,760
most likely model that the agent's brain

2393
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,920
implements there's nothing wrong with

2394
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:20,560
this doubling up of modeling relations

2395
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:23,600
as long as one is conceptually careful

2396
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:24,960
one needs to distinguish between the

2397
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,120
properties of the environment

2398
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:28,880
properties of the agent's model of the

2399
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,800
environment and properties of a

2400
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:31,600
scientist

2401
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,760
model of the agent modeling its

2402
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,600
environment and that's the third

2403
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:38,159
level and that's why it's unsurprising

2404
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:39,679
actually almost in retrospect

2405
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:42,320
that fep arose from cognitive

2406
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:43,440
neuroscience

2407
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:48,080
and neuroimaging with eeg and fmri

2408
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:50,239
because it doesn't come from we're going

2409
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:51,760
to use physics to find the grand

2410
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,520
unifying theory

2411
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:56,239
it actually came from a we're making

2412
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:57,360
measurements

2413
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:59,120
about how agents reduce their

2414
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:00,400
uncertainty about

2415
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:03,600
their model of the world and it's that

2416
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,440
that gives you the triple loop

2417
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:08,320
which i think is like quite interesting

2418
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,760
about how

2419
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,480
it's nested well and here we are adding

2420
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,320
like another layer to the loop like

2421
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:15,199
thinking about

2422
01:24:15,199 --> 01:24:17,600
how like trying to you know criticizing

2423
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,440
the model with which the scientists are

2424
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:21,120
using to model the agents

2425
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:24,480
it's just models all the way down yep so

2426
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:26,719
what are the implications for cognitive

2427
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:28,800
science in humans

2428
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,560
and this part right here properties of

2429
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:31,840
how the scientists

2430
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,920
model their agent modeling their

2431
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,520
environment you could replace

2432
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:38,800
scientists with researcher or

2433
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:41,760
data scientist or machine learning

2434
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:42,719
algorithm

2435
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:44,960
this really matters what people take

2436
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:45,920
into account

2437
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:48,480
when they design their algorithms and

2438
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,719
when they make algorithms about other

2439
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:53,199
cognitive agents

2440
01:24:53,199 --> 01:24:56,719
because that constrains

2441
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:58,480
in ways that are sometimes obvious and

2442
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,320
sometimes not obvious

2443
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:01,920
you know if you only had one variable

2444
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,760
for a user on your website how likely

2445
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:05,120
they are to buy something

2446
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:07,199
that was your variable you're going to

2447
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:08,880
set up a different algorithm

2448
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:11,199
so it's the properties of how the

2449
01:25:11,199 --> 01:25:12,719
scientists models the situation that

2450
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:14,080
really matter

2451
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:17,760
and um has implications for cognitive

2452
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:20,000
science that when we're studying humans

2453
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,960
and non-humans

2454
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:24,000
and non-animals

2455
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,440
and blue's big question

2456
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:28,800
this is actually the big question that

2457
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:31,199
the authors bring so and so they asked

2458
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:31,920
in the paper

2459
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,760
if bayesian networks and markov blankets

2460
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:36,080
are the right kinds of conceptual tools

2461
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:37,520
to delineate the sensory motor

2462
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:39,360
boundaries of agents and

2463
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:42,320
living organisms so the authors you know

2464
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:43,120
brought this up

2465
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:44,880
within the paper i thought it was just

2466
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,480
important to highlight that

2467
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:49,120
because i don't know i think like if

2468
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:50,320
we're

2469
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:52,880
you know if you go out to a scale like

2470
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:53,360
if you

2471
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:55,440
have an image and you start to you know

2472
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:56,800
coarse grain that image you know

2473
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:58,800
building representations of the image

2474
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,000
building representations of the

2475
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,080
representations of the representations

2476
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:03,360
of the representations eventually you

2477
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:04,880
can't see the picture anymore at all

2478
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:06,639
and the point is to make it easier to

2479
01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:08,560
understand not to

2480
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,080
you know make it so blurry that nobody

2481
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:12,560
understands it at all i think

2482
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:15,679
cool this is what brings them to

2483
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:19,199
the distinction of inference with

2484
01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:22,239
uh wait is that even the right it's uh

2485
01:26:22,239 --> 01:26:23,600
yeah oh yeah inference width and

2486
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,280
inference within i was thinking

2487
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,280
i was getting really you know inference

2488
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:28,400
of a model but

2489
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:32,239
inference with a model the distinction

2490
01:26:32,239 --> 01:26:34,000
between the two blanket constructs as

2491
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
they're positing them

2492
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,280
i'll shrink our little video can then be

2493
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:40,639
easily identified

2494
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:42,480
once we look at who appears to be

2495
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:44,080
performing the inference and

2496
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,719
what system that inference is performed

2497
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:48,080
on

2498
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:50,080
so they go through four kinds of

2499
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,120
networks we're not gonna

2500
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:54,320
go through it here but if people are

2501
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:55,040
interested

2502
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:57,360
in the technicalities here it's really

2503
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:58,719
worth thinking about what's the

2504
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:00,560
difference between the generative model

2505
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:03,840
and the generative process so like i can

2506
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,920
have a generative model of blue

2507
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,679
in my head so when she's speaking i'm

2508
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:09,280
doing generative inference

2509
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:12,080
on her syntax but then that's not the

2510
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:14,000
generative process which is the actual

2511
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,600
underlying person so this is just a nice

2512
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:21,360
very um rigorous way to break down

2513
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:23,440
when we're doing inference on a model

2514
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:24,560
versus inference on a

2515
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:27,760
on a process and

2516
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:31,679
okay 42 all of this points towards

2517
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:33,840
a fundamental dilemma for anyone wanting

2518
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,679
to use markov blankets

2519
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:38,000
to make substantial philosophical claims

2520
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,880
about biological and cognitive systems

2521
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,480
which is what we take proponents of free

2522
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:45,440
energy principle to be wanting to do

2523
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:48,000
so agree or disagree you know if you

2524
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,840
disagree you can write a paper or you

2525
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:50,560
can come on

2526
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:53,840
activestream but that's the claim

2527
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,920
of the authors and so that is what we

2528
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:58,880
kind of got excited to learn about

2529
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,960
and they then come back to this with

2530
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:02,239
versus within

2531
01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:04,400
and they say basically in inference with

2532
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:05,440
a model

2533
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:08,719
the graphical model is an epistemic tool

2534
01:28:08,719 --> 01:28:10,080
so that's like i'm going out to the

2535
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:12,080
forest with my machete

2536
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:15,600
i'm gonna use it as a tool as i go out

2537
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:17,920
versus inference within a model the

2538
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:20,080
scientist disappears from a scene

2539
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:21,600
becoming a mere spectator of the

2540
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,360
unraveling inference show

2541
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:25,840
before their eyes the way that's written

2542
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:28,000
makes um the authors sound a little

2543
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:31,120
bit um sort of dismissive of that being

2544
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:32,480
a likely approach

2545
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:35,040
it's almost like well we wouldn't want

2546
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:37,040
that to happen or it can't happen

2547
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:40,080
so scientists can only do inference

2548
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:43,120
with models now the scientist as the

2549
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:43,679
body

2550
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:45,760
is the inference within a model like the

2551
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:46,800
inference is happening within the

2552
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,800
science body or within the scientists

2553
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:51,199
exocortex or within their community

2554
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:53,440
but that's very different when you're

2555
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:54,800
talking about the real

2556
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:57,440
system the scientist at the desk that's

2557
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:59,600
the system that is doing inference

2558
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,520
but inference with a model is the

2559
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:04,800
instrumentalist take

2560
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:10,080
okay and um

2561
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:14,000
this is just a final slide that just

2562
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,120
gives some closing thoughts

2563
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:19,040
and this was interesting because they

2564
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:20,960
mentioned that

2565
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:23,120
there are there are simulations like the

2566
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:24,800
game of life

2567
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:28,320
which have been enormously productive

2568
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:31,520
in many domains and so basically they

2569
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,360
say that it might be an interesting way

2570
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:33,920
of

2571
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:36,000
modeling emergent processes in complex

2572
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,520
systems but it won't

2573
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:40,719
support any metaphysical claims about

2574
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:42,560
frist and blankets and then they say we

2575
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:44,639
will not pursue this idea any further

2576
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:45,360
here

2577
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:47,600
but offer it as a more modest perhaps

2578
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:49,360
instrumental interpretation

2579
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:51,440
that some proponents of the fep and

2580
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:52,560
active inference might

2581
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:54,480
be inclined to adopt in order to avoid

2582
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:57,440
any stronger commitments

2583
01:29:57,440 --> 01:30:00,480
so that's in some ways where we

2584
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:02,800
feel like we're sitting which is we're

2585
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,159
approaching active inference

2586
01:30:04,159 --> 01:30:05,520
instrumentally

2587
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:08,960
and then we'll see what happens with the

2588
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:12,159
other claims but it seems like we can

2589
01:30:12,159 --> 01:30:13,840
pursue it instrumentally

2590
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:18,840
and i guess that's a modest proposal

2591
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:23,600
and then they just summarize so overall

2592
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:27,760
nice paper relatively

2593
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:30,960
good length a lot of figures clear

2594
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:34,000
arguments rigorous philosophy and

2595
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:38,000
math so it was um good times

2596
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,600
and like a good coverage of the

2597
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:41,679
literature and um

2598
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:43,679
you know a trace through the history of

2599
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:45,040
the the

2600
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:48,159
methods underlying the fep was good do

2601
01:30:48,159 --> 01:30:49,360
you have any other

2602
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:52,400
closing thoughts only that

2603
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:54,239
maybe inference within a model is

2604
01:30:54,239 --> 01:30:55,920
actually possible if you're

2605
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:58,880
using a robot that's programmed to do

2606
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,480
inference

2607
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:02,800
right like the inference if the if the

2608
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:04,159
or if the

2609
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:06,239
action is to do inference if that's how

2610
01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:08,080
it works then then that's inference

2611
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:09,040
within a model

2612
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:12,159
possible cool

2613
01:31:12,159 --> 01:31:13,840
well it will definitely be really

2614
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:15,280
interesting to

2615
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:17,360
hear from the authors hear from

2616
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:18,960
everybody who wants to join

2617
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:21,920
on the stream so blue thanks a lot for

2618
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:24,080
joining this was a great discussion

2619
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:26,159
thanks everyone for watching and we'll

2620
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:27,840
see you later

2621
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:31,040
bye bye thank you
