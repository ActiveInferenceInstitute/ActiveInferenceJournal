hello

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,960
and welcome to actin flab this is the

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,880
active inference live stream

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,640
number 20.1 on april 20th

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,840
2021 so a lot of repeating digits

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,680
and i'm looking forward to this

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,039
conversation with all of you so thanks

8
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,720
for joining

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,560
welcome to the active inference lab

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,960
everyone we're a participatory online

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,519
lab

12
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,399
that is communicating learning and

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,320
practicing applied active inference

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,480
you can find us at the links that are on

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,680
this slide

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,600
this is recorded in an archived live

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,040
stream so please provide us with

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,760
feedback so that we can improve our work

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,520
all backgrounds and perspectives are

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,840
welcome here and we'll be following

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,840
good video etiquette for live streams

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,920
like muting when we're not talking and

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,360
raising our hands so we can hear from

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,559
everyone on the stack

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,960
hello greetings today in number 20.1

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,159
we're in the first of

27
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,080
two discussions that we're going to be

28
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,439
having as a group

29
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,159
regarding this paper the emperor's new

30
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,520
markov blankets

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,680
and so the goal of these discussions is

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,880
to learn

33
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,080
discuss be curious and find out how we

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,080
got here and where we're going and

35
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,400
why we're doing that and we're just

36
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,080
going to be having a nice

37
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,479
conversation with the authors which are

38
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,520
we're just really appreciative that

39
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,320
they've joined

40
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,920
so we're gonna just go to the

41
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,600
introductions and warm up

42
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,600
and then we will just be able to jump

43
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,040
around and see where

44
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,880
the conversation takes us so i'm daniel

45
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,600
and i'm in california i will pass it to

46
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,000
shannon

47
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,320
hey i'm shannon i'm usually in

48
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,240
california but i'm in south dakota since

49
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,520
the pandemic

50
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,640
are we going straight into warm-up

51
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,320
questions or just names in around the

52
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,560
room you can say hello or give a warm-up

53
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,759
thought

54
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,799
okay um yeah so i'm excited today

55
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,560
i'm excited to

56
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,360
explore whether or not we can use markov

57
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,919
blankets to describe

58
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,000
groups of people and social dynamics

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,599
and i tried to do this in a project

60
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,680
before and abandoned it pretty quickly

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,160
and reading this paper i think if i had

62
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,840
taken the pearl blanket formulation

63
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,200
which i'm sure we'll get into talking

64
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,000
about later

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,599
it would have been a lot more helpful so

66
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,319
i'm excited to discuss that today

67
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:37,280
um i'll pass that to steven

68
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,720
hello steven steven here i'm in toronto

69
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,920
and um it's nice to be here and thanks a

70
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,280
lot for this paper because i think it's

71
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,400
going to be really interesting to have

72
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,760
all these bits of the jigsaw

73
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,000
put together and i'm actually quite

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,840
interested in the paper because

75
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,640
i'm trying to work out when to use the

76
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,879
concepts of like the markov blanket to

77
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:57,519
help

78
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,000
describe processes and when just to

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,920
maybe talk about hidden states

80
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,239
and not focus so much on the the blanket

81
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,120
part so

82
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,800
that's quite useful for me and i will

83
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,040
pass it over to dave

84
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,879
i'm dave i am in baguio city oh

85
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,000
120 miles north of manila it's the

86
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,760
blazing summer time

87
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,519
we're a mile high city so it might get

88
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,200
as high as 80 degrees

89
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,640
fahrenheit i'm retired from information

90
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,720
technology and my background is in the

91
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,959
cybernetics of learning and teaching

92
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,040
great and we have two authors here

93
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,680
so maybe first we'll go to chris and

94
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,400
then yela

95
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,640
and just feel free to introduce yourself

96
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,080
the project the collaboration

97
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,599
however you'd like thank you so

98
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,280
thanks a lot for inviting us i'm

99
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,840
christolega i'm currently a postdoc

100
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,080
at the rural universitat in bochum

101
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,439
germany

102
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,799
i'm joining from berlin though and

103
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,599
i'm currently working on a research

104
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,879
grant

105
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,879
on bayesian cognition and

106
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,599
and the conspiracy theories i'm

107
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,400
specifically

108
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,959
interested in how proponents of

109
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,639
conspiracy theories

110
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,519
discount new evidence that contradicts

111
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,839
their beliefs

112
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,880
and this paper from my perspective grew

113
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,840
out of a

114
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,960
really long i guess friendship with

115
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,240
yellow we can

116
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,440
say that we've met a long time ago

117
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,680
at a conference in the netherlands in

118
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,160
2014 i believe on bayesian cognition

119
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,440
and we were both fascinated by this new

120
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,759
uh theory framework of predictive

121
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,199
processing

122
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,360
and i remember that already there there

123
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,360
was a seed of some kind of

124
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,680
doubt in me or or kind of a worry

125
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,040
planted because

126
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,040
it was a it was a conference on

127
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,040
probabilistic approaches to cognition

128
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,720
everyone there was supposed to be a

129
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,960
bayesian in one way or another

130
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,560
and suddenly it turned out that

131
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,800
basically no one agrees with

132
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,199
each other and everyone uses the terms

133
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,880
in a different way and i feel like

134
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,720
this paper is in a way um

135
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,120
contextualizing that experience for for

136
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,759
us

137
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,240
but yeah sorry i'll let yella speak now

138
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,440
okay uh great samuel abraham

139
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,919
um i work at macquarie university in

140
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:28,479
sydney

141
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,479
but then also due to pandemic reasons

142
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,000
located in amsterdam

143
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,039
uh the netherlands um

144
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,680
and so my my new research project is on

145
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,000
the philosophical foundations of the

146
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,800
attention economy but my phd was really

147
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,280
in

148
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,639
in uh in on a free energy principle

149
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,080
and an embodied cognition um

150
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,240
and indeed this this paper grew

151
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,960
out of a group of people who are or

152
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,479
colleagues and friends and and

153
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,160
and acquainted with each other's work

154
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,000
all roughly on

155
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,479
on predictive processing and and free

156
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,919
energy principle and active inference

157
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,440
but from slightly different

158
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,120
uh uh directions uh and i think it was

159
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,680
sparked by kind of combination of

160
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,360
fmsa kind of curiosity and skepticism

161
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,120
about some of the developments that

162
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,639
that were that were happening and have

163
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,560
been happening already since a long time

164
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,360
since since i guess 2013 or 14

165
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,720
when some of these papers originally

166
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,280
came out and kind of slowly got taken up

167
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,000
in more and more heavy philosophical

168
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,639
projects

169
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,160
and i think the more and more we read

170
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,240
those papers the more and more we grew

171
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,479
interested and and skeptical at the same

172
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,440
time

173
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,840
and uh this was really a project to try

174
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,199
to finally kind of

175
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,560
uh uh nail down what what was bugging us

176
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,639
and and how perhaps how it might be

177
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,680
salvaged or

178
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,720
or or what to do um

179
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,120
so i'm happy this is now pre-printed i'm

180
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,039
very happy we get to discuss this i was

181
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:57,840
this morning

182
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,599
doing the dishes and on my headphones

183
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,080
listening to your exposition of of my

184
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,520
paper

185
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,800
and that was just a very great and

186
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
mind-blowing uh

187
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,479
experience where somebody explicated

188
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,720
those ideas and not being one of the

189
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,080
artists i think that's that's on the

190
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,400
other

191
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,080
all of us that's that's just fantastic

192
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,840
to to have happen

193
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,080
i think actually there is a third author

194
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,199
latent uh

195
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,840
there um so i'll try to pass on the

196
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,759
baton to manuel and see if he does

197
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,880
anything or responds

198
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,160
otherwise we discontinue well hello

199
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,800
everyone

200
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,360
uh i'm just here trying to look around

201
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,400
for a little bit

202
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,160
it's uh past 11 p.m in tokyo

203
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,919
where i'm right now so yeah i'll try to

204
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,960
you know stay um along for a bit but

205
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,080
yeah clearly i'll leave the other two

206
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,560
guys

207
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,479
like who are much fresher than me right

208
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,720
now to to lead the discussion

209
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,280
um as for me i i have more of a

210
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,199
background i guess in

211
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,160
computer science some maths here and

212
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,560
there

213
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,840
now i'm doing some work on

214
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,199
control theory and estimation

215
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,240
theory applied to neuroscience

216
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,960
a lot of methods uh probably right now

217
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,440
and

218
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,680
which is the main reason i guess i

219
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,199
started working on

220
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,000
active inference and related ideas and

221
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,720
yeah as

222
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,199
the other two guys have already um said

223
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,560
you know this paper

224
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,280
was kind of born out of you know around

225
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,039
our own curiosity

226
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,719
and you know questions regarding like

227
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:33,120
what

228
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,839
the framework actually does and what it

229
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,479
can do and what it cannot do

230
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,958
so you know then i'll leave yellow to

231
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:41,599
you know

232
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,440
leave the discussion from here on

233
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,760
awesome thanks everyone for joining it's

234
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,560
great to have

235
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,519
just the authors and and kind of read

236
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,720
between the citations

237
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,959
and then actually enliven between the

238
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,800
citations so that we can ask questions

239
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,519
that were maybe

240
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,000
alluded to and hear your fresh

241
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,600
perspectives what kind of feedback

242
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,120
you've gotten on the paper

243
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,000
etc so yeah yeah where would you like to

244
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,519
start otherwise there's just a bunch of

245
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,760
places we can jump in

246
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,040
great um i'll just briefly

247
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,080
uh give some introductory uh uh comments

248
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,240
uh uh i'll keep it brief because i think

249
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,480
we're all roughly on the same

250
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,080
page having read the paper um

251
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,040
so as i was saying uh this this project

252
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,399
got

253
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,959
started out from a combination of

254
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,880
curiosity and skepticism about the

255
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,519
some new applications of active

256
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,320
inference

257
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,279
and free energy principle and so i think

258
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,800
as i understood it before

259
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,120
it's it was a kind of functional lens to

260
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,200
try to understand cognitive systems

261
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,959
and in that sense offering a kind of

262
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,720
unifying perspective and also it's a

263
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,160
different cognitive constructs in the

264
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,600
cognitive sciences

265
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,720
and i was already kind of very

266
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,040
interested in that and what we've

267
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,040
what what we've seen in the in in the

268
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,560
last few years i think

269
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,720
are one applications or at least

270
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,760
attempts to apply it to kind of

271
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,200
the harder questions so the hard

272
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,200
question of consciousness intentionality

273
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,760
etc which is more than this kind of

274
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,519
functional lens

275
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,760
an application to systems that are not

276
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,040
necessarily cognitive

277
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,320
so living systems as a whole

278
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,720
or even like a global global systems or

279
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,600
social systems

280
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,519
and then as well using this terminology

281
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,320
not only

282
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,680
to as a functional lens to to understand

283
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,440
systems that you already deem cognitive

284
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,480
but also

285
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,800
to use those tools themselves to do

286
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
democratic work

287
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,839
uh so to decide what is

288
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,600
a living or another living system what

289
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,200
is a cognitive or another cognitive

290
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,720
system so to somehow

291
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,480
employ those tools of active influence

292
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,240
onto these kind of questions

293
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,200
um and i think we were yeah we were all

294
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,040
interested in in in in a set of

295
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,680
questions

296
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,560
and and seeing how that would uh uh uh

297
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,120
um

298
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,160
how that could work and whether those

299
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,040
arguments really

300
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,079
uh really hold um

301
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,600
and i think to do that we needed to have

302
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,200
a combination of

303
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,800
uh one conceptual arguments uh two

304
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,360
formal

305
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,240
arguments and three philosophical uh uh

306
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,440
analysis and and

307
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,000
kind of combine those in the same paper

308
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,519
and i think that makes it also

309
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,440
made it a very challenging paper to to

310
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,120
to write to see how all these different

311
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,560
parts of the paper fit

312
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,320
together and and perhaps it's also made

313
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,000
it a challenging paper to to read but

314
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,720
we'll probably get to that in

315
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,760
a moment um and there's i mean there's

316
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,240
something

317
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,760
here i think that that kind of blocks

318
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,360
the whole uh uh

319
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,240
field uh some of us were on just uh a

320
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,240
few hours ago on social media and there

321
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,920
there's a new paper

322
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,440
uh now uh among others by decoding polo

323
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:53,760
and

324
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,120
evan thompson randall beer and

325
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,639
i think one of the more meta discussions

326
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,720
was was like how much mathematics how

327
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,680
much conceptual

328
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,200
work do you need to actually contribute

329
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,480
to the more conceptual

330
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,360
uh questions you want to to ask and i

331
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,399
think that this is something that's

332
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,920
intrinsically intentioned here

333
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,000
within the literature that you kind of

334
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,200
need to have a very technical

335
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,920
understanding

336
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,320
to to have to watch this question in the

337
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,519
first place but then

338
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,720
if you do that perhaps you lose out on

339
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,480
the more conceptual issues or you you

340
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,360
lose out

341
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,360
also part of your readership because

342
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,200
it's it's it's only a few people that

343
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,720
understand it so there's something

344
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,079
exciting there about fep as a whole

345
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:39,200
and i think we tried at least to be um

346
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,440
as accessible as possible in in writing

347
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,040
this paper while at the same time

348
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,760
supporting our arguments with with with

349
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,240
with

350
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,079
the formalism that we thought were were

351
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,920
necessary and that

352
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,240
uh ultimately brought us to to writing

353
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,480
this

354
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,959
and the thing

355
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,839
in in the moment we have a lot of

356
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,560
pre-prints that came out in the last

357
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,600
few months all kind of trying to target

358
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,639
and trying to to

359
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,480
to to to to criticize these these

360
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,480
developments in any principle

361
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,320
so i think some of you some of them

362
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,600
you've discussed here already

363
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,839
so from mel anderson papers thomas

364
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,760
as a good paper on this as well along

365
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,800
with the thompson paper

366
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,639
so i'm really curious to see how in the

367
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,240
next few months

368
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,360
half years say this this debate will uh

369
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:35,839
will

370
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,279
will will point out i think there's a

371
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,639
number of really interesting kind of

372
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,600
proposals now

373
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,279
and uh yeah also um

374
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,360
keep checking this uh this lab to

375
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,959
to see how you treat those other papers

376
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,239
i'm really looking forward to that

377
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,040
cool um very interesting blue do you

378
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,399
want to just

379
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,240
say hi give any introductory thoughts if

380
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,880
you'd like sure good morning

381
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,720
i'm blue knight i'm an independent

382
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,440
research consultant from new mexico and

383
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,000
i really enjoyed this paper um i don't

384
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,199
know if you got to see like our

385
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,880
contextualization video but

386
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,040
it was really good

387
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,680
cool so i'll be kind of taking some

388
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,000
notes everybody can also jump into the

389
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,920
document and that was a big question

390
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,160
that you raised there yellow um how much

391
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,959
mathematics is required to understand or

392
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:29,600
work with

393
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,959
free energy principle and active

394
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,800
inference and then which

395
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,880
are the sort of skeletal elements and

396
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,199
the sinews so to speak of the math

397
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,680
and then which parts might be secondary

398
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,839
or not

399
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,560
up

400
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,160
for some reason there might be a few

401
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,000
seconds of uh of uh

402
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,560
just flipping but yes sorry just yeah

403
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,600
what um

404
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,199
elements of the math are required to

405
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,639
understand and work with

406
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,440
these topics and then of course the

407
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,399
major

408
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,399
question of your paper and some of these

409
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,800
other recent papers we've discussed is

410
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,880
whatever the mathematics are what kinds

411
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,199
of philosophical or metaphysical

412
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,839
claims can we reach validly or or

413
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,880
invalidly um

414
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,079
yeah any other big questions or thoughts

415
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,360
people can just raise their

416
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,399
hand with a little bottom left icon so

417
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,120
yeah we'll do

418
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,399
steven and then blue

419
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,040
yeah just one thing building on the bit

420
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,440
what daniel said there is

421
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,160
active inference in biological systems

422
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,120
could be present

423
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,519
as a way for life to

424
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,320
function and evolve but there's also

425
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,680
possibilities that

426
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,680
the active influence process could

427
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,320
create structures or networks

428
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,120
which then form other systems which may

429
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,000
not have to be

430
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,680
so based on ergodicity in the same way

431
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,440
it might be like you have the skeletal

432
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,399
system

433
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,519
which gives you locomotion so i suppose

434
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,240
in some ways

435
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,360
i'd be interested in that way that

436
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,199
you know we're not tied to everything

437
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,240
being active inference in terms of how

438
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,040
we can

439
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,680
understand its applications even though

440
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,720
maybe at the core

441
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,240
it has to be there at some level

442
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,199
cool thanks anyone can give a thought on

443
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,160
that or blue

444
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,600
go for it so

445
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,120
um just to kind of yeah to i don't know

446
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,800
so stephen what you just said like

447
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,160
active inference is

448
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,399
present in biological systems i think

449
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,160
you know we need to be careful before we

450
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,880
pick a side

451
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,360
over instrumentalism versus realism like

452
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,199
is active inference present in a living

453
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,000
system

454
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,279
maybe not maybe it's just the way that

455
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,199
we use to represent a living system or

456
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,880
to model a living system or

457
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,680
like our best guess so far right i mean

458
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,440
i think that the way that the science

459
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,000
evolves

460
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,680
um you know in terms of how we think

461
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,279
about biological systems processing

462
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,320
information

463
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
will you know i mean active inference is

464
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,759
what we have now but it probably won't

465
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,120
be what we have in 100 years

466
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,760
if we survive 100 years but but my

467
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,640
question was

468
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,319
uh you know in reading the paper i

469
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,760
really it was brought to my attention

470
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,119
and and steven's question

471
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,559
so perfectly illustrates this so so to

472
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,799
there's a great degree of semantics

473
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,079
that's involved

474
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,319
um and our choice of language i think

475
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,359
really shapes

476
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,039
how we um perceive the intentions of

477
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,079
others

478
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,760
so it's just is that is that the caution

479
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,520
or is that the tale or is that the

480
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,320
cd underbelly of the paper or to what

481
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,080
role do you really think that language

482
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,440
a lot of these things could be fixed

483
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,000
with language

484
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,880
yes cool yellow you want to go for it

485
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,679
and then shannon is your hand

486
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,360
great so i'll um in the those are two

487
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,480
two great questions um and just to to

488
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,080
clarify the the last one

489
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,480
um when you say uh language do you mean

490
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,440
the kind of

491
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,559
concepts that we are uh using

492
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,080
or language as a whole as a system

493
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,400
so i i mean like how steven just said

494
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,360
you know

495
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,000
systems have active inference like it's

496
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
just like systems have active inference

497
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,320
like

498
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,480
i have a heart and a kidney and a liver

499
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,000
but i don't know that i necessarily have

500
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,080
active inference right so it's just our

501
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,360
choice of of language

502
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,919
in in that so not language as a whole

503
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,200
but but language like

504
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,760
carefully selected word choice could

505
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,520
maybe prevent a lot of the

506
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,039
the conflict um

507
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,960
yeah i i i think so and then i guess

508
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,720
generally you you might think that lots

509
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,799
of philosophy is actually a kind of

510
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,919
a linguistic therapy right

511
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,919
you're just trying to very be very

512
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,679
concise and using the right kind of

513
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,440
terminology so that you don't

514
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,240
slip into confusions that that then will

515
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,000
cloud your thinking also

516
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,480
uh so i think there's definitely some of

517
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,200
that on

518
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,919
the on on the background in the in in

519
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,200
this paper

520
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,400
um but it's it's it's not only a

521
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,880
language right there's also the the the

522
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,760
formal models

523
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,559
uh and and how to interpret those those

524
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,320
those formal models

525
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,440
um and there

526
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,120
in in the translation between the

527
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,559
technical use

528
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,799
uh um of of of this terminology

529
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,960
and the kind of everyday intuitions it

530
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
gives us i think there is in this room

531
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,960
for a lot of mistakes and slippage i

532
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,720
mean the notion of blanket is one right

533
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,280
i mean

534
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,600
i have a blanket on my bed and that has

535
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,760
that has a spatial dimension and so and

536
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,559
you can be either

537
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,520
on top of it or below it etc and and so

538
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,280
when you then use the notion of a markov

539
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,280
blanket this is the first intuition that

540
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,559
people will will

541
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,200
have uh and it turns out that actually

542
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,600
no

543
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,760
these kind of things don't have such a

544
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,120
kind of existence right they don't they

545
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,480
actually they don't they're not really

546
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,200
spatial

547
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,720
things in the world they're they are

548
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,120
just aspects of mathematical model

549
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,720
and so indeed in in kind of there the

550
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,160
language is one but also just a

551
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,000
particular way in which you understand

552
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,760
your concepts either as everyday things

553
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,360
or as technical things i think that

554
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,080
there's a lot of those slippages there

555
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,960
and i guess

556
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,480
the whole literature is full with

557
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,320
notions of model of

558
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,360
inference and and then it's very unclear

559
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,559
whether something is a

560
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,159
inference it's a technical notion or

561
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,799
inference as a philosophy of mind notion

562
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,480
or inference is something else

563
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,960
um so yeah there there are a lot of

564
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,240
those those

565
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,360
those uh things in the background

566
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,600
and i think that that also uh points to

567
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,039
the question that stephen was

568
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,320
asking uh in terms of like we can think

569
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,039
about

570
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,120
the structures for locomotion and so

571
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,960
like how does this relate to to active

572
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,000
inference

573
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,400
um and so this is this is i guess this

574
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,000
is i mean perhaps this is a topic that's

575
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,280
not really there in

576
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,240
in in in in this paper uh so much but

577
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,120
there there's a

578
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,799
huge literature in active influence on

579
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,640
how to understand the notion of model

580
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,720
and whether agents are models of the

581
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,760
environment

582
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,320
and one way to see that is is thinking

583
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,679
like well there is an

584
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,640
an and an echo niche around this and we

585
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,039
have

586
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,960
through selection that might not might

587
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,240
not be uh

588
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,919
understood for active inference have

589
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,559
been equipped with a particular kind of

590
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,240
neural system particular kind of body

591
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,080
that allows us to to engage with it with

592
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,000
that environment and in that sense kind

593
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,480
of

594
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,720
things like the the the structures that

595
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,640
facilitate locomotion could be just as

596
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,200
part

597
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,360
just just as well be part of that model

598
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,960
but then model in a very different sense

599
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,240
as it's typically used in cooking

600
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,360
designs

601
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,280
um yeah so so that that's also that

602
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,559
that's very much how you understand

603
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,559
model uh uh

604
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,039
really um shapes how you will answer

605
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,559
these kind of questions about how active

606
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,559
inference and locomotion also

607
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,080
relate to each other thanks for that

608
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,159
and um it's almost like the word

609
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,280
semantic

610
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,760
ironically carries a double meaning

611
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,120
because people will dismiss

612
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,720
a discussion well that's a semantic

613
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,280
discussion on one sense they mean you're

614
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,120
talking about words words words like

615
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,720
you're kind of just saying random stuff

616
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,000
we're debating about a word we're

617
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,960
talking about the same thing it's

618
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,640
semantic it's only semantic

619
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,360
but semantics are meaning and so i i

620
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,080
think i've

621
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,679
blipped out or maybe for some people for

622
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,679
a second but it's just so funny how

623
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,080
semantic refers to both the big sense of

624
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,039
meaning

625
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,440
and the small sense of the word and

626
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,520
we're all reducing our uncertainty

627
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,440
by actually going into the details what

628
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,440
is the markov versus the pearl versus

629
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,400
the fristen

630
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,480
blanket and can we just have a common

631
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,440
reference point

632
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,280
so that when somebody says i'm using

633
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,280
frist and blanket in the sense of this

634
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,159
paper

635
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,880
then it will preempt some of these

636
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,000
broader

637
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,520
valid or sort of spurious questions

638
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,080
so cool shannon and then anyone else who

639
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,639
raises their hand

640
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,559
yeah so i'll try to make this comment

641
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,400
without too much

642
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,159
rambling um but we talked with

643
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,159
with mel um andrews with an s um

644
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,880
hippolyta and thomas venice and we've

645
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,440
been

646
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,039
discussing like on what level the

647
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,480
system implements active inference or

648
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,000
is um has markov blankets

649
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,360
in the system versus when it's useful

650
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,200
for us to describe it that way so that

651
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:13,919
realism

652
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,559
versus instrumental debate and

653
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,360
something that was came up in the

654
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,880
conversation with an s something that's

655
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,679
easy for me

656
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,520
is to claim that there is no markov

657
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,000
blanket necessarily in a group of people

658
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,360
that are interacting

659
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,360
if we look at clusters of fans in a

660
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,600
stadium i might as a researcher identify

661
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,200
this cluster of fans because they're

662
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,480
interacting in a certain way with each

663
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,840
other that's different from this other

664
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,039
cluster of fans

665
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,200
and some game event happens and that

666
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,559
ends up being some sort of coupling

667
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:43,520
parameter

668
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,960
and now we can describe this as one um

669
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,240
unified system one unified cluster of

670
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,760
fans of people um and i am pretty happy

671
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,600
with saying that there is not a

672
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,159
real boundary in the world between group

673
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:58,720
a

674
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,919
group b or that emerges over um the

675
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,880
larger group c but

676
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,400
i really want to say that that happens

677
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,159
in the brain

678
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,799
and i really want to say that our like

679
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,200
the neurons in our brains are

680
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,840
interpreting the world as if there are

681
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,200
boundaries and that's forming boundaries

682
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,960
on neural processes

683
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,000
um like there's this specific people are

684
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,520
talking about manifolds a lot lately and

685
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,120
there's this similar

686
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,919
um fuzziness and what it means to be a

687
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,200
neural manifold but like there's a

688
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,400
certain

689
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,000
manifold that's associated with

690
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,480
observing this feature of the world

691
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,080
and i wonder if you have any

692
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,279
intuitions from this distinction

693
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,320
can we can we be realist about

694
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,679
markov blankets or the fringe principle

695
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,440
or active inference as applied to

696
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,799
neural states i mean that's where these

697
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,880
theories started while being

698
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,080
anti-realist about

699
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,600
applying these two dynamics in the world

700
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,480
like groups of people

701
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,799
great question also um just a technical

702
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,880
note like i'm not sure what's happening

703
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,400
with the active inference youtube or

704
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,520
jitsi or whatever

705
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,960
but clearly my internet is working

706
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,799
because we're having the video call

707
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,159
but the stream glitched so we can just

708
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:19,760
continue not on live stream and then

709
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,360
i'll just re-upload the full

710
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,960
quality and it won't have any glitches

711
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,960
so i'll figure it out for next week but

712
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,960
it's all good it won't be um

713
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,720
fully live but we can just still think

714
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,559
of it the same way which is the vast

715
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,520
majority of people

716
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,039
viewing it anyway so yeah sorry about

717
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,799
that i'll figure it out for next time

718
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,440
but um thanks shannon for the question

719
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,919
about the groups so

720
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,679
anyone want to speak to the group

721
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:42,960
question

722
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,279
and about whether groups can be properly

723
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,080
said to be

724
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,279
having or uh modeled by these blankets

725
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,240
or where where

726
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,480
is that

727
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,000
sorry david you so i mean daniel you you

728
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,039
glitched for a second

729
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,240
and uh yeah in the meanwhile yell asked

730
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,440
if i want to answer the group

731
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,279
question and i think i would actually i

732
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,200
have some thoughts about this so

733
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,520
i think one important thing about the

734
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,799
free energy

735
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,120
framework that especially how it's been

736
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,880
developed recently

737
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,159
is that people often like

738
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,279
people infristance closed circle like

739
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,880
ines hippolyta for example

740
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,799
has caused the paper recently with him

741
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,480
about markov blankets

742
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,559
in which they talk about viewing

743
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,799
different systems as agents

744
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,799
so so they talk about a neuron as an

745
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,480
agent right they talk about the whole

746
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,159
organism as an agent

747
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,039
and and it kind of scaffolds across

748
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,320
multiple

749
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,919
time scales and and

750
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,960
spatial scales and i think

751
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,400
our paper leaves it open to some extent

752
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,480
leaves the question open whether there

753
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,880
is some kind of scale

754
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,360
on which if we fix the parameters of the

755
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,080
model

756
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,080
the models can be validated and they can

757
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,799
produce new predictions or new

758
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,159
new empirical findings in such a way

759
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,159
where we would be

760
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,480
forced to accept that perhaps on that

761
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,320
particular scale there really

762
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,360
are blankets in the fristen sense or

763
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:15,760
like

764
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,640
at least that these models are so good

765
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:18,960
at

766
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,240
predicting certain events or findings or

767
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,960
phenomena

768
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,840
on a given scale that we would be

769
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,440
inclined to give them a realist

770
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,200
interpretation so i think this is still

771
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,559
on the table and it's very much

772
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,399
open it's just that given the

773
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,480
ambitions and the scope of the free

774
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,320
energy framework

775
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,200
uh and the fact that they start with

776
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,720
this assumption of viewing

777
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,960
different systems on different scales as

778
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,000
agents

779
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,279
right now it's just not really clear

780
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,799
um which level so to speak

781
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,279
the this this way of framing phenomena

782
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,360
would be validated in a realist context

783
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,960
great um really what warrants

784
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,960
or what license is what evidence would

785
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,360
we need for realist interpretations

786
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,520
and it's not even just a yes no because

787
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,480
there's kind of a few

788
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,399
kinds of realism as you pointed out like

789
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,039
there's different notions of boundary

790
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,080
and so a group might be very well said

791
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,679
to have an informational boundary

792
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,360
like this jitsi people who are not in

793
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,200
the jitsi are not part of this

794
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,720
informational boundary

795
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,320
but then in some other sense the group

796
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,559
may not fall so neatly under the

797
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,679
definition of

798
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,880
a realist interpretation of a blanket um

799
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,279
manuel

800
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,000
yeah so uh i was a bit slow i guess

801
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,360
after

802
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,240
stephen and blue actually asked um a

803
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,320
couple of questions earlier so i'm

804
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,159
briefly gonna go back to that and then

805
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,520
try to

806
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,760
reconnect to what shannon uh was

807
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,279
actually talking about

808
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,640
so um as for

809
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,840
i guess the the loose sense in which we

810
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,600
might want to interpret

811
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,080
active inference i think there is i

812
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,279
don't know

813
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,399
relatively low risk in just

814
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,200
i don't know waving our hands and saying

815
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,640
the systems

816
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,440
do some sort of active inference as long

817
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,000
as

818
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,360
we know we keep it loose losing such a

819
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,320
way that

820
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,000
in my opinion you might just lose

821
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,399
entirely like any meaning

822
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,000
we're just saying well you know there's

823
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,480
some active inference happening there in

824
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,720
the same sense that there is some

825
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,200
active inference happening in i don't

826
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,760
know

827
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,840
planets orbiting around stars or

828
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,080
galaxies uh

829
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,559
having some particular physical behavior

830
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:43,279
and

831
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,200
and so we might end up just not having

832
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,559
anything to say

833
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,600
it's safe but it's also not very

834
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,880
useful in a sense so in that direction i

835
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,399
think that our work

836
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,760
is trying to you know

837
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,240
uh go in the direction where we want to

838
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,159
say what active inference is

839
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,360
not in a way it is important to say well

840
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,760
you know this is what it is right now

841
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,240
and this is what it cannot be and if you

842
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,360
want it to be something else well you

843
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,679
you have to tell me exactly what else

844
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,120
you need

845
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,039
for that thing to even work to begin

846
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,440
with and then related to that there's

847
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,159
also

848
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,120
um so i think i might have heard this

849
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:25,600
from

850
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,080
alex shuntz before and i don't know who

851
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,919
else before him might have mentioned

852
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:30,720
this

853
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,200
um the idea of say an active inference

854
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,399
coming from the

855
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,799
i don't know highway and an active

856
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,840
inference coming from a more normal

857
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,880
if we can call it like that path the

858
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,440
highway is what fristen has been trying

859
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,640
to do more recently

860
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,200
you know starting from first principles

861
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,679
as he claims like from the physics

862
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,000
of you know langevin equations and you

863
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,320
know stochastic systems

864
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,600
and then trying to say derive notions

865
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,240
that are

866
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,840
already established in non-equilibrium

867
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,000
physics

868
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,200
and from there get all the way to say a

869
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,640
definition of what agents

870
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,840
might be there is also say the

871
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,919
the i don't know the normal way which i

872
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:14,960
think is what uh

873
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,159
shannon alluded to um you know at some

874
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:19,279
point because you know

875
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,799
this active inference theory was

876
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:23,279
originally brought out in neuroscience

877
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,240
with no ambition to be a first principle

878
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,559
theory starting from you know

879
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,399
uh launch of integrations that might

880
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,159
describe any physical system

881
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,320
in this universe it was just supposed to

882
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,960
be some sort of helpful framework

883
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,799
that in some way was going to generalize

884
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,399
reinforcement learning

885
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,200
which is an absolutely fair i guess uh

886
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,399
goal and ambition

887
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,640
but has also nothing to do with all of

888
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,840
the physics

889
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,320
that is more recently being plugged into

890
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,679
active inference

891
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,799
and one could safely go say the the

892
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,679
second route and just forget about all

893
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,039
the physics it might

894
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,480
leave it i don't know to a different um

895
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,399
i don't know to a different status but

896
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:05,600
it would still be

897
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,159
potentially useful and it would still be

898
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,039
something that we might look forward to

899
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,799
and that i guess lead me to

900
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,080
um leads me to um something that shannon

901
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,039
was mentioning about

902
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,399
manifolds and in some sense

903
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,960
um you know the the question about you

904
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,080
know are markov

905
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,519
blankets real or not is similar to

906
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,559
yes are manifolds real or not

907
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:36,159
um and here you know i don't want to say

908
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,640
um i'm not really sure you know how to

909
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,519
to go about this in in the same way that

910
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:44,240
i don't know

911
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,799
physicists generally don't think too

912
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:47,519
much about

913
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,600
well you know is this energy landscape

914
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,039
real or not

915
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,640
is my you know is my ball actually

916
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,039
trying to fall to the ground or is it

917
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:57,840
just

918
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,559
well you know it is a good metaphor it

919
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:01,840
works really well

920
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,240
we tend to use some you know a genitive

921
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,519
language in there

922
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,679
but i guess that if you hard press a

923
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:08,799
physicist you will

924
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,200
probably hardly get an answer about you

925
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,360
know oh is this energy escape

926
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,240
like real is there any an energy scape

927
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,519
inside the ball

928
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,519
that the ball is using to actually roll

929
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,360
down the hill

930
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,640
well probably no it is the kind of

931
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,679
question that you know

932
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,440
well i will still be using lagrange

933
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,279
mechanics i will still be using

934
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,559
emiletonia mechanics but i will not be

935
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,360
you know opening up a ball looking for

936
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,440
the energy landscape there

937
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,039
in the same way i will still be using

938
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,279
manifolds well personally because you

939
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,840
know population codes are

940
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,640
revealing like to to be pretty useful in

941
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,840
neuroscience

942
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,080
but i will not say like start looking

943
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,760
inside the brain like well where's the

944
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,039
manifold there

945
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,840
if that makes sense

946
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,720
yes totally makes sense and real and

947
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,840
useful

948
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,600
when they're aligned people celebrate

949
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,039
and when they're not aligned there's

950
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,880
often another story

951
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,800
why something is still really useful

952
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,639
even though it's just a useful

953
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,719
fiction or something like that and i

954
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,679
think that

955
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,480
um vector alignment is really what we

956
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,079
want to nuance we want to have like an

957
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,918
hour hand and a second hand in a minute

958
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,599
hand we want to be clear

959
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,918
where are we just specifying a partially

960
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:24,960
observable

961
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,918
markov decision process and fitting data

962
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,199
and then where are we in the

963
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,639
interpretive

964
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,199
frame and where are we in a metaphysical

965
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,960
frame even beyond the um

966
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,000
interpretive steven and then anyone else

967
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,639
raising their hand

968
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,040
i think as well as where we say if it's

969
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,520
real or not there's the sense of

970
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,359
at what scales and i like the fact that

971
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:50,719
you talked about scales is

972
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:54,239
what scales um and at those scales how

973
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,679
much plausibility

974
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,040
is there for certain types of inference

975
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,560
processes to be possible

976
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,079
i suppose that's where you know if

977
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,079
there's no ergodicity present

978
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,400
or seems to be very little at certain

979
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,839
scales then maybe

980
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,119
it's less likely that that mechanism is

981
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,119
an active inference mechanism although

982
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,800
there may be some elements of it

983
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,960
so i think that that also changes the

984
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,640
way that the realist

985
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,560
aspect could be brought in it's like how

986
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,640
much could it be a blanket

987
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,760
aspect or maybe like you say that

988
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,800
other scales unlike say a single cell

989
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,079
which is diffusing

990
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,119
chemicals over a membrane and there'd be

991
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,040
some weak mixing process going on

992
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,440
there's

993
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,040
some um yeah there's some ways that

994
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,440
variation or expected free energy

995
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,200
are not the only mechanisms

996
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,920
even suggesting that it's a mechanism is

997
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,839
something that's mechanical

998
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,200
it's these are what we want to

999
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,920
understand and these are the discussions

1000
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,960
and then are they equivalent and do

1001
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,880
mechanisms have to be real things

1002
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,480
or can a mechanism be something that

1003
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,240
doesn't exist in the world

1004
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,560
or a conceptual mechanism or could it be

1005
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,680
just a pattern

1006
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,920
that doesn't exist in one measurable

1007
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,520
thing we can put on a scale

1008
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,119
like a machine um so cool questions

1009
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,880
dave and then anyone else raising their

1010
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,800
hands

1011
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,560
okay uh sometimes the math

1012
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,320
is trusted too far and it's allowed to

1013
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:24,800
do

1014
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,800
a whole lot of work but sometimes the

1015
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,720
math gets crippled

1016
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,960
now i'm a student of gordon pasque and

1017
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,240
cyclicity

1018
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,839
and um self-stabilizing feedback is

1019
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,599
really critical to everything he did in

1020
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,480
learning theory and biology

1021
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,839
system science and what's the very first

1022
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,760
thing you do when you mention

1023
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,920
markov processes you stomp out the

1024
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,160
cycles you rip out those cycles you're

1025
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,240
just not allowed to have loops

1026
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,640
in a markov network well then they come

1027
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,920
back in because that's what people are

1028
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,160
looking for they're looking for

1029
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,560
self-stabilization

1030
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,800
and using the environment and the

1031
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,280
environment using you to enrich itself

1032
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:03,839
and

1033
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,680
and then as you point out at the end of

1034
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,960
your paper well then

1035
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,240
dr fristin finds there's cycles in there

1036
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,760
and then he goes and rips them out all

1037
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,040
over again

1038
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,440
what has anybody ever just left the

1039
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,320
cycles in

1040
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,839
come up with a formalism that's richer

1041
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:20,880
than

1042
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,000
a markovian tree

1043
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,200
and then see if maybe things get easier

1044
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,839
and simpler

1045
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,000
great question dave and i think

1046
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,720
the big question is what are the inputs

1047
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,760
what do we want to get

1048
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,079
out of this math are we looking to make

1049
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:40,960
analytical

1050
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,000
claims or are we looking to have uh very

1051
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,880
general

1052
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,839
frameworks for control theory um or for

1053
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:48,560
estimation

1054
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,480
theory even like manuel mentioned so

1055
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,560
anyone can raise their hand but um chris

1056
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,040
uh thanks so i just wanted to follow up

1057
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,760
on the

1058
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,520
last two questions but i see that

1059
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,440
there's already a theme emerging in a

1060
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,560
way

1061
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,280
so one thing is about the maths and you

1062
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,760
know

1063
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,200
already the question that was posed at

1064
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,040
the beginning how much

1065
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,440
the understanding of maths informs

1066
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,440
research that people can do into the

1067
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,720
predictive processing

1068
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,079
framework and i think and now we return

1069
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,839
to this question in a way

1070
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,320
with this question of of cycles and the

1071
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,000
fact that we actually

1072
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,480
analyze you know we leave the cycles out

1073
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,440
and i think it's

1074
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,480
in some ways useful to think about

1075
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,280
our paper in many ways and and what's

1076
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,119
happening with the free energy

1077
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,599
framework as a kind of a pyramid where

1078
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,680
you know formalisms mathematical

1079
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,520
formalisms are stacked

1080
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,240
one on another and finally the free

1081
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,440
energy principle really

1082
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,760
lies at the top and what we've been

1083
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,839
trying to do in some ways is to

1084
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,320
lead our readers you know through the

1085
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,119
steps

1086
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,920
going up to the free energy principle

1087
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,400
and like

1088
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,200
how it's supposed to work but the thing

1089
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,400
is that of course there are

1090
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,240
many different ways to get there so you

1091
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,839
know someone might have

1092
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,000
like you you can think about the cycles

1093
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,440
like the the

1094
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,160
the topological method that we took with

1095
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:14,640
with

1096
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,839
directed uh graphs and

1097
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,680
the the the way of thinking about

1098
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,200
dynamical

1099
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,200
coupled systems and loops and stuff like

1100
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,800
that you can think about this as

1101
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,480
different slopes of the same pyramid

1102
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,119
right

1103
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,280
in the end the point is to that you want

1104
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,760
to get to the free energy principle

1105
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,640
exactly you want to get to the free

1106
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,400
energy principle

1107
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,040
and the free energy principle lies on

1108
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:39,680
top of

1109
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,079
a lot of work done in many different

1110
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,880
formal fields

1111
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,320
and i think that i think that the the

1112
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:48,880
the last

1113
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,440
question asked by dave pointing to the

1114
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,359
possibility that perhaps

1115
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,079
if we leave the question of directed the

1116
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,480
cyclical graphs aside and just focus

1117
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,839
on cyclical systems perhaps we could

1118
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,200
arrive at a new con

1119
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,920
formal construct that could later turn

1120
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,800
out to be

1121
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,000
somewhat equivalent to to a mark

1122
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,040
of blankets but wouldn't be so easily

1123
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,800
conflated with mark of blankets i think

1124
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,200
that's a very interesting possibility

1125
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,359
uh that probably should be explored in

1126
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:20,560
the literature

1127
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,480
um and the other thing i wanted to just

1128
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,280
address very briefly is the fact that

1129
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,640
the other theme that seems to be

1130
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,319
emerging here in the discussion is this

1131
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:29,280
theme of

1132
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,520
patterns and and what's real and what's

1133
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,319
not real and i think here it's useful to

1134
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:37,920
bring back uh or or kind of points that

1135
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,680
dan dennett has already done some

1136
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,760
important work in the past on this

1137
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,760
with his work on real patterns and and

1138
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,520
what does it mean for a pattern to be

1139
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,160
real

1140
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,520
and what's the difference between a

1141
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,920
pattern being real or and not being real

1142
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,720
right

1143
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,280
um one interesting thing if we think

1144
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,880
about active inference for example is

1145
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,400
that if we think about the social

1146
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,680
dynamics

1147
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,079
uh we can think for example about the

1148
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:01,359
dynamics in the army

1149
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:05,599
right a platoon clearly has

1150
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,319
some kind of a blanket like the platoon

1151
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,560
is trying to maintain its homeostasis

1152
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,319
they they are all trying to stay alive

1153
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,319
especially in a hostile environment

1154
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:17,040
far away from the equilibrium right the

1155
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,240
interesting thing about

1156
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,720
the example of a platoon if i and i hope

1157
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,520
i'm not

1158
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,359
getting that wrong now but i'm sure

1159
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,200
manuel would correct me if i do

1160
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,119
is that we don't actually assume that

1161
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,200
the the that the

1162
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,680
platoon would be statistically ergodic

1163
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,560
because it

1164
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,599
definitely shouldn't uh shouldn't

1165
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,960
visit some of its possible state spaces

1166
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,680
right

1167
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,000
portions of the of its state space like

1168
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,839
the whole point of putting people into a

1169
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,200
platoon is so that

1170
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,240
they won't visit certain regions of the

1171
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,200
state space

1172
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,400
um so those are

1173
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,160
interesting questions here and of course

1174
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,319
the question about like are platoons

1175
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:57,200
real

1176
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,400
uh you know are they uh

1177
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,880
it's an interesting it's an interesting

1178
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,839
question to ponder

1179
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,440
dan dennett previously has asked the

1180
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,200
question about money right so is the

1181
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,800
value of money real

1182
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,920
obviously it has direct impact on our

1183
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,640
lives we be it has a direct impact on

1184
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,280
how we behave uh in virtue of the

1185
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,920
kind of social construct and the social

1186
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,200
scaffolding

1187
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,079
uh on which it rests but we all kind of

1188
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:24,960
agree that

1189
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,760
you know the the existence of value of

1190
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,119
money is just a

1191
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,520
it's just some kind of a fiction that we

1192
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,560
all buy into

1193
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,960
especially now that the gold parity is

1194
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,760
no longer a thing

1195
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,960
nice cool points and and

1196
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,359
it's really remarkable how this what is

1197
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,119
real i mean in some sense it makes sense

1198
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:48,160
it's the classic

1199
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,720
philosophy question plato's cave and

1200
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,920
what's real

1201
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,880
and it's hard to differentiate it

1202
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,040
sometimes because it's used in very many

1203
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,760
senses so sometimes like the pyramid

1204
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,760
it's almost like we're surfacing it

1205
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,640
like an iceberg to mix metaphors and

1206
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,760
then people can

1207
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,000
visibly attack a formalism well the

1208
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
directed acyclic graph doesn't represent

1209
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,760
reality because reality has cyclic

1210
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,880
elements

1211
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,119
and then we have to sort of change the

1212
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,040
formalism a little bit

1213
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,760
like could we run it in a sequential way

1214
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,760
could a message passing algorithm

1215
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,079
emulate a cyclic system even though

1216
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,119
locally computationally it's linearized

1217
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:28,800
but you lose some other attribute is

1218
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,040
that real then would the model be real

1219
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,319
so fun questions um yella and then

1220
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,640
stephen

1221
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,599
great um so i think a question kind of

1222
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,640
related slash orthogonal to uh to to to

1223
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,720
the real question is a question about

1224
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,920
uh what's in the paper called

1225
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,480
reification right so it's it's a fact

1226
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,280
that

1227
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,119
if you make a mathematical formalization

1228
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:54,319
of something that mathematical

1229
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:55,280
formalization might

1230
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,440
is quite often idealization of the

1231
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,640
target phenomenon that you're that

1232
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,319
you're investigating

1233
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,160
and then as long as you treat that

1234
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,599
mathematical structure as an

1235
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,000
idealization

1236
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,839
of the target phenomenon and don't

1237
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:09,680
automatically transfer the properties of

1238
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,599
the idealization to the to the target

1239
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,079
phenomenon then that's completely fine

1240
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:18,880
and then the uh where it gets

1241
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,280
upside down is if you suddenly take that

1242
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,359
mathematical formulization as somehow

1243
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:24,240
being

1244
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,160
at the root of the appearance of the

1245
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,119
target phenomenon that you're

1246
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:27,920
investigating

1247
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,200
so we make this case for for the kind of

1248
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,480
graphical model uh

1249
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,920
example where there is a complicated

1250
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,599
system you make a graphical model of it

1251
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:37,119
which is you know by all means a kind of

1252
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:39,599
simplification of that very system

1253
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,640
and then if you start to say look markov

1254
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,319
blankets were actually in that system

1255
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,240
you're also implying that no actually

1256
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,160
that mathematical idealization uh of of

1257
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:50,480
of

1258
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,520
of of the system was actually already in

1259
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,040
the target system that you were that

1260
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,640
you're investigating and that's that's

1261
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,040
the thing

1262
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,319
else will move that you make the

1263
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,400
mathematics itself more

1264
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,240
real than you're than you're supposed to

1265
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,640
make it um

1266
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,480
and of course i think we said this

1267
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,000
towards the end of the paper you

1268
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,599
you can buy the bullet right and say

1269
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,079
like look no matt reality at this very

1270
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,359
core is mathematical

1271
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:16,079
so so so we're fine but that that is

1272
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:17,920
something that doesn't itself come from

1273
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,720
the formalism but requires actually a

1274
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,920
pretty strong metaphysical assumptions

1275
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,640
and so the question about in that sense

1276
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,160
the question about the reality of a

1277
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,000
mathematical structure is also

1278
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,280
intertwined with this question about

1279
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,839
reification about how do you

1280
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,599
see the relationship between the target

1281
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,440
phenomenon you're investigating

1282
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,359
and the mathematical formalization of

1283
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:40,800
the target phenomenon

1284
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,200
i think these two questions kind of go

1285
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,520
go go ahead and then

1286
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,839
thank you steven than anyone else

1287
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,160
yeah i think this this mathematical

1288
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,000
piece is important as well because i

1289
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,079
think there's often the assumption

1290
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,160
that we're always inferring this model

1291
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,760
of the world and how to

1292
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,760
adapt and interact with the world but

1293
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,440
one of the key things

1294
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,200
particularly higher order animals and

1295
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,040
humans like the platoon

1296
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,960
is at times they want to be disordered

1297
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,960
or this coherent self but

1298
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,280
ultimately when they're in the field yes

1299
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,720
they want to get into the most optimal

1300
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,560
ways to shoot and do things but they

1301
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,200
need to

1302
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,760
gain the system they need to not do what

1303
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,960
the other people think they're going to

1304
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:25,520
do

1305
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,280
and they have to guess what someone else

1306
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,760
might do which is non-ergodic something

1307
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,400
which is

1308
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,440
you're basically gaming each other's

1309
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,640
environment so that you're

1310
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,680
basically like prey and predator you're

1311
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,000
you're also then taking another stance

1312
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,839
so you step outside of

1313
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:46,560
what would be that normal dynamical free

1314
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,040
energy

1315
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,200
minimization process and that is sort of

1316
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,800
sitting on top

1317
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,400
of the other process so i think that's a

1318
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,839
kind of an interesting

1319
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:57,359
confusion cool

1320
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:00,799
dave than anyone else

1321
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,400
the question of what is or wasn't what

1322
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,599
isn't ergotic

1323
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:09,119
seems to interact a lot with scale

1324
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:10,640
and this is something that can be

1325
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,880
manipulated

1326
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,240
in an organization uh sometimes to

1327
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,920
what seem like contradictory or

1328
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,680
paradoxical effects

1329
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,559
for a long time the us military officer

1330
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:23,680
corps

1331
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,680
has had an up or out policy

1332
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,599
if you didn't get promoted within a

1333
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,200
certain amount of time

1334
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,680
you were invited to leave the military

1335
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,200
and go do something else with your life

1336
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,960
which sometimes didn't work well you

1337
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,800
started running into

1338
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,359
um the um uh

1339
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,119
oh you know the the the british

1340
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,599
sociologist from the 50s with

1341
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,599
the famous organ the most famous

1342
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:53,440
organizational law

1343
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,000
such and such as law yeah people are you

1344
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,119
know they end up in their

1345
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,240
their at their level of incompetence

1346
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,280
well much more recently just over 20

1347
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,680
years ago the u.s department of justice

1348
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,800
started adopting an up or out

1349
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,160
policy which

1350
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,760
quite likely is a lot more toxic

1351
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,599
than having that in the military because

1352
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,280
the military has

1353
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,480
usually a fairly narrow kind of

1354
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,119
purpose if it's being used at all in the

1355
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,960
department of justice the fbi especially

1356
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,359
if you're a local investigator you're

1357
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:33,440
expected over a period of years

1358
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,800
not just to know your colleagues and the

1359
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,440
cops

1360
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,000
and the prosecutors and the reporters

1361
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,359
and the informants

1362
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:43,599
and the way the underworld works whether

1363
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:44,640
you're stomping them

1364
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,960
or not you're expected to develop an

1365
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,559
enormous amount of

1366
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:52,640
highly differentiated knowledge of

1367
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:56,160
south cincinnati or the east

1368
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,920
bronx well then in the late 90s somebody

1369
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,640
decided oh

1370
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,680
no wait a minute this has this leaves a

1371
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,079
possibility of local corruption

1372
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:09,040
we're allowing nests of incompetence and

1373
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,800
nests of bribery

1374
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,040
so we're going to require people to

1375
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,200
leave no matter how much you

1376
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,000
love working in the south bronx you

1377
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:18,800
either

1378
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,480
get promoted to washington or you get

1379
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,599
out

1380
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,760
so some the intention presumably was to

1381
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:26,800
keep a nice

1382
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,240
smooth pipeline

1383
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:34,240
a clear flowing stream but you end up

1384
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:39,118
requiring incompetence instead

1385
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:43,440
is there a larger scope at which

1386
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,760
you become scale independent and that

1387
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,640
sort of thing

1388
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,119
and oh yeah it looks muddy at a low

1389
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,040
level but it's actually ends up being

1390
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,040
clearer or is it just

1391
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,680
screwing up

1392
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,240
question there's a lot there one piece i

1393
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:00,720
kind of

1394
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,319
heard is like there's systems that we

1395
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,160
can actually control

1396
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,400
like a software program we can write a

1397
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,520
program

1398
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,480
with a strictly defined topology of

1399
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,599
variables

1400
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:14,240
and so it's easier to take a realist

1401
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,200
interpretation

1402
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,480
of a program where we can define

1403
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,000
all the pieces and we can know

1404
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,920
everything that's happening but once

1405
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,680
we're dealing with systems that

1406
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,839
we didn't directly control we know that

1407
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:26,800
we're dealing with

1408
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,160
a map territory distinction

1409
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,480
which i guess is something i'll flip to

1410
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,200
because this

1411
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,920
was just a great in a very accessible

1412
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,960
point

1413
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,160
which is wherever we go down the rabbit

1414
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,680
hole with the math

1415
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,240
we have to keep that map territory

1416
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:44,960
embodied

1417
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,359
metaphor in mind when whether it's a

1418
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:48,720
phone you're looking at and

1419
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,720
it's deep learning and it's maps and

1420
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,319
recommendations or whether it's a

1421
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:53,280
hand-drawn map

1422
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,119
that your friend made or whether it's a

1423
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:56,800
historical painting

1424
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,960
it's a map and we can all see how that

1425
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,119
differs than the actual

1426
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:03,119
quote realism of the territory which

1427
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:04,400
isn't even like what we

1428
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,720
see it's actually something a little bit

1429
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:07,599
else

1430
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:10,000
so going uh and holding to this map

1431
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,720
territory

1432
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,119
distinction is kind of a useful thing

1433
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:15,280
and so it's great that you brought it up

1434
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,760
also on the sort of symbolic and

1435
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,200
evocative wavelength

1436
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,880
um what about the title or what inspired

1437
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,640
the title

1438
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,720
how did you see that story or that

1439
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,880
narrative play out because you say a lot

1440
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,839
with a few words

1441
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,200
i think we stumbled on upon the title

1442
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,800
and just thought it was too

1443
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,400
too good not to use but in terms of the

1444
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:47,440
uh what you have there oh goodness

1445
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:51,680
um i i i heard you uh

1446
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,280
uh uh uh explained the story during the

1447
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,040
the pre-recording which is very

1448
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,160
uh nice uh but i think there was one

1449
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,040
element there

1450
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,200
that you that you that you didn't

1451
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,319
mention

1452
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:06,240
and that's there that there are somehow

1453
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,319
these these these swindlers in this

1454
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,200
story

1455
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,800
fell to the rest of the the lackeys and

1456
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,559
so in the palace like these are a set of

1457
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:13,359
clothes

1458
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:16,400
that you can only that you can't that

1459
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:16,800
you

1460
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,559
can only see if you're very clever if

1461
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,920
you're if you if you're too dumb you

1462
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,000
won't be able to see these clothes

1463
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,680
so there is and all the lackeys and

1464
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,520
everybody involved in the story there

1465
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,880
there is a kind of

1466
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:31,440
doubt like is this me am i too stupid

1467
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,000
or is something fishy going on here and

1468
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,680
i think that kind of state of suspense

1469
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,119
of not really knowing

1470
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:38,960
i think that's perhaps the the key to

1471
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,720
the title uh we don't we

1472
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,319
well knowing to suggest that there were

1473
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:43,920
swindlers in this story or so but that

1474
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,040
kind of idea like hey

1475
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,079
am i am i too stupid to get this or is

1476
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:50,079
something weird going on and i think

1477
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:53,040
uh uh everybody on everybody working on

1478
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,800
free energy principle has or at least

1479
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,440
should have

1480
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,640
had that feeling to to to some extent uh

1481
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,079
so i think that's the key to the

1482
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,160
the title without giving away uh too

1483
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,720
much about the rest of the story

1484
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,598
yes shannon

1485
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,440
i somehow missed that nuance from from

1486
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,079
the title

1487
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:15,359
um but it seems really question for

1488
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,680
the new paper that just came out too and

1489
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:18,720
um

1490
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,880
the twitter post response on it too is

1491
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,119
maybe certain technical aspects of the

1492
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:24,319
free energy principle

1493
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:26,960
weren't described with the specific

1494
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,119
mathematics and formalism that you need

1495
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:31,359
to properly criticize the free energy

1496
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:32,400
principle

1497
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,720
um which maybe maybe you do maybe you

1498
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:35,839
need to have

1499
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:37,839
that much detail to properly criticize

1500
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,839
it but

1501
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:43,760
if it's a principle that we want

1502
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:48,640
to use in our empirical science and our

1503
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,000
understanding of

1504
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,400
whatever subject matter we're looking at

1505
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,440
and also

1506
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,480
something that we want to use i

1507
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,559
i assume that in science we want to use

1508
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:00,319
this to also inform the world

1509
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:03,359
about something that we know about the

1510
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:04,640
system that we're studying

1511
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,920
um whether it's something like this is a

1512
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,240
true real fact of the system or this is

1513
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,599
the most useful way that we can

1514
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:12,319
understand

1515
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:15,760
the system so that we can apply

1516
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,400
treatments you know maybe translate to

1517
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,000
applied clinical practice or something

1518
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,119
like that

1519
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:23,839
then at some point it needs to be

1520
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:25,040
possible

1521
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,440
to abstract away from the formalism

1522
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,520
without

1523
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,559
losing the detail

1524
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:36,319
or without losing the assumed detail

1525
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:39,359
that the formalism brings in and

1526
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,280
maybe it's just maybe like we have to

1527
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,640
work through this nitty gritty stuff and

1528
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,160
we have to fight over

1529
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,480
very small mathematical details and

1530
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,640
people that are better at math than i

1531
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,359
have to make that fight before like we

1532
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:52,640
can bring it in and

1533
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,319
people in applied practices and

1534
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:59,440
maybe even the greater public can start

1535
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,119
understanding

1536
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,319
exactly what this means

1537
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:06,799
but i don't know when it when is the

1538
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:08,079
point that we can get there what is the

1539
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:09,280
point that we can say

1540
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,400
okay we're done arguing about the

1541
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,680
formalism we know there's subtle

1542
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,880
differences

1543
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,599
but i can still have a conversation with

1544
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:17,040
my friend who's just interested in my

1545
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,040
phd work but hasn't done a phd

1546
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,799
themselves

1547
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:22,880
or something like that i'm going to stop

1548
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,640
talking as i start trailing off with

1549
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,319
less points here but

1550
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:27,599
just throwing that out there thanks

1551
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:29,440
shannon cool points

1552
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:33,359
manuel so

1553
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:36,319
i hope this doesn't come along as a say

1554
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:36,720
like

1555
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,400
negative um uh perspective

1556
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,520
in a way but i guess that beyond uh what

1557
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,960
shannon mentioned already

1558
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,440
as being part of the problems which are

1559
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,160
real

1560
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,559
which are absolutely real like when do

1561
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:51,839
when can we stop

1562
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:55,040
like getting into the nitty-gritty stuff

1563
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,599
so that we can actually do some work on

1564
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:58,640
top of that

1565
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,640
and here i'm gonna break allowance like

1566
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,960
in um like for freezing

1567
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,079
like for once where i say that you know

1568
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:08,160
part of what makes this job difficult is

1569
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,280
also like the

1570
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,400
um the idea of dealing with definitions

1571
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,119
that

1572
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:14,960
use the same words across different

1573
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,160
fields

1574
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,960
so we have an example here for uh with

1575
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,319
ergodicity

1576
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:23,040
so the ergodicity definition the

1577
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:23,680
physicist

1578
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,920
study is um yeah this idea of having

1579
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,799
a system that visits all of the spa all

1580
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:31,599
of the state in

1581
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:35,359
um uh in a state space such that you can

1582
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:38,000
replace time average with ensembl

1583
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,280
averages

1584
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,040
if you look at it from the perspective

1585
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,960
of markov processes

1586
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,720
which i think they've actually brought

1587
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,400
out at some point

1588
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,440
a periodicity actually becomes

1589
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,640
a part of the definition if you look at

1590
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,240
it from the perspective of ergotic

1591
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,599
theory which is this field

1592
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:57,920
born like 70 80 years ago and that

1593
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:58,720
actually

1594
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,960
is supposed to just be the uh to just

1595
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,880
deal with their girdicity

1596
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,040
then what they've actually suggested in

1597
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,000
their field

1598
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,920
is weak mixing so you can have

1599
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,160
systems that are not ergotic sorry that

1600
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,799
other gothic but not weak mixing

1601
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:18,319
um so all in all without going like too

1602
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:20,000
much into details i'm just trying to

1603
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,920
suggest that there is also

1604
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,280
a level of misunderstanding that comes

1605
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,839
from people having different backgrounds

1606
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:31,119
so on top of just say understanding what

1607
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:31,920
is going on

1608
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,640
we also need to have i don't know a

1609
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,760
paper or two

1610
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,880
that just list definitions as

1611
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,520
you know i'm using this definition from

1612
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:42,880
this specific field

1613
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,780
you can find it in this book

1614
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:46,079
[Music]

1615
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:49,280
different people might want to say well

1616
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,760
this is not really how i was taught this

1617
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,760
but this specific concept

1618
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,760
but at least it is something that i can

1619
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,680
engage with

1620
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:00,319
so a lot of the confusion especially on

1621
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,960
ergodicity actually comes out just

1622
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,720
of you know people having different

1623
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,880
backgrounds none of them are wrong

1624
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,400
because all of them are just using

1625
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,720
different definitions

1626
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:14,240
unfortunately totally agreed with that

1627
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,200
it's almost like a scientific project

1628
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,000
and

1629
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,760
what we're seeing is that there's an

1630
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,079
enormous desire to contribute to a

1631
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:22,559
shared

1632
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:24,640
scientific project and to make these

1633
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,079
ideas not just something that

1634
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:28,400
rests in the head of an expert but

1635
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,480
something in our exocortex

1636
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,559
in our informational niche something

1637
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:33,680
where we can all just

1638
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,599
see the affordances in a bigger project

1639
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:36,799
like wikipedia

1640
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:39,440
and improve it and then in service of

1641
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,079
that

1642
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:43,119
we need um alignment on really the

1643
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,920
tools and the people and the ideas and

1644
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,599
the ideas are more on the philosophical

1645
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:49,440
side and the tools as we're seeing

1646
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,920
are more on the technical side and

1647
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:52,960
something that's right at the

1648
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,960
intersection of tools people and ideas

1649
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,240
are really the terms and their

1650
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,760
definitions

1651
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:01,040
and that pursuit of clarity as well as

1652
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:03,839
improved ability to translate and

1653
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:05,839
generate introductory material

1654
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:09,119
is really key and that active inference

1655
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:10,160
ontology

1656
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,319
type work is one of the things we're

1657
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:14,480
working on in actin flab

1658
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,200
because we totally agree when there are

1659
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,559
multiple definitions

1660
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:21,599
then it's either a don't ask don't tell

1661
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,960
policy on definitions or people do go

1662
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,480
into the details and then the paper is

1663
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,520
criticized for

1664
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,559
providing a specific detailed take or

1665
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:32,079
they make nine out of ten points but

1666
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:32,799
then it

1667
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:34,559
leaves um a shadow of doubt about the

1668
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:35,839
tenth of tenth point

1669
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:37,200
because it seems like it's going too

1670
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,520
technical and when people do a linear

1671
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,920
regression or a time series model

1672
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,480
even when lives are on the line no one

1673
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,359
says

1674
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:47,040
wait a minute i need the least squares

1675
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,640
error to be real

1676
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,720
but we're seeing criticisms about what's

1677
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,240
real here

1678
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,200
and so that's such a fascinating pattern

1679
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,000
that really

1680
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,079
will be explored i think in the coming

1681
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,640
months and years this

1682
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,400
line of research has brought us to some

1683
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,319
fundamentals and we are

1684
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:05,760
bringing up some new questions and

1685
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,400
connecting ideas and terms in new ways

1686
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:08,960
so it's

1687
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,760
fun to be a part of and um i hope that

1688
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,040
those who are listening can

1689
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,359
see that they're a part of this active

1690
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:16,319
conversation

1691
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:18,960
and it's not like they um the authors

1692
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,319
released this paper and now the

1693
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:21,680
conversation is over

1694
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:25,200
this is sort of their opening call

1695
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,760
and i hope that we can hear a few more

1696
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,040
pieces about

1697
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:32,160
what does that call entail for those who

1698
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:35,520
take it up um yellow

1699
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:40,960
yeah great um i just want to briefly

1700
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,359
follow up on on on shannon's point

1701
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:46,559
and uh saying that at least i think our

1702
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:47,520
aim is also

1703
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,559
to to uh um

1704
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,880
to kind of tease apart a little bit the

1705
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,400
kind of empirical

1706
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,280
research program of of active inference

1707
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,440
and

1708
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,359
dcm and so and the more kind of

1709
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,640
what we in the paper in the end called

1710
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,160
the kind of most ambitious version of

1711
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,240
blanket oriented ontology

1712
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:11,359
and and show that uh you don't

1713
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:13,760
need to buy into that heavy duty

1714
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,160
metaphysical framework in order to do

1715
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,200
empirical interesting

1716
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,200
empirical work with active inference or

1717
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,359
with with dcm or so

1718
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:23,760
so that kind of association back and

1719
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:24,400
forth

1720
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,960
uh there might be a good fit uh but

1721
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,319
there there's

1722
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:29,760
i think there's very good reasons to

1723
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,079
just say or marker blankets stay in my

1724
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:34,000
cool toolkit as a scientist and i can

1725
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,680
use them and employ them every once in a

1726
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:36,079
while

1727
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:39,599
but uh i'm not gonna speculate about how

1728
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:41,920
how that that my toolkit fits onto

1729
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,119
reality etc right

1730
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:44,720
that's that's a different ballpark but

1731
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,640
as having it in your toolkit you can

1732
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:47,839
still do

1733
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:50,400
uh basically all the signs that that

1734
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,839
that's

1735
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:54,720
already so i just want to be clear that

1736
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,319
at no point do we want to say like oh

1737
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:57,440
people should do empirical work

1738
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,039
differently or so but it's really like

1739
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:02,160
if you want to use this toolkit to dive

1740
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:02,559
into

1741
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:04,160
a different set of questions rather than

1742
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,520
the traditional empirical ones you can

1743
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:06,160
ask with

1744
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,960
questions about the democratic agents or

1745
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,240
or so that that might

1746
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,760
look a lot like the empirical one but

1747
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,680
actually are not really

1748
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:16,480
uh then you are confronted with a

1749
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,160
different set of questions namely about

1750
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,400
how does mathematics relate to reality

1751
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,200
and so but

1752
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,319
by no means do we want to kind of uh

1753
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:27,680
block that and i think i mean a long

1754
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,200
time ago i started physics right

1755
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,960
and then if you if you over bs you get

1756
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,119
discussions about are atoms real and so

1757
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:33,680
right

1758
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,160
and these are kind of right these are

1759
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,680
the kind of questions that are just that

1760
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,440
are just funny to raise and some people

1761
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,200
have more or less patience with them

1762
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,280
uh but ben by no means do any of those

1763
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,039
questions block uh

1764
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:47,359
the actual research in in physics

1765
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:48,559
they're they're they're orthogonal to

1766
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:50,079
each other and i think the same

1767
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:53,280
holds for for for for

1768
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,359
for neuroscience at least to some extent

1769
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:57,039
if you if you want to interpret data or

1770
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:57,599
so you know

1771
01:02:57,599 --> 01:02:59,440
use use a mathematical toolbox for that

1772
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,319
then that's completely

1773
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:03,839
metaphysically innocent in that so to

1774
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:06,240
say it's just this this transition

1775
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,200
that has happened that we that we have

1776
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,160
doubts about to take issue with

1777
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,880
cool thanks and anyone can raise their

1778
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:15,359
hand

1779
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:17,359
one thought on that is that the

1780
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:18,480
structure

1781
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:21,440
of the implementation of active

1782
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,079
inference

1783
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:24,079
models with a partially observable

1784
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:26,079
markov decision processes

1785
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:28,240
helps us separate out for example our

1786
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,640
priors about different variables

1787
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,799
our generative model our affordances and

1788
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:33,760
our preferences

1789
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:37,520
so using that model helps us distinguish

1790
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:40,160
for example our aspirational beliefs

1791
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:41,520
about how the world should be or what

1792
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,640
we'd prefer from

1793
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,160
the sort of reality on the ground with

1794
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,680
what our affordances are

1795
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,520
and almost at a higher level this is

1796
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,599
where this discussion is coming

1797
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:53,119
can we separate out our technological

1798
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:55,839
affordances from our preferences for

1799
01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:56,559
example

1800
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:58,720
that an integrated theory of everything

1801
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,319
would be preferable that just makes a

1802
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:01,520
theory better for it to be

1803
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,240
more explanatory more predictive more

1804
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,680
universal

1805
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,359
more transferable across different

1806
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:09,680
systems those are

1807
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,599
preferences we might have over

1808
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:14,079
distributions of scientific theories

1809
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,240
but that's not quite the same thing as

1810
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,680
what are our affordances and

1811
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,599
we don't know all the affordances yet

1812
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:21,119
there's theories that haven't been

1813
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:22,240
invented there's frameworks that don't

1814
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,119
exist yet

1815
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:26,480
so how how do we make sense at the lower

1816
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:26,960
level

1817
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,440
and then also at sort of a higher meta

1818
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,520
scientific level

1819
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,119
have a discussion across different

1820
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,640
frameworks

1821
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:37,440
without trapezing into essentially

1822
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,960
unknowable metaphysical

1823
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:43,280
questions stephen and then anyone else

1824
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,200
yeah i'd be interested one of the it

1825
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,880
sort of relates a bit to what

1826
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,039
dave was saying there about feedback

1827
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:50,559
loops and

1828
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:54,240
we had in the last session we had casper

1829
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,319
hesp talking about some of the modeling

1830
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:58,880
and there you have these kind of

1831
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,000
cyclical

1832
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,039
um iterative dynamics

1833
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:06,480
at different scales of how you know how

1834
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,000
fast or slow the kind of the churn

1835
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,520
of um observations and

1836
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,599
sensory states and maybe states of

1837
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:16,720
belief and

1838
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:20,319
such things so there's kind of a

1839
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:23,520
cyclical patterns sort of in there

1840
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:27,200
so just be curious how that cyclical

1841
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,599
pattern relates also to other types of

1842
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:32,160
feedback which is maybe a bit more

1843
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:35,280
dynamic um or

1844
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,880
just other types of feedback loops that

1845
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,400
you might think might need to be thought

1846
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,559
of

1847
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,640
yeah um i see chris and manuel both with

1848
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,480
henries

1849
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:50,640
yeah am i on youtube go ahead uh

1850
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:53,839
manuel if you have if you want to say

1851
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:55,680
something directly to the last question

1852
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,399
then go ahead

1853
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:02,799
right so um my bad for actually

1854
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:05,359
not covering that before but the idea i

1855
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:06,000
guess that

1856
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,839
um dave previously brought out and now

1857
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:13,920
stephen um kindly uh reminded us about

1858
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:14,400
like the

1859
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,960
this idea of feedback loops uh there is

1860
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:22,400
so let's say uh um i would say that

1861
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,520
my background might be more from control

1862
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:26,160
theory

1863
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:29,200
in some sense so i do see the need

1864
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:32,720
of uh considering feedback loops um

1865
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,319
because you know there's the sort of

1866
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:37,440
like bread and butter in control theory

1867
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,240
there is also a sense however in which

1868
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:40,880
um

1869
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,440
i guess usually in control theory we

1870
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,119
draw diagrams

1871
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:47,119
but they are kind of you know

1872
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:48,960
representations that will leave

1873
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,039
there as in like well this is the type

1874
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:52,799
of system i'm dealing with

1875
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:55,920
it is some sort of like picturesque uh

1876
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,559
say a view of what is actually happening

1877
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:00,480
out there we are not

1878
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:03,839
doing maths on the

1879
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:05,839
say like the the diagram that we are

1880
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:06,960
drawing

1881
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:09,760
in i guess what is happening with

1882
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,680
bayesian networks and why people are

1883
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:15,200
so much say inclined to use them

1884
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:18,240
uh is the is the fact that i guess

1885
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:21,200
we can actually use bezel network to do

1886
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:22,640
calculations

1887
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,280
so the the work by perl which we briefly

1888
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,960
mentioned in our paper

1889
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,839
clearly not giving enough justice to the

1890
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:31,440
entire say

1891
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,079
framework you know is something that can

1892
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:34,720
be used

1893
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:37,760
on these models themselves so

1894
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,640
in a way the

1895
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:43,359
the directionality there the unrolling

1896
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:44,079
of time

1897
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:47,119
the idea of an arrow of time there makes

1898
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:49,200
all of these calculations possible

1899
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:52,559
it is by no means uh a way to say that

1900
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:53,839
there will be

1901
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:57,039
um um

1902
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:00,079
say system

1903
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:02,000
that there will be different systems

1904
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,520
necessarily different systems at

1905
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,280
different times

1906
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,839
we may still choose to group certain

1907
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:09,359
variables and say well this

1908
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:12,079
is just how i don't know the environment

1909
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:13,520
is evolving over time or

1910
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:16,479
how uh an agent is evolving over time

1911
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:18,158
and we might just call that environment

1912
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:20,640
we might just call that agent

1913
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,319
that's fine i guess but when it comes to

1914
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:26,719
say do calculations with that graph if

1915
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:28,560
we just start drawing loops

1916
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,600
then time disappears

1917
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,000
and time is what makes a lot of these

1918
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,560
calculations actually work

1919
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,679
uh at least say what the algorithms

1920
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:42,960
that um you know dania also mentioned

1921
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,198
uh with message passing on bazel

1922
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:46,238
networks

1923
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:47,920
uh that is what makes them work like the

1924
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,600
fact that it is

1925
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,158
clearly there are also algorithms for

1926
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:53,279
cyclic

1927
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:55,520
uh networks but they are more limited

1928
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,040
they have some

1929
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,279
say uh they have some stronger

1930
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:00,880
assumptions

1931
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,679
so i'm rolling time i i think is not an

1932
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:04,640
incredibly

1933
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,439
crazy assumption or an incredibly crazy

1934
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:08,560
same method

1935
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:11,040
to use there it is probably yeah

1936
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,040
something quite reasonable

1937
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:15,839
we are still saying there's a there's a

1938
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:17,198
there's an agent that talks to an

1939
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:18,560
environment and an environment that

1940
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:19,759
talks to an agent

1941
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:22,560
we're just trying to make that say

1942
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,399
interaction explicit

1943
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:28,238
as a process that happens over time

1944
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:34,080
thank you steven than anyone else

1945
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,080
yeah thanks for that that that feedback

1946
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,920
and i suppose one thing that

1947
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,960
the question that can come up is um

1948
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,719
and i'm not sure if the pearl blankets

1949
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:44,479
could do this or something that the

1950
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:45,600
frist and blankets

1951
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,920
gives you the possibilities if you're

1952
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,120
dealing with

1953
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:52,719
entropic information and

1954
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:57,840
noisy kind of data that's coming in

1955
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,159
an entropy can be like zero dimensional

1956
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:01,360
it doesn't actually need to have a

1957
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,000
dimension

1958
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,719
and you can extract from that whereas in

1959
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:07,040
other cases

1960
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,360
you you're always working with something

1961
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,120
which is like a channel coming in with

1962
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,880
like a dimensional

1963
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,520
data source which is somehow like saying

1964
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,199
something about the thing out there

1965
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:18,640
as opposed to something which can be

1966
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:20,480
completely untethered

1967
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,640
from the environment so i wonder you

1968
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:23,679
know how that

1969
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:25,520
that idea of being able to extract

1970
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:26,800
shannon entropy

1971
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:30,159
information might be a unique property

1972
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:30,719
of

1973
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:32,800
the fristen blanket or whether that

1974
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,000
could be done in other ways

1975
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:40,080
um so uh

1976
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:41,360
i guess there are a couple of

1977
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,120
considerations there like

1978
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:46,080
exactly what would be extracting

1979
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,560
information from what

1980
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,040
uh because i mean this sounds a lot like

1981
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:51,760
the

1982
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,400
sort of like maxwell's demon type of

1983
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:55,520
scenario

1984
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,560
which um you know it's a well-studied

1985
01:10:58,560 --> 01:10:59,280
field

1986
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:02,960
but it's also say possibly controversial

1987
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,880
in some sense because well in physics

1988
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,280
you don't need to ask certain questions

1989
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:09,120
you just well there's a demon and i

1990
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:10,880
don't and i'm not gonna tell you what

1991
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,239
this demon is

1992
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:14,400
i'm not gonna tell you how he does his

1993
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,080
thing it just does it

1994
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,320
and this is how you know things will

1995
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:19,440
happen

1996
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:22,000
um the the thing about you know

1997
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,159
extracting information in the

1998
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:26,960
blanket sense well here i want to walk

1999
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:27,679
say

2000
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:31,760
um a very fine line um

2001
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:35,360
by saying that the

2002
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,840
there are possibly issues with this

2003
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,080
definition of the friston blanket and

2004
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,880
they have been raised before and i think

2005
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,159
martin beale

2006
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:47,440
has pointed them out in a recent paper

2007
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:50,159
and fernando rosas has also mentioned

2008
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:53,600
them in his uh work on causa blankets

2009
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:56,560
as a way to fix i would say fristen

2010
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,679
blankets

2011
01:11:57,679 --> 01:11:59,520
in the sense that the information that

2012
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:02,159
can be extracted

2013
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:05,280
in those blankets

2014
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:09,199
is not past information is just

2015
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:12,080
information at one specific time step

2016
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,920
because of this unrolling

2017
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:17,120
it makes calculations easier but

2018
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:19,440
the sort of conditional independence is

2019
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:20,840
not only

2020
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:24,640
uh in within a time step is also across

2021
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:25,840
time steps

2022
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:29,360
because of the markovian um

2023
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:32,960
property of uh of this processes

2024
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,640
and i want to make sure this is not

2025
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,000
something that i first raised

2026
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,440
this came from people like martin beale

2027
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:41,600
fernando rosas and probably in first

2028
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,760
place nathaniel virgo

2029
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:48,000
um so uh and again all the credit goes

2030
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:48,800
to them

2031
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,640
so this idea of extracting information

2032
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,400
is really

2033
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:55,760
feeble for now it is not uh

2034
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:57,199
it is not something that i would

2035
01:12:57,199 --> 01:13:00,159
actually you know bank on

2036
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:04,000
in any way

2037
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,199
cool so it's almost like it's said to be

2038
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:09,440
a strength of the markov blanket or any

2039
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,280
kind of blanket concept that it's just

2040
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,520
one time slice at a time but you don't

2041
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:14,560
get to

2042
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,480
have the blanket and eat it too because

2043
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:17,600
you can't have the

2044
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,560
through time benefits and then say that

2045
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,080
you're simplifying with something that's

2046
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,120
only reading one

2047
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:25,600
value at a time though there's also

2048
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,840
probably a lot of technical details too

2049
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,679
so chris and then anyone else raising

2050
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:33,679
their hand

2051
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:36,159
onion

2052
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:41,199
uh here we go sorry so that was a really

2053
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:42,640
nice exchange

2054
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:46,080
and i think it also ties things back to

2055
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,159
to to your point about the map and the

2056
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:50,000
territory distinction

2057
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,120
because uh one thing that we have like i

2058
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:53,520
think

2059
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:56,080
one of the intentions we had uh at least

2060
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,239
definitely me and joe who unfortunately

2061
01:13:58,239 --> 01:13:58,960
isn't here

2062
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,800
but is very interested in these topics

2063
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:03,040
is then is the philosophy of science

2064
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:06,000
behind the notion of a scientific model

2065
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,800
and one thing that we have to like in if

2066
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,719
we frame things in this way it becomes

2067
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:11,920
very interesting

2068
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:14,640
how we understand persistence formalism

2069
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:17,440
such as mark of blankets for example

2070
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:21,120
because uh in philosophy

2071
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:22,640
there's often this distinction made

2072
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,320
between the model

2073
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,400
the construal and the target system of

2074
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,000
the model right so the target system

2075
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,440
of the model is a phenomenon we're

2076
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,760
trying to investigate in the world

2077
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,760
the model itself is some kind of a

2078
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,520
formal construction

2079
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,920
usually usually described in some formal

2080
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:38,960
language

2081
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:42,480
and then the construal is kind of the

2082
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:45,760
interpretive link that connects the

2083
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:49,199
formal structure to the concrete

2084
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:51,440
real world phenomenon and one

2085
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:52,960
interesting thing about this

2086
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:55,440
is that the same formal structure the

2087
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:57,520
same model can be applied in different

2088
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:58,239
fields

2089
01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:00,880
by different scientists successfully

2090
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:02,719
using different construals right

2091
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:04,239
and this also goes back to something

2092
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:06,480
that manuel mentioned before about the

2093
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,239
multiplicity of backgrounds from which

2094
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:09,679
people come

2095
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:11,440
to the free energy framework active

2096
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,960
influence framework

2097
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,360
and it's not unproductive i mean we have

2098
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:17,360
good examples in the history of

2099
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,280
science in the history of computer

2100
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:20,719
science specifically

2101
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:24,400
of people parting certain notions from

2102
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,719
physics specifically into computer

2103
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:29,440
science and making breakthroughs so one

2104
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:32,400
very nice example of this is the

2105
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:35,520
so-called icing model of ferromagnetism

2106
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,239
which has been ported by william little

2107
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:39,440
and john hopfield

2108
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:42,480
into the neural network domain

2109
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,080
where they basically used the same

2110
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:45,600
formal structure

2111
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:49,360
to and gave it a different construal

2112
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:52,320
right to model a different a different

2113
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:54,719
worldly phenomenon so hobfield networks

2114
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:56,480
and later boltzmann networks have been

2115
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,480
very successful for example in modeling

2116
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:01,199
memory at least back when they were

2117
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:02,640
introduced now we have

2118
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,880
much more sophisticated models of course

2119
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:05,679
but it's a nice

2120
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:08,360
example of this kind of

2121
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:10,880
cross-insemination between fields where

2122
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,560
people can actually take a formal

2123
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,480
structure or notion from one field and

2124
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:15,760
successfully

2125
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:18,880
make progress in a different domain but

2126
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:20,400
one thing that's important to keep in

2127
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:21,440
mind is that

2128
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:24,719
you know little or hopfield never

2129
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:27,440
never never never published their neural

2130
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:29,280
network model and said like look

2131
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,199
it's a thermodynamical model of memory

2132
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:32,840
or something like that

2133
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:35,840
because it's not i mean in a sense

2134
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:38,320
of course it is because it's the the

2135
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:38,880
formal

2136
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,760
structure that has been mapped onto the

2137
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:42,480
target

2138
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,640
phenomenon is the same as in the icing

2139
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:48,320
model or the spin glass model

2140
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,679
the the thing is though that the

2141
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:51,440
construals are very different and i

2142
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:51,920
think it's

2143
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:54,159
it's very useful to to to keep this in

2144
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:55,120
mind

2145
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:58,640
um it can so it could like to

2146
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:00,239
boil my point down i guess the two

2147
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:02,320
sentences it can be productive

2148
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:05,280
doing this um it's just something that

2149
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:07,679
we really wanted to bring to the surface

2150
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:09,920
uh that we have to be aware of the

2151
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:11,600
distinction between the thing in the

2152
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:12,400
world

2153
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,159
and the mathematical formula that we're

2154
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:15,600
using to describe this thing in the

2155
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,840
world

2156
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:22,239
awesome thanks for this summary and

2157
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:24,640
as people i think learn and read these

2158
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:25,679
papers

2159
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:27,280
they'll see that there are these

2160
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:29,360
expanding levels of analysis from like

2161
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:31,840
the one sentence don't confuse the map

2162
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,040
with the territory

2163
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:35,120
or what you just said there it can be

2164
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,960
productive you just have to raise this

2165
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:38,960
discussion to the surface

2166
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,400
and then there's more and more and more

2167
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,719
to uncover um kind of like chipping away

2168
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:44,400
at the base of the pyramid almost and

2169
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:45,520
finding out what are

2170
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,520
our assumptions and okay all these

2171
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,840
people criticizing elements of

2172
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,199
free energy principle or active

2173
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:53,280
inference what's their preference

2174
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:55,520
what do they want to see or are we all

2175
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:57,760
on the same aspirational team

2176
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,520
in that we all want to see a

2177
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:01,840
collaborative formal framework that also

2178
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:04,400
might help us with real world questions

2179
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,080
and also philosophical ones

2180
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:12,640
variously stephen then anyone else

2181
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,800
yeah i think this is this is a really

2182
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,480
good conversation and i think

2183
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:19,040
when i've heard other approaches say in

2184
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,480
the psychology

2185
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:23,120
fields which are kind of looking at how

2186
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:23,920
people

2187
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:28,000
do sense making they often outside of

2188
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,880
work with the free energy principle it

2189
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,080
tends to be

2190
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,239
energy gradients people you know what's

2191
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:35,120
the

2192
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,960
route to least action or whether you

2193
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:39,840
notice the energy is

2194
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:42,159
lower so then you know how to act on the

2195
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:43,040
environment

2196
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:45,760
and of course the the ability to also

2197
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:46,239
bring in

2198
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:50,320
entropic kind of noisy

2199
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,880
statistical regularities which you

2200
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,000
wouldn't necessarily

2201
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,600
know why they're there um

2202
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:58,960
well you wouldn't know why they're there

2203
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:00,400
we no one knows they're there we can't

2204
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:01,760
even

2205
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,679
understand it there's something quite

2206
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:06,840
interesting and that seems to be

2207
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:10,800
um where to my understanding i don't

2208
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,719
know if there's any other models that

2209
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:14,239
are able to

2210
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:17,760
integrate the um

2211
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:20,840
the energy landscape with this kind of

2212
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,000
um

2213
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,960
uh actual you know way to infer

2214
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,800
something plausibly

2215
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:30,159
from the entropic dynamics that are

2216
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:32,879
played out

2217
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:36,640
thanks steven blue then anyone else with

2218
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:39,040
a question

2219
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:42,880
so just to go back to what daniel was

2220
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,640
saying about

2221
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,080
incorporating the active inference

2222
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,480
framework do we want this really to be

2223
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,880
a framework that is concrete and

2224
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,719
definite and stable do we want to come

2225
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:54,000
to some kind of

2226
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,719
absolute end point here with with active

2227
01:19:56,719 --> 01:19:57,440
inference or

2228
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:59,360
is this something that we want to be

2229
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:00,800
constantly evolving

2230
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:03,520
growing changing do we want to try try

2231
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:04,880
applying it like in several different

2232
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:05,440
fields

2233
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:07,760
seeing what works and what doesn't to

2234
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:09,040
then then move on

2235
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:10,960
so we have to think as we ask ourselves

2236
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:12,880
and as we you know discourage and

2237
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:14,639
encourage how the active inference

2238
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:16,639
framework is used what do we really want

2239
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:18,159
as scientists i think it's important to

2240
01:20:18,159 --> 01:20:20,799
think about that

2241
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,840
great question blue really something we

2242
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,600
could

2243
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,239
all think a little bit about shannon

2244
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:28,639
than

2245
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:32,639
anyone else sort of um following up but

2246
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:34,159
a little bit tangential what blue just

2247
01:20:34,159 --> 01:20:35,280
mentioned

2248
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:38,480
um and maybe joe can be here

2249
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,560
next week that would be great um but i'm

2250
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,480
wondering if we're having sort of an

2251
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,400
emerging

2252
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:48,400
folk active inference um so we have a

2253
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,480
like folk psychological intuitions about

2254
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:52,800
the world about how other people behave

2255
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:55,120
science uses slightly different maybe

2256
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,440
more complex intuitions to describe

2257
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:00,639
um how people perceive interact um to

2258
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:02,800
describe the psychology of individuals

2259
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:05,679
i'm wondering if

2260
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:08,080
this active inference concept is really

2261
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:10,080
great um how daniel talks about how we

2262
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:10,400
work

2263
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,800
in teams and how we're working together

2264
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,480
to resolve our uncertainty and we're

2265
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:15,679
coming together

2266
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:19,120
in this um this

2267
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:21,360
markov blanketed group of us compared to

2268
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:22,320
everyone who

2269
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:24,400
will be watching this live stream later

2270
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,920
and these are fruitful

2271
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:28,800
to making good team dynamics and to help

2272
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:29,280
learn

2273
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:31,840
and um some of us who aren't here right

2274
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:33,679
now are applying this to

2275
01:21:33,679 --> 01:21:37,040
systems to business and organization and

2276
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:39,520
this is super useful it's not the goal

2277
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:42,639
of the scientists perhaps um

2278
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:44,320
but maybe we can bring this up again

2279
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,480
next week and just talk about

2280
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:47,840
how that's useful and how that's sort of

2281
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,360
emerging at the same time as these

2282
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:51,199
formalisms

2283
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:54,080
thanks shannon and i agree that um the

2284
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:56,080
team and the project

2285
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:59,199
and the mission sometimes sidestep or

2286
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:02,320
at least um ward off the philosophical

2287
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,239
questions it's like well let's finish

2288
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:06,880
this project with this data set we have

2289
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:09,199
get the publication or get this next

2290
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:10,080
checkpoint

2291
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:11,440
and then we'll see where we're at we'll

2292
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:13,440
have a new perspective on these

2293
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:15,520
eternal philosophical questions and so

2294
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:16,960
it won't be resolved in

2295
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:20,159
2021 maybe not even in 2022

2296
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:21,920
but we'll be working together and we'll

2297
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:23,440
be more productive and we'll have

2298
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:24,639
stabilized our

2299
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:27,520
informational niche our financial niche

2300
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:28,159
dave

2301
01:22:28,159 --> 01:22:31,280
then anyone else

2302
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:40,480
dave dave

2303
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:46,239
he's still muted but

2304
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:49,760
okay okay anyone else want to uh

2305
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:53,840
add something

2306
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:57,440
uh i was just gonna say like something

2307
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:59,199
very briefly like um

2308
01:22:59,199 --> 01:23:02,000
concerning what blue uh brought out

2309
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
which i think is um

2310
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,280
very fair i guess uh view of

2311
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:10,080
um a very fair perspective of you know

2312
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,920
the the current status

2313
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:14,320
of people that might choose to work on

2314
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:15,679
active inference

2315
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:19,199
there is a good cluster i guess of

2316
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:20,000
people from

2317
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,880
different backgrounds that have some

2318
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:25,120
more or less shared goal

2319
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:27,440
that are ready to you know engage with

2320
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:28,400
each other

2321
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,719
and try i guess like to create something

2322
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:33,760
good with each other so

2323
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:36,480
if anything else that that's great i

2324
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:37,360
mean

2325
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:39,040
what else would you actually need to do

2326
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:41,199
science if not just a bunch of

2327
01:23:41,199 --> 01:23:43,920
you know motivated people that get

2328
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:44,480
together

2329
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:47,040
and try to to work towards something

2330
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:48,480
altogether

2331
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:51,440
um something that you know might have

2332
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:52,159
just

2333
01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:55,679
um on the other hand push people away

2334
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:59,120
uh like at different stages in time was

2335
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:00,840
you know

2336
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:04,800
the the idea of promising something that

2337
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:07,360
was not really there yet

2338
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:11,520
in a way like the nobody would blame

2339
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:14,480
i guess anyone for for a project that is

2340
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,320
just in the workings for something that

2341
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:17,120
is evolving

2342
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,600
for something that is still you know

2343
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,120
that has still not reached

2344
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:24,239
its final form

2345
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:27,360
i guess the idea of reading you know a

2346
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,600
theory a unifying theory of this a

2347
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,600
unifying theory of that

2348
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:35,040
is what might have you know discouraged

2349
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:36,880
other people from from actually engaging

2350
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,880
with it so

2351
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,560
probably some sort of balance that i

2352
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:43,840
think is now in place

2353
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:46,960
is conducive to i guess

2354
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:49,280
an even better research environment

2355
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,040
because i think more people can

2356
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:52,719
engage more people can see that there

2357
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:55,520
are you know constructive criticisms

2358
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,840
more people can see that you know it's

2359
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,040
not just

2360
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:02,719
uh you know a sort of environment

2361
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:04,239
completely detached

2362
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:07,120
from from reality there is there is a

2363
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:08,639
sense in which you know

2364
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:11,440
uh improvements happen when people

2365
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:12,800
engage

2366
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:15,199
and other people listen and you know

2367
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:16,400
propose new stuff

2368
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,639
which you know just a scientific method

2369
01:25:18,639 --> 01:25:20,560
that's absolutely fine that's great

2370
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:23,840
i think we we had some very welcoming

2371
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,480
you know uh feedback from different

2372
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:28,320
people

2373
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:31,360
like regardless of what we said

2374
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,840
which i thought you know is good for a

2375
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:36,800
healthy community

2376
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:39,679
nice i think yeah thank you yeah a

2377
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:40,639
mentor

2378
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:42,639
in writing told me that the three stages

2379
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:44,400
were the madman

2380
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:47,040
the architect and the interior designer

2381
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:48,800
so someone has to envision there could

2382
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:49,120
be

2383
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:51,199
a skyscraper here or there could be a

2384
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:52,320
stadium here

2385
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,800
and then it has to get planned out and

2386
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,880
interior design has to be kept in mind

2387
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:57,199
but

2388
01:25:57,199 --> 01:26:00,159
it isn't actually applied and so not

2389
01:26:00,159 --> 01:26:01,280
that those are the stages of a

2390
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:02,800
scientific theory

2391
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:05,679
but we're closer to the beginning and

2392
01:26:05,679 --> 01:26:06,400
you're right

2393
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:08,719
that now there actually is enough to

2394
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:10,320
kind of take a bite

2395
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:12,560
out of and to build within and then for

2396
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:14,080
those who think that there's like

2397
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:15,840
little grounding or they want to make

2398
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,760
almost hyperbolic claims about how

2399
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:18,960
little is known

2400
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:21,280
um my questions would be first off

2401
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:22,080
relative to

2402
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:24,960
which body of literature that's ongoing

2403
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,719
and the second question would be

2404
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:30,239
have you read the 2007 spm textbook

2405
01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:33,360
because that was 14 years ago

2406
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,679
and it demonstrates in a little bit like

2407
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:38,000
a textbook form which is more classical

2408
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,120
than the pre-print

2409
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:42,400
back and forth that's a lot of the basis

2410
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,560
and so there isn't any philosophy in

2411
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:46,159
that textbook but you'll find a lot of

2412
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:48,239
new approaches for thinking about

2413
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:50,400
cause and effect and dynamic systems

2414
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:51,840
modeling and what we can do with

2415
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:52,719
neuroimaging

2416
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:54,480
and behavioral data and heterogeneous

2417
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:56,159
data sets so

2418
01:26:56,159 --> 01:26:58,960
awesome points um dave if you want to

2419
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:00,400
unmute and try again

2420
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:04,560
and then blue

2421
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:07,040
i'm i'm not sure why you're still muted

2422
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:07,840
dave

2423
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:11,360
there we go okay yep okay

2424
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:14,400
um one of the really

2425
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,840
crucial benefits of doing the

2426
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:18,560
deconflation

2427
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:21,360
that you are correctly insisting on is

2428
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:23,199
that the real essence of

2429
01:27:23,199 --> 01:27:26,960
what's in

2430
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:29,600
scientific thinking or technical

2431
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:31,360
thinking or skill development is the

2432
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:33,600
analogies

2433
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:38,000
among different realms of thought realms

2434
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:38,960
of action

2435
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:42,800
if you conflate um

2436
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:46,320
entropy with

2437
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:50,080
the universal tendency you don't see

2438
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:53,080
you can't think about the actual

2439
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:54,560
differentiations

2440
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:57,679
of instruments that should that measure

2441
01:27:57,679 --> 01:27:59,520
entropy

2442
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:04,320
cosmological ideas that

2443
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:07,679
discuss and structure our thinking about

2444
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:08,560
a different

2445
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:10,960
realm of activity and you certainly

2446
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:13,040
aren't going to see the analogy between

2447
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:15,120
those analogies

2448
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:16,960
but once you start pulling stuff apart

2449
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:18,719
then you can start doing mapping

2450
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:22,159
in detail and find what

2451
01:28:22,159 --> 01:28:25,679
applications you can relate

2452
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:29,199
through the instrumental

2453
01:28:29,199 --> 01:28:32,000
or realistic interpretation of any of

2454
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,760
these meta concepts

2455
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,840
you can start listing tables of

2456
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:38,719
correspondences you can make

2457
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:42,239
uh gadonkan experiment and you can make

2458
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:45,360
literally lab tests and

2459
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:48,880
draw out paradoxes where the prediction

2460
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:49,280
from

2461
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:52,880
one wing of the metaphor looks like it

2462
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:53,920
ought to align

2463
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:56,000
with another with the results in another

2464
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,520
wing and don't

2465
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:59,679
at that point now you can start thinking

2466
01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:01,840
about what it is that we don't know yet

2467
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:03,120
so yeah yeah quick

2468
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:06,400
quick keep keep ripping the stuff apart

2469
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:09,600
when it's been conflated flogistan

2470
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:12,960
modeled a lot of real stuff and it was

2471
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:13,520
also

2472
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:15,920
harmful the notion that things fall

2473
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:18,000
because they belong down

2474
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,600
that predicted a lot of things that

2475
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,199
modeled a lot of stuff and

2476
01:29:21,199 --> 01:29:24,880
interfered with

2477
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:27,760
work that needed to be done thank you

2478
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:28,800
thanks steve

2479
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:32,000
nice points blue

2480
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,840
this is great because it just ties in

2481
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,199
everything that dave said but i really

2482
01:29:35,199 --> 01:29:35,920
wanted to

2483
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:39,199
respond to manuel um so

2484
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:40,719
you know i don't necessarily have a

2485
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:42,480
perspective on

2486
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,719
whether we want active inference to be

2487
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:47,360
something solid and concrete like a law

2488
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:49,040
or something that's continually growing

2489
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:51,120
and evolving and so i i just pose it as

2490
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:52,000
a question

2491
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,560
like where do we really want it to to

2492
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:55,199
end

2493
01:29:55,199 --> 01:29:58,159
um i think that um just like dave said

2494
01:29:58,159 --> 01:29:59,760
you know there's always like we we had

2495
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:01,600
the laws of physics right like newtonian

2496
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,360
physics we had all these laws

2497
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:05,040
they were in place they worked for a

2498
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:06,400
long time and then quantum

2499
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:09,120
right so so i mean we don't know what is

2500
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:10,639
going to be underneath

2501
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:12,400
when we when we finally define an

2502
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,159
absolute there could be another layer

2503
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:16,239
that we just aren't seeing yet

2504
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:19,040
so i think that um you know just like

2505
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:20,000
newtonian physics

2506
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,960
and quantum physics we need to look at

2507
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:23,440
where

2508
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:26,080
the context is right and so there might

2509
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:27,920
be an active inference

2510
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:30,480
a a contextual barrier that we can say

2511
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,000
you know active inference

2512
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,560
is this version of active inference is

2513
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:35,520
applicable

2514
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:37,760
in this context and there might be some

2515
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:38,880
other deeper

2516
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:40,560
different version that applies in other

2517
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:43,199
contexts

2518
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:48,000
cool and i think that's partly

2519
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,639
how the the specific projects and

2520
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:52,480
deliverables and questions are what

2521
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:53,040
ground us

2522
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:55,520
like with dave's example about entropy

2523
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:56,719
yeah you can probably

2524
01:30:56,719 --> 01:30:59,040
abstract entropy and start applying it

2525
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:00,239
to different domains and

2526
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:02,000
what would psychological entropy what

2527
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,080
would spiritual entropy be

2528
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:06,719
or you might be concerned with the car

2529
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:07,679
that you're building

2530
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:09,360
and you're like okay i have a preference

2531
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:11,600
for the more miles per gallon and

2532
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:13,920
less of this other emission and then

2533
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:16,159
entropy in an applied context

2534
01:31:16,159 --> 01:31:19,199
is being pursued instrumentally

2535
01:31:19,199 --> 01:31:22,719
with literal instruments and scientists

2536
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:23,600
are not just

2537
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:26,560
all-purpose thinkers when the scientist

2538
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:27,440
is on

2539
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:28,960
were instrumentalists and actually that

2540
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:30,960
makes me curious yella about one of your

2541
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:31,679
other

2542
01:31:31,679 --> 01:31:34,080
papers the anticipating brain is not a

2543
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:35,440
scientist

2544
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:38,400
so what was that about because the part

2545
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,159
in this paper about how the cognitive

2546
01:31:40,159 --> 01:31:41,120
scientist

2547
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:44,080
is in a unique position as the meta

2548
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:44,960
modeler

2549
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:47,120
reminded me a lot of this line of

2550
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:48,560
research so maybe

2551
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,560
could you summarize that or what was

2552
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:52,080
that paper about and how has that been

2553
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:55,360
developed and what you're exploring now

2554
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:59,839
oh great yeah um

2555
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:03,360
so uh yeah i think and

2556
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:06,080
can you hear me hey yeah i've got a

2557
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:06,719
comment

2558
01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:10,159
um i only now realize that they used the

2559
01:32:10,159 --> 01:32:12,239
scientist metaphor uh

2560
01:32:12,239 --> 01:32:15,040
in both this paper and in in the in the

2561
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:15,920
old one

2562
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:19,280
uh and

2563
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:21,440
i think here it's very clear to

2564
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:23,360
distinguish between

2565
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:24,960
models and models of knowledge models

2566
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,400
and animals models and scientists models

2567
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:27,600
and they have different kind of

2568
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:31,040
properties in

2569
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:34,320
in the anticipating brain paper

2570
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:37,520
we make the same distinction between the

2571
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,199
scientists model of the environment

2572
01:32:39,199 --> 01:32:41,040
and an animal's model environment and

2573
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:42,960
there the distinction is more

2574
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:45,920
in terms of what are the the aims so to

2575
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:47,040
say of the model

2576
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:48,880
and where you might say well in the

2577
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:50,719
epistemic practice of science then the

2578
01:32:50,719 --> 01:32:51,360
aim of

2579
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:53,520
the scientist model is to get an as

2580
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:54,800
accurate

2581
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:58,400
representation or inference or whatever

2582
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:00,400
from the outside world as possible so it

2583
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:01,679
is kind of a

2584
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:03,600
more epistemic process in which the

2585
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:04,960
ultimate aim is to

2586
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:07,679
to figure out something about the world

2587
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:08,560
and now

2588
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:11,600
transposing that question to the uh to

2589
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:12,560
the animal

2590
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:14,320
the problem is a different one it's not

2591
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:16,159
like the problem

2592
01:33:16,159 --> 01:33:17,679
what's out there in the world is

2593
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:20,320
secondary to how can i make what's out

2594
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:22,880
there in a world compatible with

2595
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,480
the kind of existence that i am having

2596
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:26,719
or am

2597
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:28,639
and so there the epistemic story stands

2598
01:33:28,639 --> 01:33:30,560
in the surface of something like

2599
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:31,920
flourishing or staying alive or

2600
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:33,600
homeostasis or so and there might be

2601
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,000
cases where actually

2602
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,600
and i think this is also related to the

2603
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:39,040
kind of the theory of action that's

2604
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:39,760
there like

2605
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:42,960
where uh inferring what's

2606
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,960
the exact state of the world is not

2607
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:46,159
actually the right thing to do

2608
01:33:46,159 --> 01:33:48,560
but changing the world so as to make it

2609
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,239
conform to your expectations is the

2610
01:33:50,239 --> 01:33:50,719
better

2611
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:52,719
way to do that so so that the kind of

2612
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:53,760
the epistemic

2613
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:55,360
aims in both settings the scientist

2614
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:56,560
setting and the animal in his

2615
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:57,840
environment setting are

2616
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:59,840
are what the the scientists in this

2617
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,360
everyday life setting are

2618
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:04,639
are slightly different and so that was

2619
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:07,199
also to counter the kind of

2620
01:34:07,199 --> 01:34:08,800
very prevalent kind of helmholtzian

2621
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:10,320
models of perception that are there in

2622
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:11,120
the in the

2623
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:13,360
energy literature and and the processing

2624
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:14,159
literature

2625
01:34:14,159 --> 01:34:15,440
where you say like well first and

2626
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:18,159
foremost a problem for an agent or any

2627
01:34:18,159 --> 01:34:19,440
agent is to

2628
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:21,040
infer what's out there in the world and

2629
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:22,880
i think fep shows like no that that's

2630
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:24,400
that's a secondary problem the first

2631
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:25,360
problem is

2632
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:28,000
staying alive

2633
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:32,560
interesting and that's so funny because

2634
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:33,520
what do they say

2635
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:36,560
in legacy science publisher parish so

2636
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:38,719
it's also not

2637
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:41,280
thrive and communicate and mentor it's

2638
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:41,840
actually

2639
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:45,040
still phrased in a life or death way

2640
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:46,400
that's all this might be and then the

2641
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:48,159
eve wave understanding signs indeed that

2642
01:34:48,159 --> 01:34:48,800
might be true

2643
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:52,080
yeah yes alliteration plus

2644
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:55,280
competition just irresistible

2645
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:57,760
any other thoughts otherwise there's a

2646
01:34:57,760 --> 01:34:58,400
couple other

2647
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,000
points that would be awesome to kind of

2648
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,159
just in the last 20 minutes

2649
01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:05,760
open up and then i'll re-upload

2650
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:09,040
this full video we can all think about

2651
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:11,520
some questions that we're having i guess

2652
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:12,719
one distinction that

2653
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:15,119
is clearly key from where you place it

2654
01:35:15,119 --> 01:35:16,719
in the paper and the emphasis and

2655
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:17,360
everything

2656
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:20,560
is inference with versus inference

2657
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:24,080
within a model and this is gonna sound

2658
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:26,159
like a subtlety because it's two letters

2659
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:28,800
that you're appending to the word but

2660
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,000
they're two letters that make

2661
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,719
a big difference so what would be sort

2662
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:34,400
of the map territory

2663
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:37,119
distinction how do we think about

2664
01:35:37,119 --> 01:35:39,119
inference with and within a model how do

2665
01:35:39,119 --> 01:35:40,080
we speak

2666
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:42,639
clearly about different things that are

2667
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:44,960
happening

2668
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:52,560
who's going to take that one

2669
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:56,080
shall i okay okay good

2670
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:58,080
i think i i insisted on keeping in this

2671
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:00,000
distinction

2672
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,600
throughout all phases of the co-writing

2673
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,520
process so i guess i'm responsible for

2674
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:04,880
now also

2675
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:08,880
explaining it coherently um

2676
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:12,400
i think the key distinction there is is

2677
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,320
to draw the distinction between a kind

2678
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:15,920
of

2679
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:19,360
everyday wave understanding modeling

2680
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:21,920
of saying well a model can be used by

2681
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:23,600
something external to the model

2682
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:25,280
to model something that's even external

2683
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:27,280
to that right so i guess perhaps the

2684
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:28,800
notion of construal might actually also

2685
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:30,159
be something right there is there's

2686
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:31,840
there's there there's a scientist or

2687
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:33,600
there there's a practice or so that

2688
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:34,639
construes

2689
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:38,080
and relates a model uh uh

2690
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:39,840
to some target phenomenon so that you

2691
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:42,159
can can do a predictive analysis or

2692
01:36:42,159 --> 01:36:44,880
or whatsoever uh and i think that's our

2693
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:45,760
everyday

2694
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:47,520
way of thinking about scientific

2695
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:48,800
inference

2696
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:51,840
um and then especially in the in the

2697
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:53,280
live as we know it papers at the first

2698
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:54,719
in 2014

2699
01:36:54,719 --> 01:36:58,000
uh paper something quite different

2700
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,320
is is is happening right so so in most

2701
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,080
of the predicted processing literature

2702
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:03,360
this distinction that really made made

2703
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:05,440
that explicit but in 2013

2704
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:08,639
that analysis is is

2705
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:10,960
not making clear how an agent or an

2706
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:14,480
animal can use a model to do something

2707
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:17,760
but shows makes a model and shows how

2708
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:20,560
somehow within that model a demacation

2709
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:20,960
between

2710
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:23,360
agent and environment starts to emerge

2711
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:25,840
and because of the demarcation

2712
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:28,960
uh uh an inferential relationship

2713
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:29,520
between

2714
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:31,679
agent and environment starts to emerge

2715
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:32,639
so there's now there's not

2716
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:34,320
there's not a user of that model but

2717
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:36,639
somehow within a model

2718
01:37:36,639 --> 01:37:39,040
their inferential relationship starts to

2719
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:40,880
starts to emerge and and so that's what

2720
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:42,400
we call the inference within

2721
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,080
a model the the emergence of the

2722
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:45,600
inferences within that model

2723
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:47,440
and the other one is something outside

2724
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:49,119
of the model is using the model to

2725
01:37:49,119 --> 01:37:50,639
predict something or

2726
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:52,239
capture something that that's supposed

2727
01:37:52,239 --> 01:37:54,239
to be this distinction maybe

2728
01:37:54,239 --> 01:37:56,719
maybe we'll think about a a better a

2729
01:37:56,719 --> 01:37:57,840
clearer

2730
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:59,679
semantic separation between those two

2731
01:37:59,679 --> 01:38:02,000
concepts that should be

2732
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,199
could be a part cool in the

2733
01:38:05,199 --> 01:38:08,320
four different kinds of

2734
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:11,360
i guess i want to say processes but

2735
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:14,719
the four different ways in which

2736
01:38:14,719 --> 01:38:16,560
inference is sometimes deployed to be

2737
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:18,400
talking about generative processes and

2738
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:19,440
generative

2739
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:22,239
models you know the generative process

2740
01:38:22,239 --> 01:38:22,719
is what

2741
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:24,639
actually the air moving through the

2742
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:26,159
house and the temperature as it's

2743
01:38:26,159 --> 01:38:27,440
actually changing

2744
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:29,119
and then the generative model the

2745
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:31,199
predictive thermometer

2746
01:38:31,199 --> 01:38:33,520
and there's other work that i know some

2747
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:34,560
of you have done

2748
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:36,320
about connecting systems that are

2749
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:37,600
probably less than

2750
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:40,639
lifelike and realizing that we can frame

2751
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:41,119
them

2752
01:38:41,119 --> 01:38:44,320
in a cybernetic context using these

2753
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:47,119
um same constructs which is really an

2754
01:38:47,119 --> 01:38:49,440
argument by demonstration

2755
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:51,280
almost about the philosophical points

2756
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:53,040
that you're trying to show

2757
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:54,400
it's like if somebody were making big

2758
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:57,040
claims about cybernetic systems and then

2759
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:58,560
someone said oh but it applies to a

2760
01:38:58,560 --> 01:38:59,360
thermometer

2761
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:01,199
so either you need to pull back your

2762
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:02,960
claims a little bit or

2763
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:04,719
it's fine if you think thermometers have

2764
01:39:04,719 --> 01:39:06,560
this attribute like regret

2765
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:08,480
that you're going to be studying but you

2766
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:10,719
don't get to say that the thermometer is

2767
01:39:10,719 --> 01:39:13,280
of course insentient yet it's doing what

2768
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,239
you say

2769
01:39:14,239 --> 01:39:17,440
is granting us sentience and these kinds

2770
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:19,040
of distinctions

2771
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:22,639
are not within active inference proper

2772
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:24,960
it's actually just about clarifying

2773
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:26,719
research directions

2774
01:39:26,719 --> 01:39:28,639
and learning about how we work on these

2775
01:39:28,639 --> 01:39:29,920
projects that go beyond

2776
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:32,639
the understanding of one person because

2777
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:34,480
there are a lot of technical elements so

2778
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:38,000
kind of um remind us of that earlier

2779
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,760
thread which is how are we all going to

2780
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:40,159
be

2781
01:39:40,159 --> 01:39:42,159
learning about this and working within

2782
01:39:42,159 --> 01:39:43,520
it and communicating within it

2783
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:46,400
when one could go deep into variational

2784
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:47,199
inference but

2785
01:39:47,199 --> 01:39:48,880
you know i'm not going to be the one to

2786
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:50,880
find that there's some deep quirk

2787
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:52,719
or assumption and variational inference

2788
01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:54,800
that invalidates some other technical

2789
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:57,360
piece of the puzzle so how do we almost

2790
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:57,920
um

2791
01:39:57,920 --> 01:39:59,280
kind of like the the doors in the

2792
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:01,280
titanic like separate

2793
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:04,159
different parts of our model so that we

2794
01:40:04,159 --> 01:40:05,040
at least know

2795
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:07,760
if one of them is going to be

2796
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:09,679
unsupported at this moment

2797
01:40:09,679 --> 01:40:12,719
or is is apt to even fail

2798
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:14,960
that the the there isn't a cascading

2799
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:16,239
failure

2800
01:40:16,239 --> 01:40:19,119
for our actual direction but rather

2801
01:40:19,119 --> 01:40:20,960
there's something that's modular

2802
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:24,560
that could be pulled out

2803
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:27,760
yeah i think there's lots of things that

2804
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:29,520
are lots of things about

2805
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:30,719
energy principle that are actually

2806
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:32,800
pretty trivial and some

2807
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:34,080
lots of things that are actually pretty

2808
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:36,320
uh speculative and

2809
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:39,119
high stakes and and indeed having some

2810
01:40:39,119 --> 01:40:40,719
of the democrats that we make in our

2811
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:41,679
paper

2812
01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:44,159
i guess allows you to separate some some

2813
01:40:44,159 --> 01:40:45,520
empirical methods that are

2814
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:49,040
that are useful and and and kind of

2815
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:52,320
non non non-controversial uh

2816
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:55,040
separated indeed from from what we call

2817
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:55,520
boo

2818
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:57,520
uh the kind of blanket oriented ontology

2819
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:58,719
which is uh

2820
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:02,800
a big idea which we which we are kind of

2821
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:04,560
skeptical about uh at least

2822
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:07,440
i am i'm not sure i speak for all the uh

2823
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:08,159
uh

2824
01:41:08,159 --> 01:41:10,000
uh co-authors but at least it has a

2825
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,840
different epistemic stages than the

2826
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:13,199
everyday bread and butter

2827
01:41:13,199 --> 01:41:16,000
active inference that people are using

2828
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,400
and so separating those out a little bit

2829
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:19,840
uh using the different concepts and

2830
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:21,280
different assumptions that are made by

2831
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:21,679
each

2832
01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:26,080
each approach uh probably also can give

2833
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:27,600
gives a better overview of the field and

2834
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:29,280
the things you need to buy into and

2835
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:30,719
don't necessarily need to buy into if

2836
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:33,840
you want to work with

2837
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:38,880
cool um dave then anyone else raising

2838
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:40,960
their hat

2839
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:44,840
yeah i'm going to ask a question not

2840
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:46,080
about

2841
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:50,800
status or stature or number of papers

2842
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:55,600
what influence has the personality

2843
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:58,960
of carl fristen had on the development

2844
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:02,719
of these fields

2845
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:09,679
i want to go and break another lunch

2846
01:42:09,679 --> 01:42:10,320
like

2847
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:14,400
in in his favor um

2848
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:17,040
i haven't worked like directly with carl

2849
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:20,159
uh unless like on really small projects

2850
01:42:20,159 --> 01:42:23,679
but he is just an extremely nice and

2851
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:25,440
kind person

2852
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:27,280
i think it is as simple as that like it

2853
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:28,960
is really hard

2854
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:31,600
not to to get along with them on some

2855
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:32,560
level

2856
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:35,280
so i mean i want to be positive in a

2857
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:37,679
sense to say that

2858
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:41,280
it is really hard not to

2859
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:43,360
not to want to work with with such a

2860
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:46,000
nice person

2861
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:48,639
if we want to talk about that like

2862
01:42:48,639 --> 01:42:50,800
trying like to stay away say from

2863
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:53,600
from his influence and his you know his

2864
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:56,480
status across fields it's just an

2865
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:58,400
incredibly nice person

2866
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:01,920
and even if sometimes you know there are

2867
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:04,080
some misunderstandings in communications

2868
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:04,639
there is

2869
01:43:04,639 --> 01:43:07,199
i don't know uh there is a sense in

2870
01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:08,400
which

2871
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:11,199
you feel like you want to work with that

2872
01:43:11,199 --> 01:43:13,599
person

2873
01:43:14,239 --> 01:43:17,360
i agree and also beyond niceness it is

2874
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:18,560
reflected

2875
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:21,520
through action and and mentorship and

2876
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:22,719
collaboration

2877
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:25,199
but also it's yes yellow and anyone else

2878
01:43:25,199 --> 01:43:26,560
as well

2879
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:29,360
you know i can only uh uh second that i

2880
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:30,480
i spent some time

2881
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:34,960
in uh at ucl in in in this group

2882
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:38,239
i guess for for

2883
01:43:38,239 --> 01:43:40,560
for outsiders and for brandings so you

2884
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:42,480
might think sometimes that that carl is

2885
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:43,760
able to speak a bit

2886
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:46,960
uh too well right so listening to him

2887
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:48,400
if you don't really understand what he's

2888
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:50,080
saying it sounds

2889
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:53,360
it sounds enigmatic it sounds it sounds

2890
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:54,159
fascinating

2891
01:43:54,159 --> 01:43:57,840
and it sounds it is but it also sounds

2892
01:43:57,840 --> 01:43:59,840
incredibly clever right and so

2893
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:03,679
um uh i guess in terms of branding right

2894
01:44:03,679 --> 01:44:04,080
i mean

2895
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:06,239
what what what we see a lot now is that

2896
01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:07,920
there is a kind of

2897
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:09,920
uh circle of people who really

2898
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:12,080
understand the stuff that's going on

2899
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:14,560
and and a group of people who are also

2900
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:16,560
put off by it a little bit because

2901
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:18,320
it it seems so intimidating from the

2902
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:20,239
outside and and uh

2903
01:44:20,239 --> 01:44:21,840
i think that that's something that fpp

2904
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:23,840
as a whole kind of struggles with a

2905
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:24,560
little bit

2906
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:27,199
uh uh that it might seem a little bit

2907
01:44:27,199 --> 01:44:28,480
esoteric if you're if you're not

2908
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:29,520
familiar uh

2909
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:32,400
uh uh with with with the keywords with

2910
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:34,800
haven't worked on that for for a while

2911
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:36,080
uh and i think that that's probably

2912
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:37,600
sparkled but just these these kind of

2913
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:40,000
fantastic uh

2914
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,679
lectures that carl's able to get they're

2915
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:43,360
all over youtube and so

2916
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:45,520
and they're they're they're they're hard

2917
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:48,239
to get on the first go

2918
01:44:48,239 --> 01:44:51,679
yeah and it's also notable

2919
01:44:51,679 --> 01:44:54,719
that the 2013 single author

2920
01:44:54,719 --> 01:44:57,840
paper life as we know it um

2921
01:44:57,840 --> 01:44:59,600
it serves as a lightning rod for a lot

2922
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:02,000
of critique as does his 2010

2923
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:05,199
paper uh unified brain theory

2924
01:45:05,199 --> 01:45:08,000
and they're both i hesitate to call them

2925
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:08,400
old

2926
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:09,679
because they're less than you know a

2927
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:11,440
decade old in some cases but

2928
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:13,840
in terms of our current environment

2929
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:16,320
there's been a lot between then and now

2930
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:20,480
and also their single author and so

2931
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:23,360
let him speak and represent what he

2932
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:24,960
wants to share

2933
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:27,760
just like every author and collaboration

2934
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:29,679
and then there's a ton of nuance and a

2935
01:45:29,679 --> 01:45:31,520
lot of development that's happened

2936
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:34,159
and i totally also resonate with the um

2937
01:45:34,159 --> 01:45:35,199
criticism that many

2938
01:45:35,199 --> 01:45:37,119
raise or at least the point that it is a

2939
01:45:37,119 --> 01:45:38,960
rapidly developing field so it's like oh

2940
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:40,560
active inference can't deal with long

2941
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:42,560
time steps aha but then have you thought

2942
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:43,040
about

2943
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:45,760
sophisticated active inference and so it

2944
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:46,800
does become

2945
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:48,480
a little bit of this sort of like

2946
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:50,239
criticism development criticism

2947
01:45:50,239 --> 01:45:51,199
development

2948
01:45:51,199 --> 01:45:53,280
which actually reminds me of daniel

2949
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:54,400
dennett's book

2950
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:56,960
darwin's dangerous idea and he says

2951
01:45:56,960 --> 01:45:58,800
evolution by natural selection

2952
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:01,280
is the theory that's describing itself

2953
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:03,040
because it is improving itself

2954
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:05,520
and someone says well evolution doesn't

2955
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:07,679
include ecology or development or

2956
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:10,000
evolution okay well then we make ego evo

2957
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,159
and then we go from there and so there's

2958
01:46:12,159 --> 01:46:13,280
sort of

2959
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:15,360
um a little bit of a blurriness between

2960
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:16,719
who's the detractor

2961
01:46:16,719 --> 01:46:18,880
and who's actually out in front pulling

2962
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:21,360
the theory where it needs to be

2963
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:23,360
and that's also where cognitive

2964
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:25,199
diversity comes into play

2965
01:46:25,199 --> 01:46:41,839
and just we're all single

2966
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:49,119
blue and then anyone else

2967
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:52,239
so just to kind of piggyback off of what

2968
01:46:52,239 --> 01:46:54,159
you said i i always think

2969
01:46:54,159 --> 01:46:57,280
um you know especially in our culture

2970
01:46:57,280 --> 01:46:59,440
we have like this idea that there's a

2971
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:01,040
leader or a creator

2972
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:03,520
and in this situation it's carl fristin

2973
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:04,800
right so

2974
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:07,360
is there a leader or a creator of the

2975
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:08,320
field or

2976
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:23,840
has it become it's single-handedly

2977
01:47:28,239 --> 01:47:29,600
invented a light bulb that's not how it

2978
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:31,520
happened but but we you know we kind of

2979
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:33,040
think this way and we've kind of placed

2980
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:35,280
first in in the leadership role here

2981
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:36,960
but but really i think that there's a

2982
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:38,320
lot going on underneath

2983
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:40,880
the curtains or underneath the blankets

2984
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:42,639
right

2985
01:47:42,639 --> 01:47:45,920
i agree and it's it's a meta

2986
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:48,320
problem with science communication like

2987
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:49,440
the 2018

2988
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:54,080
wired article which the title be a

2989
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:05,840
singular

2990
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:12,000
person and about something about their

2991
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,280
endocortex

2992
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:17,119
not this dedicated researcher

2993
01:48:17,119 --> 01:48:19,600
has built a network and tools for 30

2994
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:20,400
years

2995
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:22,880
that are inspiring the next generation

2996
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:23,840
of

2997
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:27,280
researchers to make impact it doesn't

2998
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:28,320
fit quite as well

2999
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:30,880
in the headline and so it's like a

3000
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:33,040
communication and a meta communication

3001
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:36,480
question communicating about how these

3002
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:38,080
uh fields actually

3003
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:40,560
work and yeah there's going to be a lot

3004
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:42,159
of interesting times ahead on those

3005
01:48:42,159 --> 01:48:44,960
frontiers i think

3006
01:48:45,119 --> 01:48:47,280
any sort of closing thoughts or maybe we

3007
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:49,679
could go around and just give a

3008
01:48:49,679 --> 01:48:51,920
last little thought or something that

3009
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:54,000
we're excited or curious about

3010
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,400
for next week's discussion when i'll fix

3011
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:57,840
it and we'll be able to include

3012
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:02,000
participants live also thanks manuel for

3013
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:05,119

good to have that
