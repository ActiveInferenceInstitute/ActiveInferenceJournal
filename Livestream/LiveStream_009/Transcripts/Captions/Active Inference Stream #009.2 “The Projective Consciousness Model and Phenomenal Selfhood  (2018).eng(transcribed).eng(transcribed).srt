and let's use respectful speech behavior

33
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,680
just some quick updates on upcoming

34
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,799
active streams

35
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,759
today we are in 9.2 december 1st talking

36
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:16,240
about

37
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,080
this projective consciousness model

38
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,600
paper and

39
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,280
in the rest of december we'll be talking

40
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,600
about two papers on december 8th and

41
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,320
15th

42
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,600
we'll be in actin 10 on a variational

43
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,040
approach to scripts

44
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,159
and on december 22nd and 29th will be in

45
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,439
active 11 on sophisticated effective

46
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,159
inference so two cool and very

47
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,600
interesting papers that we'll be getting

48
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,320
to

49
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,799
but today in action nine we're still

50
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,640
continuing our discussion of projective

51
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,079
consciousness model

52
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,200
first we're gonna have some

53
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,280
introductions and warm-ups

54
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,920
then we'll go through 9.2 as with

55
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,960
previous times

56
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,960
the projective consciousness model paper

57
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,439
by willowford at all 2018.

58
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,360
and in last conversation in 9.1 and 9.0

59
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,439
we talked about some of the groundwork

60
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,439
and the aims and claims of the paper as

61
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,280
well as going through the abstract and

62
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,639
the roadmap

63
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,878
today especially because we're lucky

64
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,120
enough to have an author on board

65
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,959
we're going to be talking about a few

66
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,520
deeper and auxiliary questions

67
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,840
as well as going through a few key

68
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,760
quotations and talking about maybe some

69
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,800
of the implications

70
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,520
for the paper and then as always we'll

71
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,000
return to the figures and ask what each

72
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,480
figure

73
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,080
is representing or invoking so

74
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,000
cool to have this discussion today and

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
then different papers in 10 and 11

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,760
and then we'll have a whole new suite of

77
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,680
papers in 2021

78
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,280
so get in touch with us if you want to

79
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,360
participate first though

80
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,840
with our nice small group today let's

81
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,280
introduce ourselves

82
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,280
we'll go around and give a short

83
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,800
introduction or a check-in

84
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
and then just pass it to somebody who

85
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,239
has not spoken yet

86
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,040
so i'm daniel i'm in california and i

87
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,400
will pass it to adam

88
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,760
uh hi um i'm adam uh adam saffron i'm

university as a

91
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,519
postdoctoral researcher and um

92
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,480
i'm very interested in consciousness and

93
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:18,879
uh

94
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,200
recently came up with a theory i called

95
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,040
integrated world modeling theory

96
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,920
which has uh a lot of overlap with uh

97
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,599
david's work and

98
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,360
which i find to be really fascinating

99
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,799

and somebody work on trying to

108
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,360
model the role of consciousness

109
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,879
including its phenomenal aspects in

110
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,799
let's put it that way generally speaking

111
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,480
biological cybernetics and more

112
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,840
particularly

synapses form in the developing brain

120

to participatory theater approaches

132
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,840
and the use of landscapes to explore

133
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,919
themes

134
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,880
and back to daniel i believe that

135
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,479
introduces our

136
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,280
nice group today as far as the warm-up

137
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,160
questions go

138
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,240
we'll just have people raise their hand

139
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,720
whenever they feel like it and

140
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,320
i'll just drop out the first two

141
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,479
questions at the beginning

142
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,880
and they are what interests you about

143
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,120
studying consciousness and what is a way

144
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,639
that we can study it

145
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,199
so both david and adam i know you've

146
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,400
thought a lot about

147
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,000
this maybe one of you two would want to

148
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,840
go first um here

149
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,680
yeah david it's just how did you get to

150
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,320
this uh

151
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,039
area it's a it's just something long

152
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:47,840
story but

153
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,520
to make it shorter uh let's put it that

154
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,160
way it's

155
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,639
really related to philosophical and

156
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,240
existential equation

157
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,759
and the quest for turning this type of

158
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,280
question into something

159
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,800
scientific but actually i was not that

160
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,240
interested in psychology when

161
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,240
i was younger i wanted to be either an

162
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,440
astrophysicist

163
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,880
or a a conductor you know of orchestra

164
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,199
but

165
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,639
no i did not

166
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,759
interesting it's a different type of

167
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,759
coordination that you're

168
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,319
achieving now uh stephen and then anyone

169
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,360
else who wants to raise their hand

170
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,080
yeah i'm interested in consciousness

171
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,759
it's in a way it's kind of a late

172
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,960
arrival because i

173
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,600
am i always thought that was something

174
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,880
esoteric that i

175
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,000
couldn't really participate in but um

176
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,639
and i've suddenly seen this has started

177
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,479
to come center stage

178
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,680
um and in both this active inference

179
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,000
world

180
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,800
but also being talked about more in in

181
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,120
in the participatory theater environment

182
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,319
so you know what what does it mean to be

183
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,800
consciously aware to have imagination

184
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,479
and what i

185
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,039
think is quite interesting is to try and

186
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,919
move beyond this kind of pan-psychic

187
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,919
um approach that seems to permeate

188
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,800
um a lot of people who actually go there

189
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,440
um

190
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,880
either it's either something that's

191
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,960
ignored and pushed to the side

192
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,759
or it's everywhere and everything in

193
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,440
this pan psychic and what i

194
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,039
am really interested is like how can it

195
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,800
be engaged in a kind of

196
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,720
in terms of how we are reflective or

197
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,080
reflexive

198
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,400
or participatory and what consciousness

199
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
means in terms of talking to people who

200
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,440
aren't the same as us

201
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,800
interesting definitely the coming from a

202
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,160
different perspective

203
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,160
is something that's baked into this type

204
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,599
of a framing because yeah

205
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:44,639
everyone's coming from a different

206
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,240
perspective that's our starting point

207
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,000
that's not our conclusion here and then

208
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,280
there's questions about how we're going

209
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,400
to coordinate

210
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,360
amidst that so we could either have

211
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,720
anyone else raise their hand on these

212
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,560
questions or i'll just put up this

213
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,280
special point two question which is what

214
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,720
is something that you have thought about

215
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,520
differently

216
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,520
after reading the paper or participating

217
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,360
in last week's discussion

218
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,000
and for me it was actually uh biking in

219
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,840
the morning and seeing the moon just

220
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,160
look

221
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,599
massive and thinking about that illusion

222
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,479
in the context of the projection and

223
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,759
what we talked about

224
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,520
last week as well as some other

225
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,520
literature by these authors

226
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,280
so i just thought what might be some

227
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,520
differentiable experiences some little

228
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,879
tests that we could do

229
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,440
that would be able to capture

230
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,199
differences between the projective

231
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,039
model and other models of consciousness

232
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,159
i didn't really have an answer but it

233
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,599
was just something i was thinking about

234
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,799
after our discussion anyone else um

235
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,279
after reading the paper or participating

236
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,479
in the discussion

237
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,680
stephen well one thing that it was

238
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,399
really helpful

239
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,040
this unpacking the diagrams last week

240
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,720
and i noticed that

241
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,839
there was that box for the head on

242
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,640
of of the perspective the consciousness

243
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,720
perspectival consciousness

244
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
and it suddenly made me realize that yes

245
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,640
this can bridge more back into the

246
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,920
embodied work

247
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,000
because it i had a discussion about this

248
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,160
paper before with someone who's in

249
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,560
theater and interested in kind of

250
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,560
some of this more kind of esoterical

251
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,160
kind of ways of knowing

252
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,480
but i'm trying to find a way to bridge

253
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,920
it back to

254
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,399
the embodied sort of inactive work and i

255
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,680
sort of by seeing it

256
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,600
in the in their kind of head i suddenly

257
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,080
realized okay it still does come back to

258
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,480
the physicality so that was really

259
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,360
really useful for me

260
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,640
cool cool sasha

261
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,279
um yeah after last week i just began

262
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,560
seeing everything as

263
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,240
um you know more more geometrical

264
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,920
and thinking about um uh people

265
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,640
and their behavior as projections um

266
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,080
kind of

267
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,880
yeah um recognizing that we're always

268
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,440
seeing

269
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,920
just one side or one perspective of

270
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,120
someone's behavior

271
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,040
and um specifically that that geb logo

272
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,240
it just uh that's all i could see

273
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,600
right with the light from the different

274
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,399
sides showing the different letters geb

275
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,040
yeah and we'll come back to geb a little

276
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,880
bit later in this discussion

277
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,519
any other thoughts from the panelists on

278
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,279
these warm-up questions otherwise i'm

279
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,480
sure there'll be a lot to

280
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,399
get into a lot of tangents to go off on

281
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,160
too cool

282
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,240
all right david go ahead

283
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,720
no i will just i just wanted to say that

284
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,000
there would be a lot to

285
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,680
to say about the points and question

286
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,680
that was raised but perhaps we can

287
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,480
not do that now and go through the

288
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,120
stream

289
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,320
and see your questions come about great

290
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,120
so today in this discussion as with our

291
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,959
last two weeks we've been talking about

292
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,959
the projective consciousness model

293
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,200
and phenomenal selfhood which is a paper

294
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,000
in frontiers in psychology december 2018

295
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,240
by willaford at all and thanks david

296
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,000
again for coming out to the stream it's

297
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,399
always

298
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,440
awesome to have the authors the aims and

299
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,640
claims of the paper

300
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,600
we did go through in a previous week but

301
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,240
david just

302
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,600
i'm curious here how do you

303
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,519
present this work or how do you

304
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,279
introduce this topic to different

305
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,720
audiences

306
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,000
who might have familiarity with

307
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
different topics like how do you

308
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,680
frame the aims in the claims of the

309
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,000
paper

310
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,600
so lately i've been particularly talking

311
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,560
in

312
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,600
context where you know people come from

313
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,560
artificial intelligence robotics virtual

314
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,519
reality

315
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,079
um uh with you know of course some

316
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,360
more broader philosophical interests

317
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,880
and i generally try to frame it starting

318
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,680
a bit like you did i mean from the

319
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,560
question of

320
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,160
you know what we could call biological

321
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,399
cybernetics and you elaborated on that

322
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:52,959
term

323
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,399
before and how active inference

324
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,440
for situated autonomous system you know

325
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,240
with

326
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,440
survival challenges uh is an interesting

327
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,320
padding to

328
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,440
understand uh cognition within

329
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,399
biological cybernetics and then i come

330
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,800
to the question of what would be then

331
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,839
the role in that process of

332
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,320
uh what you know we into it as being

333
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,360
consciousness

334
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,040
what we can say about it emphasizing the

335
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,200
big and important challenge of

336
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,079
connecting

337
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,120
let's put it that way for short you know

338
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,519
the

339
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,079
phenomenology of subjective experience

340
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:32,639
is

341
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,920
some aspect of it with for lack of a

342
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,480
better word functions

343
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,760
why do we perceive and imagine the world

344
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,760
the way and all the earth and ourself in

345
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,519
the world the way we seem to do at a

346
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,959
certain level

347
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,000
and how that actually

348
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,079
how can we make sense of that to

349
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,200
understand

350
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,240
computational in some sense process that

351
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,200
are key

352
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,320
to you know adapt adaptation

353
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,120
uh you know resilience in the context of

354
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,240
biological cybernetics

355
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,079
thanks for that and i think it was

356
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,440
really clear how you

357
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,519
laid out that connection in the paper

358
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,120
basically there's the functions of

359
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,800
consciousness which we'll go through

360
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,839
soon and then there's the uh subjective

361
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:18,639
aspects

362
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,120
which were captured in the invariance

363
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,160
and the pcm

364
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,760
is like a bridge that's going to be

365
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,079
connecting the subjective invariance of

366
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:26,959
consciousness

367
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,120
to some of these functional attributes

368
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,800
and so we're kind of going from

369
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,760
point a to point b across a specific

370
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,320
river

371
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,320
and so if we can really be clear about

372
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,079
which sites on the riverbank we're

373
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,680
building from and then be really clear

374
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,880
about what the bridge is

375
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,040
and isn't then we'll have a really good

376
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,880
discussion about consciousness

377
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,519
as opposed to just swirling around and

378
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,360
thinking it does everything and nothing

379
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,360
it's everything and nothing at once and

380
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,160
all these things so any thoughts on the

381
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,839
aims and claims from anyone else

382
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,160
otherwise we'll just go through to the

383
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,279
next section

384
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,199
cool yep we have a lot of questions

385
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,560
coming up so

386
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,040
in uh previous weeks we looked through

387
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,240
the abstract

388
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,160
sentence by sentence just to understand

389
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,639
how the authors were taking the free

390
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,120
energy

391
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,279
energy minimizing approach of active

392
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,120
inference biological cybernetics

393
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,760
and then connecting this to a few other

394
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,480
areas

395
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,279
such as geometry and the embedded

396
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,560
psychology

397
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,279
and uh that was the abstract in the

398
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,240
roadmap

399
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,040
we had the sort of outline of where they

400
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,360
go

401
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,800
they start with an introduction and go

402
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,880
straight to the methodology and then

403
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,040
talk about the two river banks in that

404
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,160
previous metaphor

405
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,279
that we want to connect the

406
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,040
phenomenological invariance of

407
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,480
experience and then the functional

408
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,079
features of consciousness

409
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,079
and then sets up the problem in a way

410
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,440
that hopefully could be

411
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,480
solved so maybe uh david i'm curious

412
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,199
like

413
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,160
in other papers how have you structured

414
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,959
it differently

415
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,760
or this was in 2018 what have you been

416
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,240
um

417
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,760
like wishing that could have been

418
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,600
explained more or where have you

419
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,560
bolstered the theory since then all

420
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:02,880
right

421
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,079
that's a huge uh question um

422
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,279
so number one uh kenneth williford the

423
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,959
first order of this paper

424
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,880
we expected him to join i don't know if

425
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,480
he will join later

426
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,519
he is a friend of mine and

427
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,000
that i admire for the quality of his

428
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,040
mind

429
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,079
the philosopher and so the structure of

430
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,600
this particular paper

431
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,920
we look at today is i think deeply

432
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,040
informed

433
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,000
by his you know philosophical methods

434
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,120
if you were to read the first paper

435
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,480
we published on the topics in the

436
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,639
journal of biological theoretical

437
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,720
biology sorry

438
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,079
in 2017 you you would find a

439
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,360
two word either but a very different way

440
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,720
of presenting

441
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,320
but they are totally consistent with

442
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,800
each other and uh

443
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,040
in both case you know it's still working

444
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,800
progress so there are still a lot of

445
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,839
questions and

446
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,399
of course we are not claiming that we

447
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,759
explain everything

448
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,920
by far we're trying to restrict

449
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,519
ourselves to things we think we can

450
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,480
frame in

451
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,000
a classical scientific framework

452
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,759
and you know i've been working for years

453
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,199
now in my lab and

454
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,040
we are actually finishing a paper on

455
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,800
that

456
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,160
to integrate in this

457
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,000
in general based on the general

458
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
principle of this model

459
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,079
in addition to um visual illusion as we

460
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,320
did recently in the moon illusion paper

461
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,880
that was published in 2020

462
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,639
uh mechanism of effective and social

463
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,519
appraisal and processing in social

464
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,720
perspective taking

465
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,959
based on projected geometry notably but

466
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,279
not only

467
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,320
to model and understand how

468
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,680
artificial agent virtual robotics

469
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,399
as a model of yourself if you wish can

470
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,839
do theory of mind

471
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,800
and how that plays a role in emotion

472
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,399
regulation

473
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,000
adaptation of behavior um and that's

474
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
basically what i've been doing and

475
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,760
entrance interestingly

476
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,359
without taking too long and there are uh

477
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,400
some studies from psychophysics that

478
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,640
that show or that you know based on

479
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,520
empirical

480
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,119
data that uh if you are confronted with

481
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:23,439
an

482
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,319
object or something you you if you feel

483
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,039
is dangerous

484
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,280
like for instance a snake or for some

485
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,679
phobic for instance

486
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,520
intensity of your fear will be a

487
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,640
function of the inverse more or less the

488
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,840
inverse of the distance

489
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,320
of the object and that has been

490
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,360
formalized as

491
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,360
being you know something you can

492
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,559
identify with

493
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,720
an empirical psychophysical law called

494
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,000
stephen's law

495
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,160
with a certain type of exponent and as

496
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,400
it turns out actually uh the projective

497
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,360
geometrical framing just gives you that

498
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,080
naturally it transforms information

499
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,880
probably the size the apparent size of

500
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,600
objects

501
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,799
according under certain constraints to

502
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,960
a law in that is the inverse from the

503
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,840
distance

504
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,160
more or less so you can recover things

505
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,600
that have been documented before and

506
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,200
understand how they may play a role in

507
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,240
appraisal

508
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,480
something i fear when it's closer it's

509
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,480
bigger it takes more of my field of

510
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,039
consciousness if you wish to make it

511
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,720
simpler and so one way of motivating my

512
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,000
behavior of for instance

513
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,320
avoidance is imagining myself further so

514
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,679
the thing is smaller

515
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,679
takes less space and as a result it has

516
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,840
less impact following the very same role

517
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,400
we're

518
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,480
discussing and therefore that will

519
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,559
minimize my free energy and i will

520
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,120
move away and i do that with robots and

521
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,880
things like that

522
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,559
huh very cool yeah i'm imagining this

523
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:48,880
like

524
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,120
fear is proportional to one over

525
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,400
distance something in that

526
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,200
family of equations uh like a bus that's

527
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,760
a 100 feet away not scary 50 feet away

528
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,840
not scary it's still on the flat part of

529
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,720
the fear curve

530
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,480
and then it gets exponentially higher

531
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,240
when it gets closer to you and takes up

532
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,840
more of your field of vision

533
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,320
so um and then there's also long

534
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,440
distance threats

535
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,200
somebody with a projectile or something

536
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,480
like that and so

537
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,720
that entails a causal model where

538
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,160
somebody who's doing a certain action

539
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,039
might be able to

540
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,679
make an object quite big in your face

541
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,600
very soon but maybe it's not quite there

542
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,280
yet but it could happen rapidly

543
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,120
so that's kind of an interesting take

544
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,799
yeah so the point here is

545
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,320
in along the line of what they were

546
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,919
saying trying to understand

547
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,000
what is or what could be some aspect of

548
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,679
the causal role of consciousness

549
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,080
in things like appraisal and motivation

550
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,120
of behavior

551
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,880
here the point that we make is that

552
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,360
actually the spatial structuring that we

553
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,400
put first

554
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,600
based on projected geometry implies

555
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,799
naturally something about you know

556
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,880
relative size that is consistent with

557
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,280
psychophysics and so it's to say that

558
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,640
you find somehow this con

559
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,520
structuration of space by consciousness

560
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,120
act as a sort of lens

561
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,760
a magnifying device if you think about

562
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,880
it that way

563
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,080
that in virtue of its own geometry

564
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,080
will have an impact that you know can

565
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,520
then be used

566
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,600
for other aspects of motivation and

567
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,200
programming of behavior in the context

568
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,520
of active influence

569
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,919
so maybe we'll get back to this

570
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:20,799
intermodal

571
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,520
area again but that's the visual field

572
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:23,919
and

573
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,880
uh not all organisms or humans may have

574
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,600
the visual

575
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,440
field but it's clear that the spatial

576
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,679
objects we visualize them in space

577
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,120
and uh there's something similar though

578
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,480
like if there's a lot of noise in the

579
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,159
background but something is what you're

580
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,880
taking up your field of audio awareness

581
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,480
and so it's like in each of our senses

582
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,280
there can be

583
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,400
a sense like a sensory um expansion

584
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,000
of focus greetings lee just play on

585
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,159
we're just continuing the discussion but

586
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,720
go ahead there david

587
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,400
yes so one of the essential thing

588
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,240
we emphasize is that it's actually not

589
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,799
just the visual field is the it is the

590
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:03,600
cognition of

591
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,640
space as in form in a multi-modal manner

592
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,600
you know through audio you may recognize

593
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,120
object and all of a sudden you kind of

594
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,960
have an image of sort of

595
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,360
a spatial representation of that object

596
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,960
as if you could see it even though you

597
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,080
don't see it

598
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,200
blind people do that all the time they

599
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,559
have actually perspectival

600
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,520
representation

601
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,240
and they represent object in space based

602
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,240
on other sensory channels there is an

603
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,240
inference that is being made and the

604
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,520
idea is that consciousness

605
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,919
operates at some level of abstractions

606
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,440
once you have actually extracted

607
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,679
information

608
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,559
from different sense modalities and then

609
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,080
they become spatial

610
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,000
objects if you wish with variety of

611
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,400
properties that you put in perspective

612
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,080
in that field of consciousness

613
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,320
and based on which you will operate at

614
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,200
the conscious

615
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,320
level if that makes any sense yep

616
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,240
interesting it's like it's so hard

617
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,320
sometimes to disentangle from the

618
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,919
eyes vision perception debacle

619
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,919
nightmare because we know that we're not

620
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,039
experiencing what

621
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,640
photons hit our retina we know it's a

622
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,320
generative model and you're really

623
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,039
taking it

624
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,200
to the next level and it's like no

625
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,480
you're not even just seeing a generative

626
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,720
model of the visual field you're seeing

627
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,280
this

628
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,159
extremely integra you're quote seeing

629
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:18,480
this

630
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,120
integrated field of consciousness and

631
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:21,679
that

632
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,799
um may depend on your visual abilities

633
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:25,120
or

634
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,360
your acuity but it also something that's

635
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,320
quite

636
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,360
uh derived from intermodal stimuli and

637
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,799
uh yeah well that's cool stuff let's get

638
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:35,280
to this

639
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,559
projective geometry idea and we

640
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,960
as non-geometers talked about it a

641
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,039
little bit in previous discussions

642
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,799
and just tried to capture a few of these

643
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,640
points that you said were

644
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,120
differing critically between euclidean

645
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,559
and non-euclidean

646
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,520
geometries so i'm just curious and

647
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,640
perhaps those who are

648
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,559
not familiar with hearing about geometry

649
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,840
and consciousness

650
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,240
in the same sentence just what is it

651
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,120
that brings

652
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,400
geometry to the table and how do we

653
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,640
end up even talking about geometry and

654
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,840
consciousness together

655
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,159
excellent question so first of all a

656
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,840
little disclaimer

657
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,760
i'm not a mathematician even though

658
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,000
since i understood early on that

659
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
what i was trying to do required to

660
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,919
think mathematically in a fairly

661
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,919
advanced way i've banged my head to try

662
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:24,799
to progress

663
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,840
but i'm privileged to work with real and

664
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,320
very you know good mathematicians

665
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,640
so that helps but nevertheless i can

666
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,520
give you

667
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,039
to the limit of my knowledge some info

668
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,120
about it number one i would say

669
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,400
generally speaking

670
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,679
uh you know if experience

671
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,159
one conspicuous aspect of experience of

672
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,679
subjective experience

673
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,120
is a spatial manifestation not all

674
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,039
experience reduced to space

675
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,360
but a big chunk of it is involves it so

676
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,200
it's good from a scientific standpoint

677
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,720
because then it becomes something you

678
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,840
can think about mathematically

679
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,279
a lot of models in let's put it that way

680
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,679
in cognitive science has been based on

681
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,760
information processing sometimes very

682
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,960
formal model like

683
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,880
you know advanced bayesian models or

684
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,200
even active inference

685
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,520
and so there is a lot of emphasis on the

686
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,640
mathematics of

687
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,080
information theory so to speak and here

688
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,360
the notion is that

689
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,640
in order to bridge information

690
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,640
processing if you wish

691
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,480
with aspect of experience as manifested

692
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,840
as a space geometry comes obviously as a

693
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,679
scientific object as a mathematical

694
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:40,240
object

695
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,600
uh as something you know necessary

696
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,159
so the the the challenge is then to

697
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,080
understand how to articulate information

698
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,600
theory with geometry

699
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,000
in order to have a fuller account of you

700
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,279
know the process

701
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,880
so then now on the uh specifics of

702
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,840
projected geometry it starts from you

703
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,159
know

704
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,840
trying to find some let's call it that

705
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,120
way phenomenological invariant that

706
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,279
most people would agree upon to a

707
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,720
certain extent

708
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,520
considering experience introspectively

709
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,799
it appears that

710
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,679
it's obvious in vision but i claim it's

711
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:18,720
general in

712
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,679
both perception and imagination that the

713
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,039
way we

714
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,200
quote and quote represent the world

715
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,039
let's not enter into the metaphysics of

716
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,480
a presentation let's use it in a

717
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,120
pragmatic

718
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,720
way here this notion of representation

719
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,679
is in perspective you know obviously

720
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:36,640
parallel lines

721
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,760
do not appear to us in region as

722
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,440
parallel but they converge

723
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,840
at a certain vanishing point to what

724
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,600
infinity

725
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,159
there is an horizon and it's

726
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,080
three-dimensional it's not like just the

727
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,480
projection of a 3d world of an image we

728
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,440
experience it

729
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,279
with a sense of depth and i argue that's

730
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,200
the same when you imagine yourself

731
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,880
somewhere or

732
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,960
considering something aiming at

733
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,559
something you know the notion of aiming

734
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,320
at is very important in the

735
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,640
phenomenological tradition in philosophy

736
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,080
it's not just about

737
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,840
visual vision it's about spatial aiming

738
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,960
and in all the circumstances

739
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,159
the world is mapped is there a

740
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,919
world that seems to correspond to a

741
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,400
surrounding a world that corresponds to

742
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,360
seeing we remember

743
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,279
or even a totally fantasy world of

744
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,279
things that may never exist

745
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,279
every single time we build a

746
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,520
experience in consciousness the point is

747
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,520
that there is a perspective that is

748
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,640
being taken

749
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,400
with these properties of having an

750
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,080
elusive point of view

751
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,200
somewhat in perception we tend to feel

752
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,679
it

753
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,679
in we feel that we are in the middle of

754
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,120
that space so that the origin is

755
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,799
somewhere in your head perhaps

756
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,559
but that's not uh necessarily the case

757
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,520
uh and that's not something that we can

758
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,000
uh

759
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,080
identify as like the way we could

760
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,080
identify the location of an object in

761
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,520
space it's a music

762
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,440
something that the phenomenologist has

763
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,799
talked about a lot

764
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,440
and it's in perspective so if you take

765
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,600
those two things

766
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,080
an origin of the projection or of the

767
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,000
point of view that is illusive

768
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,159
and a three-dimensional representation

769
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,640
of space that is in perspective

770
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,000
then the only geometry and the

771
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,840
the geometry that account for that is

772
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,520
projective geometry

773
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,840
and here since we say the space is in

774
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,360
three dimension

775
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,080
uh there is this notion of you know left

776
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,520
right up down and

777
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,399
and forward and backward uh it's a

778
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,480
three-dimensional projective space

779
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,799
and then that means that this space is

780
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,159
ruled by the

781
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,559
so-called projective transformation that

782
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:47,200
are

783
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,039
specific type of transformation that

784
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,279
comes from a group of transformations

785
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,200
that transform perspective into that

786
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,399
space

787
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,159
so for instance you can transform a

788
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,080
point of view

789
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,520
from the point of view i have here

790
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,360
looking at the screen to an imaginary

791
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,640
point of view i would have in a

792
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,840
different position

793
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,159
myself or somebody else and all of that

794
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,720
is naturally governed by that geometry

795
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,799
so then that geometry appears naturally

796
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:11,520
as

797
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,240
a or if not d candidate to account for

798
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,840
this aspect of phenomenological

799
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,720
experience

800
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,000
and therefore then you can start

801
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,679
thinking about okay how that can play a

802
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:20,399
role

803
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,760
in the process of active influence

804
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,640
nice thank you for the clear explanation

805
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,440
um

806
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,399
really in that uh little bit the

807
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,679
clearest part

808
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,080
moving forward is this elusive origin

809
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,480
and spatial perspective that we have

810
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,240
if someone can imagine an experience

811
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,440
that doesn't fulfill those two

812
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,080
conditions

813
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,080
then we're already breaking our

814
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,120
assumptions but

815
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,039
if you can that's great it's like write

816
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,399
a paper about it but

817
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:47,840
given that there's consensus that

818
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,840
there's an elusive origin and a spatial

819
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,039
perspective

820
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,039
we can then say that we're in a family

821
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,440
of uh geometries that are related to

822
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,360
this projective transformation

823
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,760
and so going from there there's other

824
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,120
downstream consequences

825
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,919
so really difficult topics sometimes to

826
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:04,880
talk about

827
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,520
of course transdisciplinary ideas but i

828
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,399
think it's really

829
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,320
clear how the structure of your argument

830
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,720
is set up stephen

831
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,600
and just just a couple of questions is

832
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,320
is the

833
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,640
is the um the distance as things go away

834
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,000
is that and you feel

835
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,200
less intensity in terms of

836
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,840
the fear or something is that linear or

837
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,039
is that kind of

838
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,080
exponential or is it vary depending on

839
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,240
the space and and i suppose the other

840
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,679
question is

841
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,480
is is this transformation between one

842
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,679
mapping

843
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,880
to the kind of projected geometry is so

844
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,279
it's

845
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,120
it's not like you store it in that form

846
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,960
there's some sort of

847
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,080
action to make it into this projection

848
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,919
yes very good question i'm going to try

849
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,919
to address them to the extent i can

850
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,919
so number number one these experiments

851
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,159
that shows the spatial relationship

852
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:02,960
between

853
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,320
subjective fear and distance they found

854
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:06,799
is

855
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,360
a power law with an expression minus one

856
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,559
so basically

857
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,080
it's like the fear decrease

858
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,640
as a function of the inverse one over

859
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,000
the distance so it's not

860
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,480
linear it's not exactly an exponential

861
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,159
it's not linear

862
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,120
and uh as it turns out that's the very

863
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,360
basic

864
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,279
rule of perspective when you want to

865
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,440
build a space in perspective

866
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,480
you divide by your coordinates

867
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,600
x y z coordinates by

868
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,000
a parameter that corresponds to the

869
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,960
distance

870
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,000
along with you are basically projecting

871
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,320
the direction of aiming that can be for

872
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,000
instance in front of you so

873
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,799
basically you find that in that geometry

874
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:51,919
there is a

875
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,960
similar operations if you wish

876
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,880
as those that are implied by the

877
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,440
the one of a distance models that is

878
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,120
empirically derived

879
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,559
so that's a nonlinear

880
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,320
but it's a very particular type of

881
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,320
non-linearity that is not a

882
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,120
super complex non-linearity that can be

883
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,640
handled computationally

884
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,559
which i guess is important and now

885
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,399
for your the second part of your

886
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:21,760
question let me

887
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,000
can you can you remind me of it so that

888
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,080
i was just about that

889
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,799
transformation between however the brain

890
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,279
stores it and this

891
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:35,279
projective phenomenon that we experience

892
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,880
yes so the idea here somewhat

893
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,200
what we have to presuppose if we want to

894
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,360
embrace that type of model

895
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,000
is that there is an unconscious world

896
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,880
model

897
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,640
which is complex which is constantly

898
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,919
updated

899
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,440
that somehow store information

900
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,880
more or less in memory uh in a client

901
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,480
manner

902
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,279
and and that we access that information

903
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,120
by taking perspective on it

904
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,600
so by transforming this sort of

905
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,039
quote-unquote activity and

906
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:07,919
representation

907
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,080
into a perspective objective

908
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,679
representation

909
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,840
that involved multiple steps and that's

910
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,000
something for instance we develop

911
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,120
the most basic one i would say in our

912
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,720
region paper in which we show

913
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,880
and we how the calibration of a

914
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,320
projective frame in

915
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,440
3d so we set the parameter that defines

916
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,880
the projection

917
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,000
and free energy immunization that's the

918
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,679
ideas free energy minimization

919
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,279
acting on geometry

920
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,080
entails uh illusions such as the moon

921
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,120
illusion

922
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,880
explain the illusions such as enzo

923
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,960
illusion and many other religions we

924
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,279
could not develop in this paper

925
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:56,640
and that is somewhat the idea is that in

926
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,240
you know sometimes people talk about

927
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,000
access consciousness

928
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,440
you know let's not enter into the

929
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,039
complexity of that debate but

930
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,120
let's say that the hypothesis here is

931
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,480
that in the way we access

932
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,039
information that's in consciousness

933
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:12,000
there is somewhat a change of

934
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,039
coordinates quote unquote from an

935
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,000
eclidean

936
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,640
representation to a projective one and

937
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,919
that operation

938
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,760
is essential in what makes information

939
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,559
conscious

940
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,080
versus not you know model if that makes

941
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,600
any sense

942
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,000
thanks for the answer let's go to lee

943
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,679
ohio yeah so i was just wondering um

944
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,399
to sort of build on stephen's question

945
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:40,960
um

946
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,200
if if a fear response is uh

947
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,279
exponentially related to

948
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,080
distance does that hold or is there any

949
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,679
research that shows whether that holds

950
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,279
for a counterfactual

951
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,120
version so i'm thinking here about

952
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,799
phobia or trauma

953
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,720
so if you have a particular experience

954
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,559
you know often in ptsd

955
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,919
those things are replayed um so yeah so

956
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:02,480
did you

957
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,880
have any thoughts on that or any point

958
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,559
it's really a great question

959
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,599
uh okay

960
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,040
the literature on this on the

961
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,079
the basic experiment is not

962
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,520
huge surprisingly at this and your

963
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,599
and your question is super interesting

964
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,119
indeed because

965
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,199
we would like to demonstrate that even

966
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,280
if you do it in an imaginary way

967
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,399
you recover this type of effect

968
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,520
consistent with the model i'm not aware

969
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,040
of such study but i'm you know i'm doing

970
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,440
so

971
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,079
so much to multidisciplinary work that

972
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,239
the literature i have to cover is vast

973
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,359
and sometimes

974
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,760
i may miss important studies in specific

975
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,800
subfield

976
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,560
but definitely that's you know that

977
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,159
gives us the road map for a great

978
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,720
experiment

979
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,399
in in the in some of the literature i'm

980
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:57,280
thinking of

981
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,240
um benjamin bergen on simulation he

982
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,560
talks about the difference between um

983
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,680
canonical perspective and i can't

984
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,800
remember the other one but it's

985
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,560
essentially first person

986
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,520
perspective um and the ability to shift

987
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,320
between these so

988
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,760
i just wondered whether it might be

989
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,000
related but i'll be certainly interested

990
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,839
if there's if there's any research that

991
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,279
you're thinking about doing

992
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,960
yeah um david on mute and then go ahead

993
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,880
and then sasha so you want me to speak

994
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,200
now

995
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,000
right oh if you have anything to add

996
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,440
sorry i misunderstood i lost

997
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,480
the screen oh yeah no great point um

998
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,560
and thanks for that question lee um

999
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,480
sasha

1000
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,520
um yeah very interesting stuff um

1001
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,560
makes me think about um

1002
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,680
uh this consciousness and understanding

1003
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,920
of um how to interact with your space as

1004
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,520
like narrative building

1005
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,240
and how that develops over the lifetime

1006
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:00,960
that

1007
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,880
like as a child that the things that

1008
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,640
you're afraid of are

1009
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,079
quite specific and nearby

1010
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,839
and as you know as we grow up

1011
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,079
we're afraid of much kind of larger but

1012
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:14,960
more distant

1013
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,160
things but there's something

1014
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,440
you know some transformation we have to

1015
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,440
figure out as far as we still have to be

1016
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,560
motivated and um afraid of the things

1017
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,200
that are

1018
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,079
uh either very afraid or very or sorry

1019
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:32,880
very scary

1020
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,680
or uh very unlikely and those are still

1021
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,720
enough to motivate

1022
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,520
um people to avoid them and so i think

1023
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,800
that's a really interesting

1024
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,880
uh yeah something in there about uh

1025
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,760
changing

1026
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,960
the scope of your

1027
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,000
uh non-euclidean projection let's say

1028
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,599
um as you uh grow up

1029
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,680
nice sasha and it's kind of like when

1030
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,960
you go back to see something scary in

1031
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,640
childhood you go oh wait it was only a

1032
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,560
six-inch stair that we were jumping off

1033
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:02,800
of

1034
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,320
well you're bigger but also you have a

1035
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,560
different world view and then just like

1036
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,880
in the computational psychiatry realm

1037
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,400
we might talk about difference in a

1038
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,079
statistical parameter leading to

1039
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,599
decreased motivation or

1040
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,320
decision making it could be a distortion

1041
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,520
of this projection

1042
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,400
that results in things being perceived

1043
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,640
as dangerously close claustrophobia

1044
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,720
people are too close to me or people are

1045
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,079
too far away from me

1046
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,000
there's so much there with the social

1047
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,200
touch as well

1048
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,079
um let's go just onto the sort of new

1049
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,520
parts of 9.2 and

1050
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,960
talk about some of these other slides

1051
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,800
and questions we have so last week we

1052
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,560
talked about the functional features the

1053
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,680
cybernetic features

1054
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,119
as well as some of these other theories

1055
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,560
threads that were drawn in like the

1056
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,440
availability

1057
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,200
kind of like a workspace the simulation

1058
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,520
theory motivation of action

1059
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,680
uh we talked about that last week as

1060
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,880
well as the

1061
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,040
questions about the phenomenological

1062
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,079
invariance

1063
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,640
with the emphasis on point one being

1064
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,079
that relational phenomenal

1065
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,320
intentionality so just pause the video

1066
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,599
and look at those if you want more

1067
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,520
detail or of course read the paper

1068
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,160
but let's go to some feedback from

1069
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,040
participants

1070
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,200
so one thing that a participant who

1071
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,280
couldn't be here today asked

1072
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,160
was one thing i'm curious about is

1073
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,200
whether they're working

1074
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,119
on more complex forms of the model with

1075
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,720
higher temporal depth that kind of

1076
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,400
speaks to these adult

1077
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,880
fears considerations we talked about and

1078
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,560
then also this person added

1079
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,920
another thing i'm curious about more

1080
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,839
philosophically is what do they mean by

1081
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:28,480
now

1082
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,079
they have an extended phenomenological

1083
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,599
background for the model

1084
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,000
which uh suggests that the now would be

1085
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,920
extended like an extended now however in

1086
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,760
naturalist models which i assumed

1087
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,000
uh active inference uh or potentially

1088
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,520
artificial intelligence framework based

1089
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,800
models are a subset of

1090
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,720
time is often modeled and understood as

1091
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,720
point-like or as a continuous

1092
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,720
variable with points i wonder what the

1093
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,560
implications are or what there might be

1094
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,599
if they mixed up these two

1095
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,599
interpretations of what the now is

1096
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,040
the physical and the psychological now

1097
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,560
so david what do you think about these

1098
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,240
questions from the participant

1099
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,599
oh they are great uh i'm gonna try to

1100
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,280
address some of it of course and again

1101
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:03,920
it's

1102
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,280
there are still a lot of things to

1103
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,040
discover and understand

1104
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,960
and one of the things we like about

1105
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,079
starting with a

1106
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,560
mathematical model is that then it's act

1107
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,160
as a guide now it's the theory that

1108
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:14,880
tells us

1109
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,800
you know where are the problem and where

1110
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,000
are the solutions

1111
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,480
if you it's a general analogy so i'm

1112
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,040
gonna be

1113
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,440
i'm gonna i'm going a bit of track but

1114
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,960
it's i think useful

1115
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,359
uh and without comparing ourselves with

1116
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:28,079
einstein

1117
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,079
don't worry we don't have that you know

1118
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,520
ambition uh

1119
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,800
if you think about a general relativity

1120
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,800
once the theory was the mathematical

1121
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,560
theory was derived

1122
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,920
basically people looked into it and

1123
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,599
started thinking uh there's a problem

1124
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:42,960
with this story it tells us that there

1125
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,640
should be black holes

1126
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,520
right and in fact basically the theory

1127
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,359
predicted things that you know nobody

1128
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,280
could observe of course before

1129
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,599
and very difficult to observe and that

1130
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,000
was a consequence of the mathematics

1131
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
and so that's the idea that we follow

1132
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,599
from a scientific standpoint is let's

1133
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,920
give us mathematics and see where it

1134
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,280
leads us now um one thing i'm curious

1135
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,079
about

1136
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,200
the first question yes we are working on

1137
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,480
more complex form and alluded to that

1138
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,359
at the beginning number one this notion

1139
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:16,640
of transformation

1140
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,800
of as an investor of distance related to

1141
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,079
this literature

1142
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,680
is not to say that we appraise

1143
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,400
information only that way

1144
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,839
it was to show at least to

1145
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,400
that type of relation holds an appraisal

1146
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,040
and

1147
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,200
to some extent or model make sense of it

1148
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,280
now about the more complex form

1149
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,520
remember the space here the geometry is

1150
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,119
one thing but it's embedded into an

1151
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,880
active inference framework

1152
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,040
with a lot of complex computation

1153
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,599
involving higher beliefs and preference

1154
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,920
internal model of the body of other

1155
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,800
objects

1156
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,880
including internal model that's what we

1157
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,160
are doing now of

1158
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,920
you know beliefs about the beliefs of

1159
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,680
others and beliefs about the belief that

1160
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,319
other

1161
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,240
beliefs are effective beliefs about the

1162
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,599
belief that

1163
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,560
other believe other have so basically

1164
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,359
level six or second order theory of mind

1165
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,480
and by actually

1166
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,280
imbuing an artificial agent with this

1167
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,119
type of

1168
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:17,200
statistical processing and combined with

1169
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:17,599
the

1170
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,760
geometry then we can start modeling how

1171
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,720
you know inspired from simulation theory

1172
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,000
we can put ourselves

1173
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,079
in the shoes of others we can try to

1174
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,480
imagine what it would feel like

1175
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,720
to look at things to observe things to i

1176
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,400
might aim at things

1177
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,200
as they seems to do including

1178
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,560
understanding that they may have

1179
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,400
different beliefs and preparations as us

1180
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,400
you know the same object may look cool

1181
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,440
to us and so

1182
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,119
when you get closer it's better but for

1183
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,960
them maybe that's something they hate

1184
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,640
and when it gets closer you know they

1185
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,160
want to run away

1186
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,920
so then we have a way of extending the

1187
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,000
model very naturally with the same match

1188
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,079
with the same general principle

1189
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,720
to encompass theory of mind and social

1190
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,119
effective perspective taking if you wish

1191
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,760
and one interesting thing that we find

1192
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,319
is that

1193
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,240
when you enable artificial agents with

1194
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,920
this type of process

1195
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,400
then they and you enable them also to be

1196
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,839
influenced by each other

1197
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,520
because you may be able to understand

1198
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,040
and predict other behavior

1199
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,400
but not care about it but if you do then

1200
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,480
uh the agents the little robots or the

1201
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,440
virtual uh

1202
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,800
humans start demand showing

1203
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,640
joint attention behavior they start

1204
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,400
interacting looking at the same thing

1205
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,240
looking at each other to kind of confirm

1206
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,440
that they understand what the other

1207
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,079
likes

1208
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:33,839
and they constantly put themselves in

1209
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,000
the skills of the other and reciprocally

1210
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,680
and through this process of you know

1211
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,720
projective perspective taking

1212
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,359
informed by all these kind of

1213
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,520
bayesian-like models and the free energy

1214
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,720
minimization

1215
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,119
they start showing very complex behavior

1216
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:49,920
including

1217
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,160
you know uh we have reproduced in a

1218
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,480
non-verbal way the famous celia

1219
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,680
and task we know about theory of mind

1220
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,760
basically that's two puppets

1221
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,119
one of them they are together uh

1222
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,880
there is some object of interest in a

1223
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,359
basket one of them leave the other take

1224
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:09,280
the object of interest from the basket

1225
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,960
and put it in the box and typically it

1226
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,200
has

1227
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,520
children you know when the other come

1228
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,280
back you know where do you think

1229
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,599
you know she will go and if you

1230
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,599
understand false belief you will say

1231
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:20,160
well

1232
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,680
because she believed that the box is

1233
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,920
still in the the the object is still in

1234
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,640
the basket

1235
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,960
she will go to the basket and so we have

1236
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,480
modeled a kind of

1237
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,960
simulation framework in a non-verbal way

1238
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,760
for that

1239
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,000
and we show our agents actually exploit

1240
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,520
their understanding of

1241
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,839
false belief in others to approach uh

1242
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,920
disingenuously uh uh object they would

1243
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,880
like by you know

1244
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,680
um being afraid of being bothered by the

1245
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,119
other because now the other has false

1246
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:47,839
belief

1247
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,400
the same way we can kind of simulate

1248
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,400
some aspect of social anxiety

1249
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,480
because anytime you give a you have an

1250
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,040
agent that believe that the other agent

1251
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:57,599
doesn't

1252
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:01,119
like it you know uh

1253
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,160
then you know playing uh the algorithm

1254
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,839
just running the algorithm

1255
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,680
anytime the agent imagine itself

1256
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,680
approaching the region the other region

1257
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,480
that

1258
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,240
the agents suppose do not like him

1259
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,640
then he puts itself because he practices

1260
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,440
he does

1261
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,560
a social perspective taking in the shoes

1262
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,040
of this

1263
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,520
other agent and when he imagined what it

1264
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,359
is like for these other regions to see

1265
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:25,920
himself

1266
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,400
or itself get closer because of the same

1267
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,160
rule we have discussed

1268
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,000
he understand that would raise free

1269
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,599
energy in the other agents

1270
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,200
and since it takes into account the

1271
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,119
other agent's opinion that it attributes

1272
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:38,160
to the others

1273
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,079
therefore that has its own free energy

1274
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,400
as a result it avoid it tend to avoid

1275
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,680
approaching the agent

1276
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,760
that it believes doesn't like it so you

1277
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,200
see you start having very

1278
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,440
sophisticated behavior holes through

1279
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,240
this

1280
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,520
basic uh processing so that's for the

1281
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,359
first question sorry it was long i hope

1282
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,640
it was not too confusing

1283
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,160
any time you have to deal with theory of

1284
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,920
mind in particular second order theory

1285
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,720
of mind and

1286
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,839
talk about belief of that another may

1287
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:04,480
have

1288
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,880
about the belief of another etcetera

1289
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,319
etcetera and so on it

1290
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:10,960
has become very challenging for the mind

1291
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,160
so now

1292
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,359
regarding um the other question about

1293
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:16,240
the now

1294
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,440
or in the spacious present so in a way

1295
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,040
it's a hard question to answer and we

1296
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,800
are still working on that

1297
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,760
in a way there is the physical time

1298
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,960
let's call it that way

1299
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,680
which is point like probably that is

1300
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,000
involved in the underlying processing

1301
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,480
you know whatever it is based on the

1302
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,280
brain or

1303
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,280
based on some computational algorithm so

1304
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,000
there is a there is a timer

1305
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,119
and then there is the time as it is

1306
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,319
integrated perceived and structure in

1307
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:49,200
consciousness and the idea here is that

1308
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,200
because we are doing active inference

1309
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,160
constantly anticipating the future to

1310
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,520
some extent even a very close

1311
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,800
future it can be at different scales

1312
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,880
so then we are trying to recover from

1313
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,040
that but we are not yet there

1314
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,200
the notion of this kind of extended

1315
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,160
presence

1316
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,319
so that basically at a given time

1317
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:09,280
incident

1318
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,400
uh that's not the right at a given

1319
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:12,960
moment

1320
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,280
if you wish you not only have this

1321
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,520
instantaneous representation of space in

1322
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,560
perspective

1323
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,520
but you have a process in which uh the

1324
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,920
anticipation

1325
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,319
drives the next instant in a manner that

1326
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:27,599
is integrated

1327
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,520
as a whole so it's very abstract what

1328
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,359
i'm saying we're also trying to

1329
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:32,079
understand

1330
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:35,200
how we can put time pressure within

1331
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,359
this free energy context and we have

1332
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:38,640
solutions for that

1333
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,480
and also how the agents can

1334
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,560
dive into their autobiographical memory

1335
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,720
under the same process

1336
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,760
we are also very interested it's now

1337
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,599
it's moving away from that but

1338
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,000
it connects to questions that we had

1339
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,280
before

1340
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,079
2d i would say pathological

1341
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:59,200
transformations

1342
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,560
in the sense that here we are talking

1343
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,440
about very adaptive behaviors

1344
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,119
very tuned to sensorimotor contingencies

1345
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:08,800
and constraints

1346
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,240
and uh so that as this embodiment

1347
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,680
uh the fact that you know we tend to

1348
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,839
have this first person point of view

1349
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:18,480
refer to the representation that we have

1350
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,559
of our body in space

1351
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:22,720
that's constrained that embodiment

1352
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,319
constraints somewhat

1353
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:26,319
reduce the number of possible projective

1354
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:27,440
transformations

1355
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,280
and you know because only some of them

1356
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,280
will give you that type of point of view

1357
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,000
but if you relax those constraints then

1358
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,359
you can get very wild

1359
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:37,280
things that i find are very interesting

1360
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,280
to connect with the literature on

1361
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,800
psychotrope on mystical experience and

1362
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,599
arts

1363
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,000
and to give you an example we've not

1364
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,440
published on that yet but

1365
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,800
one of the things that happens to the

1366
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,440
agents is that you know if they

1367
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,760
they have the possibility of basically

1368
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,000
being freer in the application of the

1369
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,240
projective transformation they can use

1370
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,599
for instance in the context

1371
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,680
in which they are in a desperate world

1372
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,119
in the sense that everything they can

1373
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:04,400
think about or do

1374
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,440
as an embodied agent will yield

1375
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,119
a very high level of free energy there

1376
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,640
is no good solution

1377
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,160
then one option is to release the

1378
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,760
constraint on the projection and when

1379
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,200
you do that

1380
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,960
in order to minimize free energy the

1381
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,839
agent will tend to

1382
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:22,240
basically put their point of view quote

1383
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,760
unquote at infinity

1384
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,520
what we called the god point of view

1385
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,680
which is a bit of a

1386
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,640
bad choice of words and so basically

1387
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,720
that means that one way of

1388
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,880
minimizing free energy for those agents

1389
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:35,760
is

1390
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,720
so releasing those normal constraints is

1391
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,040
to escape towards infinity so that

1392
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,920
basically the world become very very far

1393
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,200
and then the structure of the

1394
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,800
representation of the world you have

1395
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,880
started having very odd symmetries

1396
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,920
that may remind us of mandalas or things

1397
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:52,559
like that

1398
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,839
so i'm shutting up now wow

1399
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:58,559
a lot of stuff there let's go adam and

1400
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:02,400
then lee and then stephen

1401
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,680
um hi can you hear me yep sounds good

1402
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:09,680
um so now one thing i've been struggling

1403
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,160
with in terms of

1404
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,440
time and consciousness is

1405
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,240
whether it's better to think of it as

1406
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:18,559
like

1407
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:22,640
a series of kind of discreet snapshots

1408
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,440
or more of a continuous flow i'm

1409
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,160
personally leaning more towards um

1410
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,960
discrete snapshots and so with respect

1411
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:31,599
to um

1412
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,599
uh projective geometric modeling i'm

1413
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,240
wondering whether uh the refresh rate

1414
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,920
um might be like it's something like

1415
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,559
alpha frequencies like 10 times a second

1416
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:44,960
to uh primarily like posterior cortices

1417
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,319
getting into the mix of

1418
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:50,160
establishing that uh 40 perspective

1419
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,400
um but then where i like and you

1420
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,559
mentioned like access consciousness or

1421
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,160
where that might start and like the

1422
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,040
whole active inferential unfolding

1423
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,119
that that might be more at like theta

1424
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:03,119
frequencies like three to four times a

1425
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:04,319
second and then like you might get

1426
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:05,680
something like

1427
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,040
uh north of style like uh

1428
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,119
spatiotemporal alignments based on like

1429
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:12,720
your enteroceptive states

1430
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,280
maybe more at like delta frequencies and

1431
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,800
so you might have this like nested

1432
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,920
hierarchy of time

1433
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,920
scales with a core screening over

1434
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,079
events at various uh resolutions but

1435
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:28,000
at the bottom of it though um it seems

1436
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,359
like we're like the core of it

1437
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,800
is this establishing of a field um

1438
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,800
with projective geometric modeling at

1439
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,839
the center

1440
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:39,040
and i guess is this are these estimates

1441
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:39,760
i'm wondering

1442
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,680
discrete do you think or is it

1443
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,160
continuous

1444
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,079
that's really a very good question and a

1445
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:47,440
very sound and

1446
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,599
interesting hypothesis that you know

1447
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:50,800
with the ceremonial

1448
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,880
testing because it's it's a whole

1449
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,400
program of research

1450
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,440
i've been for longer an

1451
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,280
electrophysiologist i work for long and

1452
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,079
this stuff i

1453
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:00,160
i don't anymore but you know i'm very

1454
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,880
open to pursuing collaborations on that

1455
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,800
um i first of all i should say i don't

1456
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,640
have an answer to satisfying answer to

1457
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,559
that question

1458
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:14,079
i think it's indeed multi-scale

1459
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,520
i think that it has the

1460
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,640
discrete quote-unquote sharp if not

1461
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,400
discrete component

1462
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,280
uh which may be perfectly embedded in a

1463
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,240
more

1464
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,119
at least in the way it manifests itself

1465
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:29,520
a

1466
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,800
continuous flow uh but that is

1467
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,160
i don't think in and of itself doesn't

1468
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:36,960
compose a

1469
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,800
challenge a theoretical challenge it's

1470
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,319
just complex but we can

1471
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,720
think about how it could be done and we

1472
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,480
can also think about how it could be

1473
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,800
calibrated based on the type of

1474
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,440
biological reason you're talking about

1475
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,160
what is more of a theoretical challenge

1476
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,920
is this notion of spacious presence

1477
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,200
in which somewhere else that's the words

1478
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,880
that the phenomenologists like user

1479
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:01,680
would use

1480
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,280
we pretend a potential this notion

1481
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,720
in the now there is somewhat

1482
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,200
us in the center of that now and there

1483
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,520
is at the same time a potential

1484
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,839
towards the future and somehow there is

1485
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:19,200
simultaneously as a manifold

1486
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,319
an experience of the you know here and

1487
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:23,839
now in an experience of the

1488
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:26,240
just after and at the same time there is

1489
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,839
still this resonance of

1490
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:30,720
this retention to use gusto's world

1491
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,280
world

1492
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,480
sorry retention of

1493
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,119
of a immediate past so you can think

1494
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:38,720
okay there is an immediate past there is

1495
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,200
a

1496
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,880
actual present and there is a close

1497
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,880
future and then those things are

1498
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,720
somewhat bonded together

1499
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,640
but the difficulty is to try to think oh

1500
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,160
actually you can find a mathematical

1501
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,440
expression of a

1502
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,079
representation of that in which they are

1503
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:52,559
actually

1504
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,040
part of the same whole and not just you

1505
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,640
know something you could argue well but

1506
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,839
then that means that

1507
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:59,599
you know they are ultimately separate

1508
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:01,920
process so we're still trying to work on

1509
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,319
that

1510
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:04,480
see if there is any way of thinking

1511
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,319
about that but

1512
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:09,440
we are not yet there cool um

1513
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:14,640
we'll do stephen lee sasha

1514
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,520
yeah just building on on the idea that

1515
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,520
the projective consciousness can be

1516
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,880
released

1517
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,160
when things are not certain enough to be

1518
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,440
able to know how to

1519
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,000
make sense of action in the world it

1520
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:28,880
sort of

1521
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,000
ties in with this way that

1522
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,839
indigenous approaches are shape-shifting

1523
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:37,680
and they're trying to attune to an

1524
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,280
environment which they aren't able to

1525
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,559
construct

1526
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:43,280
in the way that we tend to construct and

1527
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,359
place ourselves in the center of

1528
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:46,720
so i think there's an interesting thing

1529
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,760
as well as there being the risk

1530
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,680
it could just be the increasing level of

1531
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,440
ambiguity and uncertainty in the world

1532
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,599
so that's interesting that you take that

1533
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:00,880
i'm just wondering if there's

1534
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,119
as well as the projective thing going

1535
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:04,079
from the self

1536
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:06,480
and maybe to infinity do you think

1537
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,839
there's a night like there might be

1538
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:09,200
another process

1539
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,000
another type of geometry come in the

1540
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,440
other direction

1541
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,960
like it could be and that and and this

1542
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,640
it sort of shifts towards the

1543
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,000
self-centered

1544
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,440
and there's an allocentric mechanism as

1545
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,160
well

1546
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,200
so that's such it's a great question and

1547
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,240
attached to

1548
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,119
another work that we are pursuing with

1549
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:32,960
mathematician danielle banker

1550
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,520
and uh kenneth williford who just told

1551
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,119
me unfortunately he could not make it

1552
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:37,599
today

1553
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:40,880
sorry about what sometimes people have

1554
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,440
called pre-reflective

1555
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,599
self-consciousness it's a bit

1556
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:47,839
along the line of this bizarre sense of

1557
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:50,319
the spacious present but now

1558
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:52,640
it's about self-consciousness in the

1559
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,760
sense that

1560
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,359
that's what people have called sometimes

1561
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:57,440
the self-consciousness hypothesis

1562
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,880
not everybody agrees upon that that

1563
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,440
we are always consciousness is always

1564
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,040
conscious of itself

1565
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,960
that is it's not like a higher order

1566
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,400
theory where there is a consciousness

1567
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,000
for instance perceptual consciousness of

1568
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,240
something and then you reflect upon it

1569
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,880
and you know become aware of the fact

1570
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,280
that you

1571
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,240
are perceiving that the idea is that

1572
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,920
it's actually the manifold itself is

1573
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:20,720
such that

1574
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,559
you know there is this pre-reflective

1575
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:28,880
reflexive uh relationship

1576
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,440
that is fundamental into it and so

1577
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,480
philosopher like

1578
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,760
sartre i believe

1579
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,160
in others i've talked about what you say

1580
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,040
that in english the um

1581
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,640
the seers seeing or seen this

1582
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,359
the sincere if you wish the one we're

1583
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:50,000
seeing is also seen at the same time

1584
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,559
as if there was some sort of duality in

1585
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:53,040
which

1586
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,480
whenever i have a first person

1587
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,880
perspective and i'm looking at the sky

1588
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,880
it feels like or there is something in

1589
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,559
it that feels like that the sky is

1590
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:02,160
looking back at me

1591
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,559
well as it turns out it's a natural

1592
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:05,359
property

1593
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:08,480
of the most you know bizarre

1594
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,319
a strange and interesting aspect of

1595
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:12,400
projective geometry which is not just

1596
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,839
you know it's a very complex and rich

1597
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:16,400
geometry

1598
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,319
and we're trying to work that out thanks

1599
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:19,680
to this mathematician around this

1600
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,480
concept of

1601
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,319
duality reciprocity uh in which

1602
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:27,680
there is at once

1603
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,839
potentially still working out the math

1604
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:31,200
uh

1605
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,400
this is the fact that you take this

1606
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,799
perspective in implies that

1607
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:37,040
you know the reciprocal perspective and

1608
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,640
that you know you look at something and

1609
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,240
these things these things look back at

1610
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:40,960
you

1611
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,520
uh in your i know it's odd it's bizarre

1612
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,319
but you know

1613
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:47,440
it's my my attempt to try to touch upon

1614
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,920
what you were talking about

1615
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,720
okay lee then sasha adam thanks for all

1616
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:53,280
these cool

1617
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,839
questions uh yeah so

1618
00:56:56,839 --> 00:56:58,880
um i'm anticipating that i might be

1619
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,200
about to ask a stupid question but i'm

1620
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,359
i'm going to go ahead anyway so it was

1621
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:04,960
um it was stimulated by

1622
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,160
the fact that you were saying that you

1623
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,760
were kind of interested in you know like

1624
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,960
mystical

1625
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,359
uh experiences in relation to projective

1626
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:12,000
geometry

1627
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,440
and i was thinking about the um

1628
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,000
the meditative experience of of

1629
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,920
non-duality

1630
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,240
um you know which is um i was wondering

1631
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,920
whether you

1632
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,359
have come across this and whether you

1633
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:28,240
see it is in any way related to

1634
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:33,200
um projective geometry perhaps

1635
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,839
yeah so i used to be i mean i was at

1636
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:39,599
some point i don't know if you know that

1637
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:43,200
person a student of francisco varela

1638
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,599
unfortunately passed away during my phd

1639
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:46,960
that's why i moved to the u.s to work

1640
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,520
with antonio damasio to finish my phd

1641
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:53,760
and of course with varela who was very

1642
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,280
interested in

1643
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:58,319
let's say meditation in a broad sense of

1644
00:57:58,319 --> 00:57:59,200
the term

1645
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,160
um both for scientific standpoint from a

1646
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,839
scientific standpoint as a possible

1647
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:05,680
method to study consciousness but also

1648
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,119
more at the personal and

1649
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:09,680
existential level you know i got more

1650
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,040
acquainted

1651
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,319
to that i practiced it i even studied it

1652
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:15,200
a bit

1653
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,680
and i've been for instance involved in a

1654
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,040
very nice workshop

1655
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,960
in israel and perspective on

1656
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,400
consciousness where this type of

1657
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,359
tradition

1658
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,880
multiple traditions we are meeting

1659
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,400
together and we had very interesting

1660
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,640
discussions and

1661
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,200
thoughts and about about that very nice

1662
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,559
group

1663
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:36,160
so um can you try just for me

1664
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,480
and for the audience perhaps to specify

1665
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,920
the phenomenology

1666
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,839
the aspect of the experience you are

1667
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:43,680
describing

1668
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,680
the meditator the specific meditation

1669
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,280
experience that you are describing this

1670
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,400
kind of

1671
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,920
unified sure i can try

1672
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:56,480
um so i think in some sense there was

1673
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,559
um uh that

1674
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:02,079
prior to a certain point there was an

1675
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:04,319
assumption that there's a separation

1676
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,520
between the observer

1677
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,640
and the and the observed and

1678
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,880
and that starts to break down such that

1679
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,920
you kind of

1680
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,559
it becomes it becomes once one space for

1681
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,720
one to the better

1682
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:20,000
yeah so that i i i think that of course

1683
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,680
i'm not saying that's the answer

1684
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,599
i'm saying that perhaps that contributes

1685
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:24,960
to that type of state

1686
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,920
that connects to the what i was talking

1687
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:28,799
about

1688
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:32,319
of that intrinsic to this the reciprocal

1689
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:33,520
relations that are

1690
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,720
embedded into this

1691
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,359
geometry i wish the mathematician i

1692
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:40,960
worked with was here

1693
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:44,720
uh there is something like

1694
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:48,000
it's non-trivial that's important a

1695
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,720
reciprocity between looking at or aiming

1696
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:51,920
at and being looked at

1697
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,720
an ad simultaneously it's like it's not

1698
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,880
like necessarily you lose track of where

1699
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,200
you know of of the perspectives that you

1700
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,079
have

1701
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:03,280
but there is this more

1702
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:07,119
richer uh experience uh that is implied

1703
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:08,880
by this type of geometry

1704
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,599
so in that sense in that sense at some

1705
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:12,960
level

1706
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,680
you know you you can perfectly conceive

1707
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,839
within this geometrically

1708
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:21,440
how you know perspective can be taken

1709
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,559
from anywhere

1710
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:24,880
and are all connected to projective

1711
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:28,319
transformation but even deeper

1712
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:30,960
perhaps through notions of dualities

1713
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:31,520
that i

1714
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,520
unfortunately could not expand upon

1715
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,520
because i would you know totally fail

1716
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:36,559
that's why i need to work with

1717
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:39,440
mathematicians uh that gives you this

1718
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,640
sort of

1719
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,680
you know unified experience of a

1720
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,319
you know sort of some sort of bizarre

1721
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:48,559
panopticon where you

1722
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:50,240
you know you could be anywhere you could

1723
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,240
be looking from anywhere and

1724
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,839
from your particular perspective and

1725
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:55,359
being looked at that could be you that

1726
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:56,000
could be something

1727
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,079
else and that's you know a manifold of

1728
01:00:58,079 --> 01:00:59,839
point of view that at the same time is

1729
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:01,599
grounded into a unique

1730
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:03,440
point of view that exists in full

1731
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:04,720
dimension so

1732
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,559
i know it's not it sounds bizarre but

1733
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:08,319
that's just the math that's what they

1734
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:11,520
what they are thank you

1735
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:15,359
we have a new visitor but sasha go ahead

1736
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:19,040
then adam um

1737
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,200
yeah so just thinking about this whole

1738
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,319
time perception

1739
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:26,160
question um whether and i guess it's two

1740
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:26,880
separate things

1741
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,160
it's is time discrete or

1742
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:33,680
continuous and the second question is

1743
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,880
time perception discrete or continuous

1744
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,920
and if it is possible for uh

1745
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,599
people to have different you know

1746
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:43,119
spatial uh

1747
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:46,000
understandings or perceptions then um

1748
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,359
it's also possible for

1749
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:50,880
people to have uh different perceptions

1750
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,000
of time passing

1751
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,960
and a different rate of how everything

1752
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:55,599
is happening

1753
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:59,359
and is that um how do we integrate

1754
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:01,440
that or allow for that to happen that

1755
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:02,960
people perceive time

1756
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,079
perhaps very differently

1757
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:10,079
well that i don't think in and of itself

1758
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:13,839
is a deeply

1759
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:17,039
difficult conceptual challenge at some

1760
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:19,440
level at least

1761
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,480
in the sense that it's not different

1762
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,119
if you want to think about it as having

1763
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:26,480
systems that

1764
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,200
have internal model of beliefs and

1765
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,559
understanding

1766
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:32,640
that you know somebody else may have

1767
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,240
different beliefs in my robots in the

1768
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,920
example i was giving it was

1769
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,520
mainly beliefs about whether or not

1770
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:42,960
an agent likes or dislikes uh something

1771
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:47,119
but uh uh uh you know do you

1772
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:49,359
and all these let's put it that way

1773
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:50,240
let's

1774
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:53,680
be broader in the mechanics of the whole

1775
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:56,160
system there are a lot of parameters

1776
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,799
uh that concerns beliefs uh that

1777
01:02:58,799 --> 01:02:59,599
concerns

1778
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:01,599
the calibration of projective frames

1779
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:02,960
that can be different from

1780
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,920
people to people so i would guess that

1781
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:06,720
it's not a

1782
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:09,839
satisfactory answer i'm sorry but that

1783
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:11,520
could be the same for the

1784
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:15,119
the way the flow of time is

1785
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:18,400
uh structured is construed uh

1786
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,920
within consciousness it's to me you know

1787
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,440
at some point you are living with

1788
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:26,160
complex systems that have you know

1789
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,079
statistical models with a lot of

1790
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:31,200
parameters so it's perfectly logical

1791
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:31,920
that if you

1792
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,920
have parameters pertaining to time

1793
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,240
consciousness

1794
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,839
they could be different from one person

1795
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:39,680
to the other you know at that level of

1796
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,359
abstraction i don't think the the

1797
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:42,799
problem is uh

1798
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:45,200
is a an essential challenge in the sense

1799
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,960
that oh yeah there is a big paradox that

1800
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,000
i cannot resolve

1801
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,240
in a consistent manner with mathematical

1802
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,039
thinking

1803
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,880
but of course there are much deeper

1804
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,559
questions than this whole

1805
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:56,319
what we were talking about before this

1806
01:03:56,319 --> 01:03:58,319
whole spacious present this kind of

1807
01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:01,039
extended experience of experience of the

1808
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:02,799
present of the now

1809
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:06,720
is more difficult to grasp to me yet

1810
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,920
cool let's go last comments here from

1811
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:10,480
adam

1812
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:14,000
and then we'll welcome kent

1813
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:18,720
hello can you hear me yep um

1814
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,839
so and talking about um this sort of

1815
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:24,160
reciprocity or mutuality of like when

1816
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,039
you look and then

1817
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:28,000
looking back at you it started to make

1818
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:28,720
me

1819
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:32,160
wonder about the extent to which

1820
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,680
uh projective uh geometric

1821
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,839
modeling might be uh inter-subjectively

1822
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:40,079
bootstrapped

1823
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:43,839
and that like it both enables

1824
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:45,680
theory of mind capacities in terms of

1825
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:46,880
giving you this

1826
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,400
flexible transformation between

1827
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:49,920
perspectives which would be like at the

1828
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,280
heart of like

1829
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:54,799
mentalizing a theory of mind but also

1830
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:57,119
to engage in that i'm wondering if that

1831
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:58,000
helps to

1832
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,200
induce the capacity which then feeds

1833
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:01,839
back and

1834
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:05,119
makes you better perspective which then

1835
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:06,720
in a kind of bootstrapping process and

1836
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,640
now i'm wondering in terms of like

1837
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:11,039
evolution and development like

1838
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:12,640
when is this starting to arise like you

1839
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,039
could in theory think of this happening

1840
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:18,400
like non-inter-subjectively in a way

1841
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,520
where it's like

1842
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,680
i don't know like a predator sort of

1843
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,599
like hunting maybe if i go here

1844
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:25,119
and doing sort of like where do i need

1845
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:26,960
to be to get

1846
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:29,520
like if the organism has like a model of

1847
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,839
itself of some degree of temporal depth

1848
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:33,280
and it's trying to do something a little

1849
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,880
bit more elaborate trying to like forge

1850
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,640
for information well that's like okay i

1851
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,680
go here i'll have a different

1852
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,119
perspective and this is like influencing

1853
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:40,160
the policy selection

1854
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:43,440
but um in humans it's probably really

1855
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,079
heavily

1856
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:46,960
inter-subjectively bootstrapped and so

1857
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,960
some thoughts

1858
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,720
i i'm not going to make a long comments

1859
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,559
to not take too much space but i

1860
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:54,799
find everything you say that i agree

1861
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:55,680
with you i think

1862
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,480
actually you write probably so they are

1863
01:05:58,480 --> 01:05:59,440
very interesting

1864
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:02,400
stuff in ethology and you know animal

1865
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,039
behavior

1866
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:05,920
or even in recent relatively recent

1867
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,039
literature that

1868
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:10,079
you know suggests the role of projective

1869
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:12,720
representations into uh the way anymore

1870
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:13,760
uh

1871
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:18,079
try to lure others into

1872
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:21,599
you know either being a mate or you know

1873
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:24,480
being a uh

1874
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:27,700
cool welcome ken you can

1875
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,280
[Music]

1876
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:33,359
hi yeah i'm sorry i'm so late all good

1877
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:36,000
morning do you have any uh thing to add

1878
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,520
or just feel free to raise your hand

1879
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:40,960
any time okay we'll do cool

1880
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,720
well there's a few more slides this was

1881
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,400
really a great set of questions by the

1882
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,240
participant so that's really

1883
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:49,839
fun topics uh here's some

1884
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:52,319
quotes that i put up there and the part

1885
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:53,839
i wanted to kind of start off with is

1886
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:54,240
the

1887
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:58,240
second half of the second quote on here

1888
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,880
which is just uh a system running the

1889
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:01,680
pcm

1890
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,440
would more closely approximate the

1891
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,119
actual complexity organization and

1892
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:06,720
processing power of human or animal

1893
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:07,599
brains

1894
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:10,480
and this could very well on the author's

1895
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:10,960
view

1896
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,280
literally be an artificial consciousness

1897
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:14,079
so

1898
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:16,160
maybe getting into sort of questions

1899
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,599
about what does it actually

1900
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:19,920
entail to have the awareness what if you

1901
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,599
make a system that has

1902
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:23,520
action and perception and it does a

1903
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,359
projective geometry transformation and

1904
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:25,760
it

1905
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,039
you know it's doing it because you're

1906
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:28,960
the one who made the robot so i was just

1907
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,319
curious to hear about

1908
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:32,799
from the robotics side or from the

1909
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:34,599
mathematical side or from the

1910
01:07:34,599 --> 01:07:36,319
neurophenomenological what else is

1911
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,559
happening in humans is it evolutionary

1912
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:42,559
is it linguistic etc so i i would like

1913
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:43,680
ken to

1914
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,480
to speak because he has a lot to say uh

1915
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,200
but

1916
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,280
since you asking about robot in that

1917
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:51,839
question is very relevant of course

1918
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:55,039
i will answer as a scientist uh i'm

1919
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:57,440
hiding behind the method the scientific

1920
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,319
method

1921
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:00,640
uh and not to avoid the question but to

1922
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:01,920
tell you first that i don't have an

1923
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:02,799
answer to that

1924
01:08:02,799 --> 01:08:05,119
fundamental question what i'm trying to

1925
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:05,920
do and that's

1926
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,960
i think the only thing science can do

1927
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,280
at least as we know it and you can take

1928
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,119
the model of physics as a

1929
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:16,640
probability example of that is uh

1930
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:19,920
to try to understand not necessarily why

1931
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:20,399
but

1932
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:24,080
how we do think we do things and that

1933
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,279
applies to consciousness to the

1934
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:27,439
phenomenology of consciousness so

1935
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:30,080
what we are modeling here is that

1936
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,120
phenomenology

1937
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:33,920
and how it is involved in other process

1938
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:34,799
and so

1939
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:37,439
at the end the only thing i could say

1940
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:39,198
about my robot

1941
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:40,960
in the way they are implemented at this

1942
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,319
point you know there is a lot of work

1943
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:45,439
ahead is that at least their behavior

1944
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:49,120
will be governed by principles that are

1945
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:51,520
central to the way consciousness process

1946
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:52,238
information

1947
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:54,640
let's put it that way so it doesn't

1948
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,000
imply at all

1949
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,158
that those robots are actually conscious

1950
01:08:58,158 --> 01:08:59,359
in the sense we

1951
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:02,880
would like to um but at least

1952
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:06,640
uh they can demonstrate how

1953
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,479
our consciousness and the principles

1954
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,960
that seems to shape our consciousness

1955
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:13,600
uh play a role in our overall the

1956
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:16,238
economy of our behavior etc etc

1957
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:19,679
it doesn't give us a an answer

1958
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:22,719
to why you know this is conscious in the

1959
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:23,279
sense

1960
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:25,520
maybe actually it's with a certain level

1961
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,120
of complexity it's sufficient

1962
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:30,000
and maybe ken should speak now and

1963
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:30,960
rebound

1964
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,238
on that

1965
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:37,839
well i was going to say this um passage

1966
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:41,198
if uh memory serves we we of course this

1967
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:42,479
is a general

1968
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:45,520
sort of worry that anybody who uh works

1969
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:45,920
on

1970
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,920
consciousness thinks about it has

1971
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,279
especially if you

1972
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:51,600
are doing anything with um simulations

1973
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:52,640
as uh w

1974
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:55,120
was so we started to think well of

1975
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,560
course we don't think that

1976
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:00,640
um the simulations that david has built

1977
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:04,080
are actually contained consciousness uh

1978
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:05,760
you know actually contain conscious

1979
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,600
agents

1980
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,880
so then you wonder all right you know so

1981
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:11,600
it's not it's not

1982
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:15,760
merely um processing information and

1983
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:18,880
the the way in a way that simulates

1984
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,560
what's specified in the model

1985
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:24,080
i guess you could say um it could be

1986
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:27,280
other things as well like uh so in a

1987
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,000
sense we

1988
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,239
we think okay this is a necessary

1989
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:31,360
condition

1990
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,280
for consciousness that you process

1991
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:35,760
information and the way the pcm

1992
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:40,239
outlines um sufficiency

1993
01:10:40,239 --> 01:10:43,520
require a certain kind of uh

1994
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:46,480
scale and complexity that that we we're

1995
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,560
not we're not certain about yet

1996
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,840
so we shouldn't just um assume that any

1997
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,159
any kind of situation that

1998
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:57,440
that follows this this model

1999
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:00,000
is just if so facto a conscious being

2000
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:00,800
that's kind of

2001
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,040
claiming too much what what else is

2002
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,000
involved well we

2003
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,840
we don't we don't know but um

2004
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,120
it's it seems like uh this is we

2005
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:14,080
we maintain this is necessary for

2006
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:15,120
consciousness

2007
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:18,320
so um the conscious being will

2008
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,719
will have this structure what will

2009
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:23,040
process information in this way

2010
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:26,320
um and it for all we know

2011
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:31,040
it could be sort of um

2012
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,840
things that we don't we're not going to

2013
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,199
be able to reduce

2014
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:38,480
to uh principles

2015
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,080
so easily that we'd have to discover

2016
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,400
empirically that's the that's the reason

2017
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,960
we say here the an aposteriori identity

2018
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,000
theory

2019
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
that's that's the idea that you can't

2020
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,239
really say what consciousness is

2021
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:54,640
a priori you have to find out what it is

2022
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:58,719
empirically and at some point you might

2023
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:00,239
find yourself in a situation where you

2024
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:02,640
could say okay

2025
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:06,159
um these suppose we build a lot of

2026
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:07,280
artificial systems

2027
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:10,400
that do this these exhibit

2028
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:13,840
all the behaviors and so on that make it

2029
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,719
seem like it you know a conscious being

2030
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:18,239
um

2031
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:20,640
they you know suppose they operate on a

2032
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,000
certain scale and a certain

2033
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,480
complexity at some point we might be

2034
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:25,600
able to say yeah we think

2035
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:28,640
right here's the sweet spot why exactly

2036
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:31,840
we don't know maybe we will discover

2037
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:32,800
that maybe not

2038
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:36,480
but um on the one hand uh

2039
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:40,320
it seems like it you don't want to be um

2040
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,320
shy of saying that the you know from

2041
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,480
what we can tell

2042
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:47,120
these are necessary conditions and on

2043
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,199
the other you don't want to be

2044
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:50,719
to um you don't want to you don't want

2045
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:52,320
to have a view of the sufficient

2046
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:53,120
conditions

2047
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:56,400
for consciousness that make it quite too

2048
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:56,960
easy

2049
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:00,320
you know so that's awesome

2050
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:03,199
yeah thanks for that response steven

2051
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:04,640
just a really quick comment and then

2052
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,960
we'll move on

2053
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,320
just just quickly i was just wondering

2054
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,239
when you think about projective

2055
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:11,760
consciousness is it like

2056
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,480
this is really summing up a particular

2057
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,760
type of consciousness

2058
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:18,159
which that we are taking these

2059
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:20,880
projective perspective or

2060
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:24,320
kind of um ways of engaging the world

2061
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,320
and there's there's a potential i wonder

2062
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,000
if there's a potential for that

2063
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,040
to seem like it's more like how

2064
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,440
consciousness is because we culturally

2065
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,920
have taken that on to be how we

2066
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:37,440
think of the world but this might be

2067
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,040
like one

2068
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,920
way of taking a view from a more sort of

2069
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:46,320
higher perspective

2070
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,719
so we should shall i take this one do we

2071
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:52,480
yes can please do and speak muscle

2072
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:55,360
what's that i think you should speak and

2073
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:56,400
because i have spoken

2074
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,840
already a lot and you have a lot of

2075
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:01,840
answers

2076
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,880
so i mean our our hypothesis is that

2077
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,400
this is not just

2078
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,199
of um

2079
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:14,560
you know how we've been enculturated or

2080
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:18,000
uh see if i i've got your question right

2081
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
i mean our view is that this is this is

2082
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,960
a at least a necessary feature of all

2083
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:26,640
consciousness that's that's the claim

2084
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,640
so now you could imagine and you could

2085
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,719
you could actually wed this kind of uh

2086
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:34,080
view to other theories of consciousness

2087
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:35,520
you could wed it to

2088
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:38,320
you know pan psychism for that matter

2089
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:39,760
you could just say oh no actually

2090
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,360
consciousness is something else it's

2091
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:43,920
whatever some fundamental property of

2092
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:44,960
nature

2093
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:48,320
um but this then if you had that sort of

2094
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:48,800
view

2095
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,719
this kind of work would still be of

2096
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:52,080
interest because it might

2097
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:56,000
um sketch out how conscious beings

2098
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,760
like us or probably you know animals

2099
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:02,719
um how they experience the world and how

2100
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:04,080
they organize how they process

2101
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:06,000
information

2102
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,640
all right so but we and of course when

2103
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:10,480
we make it so it's compatible with that

2104
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:11,360
compatible with

2105
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:14,400
um relative consciousness

2106
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,400
that's cast at a kind of metaphysical

2107
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:18,000
level i guess um

2108
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,560
our view would be something like well

2109
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:21,440
you know suppose

2110
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:24,719
this suppose this type of model

2111
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:27,679
allows us to explain everything that we

2112
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:29,760
we think is pertinent to consciousness

2113
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:32,960
so it allows us to account for whatever

2114
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:36,159
behavioral and cognitive functions

2115
01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:39,440
um consciousness carries out and for the

2116
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:42,080
phenomenology of consciousness

2117
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:45,120
um if it if it allowed you to to count

2118
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:49,280
account for those things um then

2119
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:51,920
and you suppose you could identify the

2120
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,360
type of structure this is

2121
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:55,920
and the sort of scale and complexity it

2122
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,520
needs to be organized on

2123
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,159
then to our way of thinking at least as

2124
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:02,400
it comes to the metaphysical issue

2125
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:05,280
we're we have a tendency to think okay

2126
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:06,960
that's just what consciousness is we

2127
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:07,920
we've discovered this

2128
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,239
empirically we discovered it aposteriori

2129
01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:12,080
there's no need to postulate

2130
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:14,640
any further metaphysics because any any

2131
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,280
metaphysical account of consciousness

2132
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,520
will actually has the same structure

2133
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:21,199
it's it's something you didn't figure

2134
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:22,960
out a priori really

2135
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:24,800
you just thought okay well here's a

2136
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,080
here's an account that would

2137
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,080
make sense of the fact that you know say

2138
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:29,280
take pancychism

2139
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,040
why is anything consciousness well you

2140
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,400
know conscious well

2141
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,080
you know if everything is conscious then

2142
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:37,280
it's no mystery that we are

2143
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:40,159
so so that's uh so that's that's an

2144
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:41,600
argument you could make well

2145
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,040
you know as you as you probably know

2146
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:45,120
there are all these different um

2147
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,640
positions in the philosophy of mind

2148
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,800
about the nature of consciousness and

2149
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,960
the distribution of consciousness that

2150
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:52,320
in my view they're all kind of

2151
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,320
epistemically on a par

2152
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:57,120
none of them are really like you can't

2153
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,120
show any of them a priori

2154
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:02,960
you can't demonstrate so um

2155
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:06,000
it seems like it's wide open to you

2156
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,080
on the theoretical level to be this kind

2157
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,760
of identity theorist

2158
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:11,280
just you when you reach you know when

2159
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:14,000
you have this structure have this level

2160
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,840
that you're conscious being that's what

2161
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,199
consciousness is we

2162
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:19,199
figure it out empirically and we don't

2163
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:20,880
need to sort of postulate anything else

2164
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,880
that said it's totally compatible with

2165
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,560
with other views so you could hold that

2166
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:25,600
no this is

2167
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:28,080
much more derived and primitive like

2168
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:29,760
sensing or something is

2169
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:32,800
is is a basic form of con or something

2170
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:33,600
like that

2171
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,960
um we we do think though that

2172
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:38,640
so here's one thing that's it's not

2173
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:41,199
exactly a priori but let's say it's a

2174
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:43,199
a strong intuition that a lot of people

2175
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:44,400
have if

2176
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,560
if you're conscious of anything that's

2177
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,000
going to involve the appearance

2178
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,000
of something to so it has this kind of

2179
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,679
appearance of

2180
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:57,280
two structure and that's a kind of

2181
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:58,800
spatial

2182
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:02,320
spatial i mean quasi-spatial structure

2183
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:05,600
a proto-geometrical structure um

2184
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,440
and and that takes you already kind of

2185
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:08,960
in the direction of of thinking of

2186
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:11,440
consciousness as like a space

2187
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:13,600
and like a projective space in fact

2188
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:14,480
right

2189
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:17,120
um that's not you know this you can't

2190
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:19,040
demonstrate that a priori but it is a

2191
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,960
strong intuition that people have so

2192
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,960
i'd like to say i think i say in in this

2193
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,000
paper going

2194
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,640
um you know follow your phenomenological

2195
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,560
muse

2196
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,239
build your build your models and see

2197
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:31,920
where they take you because we can't

2198
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:32,480
really

2199
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:34,400
determine those things a priori or just

2200
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:35,840
by

2201
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,840
banging on the table with our favorite

2202
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,320
um

2203
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:43,040
thanks um i i see adam and lee have

2204
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:43,360
their

2205
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,040
hands raised but just really quick would

2206
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,920
uh especially uh david and uh ken would

2207
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:48,800
would either of you be

2208
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,400
okay with staying for like a few minutes

2209
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,080
past the hour so we can just continue

2210
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,360
talking a few minutes

2211
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:56,480
okay i have

2212
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:00,560
i have a call in about 40 minutes but so

2213
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:01,520
i'm fine oh

2214
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,840
beautiful so we'll just um anyone can

2215
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,679
depart whenever they need to

2216
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:07,920
and uh otherwise we won't have to come

2217
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,120
to a speedy

2218
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,920
landing there but we'll go adam and then

2219
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:14,159
lee

2220
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:20,080
oh hello um

2221
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:21,760
i guess i'd like to hear a little bit

2222
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:24,320
more about uh the intuition

2223
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,719
for um why it is that existing

2224
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:27,760
simulations

2225
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:30,480
might not be conscious and in terms of

2226
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:31,520
um

2227
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:34,840
what it would actually take to get a

2228
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:36,080
sufficiency um

2229
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:37,360
this is something i've been struggling

2230
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,679
with also um the

2231
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:42,800
uh for me like i've been like mostly

2232
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,320
coming in from like the neural direction

2233
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:44,880
thing

2234
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,800
thinking of like okay what in terms of

2235
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,400
neural systems might underlie these

2236
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,159
different capacities

2237
01:19:50,159 --> 01:19:53,520
and then like what uh how would that be

2238
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:54,719
implemented

2239
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:57,520
um i become a little bit more confused

2240
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:59,280
when i start to think of alternative

2241
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:01,760
implementations so like something like

2242
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,040
um

2243
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:06,000
uh projective geometric modeling i'm

2244
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:06,960
wondering if that's

2245
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:10,320
primarily like a posterior mutable

2246
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,159
posterior medial cortices and that's

2247
01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:13,840
like giving you this sort of

2248
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:16,320
flexible spatial modeling but then this

2249
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:17,679
is like coupled

2250
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:20,800
to like um body maps of like lateral

2251
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,400
parietal lobes and that this is part of

2252
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:22,960
like

2253
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:25,920
one um basically synchronous complex

2254
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:26,400
which is

2255
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,639
mutually constraining each other as

2256
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:30,400
you're filling in this sort of

2257
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:33,679
joint estimate of the world

2258
01:20:33,679 --> 01:20:35,440
and your lived body in relation to it so

2259
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:38,080
basically exactly what you propose

2260
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,000
um and so for me it's like when i'm

2261
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,760
talking about a biological system

2262
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,600
there's a certain grain at which this

2263
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:44,800
calculation

2264
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,639
is being established through like a

2265
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:49,040
metastable synchronous complex or

2266
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:50,800
might call it like a non-equilibrium

2267
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,639
steady state distribution or

2268
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:54,880
i call it a self-organizing harmonic

2269
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:55,760
mode

2270
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,360
but if we're talking about something

2271
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:01,600
like a simulation on a turing machine

2272
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:02,880
that might be doing the geometric

2273
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:05,120
modeling by very different means um

2274
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:07,120
is that an issue is that not an issue

2275
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:08,400
for you uh

2276
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:11,440
just curious to know more thoughts on uh

2277
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:14,880
boundary problems thanks maybe i can

2278
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:18,000
give my thought about that and then can

2279
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,320
number one about the functional

2280
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:21,679
neuroanatomy

2281
01:21:21,679 --> 01:21:25,520
and the neurodynamical mechanism

2282
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:28,400
that you know may implement the type of

2283
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:30,719
process we are talking about

2284
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:33,600
i think agreeing with you in the paper

2285
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,320
we published in 2017 in the journal of

2286
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,639
theoretical biology we have at the end a

2287
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:41,840
little figure that kind of

2288
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:44,400
gross functional neural anatomical

2289
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:45,520
hypothesis

2290
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:48,320
and indeed it seems that the posterior

2291
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,480
you know

2292
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:53,520
in particular the parietal lobe and to

2293
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,679
some extent the posterior mesial

2294
01:21:55,679 --> 01:21:57,520
cortex but the posterior mesial cortex

2295
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:59,760
may be more of a is a bridge a hub

2296
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,679
towards interaction with other system

2297
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:02,000
but

2298
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,520
the parietal lobe and then we could

2299
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,280
enter into the detail uh

2300
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:08,719
is certain is probably where this sort

2301
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:09,199
of

2302
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:10,719
project as we call it in the paper

2303
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:12,800
projective geometrical engine

2304
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,679
operate and i think the way you you

2305
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:17,840
attempt to make sense of the difference

2306
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:18,800
between

2307
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,679
you know something like the model being

2308
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:22,960
processed the way

2309
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:26,159
you describe it into a brain versus into

2310
01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:27,280
a turing machine

2311
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:30,560
basically a computer is is perfectly

2312
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:34,560
uh fair and right and maybe indeed

2313
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:37,679
when you do it in the turing-like way

2314
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:40,080
like when i do my simulations with my

2315
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,520
humans and robots

2316
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:45,440
you know it doesn't you know entails the

2317
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:46,480
type of uh

2318
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:48,960
experiential aspect that we are trying

2319
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,320
to to figure out

2320
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:51,760
of which we are trying to figure out the

2321
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:53,920
cause basically the sufficient condition

2322
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:55,920
and perhaps indeed is a it's a very

2323
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,199
different context of

2324
01:22:57,199 --> 01:22:59,199
processing the way you describe it and

2325
01:22:59,199 --> 01:23:00,400
that is actually key

2326
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,560
perhaps not you know it would need more

2327
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:03,920
elaboration of course there's still

2328
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:06,400
explanatory gaps here but

2329
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:10,000
to make that process conscious so

2330
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,760
for me it's not a problem it's different

2331
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:14,480
type of of implementation we can use the

2332
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:16,320
turing life to do simulation from which

2333
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:17,040
we can

2334
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:19,280
learn a lot but probably there is

2335
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:20,400
something about

2336
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,800
you know the embodied processing with

2337
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:23,840
this type of

2338
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:26,080
whatever the brain is doing and you know

2339
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,760
i mean there was scientist

2340
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:30,480
initially and i can i mean we all know

2341
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:31,280
that actually

2342
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:33,360
we know much less about the brain than

2343
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:34,639
you know we pretend to

2344
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:36,639
uh and there are probably great and

2345
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:38,880
important deep fundamentally

2346
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:41,360
still to understand and until we have

2347
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:42,239
understood

2348
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:45,840
the brain in a much deeper way

2349
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:48,639
well we won't be able to conclude in

2350
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:51,199
that question

2351
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:55,360
ken yeah i i can just add that

2352
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:58,960
you know um i mean suppose it

2353
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:01,920
it it sounds a little odd you know from

2354
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:02,239
the

2355
01:24:02,239 --> 01:24:05,120
kind of computer science perspective to

2356
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:06,320
think that

2357
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:09,199
say doing performing all these

2358
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:10,960
computations in a massively

2359
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:14,000
parallel way so that um you know

2360
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:18,080
i mean you can imagine you know a tinker

2361
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:21,760
uh computer doing the computations

2362
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,120
involved they're taking like

2363
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,800
thousands of years or something and you

2364
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,320
think okay that's

2365
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:29,360
it's not it's not merely running this

2366
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:30,239
program

2367
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:32,880
right but if you say okay it has to do

2368
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:33,840
with um

2369
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:36,960
massively parallel integrated

2370
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,400
computation of these

2371
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:41,679
uh functions um that of course sounds a

2372
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:42,000
bit

2373
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,679
like um like strange like why why would

2374
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:47,760
simply being able to do it really fast

2375
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:50,320
or do it in this parallel way make it

2376
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:51,840
make a difference

2377
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:55,679
um but you know

2378
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:58,960
if you're serious identity

2379
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,679
then you think well okay we'll just find

2380
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:02,159
out

2381
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:04,320
right it does it does seem really

2382
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:05,360
strange though to think

2383
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:08,400
um that a touring machine

2384
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:12,799
made out of the beer cans and string as

2385
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,880
would be consciousness so um so that's

2386
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,159
why i i think it's

2387
01:25:20,159 --> 01:25:23,360
it's a good idea to leave leave a little

2388
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:24,800
bit of hope here

2389
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,040
right

2390
01:25:29,199 --> 01:25:31,920
let me just add a little historical note

2391
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:32,880
uh it's not about

2392
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:36,080
uh but it's about von neumann you know

2393
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:37,679
in his seminal paper in

2394
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:39,280
when he was at the bell laboratory i

2395
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:41,840
believe and you derive and explain the

2396
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,199
foundation of his

2397
01:25:43,199 --> 01:25:45,760
architecture that is now basically a in

2398
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:47,600
implementation of a turing machine

2399
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:52,080
into the computers that we use currently

2400
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:54,239
actually and then you know it become

2401
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:56,000
like oh you know van neumann machine

2402
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,600
versus the wet brain

2403
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,600
but in fact von neumann in this paper

2404
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:00,800
start from uh

2405
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:03,040
models of artificial neurons the basic

2406
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:04,080
macular can be

2407
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:06,239
neurons to try to figure out how basic

2408
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:08,239
computations such as you know arithmetic

2409
01:26:08,239 --> 01:26:10,320
operation could be abstracted

2410
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:12,960
and then he proposed a serial model of

2411
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,400
computing

2412
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,239
emphasizing that at the time because

2413
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:18,000
they had to use those vacuum tubes to

2414
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:18,639
make those

2415
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:20,800
the equivalent of semiconductor you know

2416
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,080
it would be too

2417
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:24,480
too big to build a parallel machine it

2418
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,560
would just not be physically practical

2419
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,920
you would need like a giant building

2420
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:28,400
just

2421
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:30,320
you know to put enough tubes in there

2422
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,480
and so the solution of doing it

2423
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,800
in a binary manner and in a kind of

2424
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,159
sequential manner it was just a

2425
01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:37,600
practical solution

2426
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,840
okay but his thinking was broader so you

2427
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:41,679
know maybe there are also deeper aspects

2428
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:42,960
of computations

2429
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:45,679
uh you know we don't understand yet and

2430
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:47,520
that could help us also to make sense of

2431
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:49,040
the experiential

2432
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:52,800
dimension that's an hypothesis

2433
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,880
and if i could add one thing that it is

2434
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:57,120
also true that

2435
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:00,239
simply massive complexity

2436
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:04,480
hides i mean it ha it has uh sort of

2437
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:07,120
i don't i don't take this too seriously

2438
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:07,679
but you

2439
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:10,080
you all know the old sort of uh hegelian

2440
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,280
idea that um

2441
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:15,120
quantity eventually yields to quality

2442
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:18,080
so you have quantitative changes and you

2443
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:19,120
have enough of them it's

2444
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:21,760
as if it transitions to quality well

2445
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:23,760
there is one way of thinking about that

2446
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:26,639
um in a kind of not not taking the

2447
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:28,480
metaphysics of dialectics

2448
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:31,199
seriously but looking at it uh

2449
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:32,000
epistemically

2450
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,040
where very very complicated things can

2451
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:35,840
end up

2452
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:38,080
being in fact this is kind of the way we

2453
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:38,960
are

2454
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:42,480
uh oh somebody brought this up

2455
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:44,800
okay well all right so i'm speaking to

2456
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,560
nobody's going to be freaked out if i

2457
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,080
start bringing up

2458
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:51,120
hegel no

2459
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:54,639
um anyway the idea is

2460
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:58,480
that particular notion of going from

2461
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:01,760
quantity to quality so just think of

2462
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:04,719
massive complexity and you take a

2463
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:07,120
massively complex system

2464
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:10,320
as a as a as a whole it

2465
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:12,239
can behave in ways that you you have to

2466
01:28:12,239 --> 01:28:15,120
understand sort of qualitatively

2467
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:17,600
um you can't i mean you know the they'll

2468
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:18,800
even

2469
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:21,520
some things like chess playing computer

2470
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:23,199
programs to take the

2471
01:28:23,199 --> 01:28:26,239
classic example approach your chest pain

2472
01:28:26,239 --> 01:28:28,480
playing computer if it's a good program

2473
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:30,239
from the intentional stance

2474
01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:33,440
and from dennis term you you

2475
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:35,199
you regard it as you know trying to

2476
01:28:35,199 --> 01:28:37,679
attack the crew and so on you don't like

2477
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:38,239
think of

2478
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:41,440
the low level complications going on in

2479
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:42,159
it

2480
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:45,199
to to implement that so

2481
01:28:45,199 --> 01:28:46,960
that's all just to say massive

2482
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:48,239
complexity

2483
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:51,360
with the parallel massively parallel

2484
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:55,360
patient it's not totally crazy to think

2485
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:59,199
that that could yield something

2486
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:01,440
that has this kind of form and this kind

2487
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,679
of macro structure if you like

2488
01:29:03,679 --> 01:29:06,719
that we experience qualitatively

2489
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:08,719
uh the consciousness has it's not

2490
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:11,040
completely crazy to say okay yeah serial

2491
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:12,719
computation couldn't do it but

2492
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:16,320
massively parallel computation could

2493
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:18,880
here's it's no crazier than any theory

2494
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:20,159
of consciousness

2495
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:23,360
i've been um thanks for that i've been

2496
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:24,480
um

2497
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:27,440
that makes a lot of sense to me and i

2498
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:28,560
guess in my own thinking i've been

2499
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:29,920
struggling with like

2500
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:32,080
to what extent i'm dealing with

2501
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:33,040
practical

2502
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:36,239
versus in principle uh

2503
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:39,679
uh issues with respect to like

2504
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:41,120
boundaries and like what it would take

2505
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,960
to uh realize consciousness

2506
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,560
of like you could say like the massive

2507
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:47,520
parallelism is practically necessary

2508
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:50,239
but is it in principle necessary and

2509
01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:51,840
there does seem to be something strange

2510
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:52,400
like

2511
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:55,520
you know church turing uh thesis like in

2512
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:56,639
theory you could

2513
01:29:56,639 --> 01:29:58,800
do it with the beer cans and rope and

2514
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,239
let it just play out in a really long

2515
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:02,080
time ago and eventually you calculate

2516
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:02,719
the whole

2517
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:05,199
darn thing right but you're just like i

2518
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:06,560
don't know about that

2519
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:09,120
but but why so it would be like well

2520
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:10,080
practically

2521
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:11,440
there might be like a sense for like

2522
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:13,440
okay you need consciousness to both

2523
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:16,000
like inform and be informed by action

2524
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,159
perception cycles or something like that

2525
01:30:18,159 --> 01:30:20,239
but that's still a practical not

2526
01:30:20,239 --> 01:30:22,159
necessarily like an in principle

2527
01:30:22,159 --> 01:30:24,560
but then like i guess i've been

2528
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:25,520
wondering like

2529
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:28,320
okay so if it's if we're going to in

2530
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:29,280
principle it

2531
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:32,960
would be like is the computational

2532
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:34,400
objects like

2533
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:38,080
real or not um so like uh

2534
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:41,520
if like like like a simulation versus an

2535
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,280
emulation or

2536
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:46,400
things like this so like in like in

2537
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,239
with like the recurrent dynamics sort of

2538
01:30:48,239 --> 01:30:50,320
like metastable synchronous complexes

2539
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:54,320
model i'm working on uh

2540
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:56,800
even then there's like an issue of like

2541
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:58,400
is this a real thing or not and like

2542
01:30:58,400 --> 01:30:59,840
they're dealing with like this issue

2543
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:02,000
with respect to non-equilibrium uh

2544
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,080
steady states and the free energy

2545
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:05,360
principle which is like

2546
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:08,320
these um these things are defined as

2547
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:09,280
these like

2548
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:13,120
harmonic modes um but then

2549
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:16,480
their their boundaries are like

2550
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:19,520
um they seem to be

2551
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:22,880
um modeler dependent like like what

2552
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,880
um or like in a neural system like do

2553
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,880
you ever get like exact synchrony

2554
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:29,440
how much is enough to count um what's

2555
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:30,400
the

2556
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,638
uh

2557
01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:37,600
what's the time scale at which the thing

2558
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,120
actually has its existence

2559
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:42,159
as a particular attracting state and

2560
01:31:42,159 --> 01:31:44,960
relative to what and so this is where i

2561
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:45,840
start to

2562
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:50,159
uh yeah this difference between

2563
01:31:50,159 --> 01:31:53,679
practical and in in principle issues of

2564
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:57,360
implementation what would actually

2565
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:00,400
and then what would let you say okay

2566
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,159
this thing is conscious i'm

2567
01:32:02,159 --> 01:32:04,639
i'm still really confused about it

2568
01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:05,520
anyways

2569
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:08,239
may i interject do we just say may i

2570
01:32:08,239 --> 01:32:09,120
comment on that

2571
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:12,320
yeah i'm gonna go

2572
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:15,760
i don't seem to have a opposition so

2573
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:18,560
i started developing an hypothesis a

2574
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,520
while ago

2575
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:22,320
um that i published in you know in a

2576
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:23,120
journal called

2577
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:25,520
advances in neuroscience that actually

2578
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:26,400
died

2579
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:30,080
i don't think it still exists uh

2580
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:33,520
and it was kind of based on a reflection

2581
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:35,920
on my own work and the work of other in

2582
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:38,000
neuroscience and neuropsychology notably

2583
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,679
working with

2584
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:43,040
brenda showing that you know

2585
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:44,400
a lot of what we believe has been

2586
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:46,320
critical for cognition in many aspects

2587
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:47,360
of you know

2588
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,199
cognition and affective processing in

2589
01:32:49,199 --> 01:32:50,480
the brain

2590
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:52,000
like everybody believes now that the

2591
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
insular cortex is critical for

2592
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,639
craving and many aspects of the sense of

2593
01:32:56,639 --> 01:32:57,520
self well

2594
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:59,120
i worked with brain damage patients that

2595
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:01,679
basically had no insulin on both sides

2596
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:04,639
like 40 of their brain and nevertheless

2597
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:05,360
you know

2598
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:07,760
except for some deep anterior amnesia

2599
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:09,280
that could be explained by their

2600
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:12,960
whatever uh they were normal so i came

2601
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:13,360
to

2602
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:14,800
actually think that the brain is much

2603
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:17,280
more complex than we think that they are

2604
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:19,120
the way we observe it with the method we

2605
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:21,280
have no imaging or electrophysiology is

2606
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,159
very low level

2607
01:33:22,159 --> 01:33:23,520
it's not different than putting

2608
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:25,280
thermometers on a microprocessor and

2609
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:26,400
trying to infer

2610
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,960
what type of uh operating system is

2611
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,080
running

2612
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:32,639
and so i started thinking so maybe there

2613
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:33,920
are you know

2614
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:36,080
layers of abstractions that we haven't

2615
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:38,159
understood in the way the brain process

2616
01:33:38,159 --> 01:33:39,120
information

2617
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:42,080
and one analogy that came to my mind i

2618
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:43,600
was very interested in computer science

2619
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:44,560
at the time

2620
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:47,520
is the process of virtualization in

2621
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:48,880
computer science that

2622
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:51,280
is basically a way i mean it's a

2623
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:53,760
simplistic way of explaining it but

2624
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:56,639
a way of creating abstraction layers so

2625
01:33:56,639 --> 01:33:58,400
that actually at the

2626
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:00,080
user level of course we are talking

2627
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:02,000
about computer involving user but at the

2628
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:02,560
process

2629
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:06,239
level uh all the details of the hardware

2630
01:34:06,239 --> 01:34:07,280
are hidden

2631
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:09,120
you know when to take a very trivial

2632
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:11,040
example that is not a good analogy when

2633
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:11,520
you

2634
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:14,880
use your desktop computer you don't

2635
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:18,159
see the the the machine language you are

2636
01:34:18,159 --> 01:34:19,040
not

2637
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:20,960
using word you don't need to program in

2638
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:22,960
assembly language to use your

2639
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:26,080
microsoft word uh interface

2640
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:28,080
so virtualization is actually a process

2641
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:30,719
through which

2642
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:35,199
software or process can be uh

2643
01:34:35,199 --> 01:34:38,000
you know abstracted hide the complexity

2644
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,440
of the hardware

2645
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,520
and also become much more resilient in

2646
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:43,119
the sense that then you can kind of move

2647
01:34:43,119 --> 01:34:45,280
things around across servers across you

2648
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:47,280
know different things so

2649
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:49,440
it's not an answer to the question but i

2650
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:51,600
i still have this intuition and belief

2651
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:52,960
that perhaps there is something

2652
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:53,920
analogous

2653
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:56,000
that is bridging the gap to some extent

2654
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,199
between you know what we

2655
01:34:57,199 --> 01:34:59,280
know and observe of the brain and

2656
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:01,119
subjective experience and more

2657
01:35:01,119 --> 01:35:03,679
you know higher order level process that

2658
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:05,440
is analogous to

2659
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:08,159
virtualization that basically the

2660
01:35:08,159 --> 01:35:10,400
phenomenal experience of consciousness

2661
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:13,679
is very useful for active inference but

2662
01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:15,920
relies on neural mechanisms that

2663
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:16,960
precisely

2664
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:20,239
are designed to hide the

2665
01:35:20,239 --> 01:35:23,360
nitty gritty small and complex details

2666
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:26,159
of the hardware and therefore makes it

2667
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:26,880
more you know

2668
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:29,360
usable more practical and of course at

2669
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:31,040
the same time it takes longer because

2670
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:33,679
you need to run many cycles to do that

2671
01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:35,360
for instance if you want to simulate a

2672
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:37,440
certain type of microprocessor

2673
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:38,800
over another architectural

2674
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:41,199
microprocessor etc etc

2675
01:35:41,199 --> 01:35:43,440
so i think there is something there

2676
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:45,600
about trying to understand this

2677
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:48,480
how the brain may create virtual space

2678
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,719
and through virtualization process that

2679
01:35:50,719 --> 01:35:54,000
then may help bridge the gap between the

2680
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,760
different domain we are talking about

2681
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:57,679
even though it's not sufficient yet in

2682
01:35:57,679 --> 01:35:58,480
my mind

2683
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,800
it doesn't fully address the problem

2684
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:01,679
cool

2685
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:04,719
just a couple notes to tie together

2686
01:36:04,719 --> 01:36:06,480
a little bit of the discussion so we've

2687
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:08,400
heard about a few classic

2688
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:10,480
philosophy of science dichotomies like

2689
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:12,320
necessary insufficient

2690
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:14,719
uh practical and principled from

2691
01:36:14,719 --> 01:36:16,159
philosophy and then also like real

2692
01:36:16,159 --> 01:36:17,280
versus unreal

2693
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:20,159
seems like to some degree brains would

2694
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:21,199
like

2695
01:36:21,199 --> 01:36:24,320
have to

2696
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,880
because they're so complex they would

2697
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,560
have to create these abstraction layers

2698
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:29,760
just to

2699
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:32,080
like work as control systems just to

2700
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:34,320
work as integrated systems

2701
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:38,960
yeah they would they'd have to

2702
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,480
yeah like you'd have to like self-core

2703
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:42,000
screen

2704
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,360
just to actually have purchase to do

2705
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:47,520
like hierarchical control

2706
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:51,199
and then once you're doing this um

2707
01:36:51,199 --> 01:36:53,840
then you might get potential some like

2708
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:55,840
flexible multiple realizability from

2709
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:57,600
that potentially

2710
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:00,480
or or or or non flexibility too

2711
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:01,360
depending on like

2712
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:04,320
how you did it but

2713
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:07,840
yeah you summarize adam again very good

2714
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:08,719
summary of

2715
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:12,800
in better presentation of my own thing

2716
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:15,360
well you've uh influenced me very

2717
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:16,400
heavily so

2718
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:20,239
uh i don't think that's a coincidence

2719
01:37:20,239 --> 01:37:23,280
um yeah one just to bring a few of these

2720
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:24,719
threads together this is all really

2721
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:25,840
interesting stuff

2722
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:28,239
so one is that in complexity we say more

2723
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:28,960
is different

2724
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:30,639
and that's related to this qualitative

2725
01:37:30,639 --> 01:37:32,480
to quantitative

2726
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:33,920
more quantitative changes can lead to

2727
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:35,679
qualitative differences through phase

2728
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:36,600
transitions

2729
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:38,719
self-organization just qualitatively

2730
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:39,920
different behavior

2731
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:42,239
strong or weak emergence from just

2732
01:37:42,239 --> 01:37:43,440
quantitatively more

2733
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:44,719
and then that's always going to be a

2734
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:46,639
relational question how many grains of

2735
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:48,560
sand are in a heap that's the whole

2736
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:49,199
point is

2737
01:37:49,199 --> 01:37:51,760
that's not pretending to be an objective

2738
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:52,639
question it's about

2739
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:54,400
objects but it's not pretending to be a

2740
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:55,840
non-relational

2741
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:57,199
question even though it is about the

2742
01:37:57,199 --> 01:37:59,760
world uh and these ideas about which

2743
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:01,040
levels of the system

2744
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:03,600
are available for introspection versus

2745
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:04,719
which art

2746
01:38:04,719 --> 01:38:06,800
is related not just to attention schema

2747
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:08,719
theory and attentional assailants

2748
01:38:08,719 --> 01:38:11,119
uh saliences from the fep and active

2749
01:38:11,119 --> 01:38:11,760
inference

2750
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:13,520
but also a lot of things in gerda

2751
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:15,760
escherbach and so there is a uh

2752
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:17,520
hofstetter citation and a lot of these

2753
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,679
ideas have a lot of analogy there

2754
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:22,000
which just shows how in some senses many

2755
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:22,880
of the same

2756
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:26,400
questions are returned to even 40 years

2757
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:27,119
later

2758
01:38:27,119 --> 01:38:30,239
so we have to balance out a big

2759
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:31,440
computing hype

2760
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:33,280
from the really quintessential

2761
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:34,960
philosophical questions like

2762
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:37,360
necessary sufficient practical versus

2763
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:38,159
principle

2764
01:38:38,159 --> 01:38:40,560
real versus unreal perspectival and

2765
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:41,760
taking that seriously

2766
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:43,840
the relational perspective integrating

2767
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:46,080
topology and geometry so

2768
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:49,040
it's just really this great discussion

2769
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:49,679
and that

2770
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:51,119
the way the paper and actually the

2771
01:38:51,119 --> 01:38:52,960
sequence of papers is written is

2772
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:56,080
very clear interfaces and highly

2773
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:57,360
compressed focus

2774
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:59,920
with different metaphysics but just

2775
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:01,040
saying it's neither

2776
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:03,040
uh simply necessary nor sufficient to

2777
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,400
have this projected mapping

2778
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:06,800
it's just under condition x and y for

2779
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:07,760
example the

2780
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:10,480
vanishing um you know privilege point

2781
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:11,119
and

2782
01:39:11,119 --> 01:39:12,560
all these things we were talking about

2783
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:14,560
it just goes downstream from there so

2784
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:16,239
it's an interesting approach and

2785
01:39:16,239 --> 01:39:18,400
as we're hearing from this discussion

2786
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,600
that come together

2787
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:21,520
in thinking about these topics so thanks

2788
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:23,280
for like bringing all these

2789
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:26,400
perspectives the tables this cool stuff

2790
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:29,679
um maybe ken can you remember

2791
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:32,480
your reference that you had before on

2792
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,880
the glass of later works and get alex

2793
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:36,719
because actually ken has worked a lot on

2794
01:39:36,719 --> 01:39:38,560
these questions that actually

2795
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:41,840
contributed to the i'm a strange look

2796
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:44,719
uh strange look book of the glass of

2797
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:47,280
stator by editing a version of it and

2798
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:50,400
he knows later very well so maybe things

2799
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:51,360
to say

2800
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:52,960
cool this is what the this is the

2801
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,960
section that where it was one of the

2802
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:56,719
sections where hofstetter was cited

2803
01:39:56,719 --> 01:39:58,639
but i'd love to hear about this can it

2804
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:00,800
be great thanks

2805
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:02,800
yeah as well it's just a little bit of

2806
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:05,760
um i guess history about this like um

2807
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:10,159
actually that i met david through um

2808
01:40:10,159 --> 01:40:12,320
he and antonio dimaggio were

2809
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:14,239
contributing a paper to a book i was

2810
01:40:14,239 --> 01:40:15,520
editing

2811
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:18,080
um and douglas hofstetter also had a

2812
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:19,040
paper in that

2813
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:22,719
book and um you know the papers were

2814
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:23,840
supposed to be like

2815
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:26,159
i don't know 30 pages maybe in hofstede

2816
01:40:26,159 --> 01:40:29,519
or turned in 100 pages

2817
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:33,040
so in this kind of typical way so i i

2818
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:34,719
i said well look you know we have to

2819
01:40:34,719 --> 01:40:36,960
edit this and he's like you know

2820
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:40,080
um okay but you know be very careful

2821
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:42,719
and so i went through this long process

2822
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:45,199
of editing down his contribution i cut

2823
01:40:45,199 --> 01:40:46,639
it in half

2824
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:49,840
and and that eventually became i am a

2825
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:50,639
strange loop

2826
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:54,560
which is uh cited here um but he he was

2827
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:55,040
uh

2828
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:57,760
ultimately uh okay with with my editing

2829
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:58,800
job but

2830
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:02,400
that's yeah so and and in particular i i

2831
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:03,679
what i thought was really

2832
01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:06,880
ended up being really nice about um i am

2833
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:08,239
a strange loop

2834
01:41:08,239 --> 01:41:12,159
uh the way in which hofstetter

2835
01:41:12,159 --> 01:41:16,080
is able to um describe

2836
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:19,600
you know the cause basically the causal

2837
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:23,679
efficacy of um

2838
01:41:23,679 --> 01:41:25,840
implement you know of uh implementing

2839
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:27,040
mathematical

2840
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:30,560
forms and so it's it's it's you you know

2841
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:31,280
you ten

2842
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:34,480
at least in philosophy i think think of

2843
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:37,360
mathematics as a totally like abstract

2844
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:39,440
platonic way it doesn't have any causal

2845
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:41,280
powers and so on

2846
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:43,119
and then of course there's the old much

2847
01:41:43,119 --> 01:41:44,719
you know there's the aristotelian

2848
01:41:44,719 --> 01:41:46,159
tradition which says no no

2849
01:41:46,159 --> 01:41:48,400
the forms are actually in the matter

2850
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:51,760
they're implemented in the matter

2851
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:53,600
and but that's that position is not

2852
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:55,520
particularly um

2853
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:57,600
i mean you can find it but it's it's

2854
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:59,360
kind of like it's not the dominant sort

2855
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:00,080
of thumbnail

2856
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:01,920
sketch of this issue in the minds of

2857
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:03,119
most philosophers but

2858
01:42:03,119 --> 01:42:04,800
i found hofstetter's book to be really

2859
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,960
um really good on that

2860
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:09,520
like you know implementing certain

2861
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:11,280
computational structure

2862
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:14,239
certain ultimately mathematical forms

2863
01:42:14,239 --> 01:42:14,719
has

2864
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:17,440
real causal power you know it does

2865
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:18,639
change

2866
01:42:18,639 --> 01:42:21,040
uh the system that implements it and and

2867
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:22,480
it's perfectly

2868
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,400
legitimate to think of it as a causally

2869
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:25,760
real uh

2870
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:29,280
thing yep one example from hofstetter's

2871
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:30,960
writing that reminded me of today

2872
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:32,800
was when we were talking about whether

2873
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:34,560
it would simply be enough to have a data

2874
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:36,080
processing model that involved a

2875
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:37,840
projective geometrical component would

2876
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:39,360
that be necessary or sufficient for

2877
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,159
consciousness

2878
01:42:40,159 --> 01:42:42,880
and you're very articulated answer was

2879
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:43,440
about how

2880
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:44,880
actually we know that these are some

2881
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:46,800
sort of uh features

2882
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:48,320
of what we want to be modeling but

2883
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:50,560
they're neither at the necessary nor

2884
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:51,520
sufficient tier

2885
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:52,800
they're things that we're seeing as like

2886
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:54,159
sort of being spun off from some

2887
01:42:54,159 --> 01:42:55,440
underlying process that there's still a

2888
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:56,800
lot of mystery around

2889
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:59,119
and so that's like the phonographs um

2890
01:42:59,119 --> 01:43:01,040
with the low resolution phonographs in

2891
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:02,400
gerbach it's like

2892
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:04,400
you can make a very limited thing that

2893
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:05,600
does one thing

2894
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:07,280
without error or without some of the

2895
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:08,639
fancy attributes

2896
01:43:08,639 --> 01:43:11,040
but then to extrapolate from this less

2897
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:12,960
is different more is different case

2898
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:14,400
it's like well it's not a phonograph

2899
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:15,840
it's a hammer it's like okay it doesn't

2900
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:16,560
play records

2901
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:18,480
yep well it's that kind of a phonograph

2902
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:20,000
that's what it's like to be that kind of

2903
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:20,800
a phonograph

2904
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:22,239
that's what it's like to be a light

2905
01:43:22,239 --> 01:43:24,719
switch okay well that's not really the

2906
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:25,920
complexity of system

2907
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:27,679
that we're talking about here which is

2908
01:43:27,679 --> 01:43:30,320
the embedded in cultured human

2909
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:32,639
and then that level of complexity the

2910
01:43:32,639 --> 01:43:34,639
full featured phonograph

2911
01:43:34,639 --> 01:43:37,199
opens itself because of its strange loop

2912
01:43:37,199 --> 01:43:39,199
nature to this whole new

2913
01:43:39,199 --> 01:43:42,560
universe of recursion and of loops

2914
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:45,600
and of uh self-reflection projection

2915
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:47,760
and then the phase transition or more is

2916
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:49,280
different question is like

2917
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:51,920
how do we get from things that don't

2918
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:53,679
have that strange loop feature to things

2919
01:43:53,679 --> 01:43:54,560
that do

2920
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:56,560
but there's nothing that is sort of a

2921
01:43:56,560 --> 01:43:58,800
strange loop or is not a strange loop

2922
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:00,400
it's like either it loops back with

2923
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:02,080
sufficient complexity to be strange in

2924
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:02,880
the world

2925
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:05,440
or it's just not strange enough to be as

2926
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:06,719
interesting as these

2927
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:08,639
open-ended infinite generative systems

2928
01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:10,239
that we seem to be participating

2929
01:44:10,239 --> 01:44:13,199
in adam

2930
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:15,119
and i'm curious about how this interface

2931
01:44:15,119 --> 01:44:16,719
is with free energy because i've

2932
01:44:16,719 --> 01:44:17,840
i don't i don't think there's been a

2933
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:19,760
hotset or free energy crossover quite

2934
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:20,000
like

2935
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:23,119
this adam hi

2936
01:44:23,119 --> 01:44:26,080
um i'm thinking again about what uh

2937
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:27,520
david was mentioning with this sort of

2938
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:28,199
like

2939
01:44:28,199 --> 01:44:30,880
reciprocity or mutuality of perspective

2940
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:31,600
of like

2941
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:33,040
seeing and then like looking at

2942
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:34,719
something and then this and being looked

2943
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:36,080
at and

2944
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:39,280
the ways in which um some of these

2945
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:40,560
things might be inter-subjectively

2946
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:42,239
bootstrapped

2947
01:44:42,239 --> 01:44:44,560
and i guess i'm wondering um whether

2948
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:45,920
that

2949
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:47,679
puts like a strange loop like right at

2950
01:44:47,679 --> 01:44:49,040
the heart

2951
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:51,840
um of this model and i'm also wondering

2952
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:52,639
whether

2953
01:44:52,639 --> 01:44:55,520
one of the things that might like

2954
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:56,159
potentially

2955
01:44:56,159 --> 01:45:00,000
get you is a um recursion

2956
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,440
and like a and a a powerful kind of

2957
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:04,960
reflexivity

2958
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:06,719
which would then you can then start

2959
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:07,920
talking about things like conscious

2960
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:08,560
access

2961
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:10,960
and all sorts of metacognition kind of

2962
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:13,280
like growing out of that potentially

2963
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:17,199
um yeah some thoughts ken you need to

2964
01:45:17,199 --> 01:45:19,280
answer that question you know when it

2965
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:20,239
comes to

2966
01:45:20,239 --> 01:45:22,159
self-reference and uh non-wealth from

2967
01:45:22,159 --> 01:45:24,320
that said theory and all projects etc

2968
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:27,679
you are the one to to address that

2969
01:45:27,679 --> 01:45:30,560
okay well so actually that volume that

2970
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:30,960
uh

2971
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:34,960
david contributed to and uh

2972
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:37,280
hofstede are contributing it was it was

2973
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:39,440
a book called the self-representational

2974
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:41,280
approaches to consciousness

2975
01:45:41,280 --> 01:45:43,600
um and it's was most of it was written

2976
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,679
by you know analytic philosophers and

2977
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:46,320
some

2978
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:48,159
some a couple of phenomenology

2979
01:45:48,159 --> 01:45:49,679
phenomenologists but

2980
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:51,920
the that was the theme basically how do

2981
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:53,679
you how you know the people who think

2982
01:45:53,679 --> 01:45:54,080
that

2983
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:57,440
like like i long have that consciousness

2984
01:45:57,440 --> 01:46:00,480
involves this kind of reflexivity uh

2985
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:01,280
kind of uh

2986
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:03,600
self-awareness that is not just it's not

2987
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:04,719
just introspection

2988
01:46:04,719 --> 01:46:07,119
it's a more basic notion of reflexivity

2989
01:46:07,119 --> 01:46:08,480
than being able to

2990
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:10,000
attend to yourself or reflect on

2991
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,080
yourself and that that

2992
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:15,119
book was uh was about that but i in that

2993
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:17,920
book i kind of looked at ways of

2994
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:19,199
formalizing

2995
01:46:19,199 --> 01:46:22,880
this using so the hopster we we

2996
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:25,440
i've asked hofstetter to contribute to

2997
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:26,080
it because

2998
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:27,520
we we thought that's that's right in

2999
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:29,119
line with girdle escher bach and the

3000
01:46:29,119 --> 01:46:30,080
notion of

3001
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:31,600
kind of using the notion of meta

3002
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:33,760
mathematics and self-representation

3003
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:36,719
in self reference in um in the meta

3004
01:46:36,719 --> 01:46:37,520
mathematical

3005
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:40,639
context as sort of one model for

3006
01:46:40,639 --> 01:46:42,960
the kind of self awareness that's

3007
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:44,880
involved in consciousness he of course

3008
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:46,159
that's the strain that's the kind of

3009
01:46:46,159 --> 01:46:47,920
quintessential strange loop

3010
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:51,440
for him with respect to consciousness um

3011
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:54,719
but we i uh you know looked at models

3012
01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:57,440
using hypersets like sets that contain

3013
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:58,400
themselves

3014
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:02,480
or as members um and

3015
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:05,760
now recently though i mean we we kind of

3016
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:07,440
actually working on that is kind of at

3017
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:09,199
the origin of the the whole

3018
01:47:09,199 --> 01:47:12,159
uh project the whole pcm um project

3019
01:47:12,159 --> 01:47:13,360
because

3020
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:16,960
um i i moved back to iowa city

3021
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:20,639
at in like 2007

3022
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:22,880
i think that's right and um david was

3023
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:24,639
there um

3024
01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:28,480
at uh it's still in the in the he had um

3025
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:30,400
graduated from the neuroscience program

3026
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:31,840
there but he was still

3027
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:33,520
working at the neuroscience program at

3028
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:35,840
iowa and we kind of formed a little

3029
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:37,040
research group

3030
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:39,920
just based on this and this eventually

3031
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:41,199
you know sort of

3032
01:47:41,199 --> 01:47:43,280
we we could have discussed geometrical

3033
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:44,800
models a little bit but

3034
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:48,239
but david really had the breakthrough um

3035
01:47:48,239 --> 01:47:50,400
with regard to thinking of projective

3036
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:52,080
geometry as the

3037
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:55,760
the the way forward uh somewhere around

3038
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:59,440
2010 or something like that but we um

3039
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:01,760
we long wondered how how can you you

3040
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:03,199
know can you really connect

3041
01:48:03,199 --> 01:48:05,360
these two threads this the the

3042
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:07,199
geometrical part

3043
01:48:07,199 --> 01:48:10,400
um the projective geometry and um this

3044
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:12,159
notion of

3045
01:48:12,159 --> 01:48:14,000
for lack of well to use hofstadter's

3046
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,080
term strange strange loopiness

3047
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:19,199
of consciousness um and we

3048
01:48:19,199 --> 01:48:21,199
we're actually still working on this so

3049
01:48:21,199 --> 01:48:22,639
we we we

3050
01:48:22,639 --> 01:48:24,960
we uh we think we're not certain but we

3051
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,960
think we

3052
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:29,360
thanks to daniel because that daniel

3053
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:30,320
vincent

3054
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:33,600
um we think we we found a way to connect

3055
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:35,600
these two notions finally

3056
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:39,040
um more clearly um dave do you want to

3057
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:41,440
say a little bit about that

3058
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:44,639
about so how the how the how the pcm

3059
01:48:44,639 --> 01:48:47,920
can sort of um make sense of the

3060
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:49,840
this notion of strange loopedness

3061
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:52,239
loopiness strange loopiness

3062
01:48:52,239 --> 01:48:54,800
yeah so that was uh really a driving

3063
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:56,000
force indian in

3064
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,280
trying to select a a model uh that the

3065
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:00,639
model would

3066
01:49:00,639 --> 01:49:03,679
incorporate intrinsically properties

3067
01:49:03,679 --> 01:49:04,560
like that so

3068
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:06,480
when i was trying to because i always

3069
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:07,920
had been convinced that you know there

3070
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:09,360
was something geometrical about

3071
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:11,199
nutrition and so we needed to

3072
01:49:11,199 --> 01:49:14,320
move from kind of abstract graph theory

3073
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:17,040
and even with this kind of non-well from

3074
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:18,719
that sort of set theory that allows you

3075
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:20,159
these loops etc

3076
01:49:20,159 --> 01:49:22,000
into something more phenomenal more

3077
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:23,840
experiential more concrete

3078
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:26,880
so i was looking into kind of possible

3079
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:29,520
geometries that had weird features

3080
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:30,880
beyond this perspective

3081
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:33,840
intuition from which we introduced that

3082
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:35,440
and this projective geometric

3083
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:39,280
geometry under some boundary condition

3084
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:41,520
but actually it's intrinsic to it

3085
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:44,639
as a natural loop

3086
01:49:44,639 --> 01:49:46,960
if you wish what i'm going to say is

3087
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:48,639
going to sound very acquired

3088
01:49:48,639 --> 01:49:49,920
and it's a kind of qualitative

3089
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:51,360
description of things that needs to be

3090
01:49:51,360 --> 01:49:53,360
expressed and formulated vigorously so

3091
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:54,960
sorry for to the mathematician that may

3092
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:56,000
listen if i'm

3093
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,480
you know doing it the right way but

3094
01:49:58,480 --> 01:49:59,920
basically

3095
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:02,480
when you look at a point at infinity in

3096
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:03,679
front of you

3097
01:50:03,679 --> 01:50:05,760
okay so the vanishing point just in

3098
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:07,119
front of you

3099
01:50:07,119 --> 01:50:09,360
that's the same point that the back of

3100
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:10,960
the point that is actually

3101
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:14,000
the antipodal point in the back

3102
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,320
on type of that point so two opposite

3103
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:17,520
points at infinity

3104
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:20,480
in that in projective space are

3105
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:22,159
topologically glued

3106
01:50:22,159 --> 01:50:24,800
so that in some sense actually if you

3107
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:25,280
wear

3108
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:28,560
kind of a virtual little creature

3109
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:31,040
moving into the space of consciousness

3110
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:33,920
uh when you reach the point at infinity

3111
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:35,760
you find yourself on the other side of

3112
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:37,440
the space

3113
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:40,639
and uh if you think about

3114
01:50:40,639 --> 01:50:43,520
it it's just as if uh actually the

3115
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:44,960
projective space

3116
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:48,320
you know at you know this when you kind

3117
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:49,599
of start messing with the

3118
01:50:49,599 --> 01:50:52,000
or considering the plane at infinity and

3119
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,239
its topological properties

3120
01:50:54,239 --> 01:50:58,719
basically was kind of a sort of

3121
01:50:58,719 --> 01:51:01,760
mirror in the sense that basically when

3122
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:03,360
i look in front

3123
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:04,800
that's not the case in a visual

3124
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:06,560
experience obviously but that's in such

3125
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:08,719
that is in the structure of the geometry

3126
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:10,320
i look quite unquote

3127
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:13,360
of myself looking in front from the back

3128
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:15,520
in a kind of reverse way that's a

3129
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:17,199
property that is actually intrinsic to

3130
01:51:17,199 --> 01:51:19,040
projective spaces

3131
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:22,239
but that we don't normally see

3132
01:51:22,239 --> 01:51:25,040
okay cool stuff here thanks for sharing

3133
01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:25,920
all this history

3134
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:27,920
too so just two thoughts one is this

3135
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:29,679
virtualization idea

3136
01:51:29,679 --> 01:51:33,520
and in gerda usherbach it's prelude ant

3137
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:34,080
fugue

3138
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:37,360
aunt hillary the ant colony and uh

3139
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:39,280
is it a virtual machine well there's yes

3140
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:41,599
and no in one sense

3141
01:51:41,599 --> 01:51:43,520
lower level details are shielded to the

3142
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:45,440
more semantically operative top levels

3143
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:47,040
so that's virtualization for sure

3144
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:48,800
concurrent programming as well

3145
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:50,800
but is it a virtual machine in the sense

3146
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:52,080
that it's a dot

3147
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:53,920
vm that i can run on a different

3148
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:55,599
operating system no

3149
01:51:55,599 --> 01:51:57,920
that's not even the ant colony os that's

3150
01:51:57,920 --> 01:51:59,840
not a strategy that transfers

3151
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:02,320
so the virtual machine metaphor captures

3152
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:03,840
one aspect perfectly which is that

3153
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:05,520
there's shielding of lower levels of the

3154
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:06,719
quote assembly code

3155
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:08,159
but also there's another feature of

3156
01:52:08,159 --> 01:52:09,920
virtual machines that they've come to

3157
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:10,320
mean

3158
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:12,080
in the modern computing environment

3159
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:13,840
which is like reproducible computing

3160
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:15,760
and that's definitely not the case

3161
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:17,360
that's because we have this embodied

3162
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:18,000
inactive

3163
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,679
ecological element so that's kind of a

3164
01:52:19,679 --> 01:52:22,639
cool uh extension of a hofstetter idea

3165
01:52:22,639 --> 01:52:24,480
and then this idea of infinity being on

3166
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:26,480
the other side it's sort of like you

3167
01:52:26,480 --> 01:52:28,320
would if your light rays were being bent

3168
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:29,599
around the sphere

3169
01:52:29,599 --> 01:52:32,320
or uh whatever shape we're on it would

3170
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:32,639
be

3171
01:52:32,639 --> 01:52:34,239
seeing around so that's straight out it

3172
01:52:34,239 --> 01:52:35,599
like a laser so that's sort of an

3173
01:52:35,599 --> 01:52:36,880
attentional laser

3174
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:38,880
reflected by the higher concentration of

3175
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:40,080
photoreceptors the

3176
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:41,760
increased sensitivity to observations

3177
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:43,920
there but that being the point of

3178
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:44,719
attention

3179
01:52:44,719 --> 01:52:46,800
and even meditative practices often

3180
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:48,639
focusing on attentional

3181
01:52:48,639 --> 01:52:51,760
points and uh visual rays like that but

3182
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:53,360
it does if you think about the

3183
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:54,560
the ray of light going all the way

3184
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:56,400
around it would be the trajectory you

3185
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:57,360
would look at

3186
01:52:57,360 --> 01:53:00,639
to see yourself from the back so very

3187
01:53:00,639 --> 01:53:02,320
interesting there and that's related to

3188
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:04,480
our conception of the space of the earth

3189
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:06,080
whereas on a flat plane it would just go

3190
01:53:06,080 --> 01:53:07,840
to infinity and then pop through in like

3191
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:08,239
a

3192
01:53:08,239 --> 01:53:09,840
piercing way because the space doesn't

3193
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:13,840
bend back on itself adam

3194
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:24,719
sorry yeah so

3195
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:28,159
i'm thinking that you um might be

3196
01:53:28,159 --> 01:53:29,440
providing

3197
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:33,440
an additional account of some of the uh

3198
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:35,599
phenomena that uh graziano tries to

3199
01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:38,159
describe with the tension schema theory

3200
01:53:38,159 --> 01:53:40,880
in terms of um certain intuitions about

3201
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:43,040
the nature of consciousness and

3202
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:46,480
selfhood and a kind of like um awareness

3203
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:47,920
is like a soul-like

3204
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:51,760
ethereal non-material intuition

3205
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:55,119
and so for graziano for him

3206
01:53:55,119 --> 01:53:57,520
uh consciousness you know it's this low

3207
01:53:57,520 --> 01:53:58,560
dimensional

3208
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:01,119
sketch necessarily reduced

3209
01:54:01,119 --> 01:54:03,199
dimensionality for the sake of control

3210
01:54:03,199 --> 01:54:05,920
um to have a model that's more

3211
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:07,599
handleable it throws away details and

3212
01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:08,960
gives you purchase

3213
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:11,840
but that this like low dimensionality to

3214
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:13,760
it is like the thing that makes you

3215
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:15,679
that if this is your awareness this is

3216
01:54:15,679 --> 01:54:18,239
um and your sense of consciousness and

3217
01:54:18,239 --> 01:54:20,000
and self coming from this this is part

3218
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:21,360
of certain intuitions about

3219
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:23,119
like immaterial souls and things like

3220
01:54:23,119 --> 01:54:25,119
this but

3221
01:54:25,119 --> 01:54:28,400
if your perspective inherently involves

3222
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:30,080
this kind of like

3223
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:32,719
strange loop this like difficult

3224
01:54:32,719 --> 01:54:35,440
conceivability where it's like you are

3225
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:37,520
both the constant context for everything

3226
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:38,800
the reference point

3227
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:40,400
but you're the one thing that's like

3228
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:42,800
invisible and in this kind of

3229
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:46,080
paradoxical way i'm wondering if even

3230
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:47,199
i'm wondering if that potentially

3231
01:54:47,199 --> 01:54:49,679
contributes to similar aspects of

3232
01:54:49,679 --> 01:54:51,119
phenomenology

3233
01:54:51,119 --> 01:54:54,239
where like certain aspects of kind of

3234
01:54:54,239 --> 01:54:56,639
like mystical intuitions

3235
01:54:56,639 --> 01:54:59,280
about the self and consciousness some

3236
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:01,599
thoughts

3237
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:04,719
cool question and we're taking it nice

3238
01:55:04,719 --> 01:55:05,040
um

3239
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:09,280
in interesting areas david why don't you

3240
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:11,119
can ken could say a lot of things oh

3241
01:55:11,119 --> 01:55:12,639
sorry somebody else wanted to talk

3242
01:55:12,639 --> 01:55:15,520
nope you or can go ahead okay i'm gonna

3243
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:16,719
i'm gonna just

3244
01:55:16,719 --> 01:55:19,599
say something but ken will be able to

3245
01:55:19,599 --> 01:55:21,040
better elaborate

3246
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:24,159
there was a a if

3247
01:55:24,159 --> 01:55:27,840
a mystic or was a zoterist

3248
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:31,280
named rudolf steiner right ken who

3249
01:55:31,280 --> 01:55:34,239
actually uh believe that projective

3250
01:55:34,239 --> 01:55:35,679
geometry

3251
01:55:35,679 --> 01:55:38,400
uh because of this sort of reciprocity

3252
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:40,800
of perspective when i look at the sky

3253
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:43,920
the sky look back at myself was of

3254
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:46,159
connection to god

3255
01:55:46,159 --> 01:55:48,560
now we don't understand you necessarily

3256
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:50,480
but there is a history of mystical and

3257
01:55:50,480 --> 01:55:52,080
esoteric traditions

3258
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:54,400
that invokes projective geometry in the

3259
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:55,520
past

3260
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:58,800
in that kind of context right can

3261
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:01,040
yeah so there's there's the steiner uh

3262
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:02,239
tradition which

3263
01:56:02,239 --> 01:56:05,679
um one of his students i believe she was

3264
01:56:05,679 --> 01:56:06,480
one of the students

3265
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:09,599
olive witchier she wrote a really

3266
01:56:09,599 --> 01:56:13,199
introduction to projective geometry um

3267
01:56:13,199 --> 01:56:15,199
which uh i highly recommend looking at

3268
01:56:15,199 --> 01:56:18,000
it's got wonderful illustrations and um

3269
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,840
and they they seem to have been on to

3270
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:22,880
the idea that the projected geometry was

3271
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:23,679
crucial to

3272
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:26,800
uh consciousness and mind um

3273
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:30,239
and but you know they also had a lot of

3274
01:56:30,239 --> 01:56:33,360
strange other notions that that

3275
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:36,320
made them seem like cranks you know um

3276
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:37,760
and then there was another

3277
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:40,560
interest in just higher dimensional

3278
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:41,840
geometry

3279
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:45,199
that came from people like um

3280
01:56:45,199 --> 01:56:48,239
uh pd ospensky if you've heard of this

3281
01:56:48,239 --> 01:56:52,639
this this guy um he um

3282
01:56:52,639 --> 01:56:54,239
he was he book called the fourth

3283
01:56:54,239 --> 01:56:55,679
dimension and

3284
01:56:55,679 --> 01:56:58,159
his his view is that there must be part

3285
01:56:58,159 --> 01:56:59,199
of our

3286
01:56:59,199 --> 01:57:02,159
selves that we don't have access to in

3287
01:57:02,159 --> 01:57:02,639
this

3288
01:57:02,639 --> 01:57:04,960
in in the way in which we have access to

3289
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:06,800
three-dimensional objects

3290
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:08,320
which kind of and he thought that would

3291
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:10,000
be in the fourth dimension

3292
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:11,520
it's not clear that he thought that it

3293
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:13,440
was a projective geometrical

3294
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:16,719
structure but um still it's sort of

3295
01:57:16,719 --> 01:57:19,440
you know sort of in the ballpark um well

3296
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:21,199
just one quote there is that uh

3297
01:57:21,199 --> 01:57:24,800
ospensky who studied under uh gerd jeff

3298
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:27,280
there's some deep esoteric threads and

3299
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:28,880
of course going much

3300
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:30,880
deeper through time alternative ideas

3301
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:31,920
about number

3302
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:35,440
geometry color and of course philosophy

3303
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:39,280
those are in many ways what the uh

3304
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:42,080
less religious at least in the exoteric

3305
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:42,880
sense

3306
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:45,360
of these wisdom traditions so it's very

3307
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:46,400
interesting to see

3308
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:49,440
the geometry spiritual connection

3309
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:52,880
return after who knows maybe never even

3310
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:53,840
a separation

3311
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:55,599
but at the very least in most people's

3312
01:57:55,599 --> 01:57:57,360
mind they'd think of it as shapes on a

3313
01:57:57,360 --> 01:57:58,080
plane

3314
01:57:58,080 --> 01:58:00,719
not about the conceptions of the lower

3315
01:58:00,719 --> 01:58:01,119
level

3316
01:58:01,119 --> 01:58:03,360
structure of reality or the higher level

3317
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:04,880
structures of reality like the shape the

3318
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:06,239
universe shape of thing shape of

3319
01:58:06,239 --> 01:58:06,960
ourselves

3320
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:10,800
so very nice threads and david's a big

3321
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:11,679
fan of uh

3322
01:58:11,679 --> 01:58:14,159
what's his name matilda geeker isn't

3323
01:58:14,159 --> 01:58:15,040
that right

3324
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:18,960
yeah poet mathematician and romanian

3325
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:20,239
prince

3326
01:58:20,239 --> 01:58:23,119
who wrote many books about the

3327
01:58:23,119 --> 01:58:23,920
connection

3328
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:25,840
between mathematic aesthetics and

3329
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:27,199
natural forms yes

3330
01:58:27,199 --> 01:58:28,880
there are a lot of connections that were

3331
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:31,520
very inspiring to me my father

3332
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:33,599
used to show me his book when i was a

3333
01:58:33,599 --> 01:58:35,199
kid and my grandfather was an art

3334
01:58:35,199 --> 01:58:37,280
historian and he was also searching

3335
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:40,880
you know interpretation of art forms for

3336
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:42,560
mathematics so there is a long family

3337
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:43,599
tradition that

3338
01:58:43,599 --> 01:58:45,840
led me here so i'm sorry but i will have

3339
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:47,440
to leave to another call it was very

3340
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:48,000
very

3341
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,239
great i can leave you you can continue

3342
01:58:50,239 --> 01:58:52,320
to discuss i was very happy so

3343
01:58:52,320 --> 01:58:54,480
uh we'll get in touch and and stay in

3344
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:56,800
touch and i'll see you

3345
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:59,520
great bye-bye guys see you all um move

3346
01:58:59,520 --> 01:58:59,920
us

3347
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:02,480
to the end but really uh david and ken

3348
01:59:02,480 --> 01:59:03,199
thanks so much

3349
01:59:03,199 --> 01:59:04,719
it's like always just great to have the

3350
01:59:04,719 --> 01:59:06,320
authors on here to be hearing all this

3351
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:07,599
extra stuff so

3352
01:59:07,599 --> 01:59:09,360
the other slides just to you know

3353
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:10,960
visualize them people could screen cap

3354
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:11,360
them

3355
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:14,000
is just a few more quotes to get to that

3356
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,679
hegelian dialectic which we actually got

3357
01:59:15,679 --> 01:59:17,119
to talk about

3358
01:59:17,119 --> 01:59:18,639
um we could have had a few more just

3359
01:59:18,639 --> 01:59:20,239
general questions especially

3360
01:59:20,239 --> 01:59:22,239
where does active inference fit into

3361
01:59:22,239 --> 01:59:23,599
this whole picture and that's in the

3362
01:59:23,599 --> 01:59:25,760
cybernetics and how it's carried out but

3363
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:27,520
uh active inference live stream and

3364
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:28,719
whatnot that's always what we want to

3365
01:59:28,719 --> 01:59:29,599
think about

3366
01:59:29,599 --> 01:59:32,000
and then we just had figure one figure

3367
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:33,440
two figure three

3368
01:59:33,440 --> 01:59:35,760
and figure four so those are just things

3369
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:37,840
that we could have talked about maybe

3370
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:40,400
uh in the future or in 2021 we could

3371
01:59:40,400 --> 01:59:40,960
have

3372
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:44,080
the moon illusion or a deep dive on one

3373
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:45,360
dimension or another because this was

3374
01:59:45,360 --> 01:59:47,840
such a fascinating conversation

3375
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:50,880
so if uh adam or alex or

3376
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:53,040
ken maybe each of you want to have just

3377
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:54,000
a uh

3378
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,560
last comment that would be great so

3379
01:59:56,560 --> 01:59:57,360
let's um

3380
01:59:57,360 --> 02:00:00,880
alex if you want to go first then adam

3381
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:05,199
and then ken or pass no worries if not

3382
02:00:05,599 --> 02:00:08,960
okay i'll pass by now thank you alex

3383
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:13,760
um adam any last thoughts

3384
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:15,440
um how is it gonna change what you're

3385
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:17,040
gonna work on or think about

3386
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:19,440
or just

3387
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:23,440
um too many thoughts but one of the

3388
02:00:23,440 --> 02:00:24,639
things i'm

3389
02:00:24,639 --> 02:00:26,960
uh i'm doing a lot of thinking about

3390
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:28,639
like what neural systems

3391
02:00:28,639 --> 02:00:30,159
uh might potentially contribute to

3392
02:00:30,159 --> 02:00:33,040
different aspects of uh

3393
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:34,960
visual spatial awareness and geometric

3394
02:00:34,960 --> 02:00:36,159
modeling

3395
02:00:36,159 --> 02:00:40,080
and um one

3396
02:00:40,080 --> 02:00:43,760
issue i'm wondering about um is

3397
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:46,800
the extent to which um

3398
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:51,520
uh at least in its visual nature

3399
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:55,119
it might always the conscious awareness

3400
02:00:55,119 --> 02:00:56,639
might always be

3401
02:00:56,639 --> 02:01:00,320
um more of a of a 2d projection

3402
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:02,480
and that um things like

3403
02:01:02,480 --> 02:01:03,520
three-dimensional

3404
02:01:03,520 --> 02:01:06,400
so and things like uh additional depth

3405
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:08,480
and additional dimensions might

3406
02:01:08,480 --> 02:01:10,760
involve um

3407
02:01:10,760 --> 02:01:12,000
[Music]

3408
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:15,280
the ability to transition between

3409
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:16,880
different points of view in a coherent

3410
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:20,000
way in a way that would imply

3411
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:23,280
a 3d world but where at any given moment

3412
02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:24,960
the visual aspect

3413
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:28,080
um is uh actually

3414
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:31,520
uh 2d and potentially without clear

3415
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:32,480
depth

3416
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:34,880
um these are some things i'm wondering

3417
02:01:34,880 --> 02:01:35,679
about and

3418
02:01:35,679 --> 02:01:37,599
i think it's not incompatible with

3419
02:01:37,599 --> 02:01:39,440
projected geometric modeling

3420
02:01:39,440 --> 02:01:42,719
it would just be um whether the um

3421
02:01:42,719 --> 02:01:45,840
the engine uh you know how distributed

3422
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:46,080
is

3423
02:01:46,080 --> 02:01:47,679
like the granularity over which it's

3424
02:01:47,679 --> 02:01:50,800
being achieved and so this like coupling

3425
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:53,760
between like a 2d projection screen

3426
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:55,599
and like you know a body map like

3427
02:01:55,599 --> 02:01:57,599
adjusting what you ought to see

3428
02:01:57,599 --> 02:01:58,880
or something like the posterior

3429
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:00,320
cingulate like saying like okay here's

3430
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:01,199
where you're like

3431
02:02:01,199 --> 02:02:04,239
your eyes and your head is so you know

3432
02:02:04,239 --> 02:02:05,760
giving putting your perspective in there

3433
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:08,880
and then putting

3434
02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:11,840
it it seems like 40 geometry could be

3435
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:13,440
perfectly compatible with this and

3436
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:15,280
but i'm trying to figure out how that

3437
02:02:15,280 --> 02:02:16,880
works that was a lot

3438
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:19,040
of rambling but thank you no great

3439
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:20,480
thanks for your participation and this

3440
02:02:20,480 --> 02:02:21,199
figure too

3441
02:02:21,199 --> 02:02:22,960
i think points out some of what you're

3442
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:24,480
talking about that's a projection onto

3443
02:02:24,480 --> 02:02:25,119
the 2d

3444
02:02:25,119 --> 02:02:26,639
there's an ambiguous projection on the

3445
02:02:26,639 --> 02:02:28,400
left because of the perspective being

3446
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:29,199
ambiguous

3447
02:02:29,199 --> 02:02:30,800
and then free energy is invoked just

3448
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:32,560
like a symmetry break that

3449
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:34,560
gives a perspective on which side of the

3450
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:36,000
box one is actually

3451
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,800
on given the prior that about how

3452
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:39,679
certain angles

3453
02:02:39,679 --> 02:02:41,520
must be reflective of two-dimensional

3454
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:43,040
representations so

3455
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:46,080
yeah ken any um thoughts on that and or

3456
02:02:46,080 --> 02:02:49,360
just a last comments uh well just

3457
02:02:49,360 --> 02:02:51,599
thank you for uh organizing this and i'm

3458
02:02:51,599 --> 02:02:52,880
sorry i couldn't make it for the whole

3459
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:53,520
thing

3460
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:56,719
um and it's really

3461
02:02:56,719 --> 02:02:59,040
been a wonderful conversation and i'll

3462
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:00,159
just say the

3463
02:03:00,159 --> 02:03:02,480
the next thing we're working on the

3464
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:04,320
daniel and david and i

3465
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:07,119
is a paper trying to relate the

3466
02:03:07,119 --> 02:03:08,960
projected geometrical

3467
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:12,719
model uh close or to show how it relates

3468
02:03:12,719 --> 02:03:14,320
to notions like strange

3469
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:17,280
strange and pre-reflective

3470
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:18,320
self-consciousness

3471
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:20,719
this kind of more basic type of

3472
02:03:20,719 --> 02:03:22,639
self-consciousness than uh

3473
02:03:22,639 --> 02:03:25,520
introspection or attention and to show

3474
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:26,960
that you can

3475
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:28,639
you can make sense of that in terms of

3476
02:03:28,639 --> 02:03:30,480
the projected geometrical structure

3477
02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:32,239
that's the next thing on the agenda

3478
02:03:32,239 --> 02:03:36,480
for us cool sounds like a fun

3479
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:39,119
research direction so with all of this

3480
02:03:39,119 --> 02:03:40,239
being said

3481
02:03:40,239 --> 02:03:42,639
everyone thanks a lot for participating

3482
02:03:42,639 --> 02:03:43,280
live

3483
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:45,040
and if you're watching for watching it

3484

too we will

3485
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:48,639
have the follow-up form link is in the

3486
02:03:48,639 --> 02:03:50,480
calendar invite if you want to

3487
02:03:50,480 --> 02:03:53,119
just provide us some thoughts um any

3488
02:03:53,119 --> 02:03:54,960
feedback suggestions and questions are
