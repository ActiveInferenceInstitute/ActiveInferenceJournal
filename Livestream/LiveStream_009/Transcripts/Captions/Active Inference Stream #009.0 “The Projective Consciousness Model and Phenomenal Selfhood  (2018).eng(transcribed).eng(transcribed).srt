00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:11,759
hello

2
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,240
and welcome everyone to the active

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,599
inference live stream

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,480
i believe we are live it is active

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,320
stream 9.0

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,000
and it is november 18th 2020

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,640
i am daniel friedman and i will be doing

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,279
a solo acting stream today

9
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,320
so welcome to team com everyone

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,719
we are an experiment in online team

11
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:35,680
communication

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,239
learning and practice related to active

13
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,280
inference

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,040
you can find us on twitter at

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,399
inferenceactive

16
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,800
at active at activeinference.gmail.com

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,559
our public key base team

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,280
at our youtube channel or um through any

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,320
other mechanism

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,399
this is a recorded and an archived live

21
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,000
stream so please provide us with

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,840
feedback so that we can improve on our

23
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,120
work

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,960
all backgrounds and perspectives are

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,440
welcome here and for video etiquette on

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,320
live streams

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,760
make sure to mute if there's noise in

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,600
the background raise your hand so that

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,520
we can hear from everyone on the stack

30
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,240
and use respectful speech behavior so

31
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,320
just a quick announcement before we

32
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,520
jump into the paper discussion you can

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,600
find on our twitter information about

34
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,000
the rest of our discussions for 2020 we

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,439
have six more

36
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,920
uh group act imp streams in 2020

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,479
on november 24th and on december 1st

38
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,280
we're going to

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,400
be in active 9 discussing the projective

40
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,159
consciousness model and phenomenal

41
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:34,960
selfhood

42
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,720
and that will be the paper that this

43
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,400
active stream 9.0

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,520
is context 4.

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,720
in active 10 on december 8th and 15th

46
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,720
we'll talk about the paper a variational

47
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,320
approach to scripts

48
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,920
while in act 11 on sophisticated

49
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,119
affective inference

50
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,280
we'll talk about more modeling and math

51
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,040
again and that will be on december

52
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,079
22nd and 29th so that will close out

53
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,040
2020

54
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,880
and then we look forward to a whole new

55
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,479
panel of events

56
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,840
and projects collaborators for

57
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,038
so find out more on our twitter that way

58
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,879
let's talk about what we're going to do

59
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,080
in acting stream

60
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,959
9.0 which is right now so the goal of

61
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,400
active 9.0

62
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,640
is going to be to set the context for

63
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,440
9.1

64
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,440
and 9.2 which are going to be the group

65
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,000
discussions that we have on these papers

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,280
and the paper that we're going to be

67
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,160
discussing for 9.1 and 9.2

68
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,840
is called the projective consciousness

69
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,680
model and phenomenal selfhood

70
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,800
by willa ford at all 2018

71
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,360
and there's a link that people can see

72
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,160
the video

73
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,959
that we're about to jump into right now

74
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,879
is an introduction to the context of

75
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,720
some of the ideas presented by the

76
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,680
authors it's not

77
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,400
a review or a final word it will

78
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,319
contextualize some of the ideas

79
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,800
math and vocabulary that might be

80
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,000
interesting or

81
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,840
important to know for reading will

82
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,040
afford at all

83
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,000
2018 and the punch line that they're

84
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,360
going to work their way towards

85
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,440
is that we might be able to combine

86
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,400
fields such as

87
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,760
geometry cybernetics and

88
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,239
neurophenomenology

89
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,080
using the framework of active inference

90
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,440
and the free energy principle

91
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,920
to potentially understand or explain

92
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,640
consciousness

93
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,360
so that's going to be up to you up to us

94
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,040
how we feel about these kinds of claims

95
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,319
that they're going to get to in the

96
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,120
paper

97
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,239
but that's where we're headed and

98
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,680
the sections of 9.0 will be as follows

99
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,000
first we'll go through the keywords and

100
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,920
hopefully provide some background on the

101
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,280
different keywords whether it's your

102
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,040
first time hearing one of these words or

103
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,519
whether

104
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,840
you're in one of these fields and then

105
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,680
we'll talk about the aims and claims the

106
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,319
paper

107
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,760
go through their abstract and the

108
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,799
roadmap the sections then we'll talk a

109
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,319
little bit about consciousness

110
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,319
from the author's perspective just what

111
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,440
do the authors say

112
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,280
is important about consciousness and

113
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,680
what do they think are invariant aspects

114
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,640
of it

115
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,319
well then walk briefly through the

116
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,239
figures just try to understand what

117
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,319
are these figures even doing how are we

118
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,519
going to get a first pass on

119
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,200
understanding what these figures are all

120
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,080
about

121
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,680
and then in 9.1 and in 9.2

122
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,280
we're going to stay with this exact same

123
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,840
paper so save and submit your questions

124
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,319
and

125
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,760
feel free to get in touch with us if

126
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,440
you'd like to participate

127
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,680
whether that's in 9.1.2 or in a future

128
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,759
endeavor let's talk about the keywords

129
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,639
the first keyword is actually not on the

130
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,680
paper keywords but

131
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,840
is what we're about here is active

132
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,400
inference and the free energy principle

133
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,080
that's what we'll try to tie so much of

134
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,080
this back to and here were the keywords

135
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,360
that were listed

136
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,639
cybernetics projective geometry

137
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,759
consciousness neurophenomenology

138
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,919
first person perspective and

139
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,160
perspectival imagination

140
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,680
so cool terms maybe it's your first time

141
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,000
thinking about math and geometry in the

142
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,320
context of consciousness maybe it's not

143
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,160
but hopefully as i go through these

144
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,080
following keywords i hope that this is

145
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,320
interesting and exciting whatever

146
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,320
level of familiarity you have with these

147
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,759
concepts

148
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,400
so first keyword is cybernetics and it's

149
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,240
also written there in russian as

150
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,600
kubernetes

151
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,880
and there's many resources to read on

152
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,880
for the history of cybernetics some of

153
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,080
which we're going to talk about here

154
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,840
because in a lot of other

155
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,400
active streams and other locations you

156
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,320
can probably hear about the mathematics

157
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,919
underlying cybernetics

158
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,520
and about how it's related to control

159
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,880
theory both things that we've talked

160
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,600
about

161
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,919
on this stream but let's talk a little

162
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,039
bit about just

163
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,759
more historically or from a cultural

164
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,680
perspective what is cybernetics what is

165
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,120
it trying to do

166
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,759
cybernetics is a school of thought

167
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,039
tradition of action however you want to

168
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:45,759
think about it

169
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,000
that's related to the action policy

170
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,600
selection and control

171
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,960
of goal-oriented systems now

172
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,280
there's various orders of cybernetics

173
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,600
which we can sort of walk through here

174
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
and um i'll go through a couple of

175
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,039
different resources on

176
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,400
cybernetics and hopefully you'll see

177
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,960
soon why i put a history citation

178
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,319
on the bottom left and a little bit of

179
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,319
russian on the top it's not just because

180
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,639
we have great russian colleagues in team

181
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,520
com

182
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,520
here are the orders of cybernetics

183
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,960
there's probably different ways to state

184
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,479
them or think about them

185
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,240
first order cybernetics might be thought

186
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,080
of as self-regulation without

187
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,319
detailed observations so this could be

188
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,120
like a negative

189
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,919
feedback system that is able to maintain

190
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,240
a semblance of homeostasis

191
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,919
in virtue of being an isolated or a

192
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,440
closed process like

193
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,880
there's something that gets triggered

194
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,479
when it's too hot and then as soon as

195
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,039
it's triggered

196
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,039
it's too hot it instantly kicks in a

197
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,319
cooling program

198
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,560
second order cybernetics is um

199
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,319
self-regulation that can be influenced

200
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,639
by observers within a domain of control

201
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,000
so that could be for example

202
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,759
continuously varied

203
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,680
thermometer that's able to enact

204
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,680
different kinds of control policies

205
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,319
as a function of continuous inputs from

206
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,240
the thermometer

207
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,960
third order cybernetics is

208
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,479
self-regulation that is influenced by

209
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:01,440
observation

210
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,080
with a relational basis or an ecological

211
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,800
grounding

212
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,560
so the system in this third or

213
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,840
cybernetic loop

214
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,759
is able to acknowledge its surroundings

215
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,400
and learn develop and evolve

216
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,880
and fourth order cybernetics is when

217
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,080
self-regulation

218
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,400
involves the enactment of multiple

219
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,400
different realities or adjacencies

220
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,960
affordances counterfactuals a lot of

221
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,319
ways you can think about that

222
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,280
in terms of a functioning creative

223
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,000
observer

224
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
so these are deeply contextualized and

225
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,680
integrated systems

226
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,199
that are doing higher orders of

227
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,599
cybernetics and i'm not a stickler about

228
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,039
which order is which number

229
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,680
i also on purpose drew the parallel with

230
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,080
the

231
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,280
um one two and three loop thinking which

232
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,240
is related to

233
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,639
um some decision-making theory from

234
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,000
innovation and the entrepreneurship

235
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,960
space but i just thought it's

236
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,919
interesting

237
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,039
here's a figure from the um book

238
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,280
chapter cybernetics in the 20th century

239
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,639
on the bottom left there

240
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,280
and it shows a map of concepts and how

241
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,039
they're related to cybernetics

242
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,520
so on the left are sort of two inputs to

243
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,520
cybernetics which are control theory and

244
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,879
the idea of control and then

245
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,319
communication theory and the idea of

246
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,919
communication and information

247
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,440
and so those are two branches that we've

248
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,120
talked a lot about on this stream and we

249
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,720
will continue to talking

250
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,520
be talking a lot about because control

251
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,240
of action

252
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,560
and communication message passing these

253
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,360
kinds of things

254
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,639
inference is the thread that runs

255
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,080
through them all these kinds of things

256
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,720
are critical

257
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,319
for control theory for cybernetics for

258
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,919
the kinds of systems we want to

259
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,919
get into working with on the right side

260
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,640
we see cybernetics branching back out

261
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,880
into the machine area with the

262
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,640
engineering sciences and the planning of

263
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,839
for example complicated factory

264
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,719
operations but as well as into the

265
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,399
animal and the social levels

266
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,320
so the animal cybernetics is about for

267
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
example the self-regulation of behavior

268
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,160
and the social cybernetics could be

269
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,080
about um the way that our

270
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,839
governance is run and there's a really

271
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,680
interesting book read plenty

272
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,200
that's kind of like historical fiction

273
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,040
about cybernetics

274
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,200
speaking of history this is such an

275
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,959
interesting plot and it was in the

276
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,040
cybernetics book figure 16.

277
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,519
it is the usage of the term cybernetics

278
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,680
and control by years in the text of

279
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,880
publications

280
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,640
publications indexed by google scholar

281
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,080
so caveats

282
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,440
maybe people are speaking about it with

283
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,200
different words or it's being used

284
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,680
a different language not english or

285
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,200
there's some other way of saying it

286
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,760
but look at how similar these things are

287
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,440
in terms of their trends

288
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,080
where both of them ramp up gradually

289
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,320
leading to in early 2000s

290
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,040
a lot of discussion of cybernetics and

291
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,000
of control

292
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,600
potentially looking backwards a couple

293
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,279
years so think about these peaks in the

294
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,080
early 2000s

295
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,680
as potentially reflecting something at

296
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,600
the close of the 1900s

297
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,360
and then how they both start to drop off

298
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,720
and this is consistent with something

299
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,519
that a lot of us

300
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,800
have experienced which is that

301
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,800
cybernetics is a term that a lot of at

302
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,120
least

303
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,040
english speakers may not be too familiar

304
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,640
with but we can look at the journals

305
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,160
that fristen and others have published

306
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,480
in

307
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,920
we find a lot of connections to

308
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,600
cybernetics

309
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,760
what is going on there so to get a

310
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,519
little sense of what is going on

311
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,279
two other resources to look into would

312
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,279
be this big history understanding of

313
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,600
complexity information in cybernetics

314
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,880
and then this book which i'll read a

315
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,480
quote from right now which is called

316
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,320
from newspeak to cyberspeak

317
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,640
a history of soviet cybernetics by slava

318
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,760
garevich

319
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,920
and the author writes in this book from

320
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,519
2002

321
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,680
the history of soviet cybernetics

322
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,600
followed a curious arc

323
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,200
in the 1950s it was labeled a

324
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
reactionary pseudoscience and a weapon

325
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,720
of imperialist ideology

326
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,160
with the arrival of khrushchev's

327
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,480
political thaw however it was seen as an

328
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,240
innocent victim of political oppression

329
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,760
and it evolved from a movement for

330
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,680
radical reform of the stalinist system

331
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,040
of science

332
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,160
pretty interesting in the early 1960s it

333
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,480
was hailed as a science in service

334
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,800
it was hailed as a science in service of

335
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,680
communism

336
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,519
but by the end of the decade it had

337
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,079
turned into a shallow fashionable trend

338
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,160
using extensive new archival materials

339
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,160
garovich argues that these fluctuating

340
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,000
attitudes reflected profound changes in

341
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,519
scientific language and research

342
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,360
methodology across disciplines

343
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,959
in power relationships within the

344
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,399
scientific community

345
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,240
and in the political role of scientists

346
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,399
and engineers in soviet society

347
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,160
his detailed analysis of scientific

348
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,839
discourse shows how the new speak of the

349
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,680
late stalinist period and the cyberspeak

350
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,200
that challenged it eventually blended

351
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,000
into cyber

352
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,399
newspeak so maybe there was a book

353
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,920
summary of this um

354
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,560
work but pretty interesting how that

355
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,680
plays out and so

356
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,120
definitely we'd love to learn more about

357
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,120
this whether we have

358
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,560
russian speaking colleagues who could

359
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,720
fill us in or anyone else

360
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,079
next key word projective geometry

361
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,399
what is projective geometry about well

362
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,160
of course you could go down the rabbit

363
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,839
hole with this topic but let's just try

364
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,200
to keep it constrained to what the

365
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
authors are going to use it for in terms

366
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,000
of the paper

367
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,480
they write the concept of a 4d

368
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,440
four-dimensional

369
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,079
projective transformation is central to

370
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:48,800
the model

371
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,560
as it yields an account of the link

372
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,800
between perception imagination and

373
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,160
multi-point of view

374
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,440
action planning great okay so what is

375
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,040
happening here and how can we understand

376
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,440
this

377
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,959
and its relationship to projective

378
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,760
geometry i'm going to introduce just two

379
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,760
ideas here with this visualization

380
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,440
the first by looking at the bottom is

381
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,200
the distinction between the euclidean

382
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,079
and the non-euclidean types of spaces

383
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,079
and then the second idea with a purple

384
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,000
arrow is this idea of a map

385
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,519
or potentially you could call it a

386
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,839
mapping because it's actually a process

387
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,279
and it's actually a certain type of

388
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,959
process it's a projection

389
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,720
so we're talking about projective

390
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,560
geometry we're talking about

391
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,040
geometry which means this the shape of

392
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,800
things and the spaces that they're

393
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,519
existing in so as opposed to topology

394
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,040
which is how things are connected

395
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,360
connected with nodes and edges geometry

396
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,800
is about things and their shapes and

397
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,920
their spaces

398
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,320
we're going to talk about projections

399
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:42,959
amongst

400
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,600
different geometries specifically

401
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,120
potentially this one between

402
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,639
euclidean and non-euclidean geometries

403
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,320
and here's a quote that they write

404
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,240
authors do they write

405
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,480
this perspectival phenomenal space so

406
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,519
the space in which

407
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,600
they're going to say that experience

408
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,519
occurs within phenomenology occurs

409
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,079
within

410
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,320
a space allows us to locate ourselves

411
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,079
and navigate in an ambient space

412
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,600
that is nevertheless essentially

413
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,440
euclidean however

414
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,000
in a euclidean space there are no

415
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,120
privilege points

416
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,760
no points at infinity no horizon and a

417
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,399
no

418
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,480
and an arbitrary origin they say there's

419
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,000
no non-arbitrary origin

420
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,480
same thing this version this very

421
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,560
strongly suggests that a non-euclidean

422
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,320
frame must be operating

423
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,800
in the phenomenal space with the help of

424
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,120
sensory motor calibrations

425
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,360
to preserve the sense of the invariance

426
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,880
of objects across the multiple

427
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,800
perspectives adopted

428
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,720
and relate the situated organism to the

429
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,639
ambient euclidean space

430
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,720
so what is it that allows me to continue

431
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,320
thinking about this as a pen

432
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,000
even as it comes very close to my face

433
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,360
and looks very

434
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,920
weird so what is that generative model

435
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,519
that allows me to

436
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,240
act like everything's normal as objects

437
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,600
maintain their invariances

438
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,639
as the eye travels through the space and

439
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,720
so we can contrast this euclidean space

440
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,040
that

441
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,720
they're supposing that we exist in

442
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,880
they're saying we exist in a space that

443
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,399
doesn't have privileged points of access

444
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,199
no points at infinity etc etc um and

445
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,560
they're saying the space that

446
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,399
an organism for example moves through is

447
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,639
euclidean while the space

448
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,720
that their consciousness is being

449
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,160
projected into

450
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,360
experientially is non-euclidean what

451
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,040
about it is non-euclidean well let's

452
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,720
just take the opposite of what's in red

453
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,760
and put it in blue

454
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,839
so there are privileged points from the

455
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,360
point of view of the observer that is

456
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,079
the privilege

457
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,720
point of view quite literally there can

458
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,839
be points at infinity

459
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,199
there can be points that sort of just

460
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,720
like they're so far away they're

461
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,560
infinitely far away and not just from an

462
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,839
affordance point of view but from a

463
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,079
perception point of view

464
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,399
there can be a horizon in fact we see it

465
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,360
every day

466
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,760
and there can also be a non-arbitrary

467
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,880
origin which is a little bit of a

468
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,320
restatement the idea that there could be

469
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,600
a privilege point but basically it's

470
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,199
privileged it's a non-arbitrary origin

471
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,279
these are pretty similar concepts

472
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,600
now non-euclidean it's like saying

473
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,560
non-linear

474
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,720
and the joke about this is things that

475
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,079
are not elephants that's the

476
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,440
non-elephant class

477
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,040
you'll know when you see it so that's

478
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,480
about how helpful it is to say it's

479
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,279
non-euclidean or it's non-linear model

480
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,680
okay we get it it's not linear model

481
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,199
it's not euclidean geometry but there's

482
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,160
many choices

483
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,680
and the reason why even though it sounds

484
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,120
like wait you're barely ruling anything

485
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,600
out

486
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,360
we're actually ruling out very specific

487
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,120
parts of the geometry of the euclidean

488
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,680
space

489
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,519
so in euclidean space parallel lines

490
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,279
don't intersect but that's not

491
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,079
necessarily

492
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,920
um the case for certain types of

493
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,120
geometry or

494
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,279
a triangle with three edges and three

495
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,279
angles is 180 degrees from the sum of

496
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,440
the angles but on a sphere it's not that

497
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,000
way

498
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,240
so that is what is happening with these

499
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,759
geometric projections

500
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,199
is we're going to be projecting from

501
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,880
sort of the um

502
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,040
grid they want to think about now you

503
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,480
might want to ask bucky fuller

504
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,320
if we're actually in a euclidean space

505
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,839
or if it just seems that way because of

506
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,120
public education

507
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,360
but for the purposes of this paper we're

508
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,560
in a euclidean space

509
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,399
as action and that's the space we want

510
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,000
to be making our perception

511
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,720
uh simulate so to speak and to act like

512
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,759
everything is normal

513
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,920
and to decrease our uncertainty about

514
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,279
euclideanly mapped

515
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,639
space while also relating it to

516
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,560
through a projection something that does

517
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,160
have a privilege point of access

518
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,680
and something that is as they put it

519
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,000
informed by sensory motor calibration

520
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,399
and relates to our action affordances so

521
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,399
that's how you can have a euclidean

522
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,360
concept of for example um a gap in the

523
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,959
ground that you can't jump over

524
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,720
so it's a very complex estimation of

525
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,639
what you can do and how big the gap is

526
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,680
and where you are

527
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,000
how much run up you would need etc all

528
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,920
of that is going to come together

529
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,199
by doing what they're going to talk

530
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,440
about here now

531
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,000
consciousness um it's great to talk

532
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,759
about consciousness and i'm going to go

533
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,000
into a little bit of detail soon about

534
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,880
some of my own thoughts on the issue but

535
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,560
when talking about consciousness

536
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,959
it's important to be really clear even

537
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,160
though it's something that we're not

538
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,000
always sure about it's always important

539
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,240
to at least use language very carefully

540
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,680
and use our scholarship

541
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,600
and our intercultural respectfulness

542
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,959
very importantly because

543
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,120
as i'll hopefully come back to a few

544
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,039
points soon it's just a critical issue

545
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,240
and we can't think of it

546
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,679
um just flippantly the authors write

547
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,359
when talking about consciousness because

548
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,199
i want to just go with what they think

549
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,880
about consciousness for here

550
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,959
they write we might divide contemporary

551
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,000
neuroscientific

552
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,119
and psychological theories of

553
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,119
consciousness into three main types

554
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,199
the biofunctional the cognitive

555
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,240
neurofunctional

556
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,520
and the information theoretic as should

557
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,400
be clear

558
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,080
the projective consciousness model the

559
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,480
pcm incorporates the emphasis on

560
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,320
self-awareness common to many approaches

561
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,039
to consciousness

562
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,360
as well as an emphasis on the biological

563
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,120
functions of consciousness

564
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,600
so they're defining the space a certain

565
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,960
way i'm going to define it a different

566
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,280
way

567
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,520
soon but they're defining it that way

568
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,760
then we're going to insert the pcm here

569
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,640
and then they write at the end the pcm

570
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,120
thus

571
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,200
subsumes and unifies the main insights

572
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,559
in all of these approaches

573
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,679
to consciousness above all what we add

574
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,240
to pre-existing theory is a geometry

575
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,520
the thesis that projective

576
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,600
transformations and projective frames

577
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,000
necessarily subtend the appearance and

578
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,760
workings of consciousness

579
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,880
so whatever we're going to learn in this

580
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,799
actin stream or whatever we think the

581
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,960
pcm is doing and we want to evaluate it

582
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,600
not by

583
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,919
um what it doesn't do but what it does

584
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,679
do and what it claims to do what it sets

585
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:20,559
out to do

586
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,400
that's where they're trying to step in

587
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,240
their understanding of literature and

588
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,080
consciousness is that they broke

589
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,520
consciousness down into these three

590
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,679
kinds which citations exist there

591
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,600
you can read the paper and then they're

592
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,880
going to step into that gap

593
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,880
and then they're going to make the claim

594
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,120
that they're subsuming and unifying the

595
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,280
main insights from these approaches

596
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,880
where does that leave these approaches

597
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,559
from a theory perspective

598
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,240
question for another day but that is

599
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,919
where the authors understand their work

600
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,320
to be fitting in so if you don't know

601
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,240
what the pcm is or it's kind of trippy

602
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,679
to think about what it means to do

603
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:52,960
mathematics and geometry of

604
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,760
consciousness

605
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,840
that's perfect here is the blank that

606
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,559
they're going to fill in with their work

607
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,039
what do i think about consciousness

608
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,799
though and i want to be clear about what

609
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:03,360
my

610
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,200
stance is or at least just give the tip

611
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,120
of the iceberg on my stance because this

612
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,200
is a first person active stream

613
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,960
and there's some relevant research i'll

614
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,640
discuss in a few minutes

615
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,960
and also i've just for a long time been

616
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,160
interested in the science of

617
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,000
consciousness but also this second layer

618
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,679
of how it's communicated especially from

619
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,120
scientists

620
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,000
so there's a lot of places to go here

621
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,679
and a lot of places to start

622
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:26,880
i'm just going to walk through a few

623
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,480
general thoughts and raise a few

624
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,039
questions

625
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,880
really more questions than answers and

626
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,880
then i'll discuss a paper

627
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,440
from the last couple of years with a

628
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,440
colleague eric sonic

629
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,080
all right so there are many ways to

630
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,440
think about studying

631
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,840
consciousness and one path that you

632
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,799
could go down

633
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,799
um this is sort of you know across

634
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,240
cultures through the time

635
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,160
one path you can go down is thought

636
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,840
experimentation so this could look like

637
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,840
meditation it could look like a specific

638
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,480
thought experiment um or some other sort

639
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,480
of insight approach or a gudangan

640
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,640
approach and whether it's culturally

641
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,679
called one thing or another

642
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,400
is not as much my concern here the

643
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,679
thought experiment approach doesn't

644
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:06,000
involve

645
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,679
making interventions for example in the

646
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:08,880
outside world just thinking about

647
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,840
consciousness you know

648
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,080
hearing ted talks and stuff like that so

649
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,120
the issue

650
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,360
is that um whatever is actually

651
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,440
happening if that's what we're pursuing

652
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,120
um we could just be led to the wrong

653
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,120
conclusion and then if there is some

654
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,080
element of

655
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,000
free will or interventionary role of

656
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,280
consciousness then

657
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,679
we could intervene to um end up

658
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:28,320
believing

659
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,760
that we couldn't intervene or any of

660
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,679
these accommodations so i just never

661
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,200
quite understand the relationship

662
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,679
between

663
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,919
what one directly feels convinced about

664
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,440
with respect to a thought experiment or

665
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,799
a thought or an idea

666
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,480
and how that might relate to how it

667
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,240
actually is for people who aren't that

668
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,039
person

669
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,200
and one aspect of this is that it's

670
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,240
really impossible

671
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,760
to know which aspects of thought

672
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,280
experiments can be transferred to other

673
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,320
situations

674
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,080
so for example one of the most famous

675
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,520
papers in this area

676
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,480
most cited papers is a 1974 paper by a

677
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,919
philosopher named nagel

678
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,919
and that raises the question what is it

679
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,360
like to be a bat i don't think he

680
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,480
invented that question

681
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,240
um but he's the one who got famous for

682
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,000
it and in that paper

683
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,159
it's written an organism has conscious

684
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,360
mental states if

685
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,360
and only if there is something that it

686
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,760
is like to be that organism

687
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,720
something it is like for the organism

688
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,120
now you might think

689
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,840
what are philosophers doing because it

690
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,720
sounds like a

691
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,720
sort of a weird question and i

692
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,919
understand that many

693
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,760
uh careers and a lot of good thinking

694
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,679
has come out of this question so i want

695
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,360
to optimistically see it as a catalyst

696
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,559
in a seed

697
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,600
it's always good to have simple

698
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,200
questions to return to it's good that

699
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,080
it's such a simple

700
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,679
question and it opens to so many

701
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,080
perspectives it initiates students into

702
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,360
our knowledge traditions

703
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,720
there's so many advantages to having

704
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,480
these kinds of classic works

705
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,320
but to be that um uh to be blunt i guess

706
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,720
i find the phrasing of this question of

707
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,720
consciousness to be quite unhelpful

708
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,400
because it is so informal it's so

709
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,159
hypothetical it's untestable it's

710
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,080
ambiguous but it's specific it brings a

711
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,440
bat into question

712
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,039
and then you can imagine oh it's a dog

713
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,880
what is it like to be a dog now these

714
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,320
are all good things to imagine

715
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,520
but again they don't really bring us

716
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,520
closer to addressing real frameworks for

717
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,480
consciousness

718
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,320
and the reality is there's been now a

719
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,400
vast wasteland of literature that's just

720
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:12,720
not

721
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,480
comparable to other work in the same

722
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,039
exact space across different species

723
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,600
that essentially amounts to speculation

724
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,200
and appealing to what it might be like

725
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,720
to be a certain type of animal

726
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,320
thinking well if i was really a bat and

727
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,840
i grew up as a bat would i ever like

728
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,240
thought

729
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,400
uh what it was like to be a human how

730
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,240
would i so it ties up to all these

731
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,960
second level

732
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,280
questions that aren't super relevant and

733
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,320
um

734
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,159
we've always wondered through time every

735
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,600
culture everyone has wondered what other

736
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,039
systems experience

737
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,799
whether that's in a person or an animal

738
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,799
or a fictional character or a physical

739
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:43,520
object

740
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,440
so the speculation and the think pieces

741
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,400
they don't really add something

742
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,840
substantial to the literature

743
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,280
which is what the scientific literature

744
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,200
is about for me so the bigger issue

745
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,080
though

746
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,080
with thought experiments of any kind is

747
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,240
that we can always imagine things that

748
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,120
are just

749
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,039
not making sense within a framework or

750
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,400
any framework or just don't relate to

751
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,000
the world that we live in

752
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,600
we all know that we can be wrong about

753
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,760
an idea but believe that we're right

754
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,960
and so um to kind of rephrase that in an

755
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,559
active inference framework we can say

756
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,200
that

757
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,880
these are situations where the precision

758
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,559
parameter is very high

759
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,039
there's a belief a metacognitive belief

760
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,559
that the precision is high that some

761
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,240
question has been resolved

762
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,520
um this represents that um for example

763
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,280
someone's model of consciousness whether

764
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,039
it came from a knowledge tradition or

765
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:27,919
their own thinking

766
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,440
they believe that they're they're on to

767
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,039
it they got it figured out it's resolved

768
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:31,919
for them

769
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,080
but um that doesn't mean that your s

770
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,679
your estimate is related to s

771
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,080
hat the actual state in the world and

772
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,679
i'm not passing judgment on

773
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,480
being overconfident or um being wrong

774
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,240
because sometimes it can be very

775
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,760
important and powerful to have these

776
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,360
kinds of beliefs but

777
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,520
that's not what being correct is about

778
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,120
and so if you actually don't care about

779
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,039
being correct being right going towards

780
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:53,679
the truth

781
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:54,960
and you really don't care about that

782
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,279
then um i'd love to hear

783
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,159
where you're coming from um the rest of

784
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,760
the scientific literature

785
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,400
although with many shades and many

786
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,279
differences

787
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,200
is moving towards what actually would be

788
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,679
general as generalizable through truth

789
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:10,960
so let's go back to consider

790
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,240
experimental approaches which is

791
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,679
something that comes up a ton

792
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,360
in the philosophy and the science of

793
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,960
consciousness literature

794
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,600
now it would be awesome to do

795
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,600
experiments on consciousness and in some

796
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,880
way don't we all

797
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,200
we could study humans as they behave and

798
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,480
sleep and daydream

799
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,960
take um psychedelics or they wake up for

800
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,559
anesthesia and they develop and there's

801
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,080
so many things that could be exciting

802
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,080
to learn about also if we can do

803
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,679
experiments on consciousness we could do

804
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,279
experiments on animals

805
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,880
now we could do experiments that are

806
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,400
interventive like

807
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,080
manipulating the brain of an animal or

808
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,000
the body or the situation of an animal

809
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,600
these experiments might be seen as

810
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,760
inhumane or just to massively violate

811
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,840
ethical standards for humans

812
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,760
and so there's a bit of irony in doing

813
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,440
these potentially invasive

814
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,240
non-consensual experiments with captive

815
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,520
or wild animals

816
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,360
when we're studying potentially their

817
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,440
capacity to not consent

818
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,320
to our discussions with them it's an

819
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:04,960
interesting

820
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,720
question i won't go down the ethics

821
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,799
route here but a non-ethical question

822
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,320
that's related to experimentation is

823
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,080
that we just don't know which systems to

824
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,559
study

825
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,400
or what observables to measure for

826
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,320
experiments and so we're studying

827
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,760
something that isn't really

828
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,240
measurable or observable but we'll come

829
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,640
back to this idea of observability

830
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,080
in a few minutes when we're talking

831
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,240
about neurophenomenology

832
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,320
and the reality is no matter what you do

833
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,760
measure even if you come up with this

834
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,360
one special measurement that hasn't been

835
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,400
done before

836
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,240
all experiments are interpreted within a

837
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,240
cultural and a scientific milieu

838
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,679
in terms of what measurements

839
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,520
conclusions interpretations are

840
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,400
ethical correct accepted valid discussed

841
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,840
all these things

842
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,039
and even going another layer back about

843
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,240
experiments even

844
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,440
assuming that we can measure what we

845
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,440
want to know and measure and everything

846
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,600
experiments especially if they're

847
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,720
disconnected from

848
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,960
grounding in theory it's difficult to

849
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,320
know what is really being uniquely

850
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:58,960
tested

851
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,440
or demonstrated or falsified by

852
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,880
different kinds of experiments or what

853
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,640
we can learn from different kinds of

854
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,760
measurements

855
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,720
and there's a lot of ambiguity a lot of

856
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,039
levels the ambiguity can enter into but

857
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,400
just to give a few examples an

858
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,159
experimental result could be consistent

859
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,760
with many different frameworks or

860
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,279
potentially all frameworks

861
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,840
or a set of frameworks for consciousness

862
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,760
so when we really want to be identifying

863
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,360
what frameworks we're

864
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,679
wanting to work with it doesn't narrow

865
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:26,880
the space as much

866
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,480
to do experiments which we'll return to

867
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,320
soon and that's kind of related like the

868
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,760
neural correlates of consciousness

869
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,480
debate

870
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,720
which is do you put somebody in a neuro

871
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,120
imager and then have them do a no report

872
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,640
paradigm where they don't say yep i

873
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,600
heard the sound

874
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,440
so you play sounds of different uh you

875
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,760
know notes but what if it just

876
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,080
subconsciously

877
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,360
influenced their brain there still could

878
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,880
be a neural signature of that how would

879
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,080
you know they experienced it

880
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,919
well that's called a report paradigm you

881
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,679
ask them did you experience it

882
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,120
but in some sense you're just asking

883
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,880
them if they remember or if they hit the

884
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,840
button so

885
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,919
it gets messy but that really gets into

886
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,200
some of the weeds about what you're

887
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,080
measuring

888
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,880
and another example or area where we see

889
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,000
limitations on

890
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,600
experiments related to consciousness is

891
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,200
in animal behavior

892
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,200
so animal behavior seems naturally like

893
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,039
it'd be adjacent to human consciousness

894
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:11,840
studies

895
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,760
and we see a wide variety of things

896
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,600
being used here like pulley tests can

897
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,799
two of the same animal

898
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,120
pull a pulley so they get a reward

899
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,159
looking in a mirror

900
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,080
can one recognize themselves and take an

901
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,360
action pattern to clean themselves in

902
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,159
the mirror

903
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,440
and the first thing to note is that

904
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,960
whatever kind of setup you're dealing

905
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,320
with a visual illusion

906
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,640
a cooperation task a recognition task

907
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,240
memory planning

908
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,399
they're always going to be based upon

909
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,640
the affordances of that animal

910
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,720
and again it might be ambiguous as to

911
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,320
whether they're using some q that you

912
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,520
actually expect

913
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,520
um or if it doesn't see it's not going

914
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,960
to be able to be in the mirror test

915
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,720
so at the very least these tests for

916
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,559
consciousness which we'll get back to

917
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,200
don't help us really study the ground

918
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,600
rock

919
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,440
of this frameworks for consciousness

920
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,799
question because all you could say is

921
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,200
okay this bird can do the pulley test

922
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,720
but we don't even know what that means

923
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,960
and then of course if we find out that

924
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,120
potentially experience isn't related as

925
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,880
much as we thought to behavior or

926
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,799
if one has a model that it's not related

927
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,159
to behavior then

928
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,520
you could say yeah it's a robot that

929
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,520
just acts like it's a crow all right i

930
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,720
think i'm still streaming but it looks

931
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,240
like my camera froze i'm not just

932
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,840
re-plugging in um

933
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,440
yeah actually i'll just

934
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,039
see if i don't know what it's about but

935
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,640
that happened uh

936
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,240
last time as well but c'est la vie

937
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,600
i'll just close the camera for now

938
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,919
um actually let me just see if i can

939
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,600
remove the source

940
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,080
and then add the camera back in i'm

941
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,279
going to find out live

942
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,159
whether it is obs being weird or whether

943
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:45,120
it is

944
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,480
the actual usb connection

945
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,440
and turns out it was obs

946
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,399
we now know and we're right back

947
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,840
in it so

948
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,200
um to the point about potentially robots

949
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,520
or zombies as dennett might put it doing

950
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,720
uh complex behavioral tasks uh you

951
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,440
wouldn't know

952
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,960
whether the experience was being had

953
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,399
even if the behavioral experiment you

954
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:15,840
had lined up for this animal was

955
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,880
enormously complex and uh

956
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,559
robots might be able to do things that

957
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,320
we might not expect them to be able to

958
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:22,640
do

959
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,679
already such as learning language or

960
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,000
being culturally embedded and so yet

961
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,520
another point here is that

962
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,159
before you get too excited about any

963
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,279
single experiment

964
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,600
that might prove or disprove a model of

965
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,120
consciousness

966
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,279
consider it just another grain of sand

967
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,480
on a sand heap

968
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,960
and any single grain of sand that you're

969
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,799
adding to the seat back could be the one

970
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,880
that sets the whole cascade in motion

971
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,240
so by all means i encourage

972
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,720
experimentation but that being said

973
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,039
let's not fool ourselves in pretending

974
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:53,840
that

975
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,000
many of the data points we already have

976
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,520
are out there in the world already

977
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,679
and that just one more experiment is

978
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:00,799
unlikely to provide

979
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,720
any type of knockout evidence for or

980
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,880
against a model of consciousness

981
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,600
and so to kind of recap there there's

982
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,000
the thought

983
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,840
experiment branch the philosophy

984
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,679
meditation insight route and there's the

985
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,080
experimentation interpretation route

986
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,960
and uh those are connected of course

987
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,480
experiments are ideas too

988
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,919
but that being said they both have pros

989
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,760
and cons and people will often argue one

990
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,440
or the other as if they have um the

991
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,960
answers from one branch or the other i

992
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,840
hope i've

993
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,799
demonstrated that that isn't true and

994
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:29,279
one

995
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,600
reason i think that it's important to

996
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,279
have this viewpoint is that

997
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,600
we're living in a world just as a primo

998
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,520
fascia observation where there's some

999
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,080
people

1000
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,799
humans who say that they think all

1001
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,000
things are consciousness

1002
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,679
or that all things are consciousness in

1003
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,600
their own special way or that nothing is

1004
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,240
conscious

1005
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,159
including humans and of course there's

1006
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,000
many flavors to each of these viewpoints

1007
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,200
that could be held

1008
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,440
or at least communicated and there's

1009
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,200
many things about beliefs about

1010
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,880
consciousness that might not be verbal

1011
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,120
or expressible in a certain language

1012
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,440
so the point is we're in a total state

1013
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,279
where the evidence in the world has

1014
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,120
resulted in people believing different

1015
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,080
things through time

1016
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,840
different things even within the same

1017
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,440
family and so

1018
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,440
let's be humble the table has mostly

1019
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,760
been set for us in terms of observations

1020
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,240
about

1021
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,640
ourselves and about our world though it

1022
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,240
doesn't mean we can't reimagine

1023
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,640
much of our own experience or the world

1024
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,640
but um it would really have to be quite

1025
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,559
the thought experiment or quite the

1026
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,679
experiment

1027
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,919
uh in the real world if it can resolve

1028
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,000
these long-standing and philosophically

1029
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,600
grounded differences in worldview

1030
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,279
between schools of thought and between

1031
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,000
people

1032
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,880
and even if it did this even if the

1033
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,519
experiment

1034
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,120
were so good that it just convinced

1035
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,279
everyone it wouldn't even mean it was

1036
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:43,760
right

1037
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,799
it would just mean that it was

1038
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,360
convincing as a meme and so

1039
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,799
if we're really trying to find out

1040
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,320
what's right rather than how can we

1041
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,159
shape our own reality and other people's

1042
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,720
which isn't always the worst task

1043
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,120
if we want to be right then as far as i

1044
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,960
know it's not going to be the experiment

1045
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,080
or the thought experiment

1046
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,679
route alone and one last point on this

1047
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,279
slide because there's a lot to say here

1048
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:05,679
is that

1049
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,200
there's academics who believe different

1050
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,720
things and you can see these slides and

1051
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,080
citations and see that

1052
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,640
they cite different work that says one

1053
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,000
thing about the global workspace

1054
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,360
or another thing about information

1055
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,159
theory there's also different views on

1056
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:18,960
consciousness

1057
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,440
from different world traditions from

1058
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,240
artists

1059
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,799
from practitioners from non-scientists

1060
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,320
from non-philosophers

1061
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,760
from all kinds of people children adults

1062
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,240
everyone this is just to say that we

1063
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,919
should be very cautious

1064
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,080
about any kind of hegemonic especially

1065
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:36,960
scientific

1066
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,440
effort to define consciousness whether

1067
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,120
it comes from academia or

1068
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,679
from some other source there's just way

1069
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,120
too much on the table here

1070
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,200
for people to be making sweeping claims

1071
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,960
about what is or is not

1072
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,320
conscious uh and there's a lot

1073
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,399
that is downstream of that it's really a

1074
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,240
personal and a cultural

1075
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,159
thing what somebody believes about

1076
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:59,760
consciousness

1077
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,360
what they want to say or what they want

1078
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,799
to commit to

1079
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,399
and also while some people might find

1080
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:07,919
these topics exciting i think they're

1081
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,200
exciting if you're listening you

1082
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,559
probably find them to some extent

1083
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,559
exciting as well but many people

1084
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,440
are not interested in considering it and

1085
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,880
don't

1086
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,640
perhaps want to be told this is how

1087
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,279
their consciousness or experience is

1088
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,200
and other people are simply okay not

1089
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,559
knowing whether they're curious about it

1090
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:25,600
or not

1091
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,360
and so i'm always skeptical about

1092
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,840
science says type thinking which can be

1093
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,720
often how scientific papers are written

1094
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,399
even if it's written in an author's

1095
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,080
say type thinking it's about how it's

1096
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,480
communicated we've all seen the misuse

1097
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,760
of science says

1098
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,559
policy related to everything and

1099
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,399
consciousness would be the next level on

1100
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,440
that wouldn't it be

1101
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,440
so fill in the blanks think about what

1102
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,519
kind of power is held by the people

1103
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,640
who can say what or who is consciousness

1104
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,559
or evaluate conscious states such as

1105
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,440
suffering or pleasure so there's just a

1106
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,399
lot to it

1107
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,799
and then um the last point really here

1108
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,720
is that people can change their beliefs

1109
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,039
during their own lifetime and go deeper

1110
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,000
and shallower into different

1111
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
ideas and that probably doesn't change

1112
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,839
the underlying nature of consciousness

1113
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,918
so it will never be enough how we think

1114
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:12,960
at one moment

1115
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,320
or for a group of people to believe

1116
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,000
something i've gone down these

1117
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,520
discussions and roads many times with

1118
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,159
people

1119
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,560
um alone and in conversation and people

1120
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,079
will tell me well you know we're working

1121
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,839
with our best possible understanding of

1122
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:25,599
consciousness given the research at this

1123
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,399
time

1124
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,960
and it's just simply not true there's so

1125
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,440
much

1126
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,440
to know and respect in terms of the

1127
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,679
research and also the non-scientific

1128
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,159
literature

1129
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,119
on consciousness that there is just a

1130
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,800
lot more to the discussion than well

1131
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,079
let's just tell the kids something

1132
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,760
simple to it

1133
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,800
now to go beyond that and thanks for

1134
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,599
bearing with me

1135
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,040
it was just i wanted to say a few of

1136
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,399
those things because a lot of times

1137
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:49,119
consciousness

1138
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,719
papers are approached from

1139
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,159
non-scientists

1140
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,960
with excitement so i want to provide a

1141
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,879
little bit more of a nuanced scientists

1142
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:57,839
take here

1143
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,839
on how we can really respectfully study

1144
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:01,280
consciousness because this isn't just

1145
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,200
like fristen at all figuring it out in a

1146
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:03,920
paper

1147
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,040
but i love the paper and it's

1148
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,280
interesting so how do we hold this yes

1149
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:07,680
and

1150
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,400
perspective through nuance hearing

1151
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,920
multiple people's perspective having

1152
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,359
participation

1153
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,000
so what i'm going to talk about here is

1154
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,880
this paper

1155
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,800
that i worked on with my colleague eric

1156
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,240
sovik who's a professor

1157
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,640
in norway and the paper is called the

1158
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,839
ant colony test

1159
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,400
as a the ant colony as a test for

1160
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,240
scientific theories of consciousness

1161
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,320
so this is how i came to be thinking

1162
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,240
about a lot of these topics

1163
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,280
now professor soviet's background was in

1164
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,280
neurobehavior and in genetics of the

1165
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:37,920
honeybee

1166
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,920
mind was in similar areas but related to

1167
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,040
ants

1168
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,520
eric is also a very pragmatic and a

1169
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,560
philosophical

1170
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,280
thinker his phd advisor who is andy

1171
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,480
barron

1172
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,440
at macquarie university in australia is

1173
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,040
a honeybee biologist

1174
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,599
and professor barron has also written

1175
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:56,800
philosophy papers

1176
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,640
that are related to entomology as well

1177
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,800
as to experience and consciousness

1178
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,920
uh on my side my phd advisor professor

1179
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,720
deborah gordon

1180
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,119
at stanford is an ant behavioral

1181
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:07,839
ecologist

1182
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,119
who also wrote a lot of philosophy works

1183
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,000
broadly construed and so both eric and i

1184
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,359
had really positive

1185
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,320
mentors and role models for how we could

1186
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,800
combine entomology with philosophy

1187
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,480
so that's where we were coming from with

1188
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,839
this paper was

1189
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:26,720
how can we combine our direct

1190
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,680
ethological

1191
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,839
behavioral ecological experience with

1192
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,280
the social insects

1193
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,200
with what we knew about neurogenetics

1194
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,960
and molecular biology

1195
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,680
and then tie that through respectful

1196
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,680
engagement with some of the philosophy

1197
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,480
of consciousness

1198
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,200
literature here's what we didn't do in

1199
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:43,920
the paper

1200
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,880
what we didn't do is make a claim or a

1201
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,520
bet

1202
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,079
on whether ant colonies are conscious or

1203
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:50,640
not

1204
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,119
whether ant workers are conscious or not

1205
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,000
if people have

1206
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,240
feelings on that let's hear about them

1207
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,000
on the active stream let's find an ant

1208
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,599
stream let's do something fun

1209
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:00,880
let's hear about it but that's actually

1210
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,520
not what we did in this paper

1211
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,280
we do a few things in this paper the

1212
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,119
first thing is that we proposed

1213
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,200
this terminology of a forward and a

1214
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,200
reverse test for consciousness which i'm

1215
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,880
going to return to in a second with this

1216
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,760
image

1217
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,000
the second thing we did was to review

1218
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,599
the literature on consciousness from

1219
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:18,880
scientific literature

1220
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,560
and make classification schemes for

1221
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,760
different kinds of theories of

1222
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,640
consciousness

1223
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,640
so you can see why i was interested in

1224
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,400
the breakdown of this

1225
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,880
paper's understanding about the fields

1226
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,440
of different

1227
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,520
scientific studies of consciousness and

1228
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,200
then the third part of the paper

1229
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,119
we used empirical findings from

1230
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,240
entomology so

1231
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,800
observations of morphology or of

1232
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,359
behavior

1233
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,040
of individuals or of colonies from

1234
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,200
entomology and we asked whether

1235
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,960
different frameworks for consciousness

1236
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,160
that we found during the literature

1237
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:46,960
review

1238
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,119
might come to the conclusion that ant

1239
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,079
colonies and

1240
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,400
or workers had consciousness or

1241
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,599
awareness

1242
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,079
and we as authors remained neutral on

1243
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,160
the issue to the extent we could as far

1244
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:58,720
as just

1245
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,800
presenting hypothetical evaluations of

1246
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,160
colony of consciousness

1247
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,359
from the point of view of these

1248
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:04,640
different frameworks which is something

1249
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,079
that's so intrinsic to consciousness so

1250
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,520
it's kind of fun

1251
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,760
and it turns out that frameworks just

1252
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,760
simply wildly diverge

1253
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,440
in their claims about ant colony

1254
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,960
consciousness and

1255
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,320
it's really not a surprise that it

1256
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,160
turned out to be that way

1257
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,960
because the same frameworks diverge in

1258
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,839
their claims

1259
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,839
pretty plainly and people diverge in

1260
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:24,880
their opinions

1261
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,480
and so if the frameworks are going to

1262
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,240
disagree about humans being conscious or

1263
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:28,960
electrons

1264
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,640
then they're going to disagree about

1265
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,520
ants and

1266
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,960
it was just interesting to experience

1267
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,880
this though and ask how we could have a

1268
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,480
reconsideration of what we're really

1269
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,920
doing here with the consciousness

1270
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,320
studies area because there's thousands

1271
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,680
of speculative papers

1272
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,200
about consciousness and animals but are

1273
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,880
we moving the needle and if we are

1274
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,480
in what direction is that where we want

1275
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,000
to be moving it

1276
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,640
what did we do in the paper so we

1277
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,720
introduced this idea of a forward and a

1278
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,280
reverse

1279
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,440
test for consciousness and we thought

1280
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,720
about forward in reverse

1281
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,000
just from the point of view of the

1282
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,760
observer the experimenter

1283
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,520
so that's very related to this

1284
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,119
phenomenological invariant

1285
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,040
idea that the pcm model is going to

1286
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,960
return to in a little bit

1287
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,480
and this idea that everything in

1288
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,240
consciousness should be relational let's

1289
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,920
take this perspectival and this

1290
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,200
relational approach

1291
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,000
very seriously so what is a forward and

1292
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,800
reverse test

1293
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,040
a forward test is when you trust your

1294
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,960
test and it describes the mode of usage

1295
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,200
of

1296
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,520
tool where you're measuring systems and

1297
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,880
drawing conclusions

1298
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,040
so for example in the figure it says i

1299
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,040
trust my test how heavy are these boxes

1300
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,560
and we have this gray test

1301
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,119
it says it it's an unknown whether the

1302
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,880
box is conscious or not

1303
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,119
we put it on there it says yep one and

1304
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,560
then we go out in the world and we

1305
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,400
investigate whether different boxes

1306
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,760
are um different weights or a

1307
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,599
consciousness or whatever and

1308
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,520
that is for validated calibrated

1309
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,440
instrumentation and it's important for

1310
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,480
the normal

1311
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,520
in a paradigm uh vocabulary the normal

1312
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,200
science which is advancing

1313
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,240
science and a reverse test is a

1314
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,079
different phase a reverse test is when

1315
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:00,880
you don't

1316
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,640
trust your test yet and this is like

1317
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,800
calibration and calibration

1318
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,400
is when you take things that you do know

1319
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,240
about like we know that the meter is

1320
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,520
this much

1321
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,160
relative to this and we know that the

1322
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,599
wavelength of this is going to help us

1323
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,280
calibrate this tool

1324
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,400
but really just when you use a

1325
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,680
scientific instrument it has to be

1326
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,800
calibrated

1327
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,560
and if we want to have a science of

1328
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,599
consciousness we have to have a

1329
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:22,880
calibrated instrument

1330
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,480
and so the reverse test is when you

1331
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,319
don't trust the test and you don't know

1332
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:27,599
what the machine is going to read out

1333
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,359
but you put on the one pound block

1334
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,359
and you say i'm going to fine tune this

1335
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,880
machine so that it comes out with

1336
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,720
one when i put the one on there and then

1337
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,280
we'll know that this scale or this

1338
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,520
spectrophotometer

1339
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,680
works and it's kind of this back and

1340
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,359
forth this two-stroke

1341
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:44,400
engine that we've seen so much about and

1342
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,319
we've been talking about um the back and

1343
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:46,880
forth

1344
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,839
between action and inference of course

1345
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:51,280
we've been talking about that from the

1346
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,440
framework of computationalism

1347
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,040
from the bayesian perspective the

1348
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,880
bayesian structuralist perspective

1349
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,440
in activism and ecological psychology

1350
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,000
and just

1351
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,800
cognition in general agency how do we do

1352
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,319
this forward and backwards of

1353
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:07,359
more tool-like based upon affordances

1354
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,280
and more inference based upon

1355
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,720
observations

1356
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,000
okay so it's kind of a two-stroke engine

1357
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,240
for studying consciousness from a field

1358
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,760
perspective so this is like what should

1359
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,440
the field of consciousness researchers

1360
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:19,760
be

1361
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,119
studying now wouldn't it be great

1362
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,720
if we had a forward test for

1363
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,319
consciousness if we had

1364
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,240
a scale that we could go yep we hooked

1365
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,680
up this person's brain or

1366
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,560
this wi-fi router or this beetle and yet

1367
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,800
it's a two out of four it's a 2.9 out of

1368
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,480
you know whatever it is

1369
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,119
yeah sounds great i understand why

1370
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,040
people want to mathematize and why they

1371
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,880
want to measure consciousness

1372
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,839
but if you meet somebody who has a good

1373
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:46,480
test

1374
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,880
for consciousness then you know get the

1375
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,000
tesla tech

1376
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,680
get the perpetual motion machine get

1377
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,599
everything you can from that person

1378
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,000
because we don't see it within the

1379
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,880
current space

1380
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,160
we're in we want to have this test

1381
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,400
prefrontal cortex language whatever it

1382
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,960
happens to be no caveats just a test

1383
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,040
of course it doesn't exist and so that's

1384
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,720
kind of what this issue is about

1385
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,400
and so when we don't have a forward test

1386
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,160
for consciousness even though people

1387
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,760
might think they locally have one i hope

1388
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,200
i've sort of dispelled that with a

1389
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,640
previous slide

1390
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,480
if we don't have a forward test to

1391
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,800
operate in the action mode

1392
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,359
do we have a reverse test to help us

1393
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,560
work in the inference

1394
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,480
mode so that is um where

1395
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,400
professor cervic and i wanted to think

1396
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,319
about different kinds of forward tests

1397
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,599
for consciousness and then

1398
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,119
how could the ant colony be a reverse

1399
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,880
test for consciousness so here's the

1400
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,160
framework that we

1401
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,160
loosely organized into for our

1402
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,560
literature framework

1403
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,319
um in terms of forward tests for

1404
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,000
consciousness so this is like what other

1405
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,359
people might call frameworks for

1406
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:48,640
consciousness

1407
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,680
we said look all these models what they

1408
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,880
have in common is that there's some

1409
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,839
measurements some

1410
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:56,560
tool-like intervention or um

1411
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,920
intervention into the process or

1412
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,560
measurement

1413
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,160
that could be done that would help us

1414
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,079
have a forward test so like

1415
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,319
is this system conscious does it have x

1416
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,760
does it have language does it have a

1417
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,880
prefrontal cortex

1418
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,640
okay now the reverse test for

1419
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,240
consciousness would be like we know

1420
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,520
humans are conscious

1421
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,520
so any theory that says that is fine

1422
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,560
with me or

1423
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,400
we know humans are not conscious so i

1424
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,119
rule out any theory that says that right

1425
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,960
whichever one you think you believe fine

1426
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,960
so we separated into a few different

1427
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,240
categories the first one was

1428
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,000
neurobiological so remember that they

1429
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,160
had three categories biofunctional

1430
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,000
cognitive neurofunctional and

1431
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,680
information theoretic

1432
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,599
what we did with our slightly different

1433
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:36,800
breakdown of

1434
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,280
the categories in the space not a final

1435
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,359
word this is just what we had uh

1436
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:44,400
found out about is we divided

1437
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,920
neurobiological models

1438
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,640
into the following categories which were

1439
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,319
structural models that were based upon

1440
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:50,880
macro

1441
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,560
or micro uh structure so macro structure

1442
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,119
would be like

1443
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,440
the cerebral cortex is this size or it

1444
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,839
has this brain region so gross anatomy

1445
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:02,160
macro structure the micro structure is

1446
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,240
like wow there are so many connections

1447
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,760
on the dendrites or

1448
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,240
this cell type has this shape so things

1449
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,560
that you'd need a microscope to see

1450
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,920
macro to micro so you need the

1451
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,000
microscope for the micro histology or

1452
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,839
oh the architecture of these neural

1453
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:17,200
networks is a feedback

1454
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,880
that means that it could be implementing

1455
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,280
something so macro microstructure of the

1456
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:21,680
brain

1457
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,520
neurobiology or of the brain in the body

1458
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,960
for that matter because it's not always

1459
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,480
about the brain

1460
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,560
functionalist models for um

1461
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,680
consciousness would be like

1462
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,079
there is a function that does egocentric

1463
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:32,880
navigation

1464
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,440
in crawfish and crows and humans so

1465
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,000
these are

1466
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,240
conscious entities so because there's a

1467
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,359
functional

1468
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:40,960
element of something that's being done

1469
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,079
even if it's being done in

1470
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,760
non-homologous brain regions

1471
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,119
or two different ways by two different

1472
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:46,960
species or in somebody who was born with

1473
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,640
vision or who wasn't born with vision

1474
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,040
it's the function that matters and then

1475
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,800
another neurobiological

1476
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,560
assessment that people often make in

1477
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,000
terms of forward testing

1478
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,240
is dynamical features of brain function

1479
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,200
so they'll say

1480
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,640
well because the brain is a complex

1481
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,640
adaptive system with winnerless

1482
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,640
competitions and leaky integration

1483
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,280
and action policy selection and um lock

1484
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,000
and voltair

1485
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,160
um you know uh predator prey type

1486
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,200
dynamics or

1487
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,839
chaos and landslides catastrophes power

1488
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:15,280
tail of noise

1489
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,520
all of these dynamical features coming

1490
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,599
from usually a complexity or a signal

1491
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,200
processing perspective

1492
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,720
so those are the kinds of appeals that

1493
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,960
people make to the brain and the body

1494
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,800
there's also the egocentric and

1495
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,440
relational frameworks for thinking about

1496
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,839
what counts as a model of consciousness

1497
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,040
and in this category

1498
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,040
there's a bunch that we could go into

1499
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,640
but just to make it kind of clear what i

1500
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,319
mean by egocentric and relational which

1501
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:41,680
is actually the first invariant

1502
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,359
principle of the pcm so

1503
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:45,599
totally agree it's critical it's on the

1504
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,160
idea of spatial awareness and perception

1505
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,319
which is um whether it's the lived

1506
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,800
experience or just the acting as if

1507
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,640
of things being closer to you being more

1508
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,319
accessible but everything

1509
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,160
in consciousness is experienced in

1510
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,359
relation to

1511
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:02,160
something that's agreed upon even when

1512
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,280
people don't even agree what that

1513
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,040
relationship is or what that something

1514
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:05,920
is so

1515
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,040
that's kind of cool um then there are

1516
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,800
cognitive and behavioral frameworks so

1517
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,079
these are cognitive

1518
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:13,839
being broadly understood as like things

1519
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:15,359
that computers might be able to do or

1520
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:16,560
computer networks or

1521
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,440
extended cognition embedded enacted and

1522
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,040
cultured all this stuff that we talk

1523
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,400
about every week

1524
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,560
let's take that broadly to cognitive so

1525
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,720
here by cognitive i don't just mean

1526
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,560
what people think of happening between

1527
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,920
you know the student's eye

1528
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,599
and them filling in the multiple choice

1529
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,520
test that's not just cognition

1530
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,359
we want to have a broad understanding of

1531
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,119
cognition multi-scale

1532
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:40,160
message passing bayesian nets etc and

1533
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,280
the categories here

1534
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,240
are um there's multiple but examples are

1535
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:44,560
like

1536
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,720
emotional or affective states kind of

1537
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,560
foreshadowing um the sophisticated

1538
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,319
affect of inference which will be active

1539
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:51,200
11.

1540
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,240
but emotional states like regret um or

1541
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,200
optimism bias and cognitive biases more

1542
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:57,920
general

1543
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,359
so everything from visual illusions

1544
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:03,599
to other types of illusions that are not

1545
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,680
visual but can be related to the order

1546
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,359
of things being presented

1547
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:09,200
these are sort of cognitive effects that

1548
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,800
potentially like a neural network

1549
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,079
might fall victim to and so what we've

1550
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:14,800
experienced

1551
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,319
is that there's this run around and

1552
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,319
people say well this bird has this brain

1553
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:20,079
region so it's a macro structural claim

1554
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:21,280
so it's conscious and then

1555
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,800
somebody brings up a shortcoming of the

1556
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,559
idea of macrostructuralism

1557
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,240
like well does it really mean that it's

1558
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,520
aware just because it has this brain

1559
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,440
region what about sleeping people or

1560
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,599
what about you know daniel dennett or

1561
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:32,480
something like that

1562
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,079
and they go well right it's actually the

1563
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,480
brain region and the microstructure okay

1564
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,400
so it's microstructural great well

1565
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,680
then would anything with that

1566
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,000
microstructure have that kind of a

1567
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,040
characteristic

1568
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,640
um like if you made a model and a

1569
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,079
computer would it have awareness well no

1570
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,760
it has to be evolved or it has to

1571
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,880
have language or it has to be

1572
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,880
implementing something ecologically

1573
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,359
great so we want to chase that rabbit

1574
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:54,240
down

1575
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,480
because we're serious about answers here

1576
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,079
and so we want to chase it down someone

1577
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:59,440
says oh well when i said language i

1578
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,960
didn't just mean a chatbot

1579
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,760
i meant they they feel emotion you say

1580
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,280
well but what if the chatbot says it

1581
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,280
feels emotion too what are you gonna do

1582
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,720
and then all of a sudden that whole

1583
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,720
feeling emotion um communication of a

1584
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,839
feeling emotion

1585
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:13,119
all of a sudden they have a new

1586
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:15,280
explanation so let's keep on

1587
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,400
chasing down these rabbit holes and uh

1588
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,480
one other category that is closest to

1589
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,720
what is described in this paper

1590
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,640
is the mathematical framework so we took

1591
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,240
a step beyond the authors

1592
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,359
in the um 2018 paper the projective

1593
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:30,640
consciousness model

1594
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,400
where they said there's the information

1595
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,960
theory category of consciousness models

1596
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,800
we actually separated a few of these

1597
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,880
models of mathematical frameworks so we

1598
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,240
have decision making and long-term

1599
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,200
planning

1600
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,160
um as well as information theo theoretic

1601
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:44,960
geometrical

1602
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,119
so there have been some maybe it was

1603
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:48,000
published similar

1604
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,520
or slightly after this paper but there

1605
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,280
have been some geometric theory of

1606
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,319
consciousness

1607
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:55,040
info theory and then also a lot of times

1608
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,640
the information theory approaches deal

1609
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,160
with information geometry

1610
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,119
so which one is it i agree that it's

1611
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:02,559
enough to call it mathematical and just

1612
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:02,880
say

1613
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,200
includes topology information theory

1614
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,960
thermodynamics geometry

1615
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,319
just a lot of math stuff um another

1616
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:11,760
area of mathematical frameworks for

1617
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,680
consciousness could be like cybernetics

1618
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,359
which is why it was one of the key words

1619
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:16,000
for this paper

1620
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,839
because a mathematical framework for

1621
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:19,440
consciousness might involve

1622
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,480
decision making or agency or ability to

1623
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:22,880
plan

1624
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,119
at a certain level of coherence and in

1625
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:26,880
fact in the 2018

1626
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,440
interview that was with carl fristin

1627
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,079
myself

1628
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:31,920
and our passed away colleague martin

1629
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,079
forger in the last question of that

1630
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:35,119
interview

1631
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,359
i asked him whether he thought the ant

1632
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:38,640
colony was conscious because i was

1633
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,400
working on this paper with eric

1634
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,599
and i was writing the interview with

1635
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:43,520
carl and then i just thought wow we

1636
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,920
could figure out what carl thinks about

1637
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,160
ant colonies being conscious and if

1638
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,359
you're interested in

1639
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:52,319
either fristenology or in ant colony

1640
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:53,200
consciousness then

1641
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,760
definitely review carl's answer on that

1642
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,599
but just to kind of close this slide off

1643
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:00,640
um we're committed to long-term clarity

1644
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:01,119
on these

1645
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:02,880
issues about the study of the science of

1646
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,559
consciousness so we really

1647
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,280
welcome collaboration or improvement on

1648
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:07,760
these

1649
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,599
questions let's work with it let's make

1650
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:11,520
an ontology for consciousness or

1651
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,280
how are we going to get organized on

1652
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,520
this issue because as i said there's

1653
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,200
just too much on the table to let this

1654
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,319
one slide

1655
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:20,880
and we have to enter this space and do

1656
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:21,599
it right

1657
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:24,839
because otherwise just it goes off the

1658
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:26,960
rails

1659
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,440
okay let's get to neurophenomenology

1660
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,720
which is one of the key words of the

1661
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,400
paper oh yeah the paper

1662
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,480
and on the bottom here i have a couple

1663
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,839
just fun images

1664
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:38,960
the left side is the book geb

1665
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,559
by douglas hofstetter 1979 but reads as

1666
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,680
crisply as ever and uh really

1667
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,520
an insightful book and then on the other

1668
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,960
side uh of

1669
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,960
uh is the tree of knowledge this yellow

1670
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,680
cover by uh varela and maturana

1671
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,079
and that's a book about autopilesis and

1672
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:57,040
a few other

1673
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,680
topics that are really cool related to

1674
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,400
complexity

1675
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,160
and just very deeply related to the

1676
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,079
ecological and activist

1677
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:07,119
semantic biobehavioral a lot of great

1678
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:07,760
stuff

1679
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,240
also potentially the work of frijoff

1680
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:10,880
capra

1681
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,480
is one thing to look into here but then

1682
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,240
some images because it's not all about

1683
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:14,800
language

1684
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,720
so here's some images by magritte and by

1685
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,240
m c escher

1686
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,680
that have to do with sort of what is

1687
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,000
this self let's look at how the authors

1688
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:22,599
define

1689
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:25,920
neurophenomenology they define it as one

1690
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,440
observation and description of the

1691
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,200
phenomenological invariance at the

1692
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,200
appropriate level of abstraction

1693
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,480
so maybe the appropriate level of

1694
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,880
abstraction for the experience of

1695
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,000
drinking water is not

1696
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,319
uh you know a throat cell maybe it's uh

1697
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:39,440
not a whole

1698
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,400
nation maybe it's a person the

1699
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,160
classification too classification of the

1700
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,079
behavioral cognitive and biofunctional

1701
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:47,760
aspects of consciousness so

1702
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,760
some drugs like you know you take

1703
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,760
acetaminophen and it doesn't make you

1704
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,119
feel that different there's other drugs

1705
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:54,640
that are psychoactive or that have

1706
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,480
long-term changes to your brain

1707
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,839
whether you experience it in the short

1708
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:00,400
term or not so how are we going to get a

1709
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,119
behavioral

1710
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,359
cognitive molecular genomic

1711
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:04,480
understanding of

1712
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,839
fat mechanism three identification of

1713
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:09,160
the neuroanatomical and

1714
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,720
neurophysiological correlates of

1715
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,440
consciousness

1716
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,760
so i see neuroanatomy as the structural

1717
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,800
whether it's

1718
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,880
function structural at the macro or the

1719
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,520
micro neuroanatomy is what soviet and i

1720
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,280
called structure then neurophysiological

1721
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,599
is um referring to the dynamics and the

1722
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:26,400
processes

1723
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,240
molecular informational whatever they

1724
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,839
may be that are in the brain so those

1725
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:31,599
are the functionalist models to me

1726
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:34,400
of the brain four development of

1727
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,160
mathematical and computational models of

1728
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,680
consciousness which i would consider to

1729
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,079
be in the mathematical category

1730
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:41,839
that a faithfully integrate all the

1731
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:43,280
invariants described in one which we'll

1732
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:43,839
get to

1733
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:47,280
soon b provide unifying explanations

1734
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,119
of intestinal hypotheses about the

1735
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:50,720
bio-functional aspects of consciousness

1736
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,000
described in two

1737
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,079
all on board and c can be physically

1738
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:55,680
implemented in the hardware identified

1739
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:56,319
in three

1740
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:57,920
as well as perhaps in non-biological

1741
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,440
hardware so i

1742
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,839
don't subscribe to computationalism i

1743
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:03,280
don't believe in a hardware software

1744
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,280
distinction except as a useful metaphor

1745
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,280
in biology i think the book wet wear is

1746
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,559
pretty interesting

1747
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:11,839
on this topic and the reason why i

1748
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:13,760
intervened right after the mathematical

1749
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,359
and computational models is because i

1750
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:16,960
think it's actually a different domain

1751
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,319
i think there could be a mathematical

1752
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:20,319
model that's extremely agnostic to the

1753
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:21,359
biology

1754
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,520
or our biological model could just be

1755
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,200
like it is what it is

1756
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,720
and it doesn't matter what the math or

1757
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,400
what anyone thinks the math is

1758
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,720
it is what it is because of evolution or

1759
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,680
um because it

1760
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,200
passed through some sort of historical

1761
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,440
filter and any equation you put on it is

1762
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,720
just like a linear regression

1763
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,240
it just it doesn't matter so those to me

1764
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,920
they can kind of fly together and that

1765
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,359
would be great or not

1766
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:45,280
it could be something totally off base

1767
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,800
which is why i think again it's

1768
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,319
important that even though we have

1769
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:50,240
the citations and the ways that we can

1770
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,680
sort citations into

1771
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,839
keyword clusters let's not think that

1772
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:55,040
we've mapped out the space of the

1773
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:55,680
possible

1774
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,599
in consciousness because there's people

1775
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:58,960
in other cultures

1776
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,680
who don't feel the same way as

1777
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,839
scientists

1778
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:05,520
first person perspective is i think the

1779
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,880
last key word

1780
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,760
and they write about that in the paper

1781
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:10,000
they

1782
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,960
say ideally this method of the pcm would

1783
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,480
give us a theory of consciousness that

1784
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,400
intelligently links the phenomenology of

1785
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,319
a first-person conscious experience with

1786
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,000
its realization in the brain or other

1787
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:20,720
substrate

1788
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,040
via mathematical and computational model

1789
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,960
simultaneously accounting for its bio

1790
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:25,920
functional properties

1791
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,760
so the bio functional properties is kind

1792
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,119
of where you got the

1793
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:31,440
neuro part the mathematical

1794
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,720
computational model

1795
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,319
they're saying wouldn't it be good for

1796
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:36,480
purposes of describing it predicting it

1797
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,280
controlling it designing it

1798
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,799
explaining variance reducing our

1799
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:42,480
uncertainty why not

1800
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,240
that's the mathematical computational

1801
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,599
side and then

1802
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:47,760
pull it all the way back phenomenology

1803
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,319
so computational neural phenomenology

1804
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:52,000
we're going to be doing mathematical

1805
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,240
computational neurophenomenology in this

1806
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,040
paper

1807
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,480
and we're going to be using geometric

1808
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,400
tools like projection mapping

1809
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,720
to think about how cybernetics and

1810
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,839
active inference

1811
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:04,839
are related to classic work in

1812
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:06,799
neurophenomenology

1813
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:09,520
okay one more keyword perspectival

1814
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,640
imagination

1815
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,000
so they quote on this one they write

1816
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
this perspectival space of the field of

1817
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,440
consciousness foc

1818
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,599
is organized around an elusive implicit

1819
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:21,040
origin or zero point and

1820
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,960
includes a horizon with vanishing points

1821
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,799
at infinity that mark its limit so right

1822
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,240
there there's the two of the violations

1823
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,680
of euclidean geometry

1824
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,119
point of privilege that's the point of

1825
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:30,960
view and then the vanishing horizon

1826
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,240
points out infinity

1827
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,880
the foc embeds vectorized directions

1828
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,960
that frame the orientation of attention

1829
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:37,680
and action

1830
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,720
along three axes vertical horizontal and

1831
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:41,760
sagittal so like

1832
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,680
you know this one this one and then that

1833
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,040
one

1834
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,280
these are given in perspective with

1835
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,599
respect to these same points at infinity

1836
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:52,240
so pretty interesting stuff they

1837
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,839
continue and they write

1838
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:55,680
since we are dealing with a 3d

1839
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,680
perspectival space with an elusive

1840
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,920
origin point of privilege point of view

1841
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,000
and vanishing points at infinity

1842
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,079
constituting a horizontal plane

1843
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,240
a horizon plane that happens to be in

1844
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,520
the horizontal axis

1845
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,599
it doesn't have to be if you're on your

1846
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:12,000
side it's not

1847
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,760
the pcm postulates that the field of

1848
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,839
consciousness has the structure of a 3d

1849
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,280
projective space in the sense of

1850
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,480
projective geometry

1851
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,240
nice thanks for giving it as a keyword

1852
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,079
too it helped me learn about it

1853
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,640
the foc can thus partly be understood in

1854
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,200
terms of 3g projective frame

1855
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,880
let's look at a few just kind of cool

1856
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,640
examples related to perspectival

1857
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:31,839
imagination

1858
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:34,480
so this is an example of a non-euclidean

1859
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,839
geometry it's an escher

1860
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:38,240
uh artwork and it's like these bats that

1861
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,280
kind of fractal

1862
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,599
off and sometimes this could be related

1863
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:43,599
to hyperbolic geometry or other

1864
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:46,559
geometries but the point is like each

1865
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:47,520
bat might be

1866
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,000
flying off and so that kind of maps onto

1867
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
our experience of a bird or about flying

1868
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,119
away from us and slowing down perhaps

1869
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:57,440
but how is that going to get mapped onto

1870
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,559
another space

1871
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:00,240
that may or may not have three

1872
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,839
dimensions spatially

1873
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:03,920
again bucky fuller might claim there are

1874
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,599
four spatial dimensions so let's not

1875
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:06,799
assume there are three spatial

1876
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:08,160
dimensions and that the fourth one is

1877
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,119
time

1878
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,520
that being said it makes sense to talk

1879
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,559
about xyz

1880
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:15,359
coordinates from a cartesian perspective

1881
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:15,920
another

1882
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,520
example about this perspectival

1883
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,200
imagination is vanishing point so

1884
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,839
everyone who's done a fun drawing course

1885
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:24,319
or just looked down a city road or

1886
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:25,040
looked out

1887
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,839
of a car that was driving through fields

1888
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:29,280
everything kind of vanishes

1889
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,040
and so you can see the rows of a field

1890
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:31,920
and you know that they're all in

1891
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:32,880
parallel

1892
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,559
but then you can see really deeply down

1893
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,400
one other ones like kind of

1894
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,319
move towards it and another way of

1895
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:40,400
seeing it in a cityscape is like

1896
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,000
you can conceptually know that the

1897
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,920
street is straight but if you look at it

1898
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,040
it looks like a triangle

1899
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,319
that's disappearing from you with a

1900
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:48,079
point at the top so

1901
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:50,079
what is it that allows us to be like oh

1902
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,480
yeah buildings have 90 degree angles

1903
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,480
and they're going upright even though

1904
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,720
all the actual angles are kind of wacky

1905
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,200
so that's this perspectival imagination

1906
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,720
and that's what makes an artist who can

1907
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,319
make a lifelike drawing

1908
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:03,599
especially like an architecture or

1909
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:05,760
something look

1910
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,920
lifelike because they capture these

1911
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,920
extremely subtle

1912
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,240
features about vanishing point and

1913
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,200
perspective

1914
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,720
and all these different things so one

1915
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,720
drawing that i love on this is um

1916
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:20,240
this one and it's like

1917
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,520
for many people it's okay do a

1918
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,440
self-portrait of what you see when

1919
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,559
you um are on the couch and one approach

1920
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:27,200
might be like

1921
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,040
i just you know draw like okay i see

1922
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,640
this you know here's this piece of art

1923
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,680
here's my bookshelf

1924
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,160
here's you know my bike then the next

1925
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,280
layer back's like oh i'm going to

1926
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,400
include my feet

1927
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,160
in the drawing like the kind of you know

1928
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,079
i'm on the beach here's my legs type

1929
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:40,559
thing

1930
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,119
like uh taking a picture from right in

1931
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:44,400
front of you

1932
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,240
with a phone something that we actually

1933
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,839
have an affordance to do now but

1934
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:49,920
other people may not have seen in such a

1935
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,520
direct way

1936
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,520
which is why they didn't take selfies

1937
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:54,799
for example oh

1938
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:58,880
hey here i am this drawing takes it back

1939
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,839
another layer now this is actually where

1940
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:02,960
are you really

1941
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,680
seeing from not what is cancelled out

1942
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,760
with a binocular vision

1943
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,319
but what happens when you look with one

1944
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:11,200
eye

1945
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,839
really really far to the side well you

1946
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:15,280
see this curving

1947
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,040
and it's just like a little bit

1948
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,319
beautifully accentuated

1949
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:20,480
but of course we're seeing that as a

1950
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,240
two-dimensional projection

1951
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:26,079
so that's just so cool and uh

1952
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,920
styles that play with our perception

1953
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,160
like optical illusions or cubism

1954
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:33,040
or abstract art they often incorporate

1955
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:33,520
some

1956
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,400
invariant features of perspectival

1957
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,760
imagination but then violate

1958
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,960
expectations on other ones so like um

1959
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,640
half of the person's body is as if they

1960
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,160
were lit from this side and half as

1961
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,440
if is as if they were lit from a

1962
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,119
different side that was a classic

1963
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:48,640
technique of the cubists

1964
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,079
and so very rich space

1965
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:55,599
very open for honest collaboration

1966
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:59,040
with artists and philosophers

1967
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,359
and practitioners so we hope that this

1968
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:02,640
is kind of an opening

1969
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,760
for those who might have thought active

1970
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,200
inference okay it's an engineering

1971
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:07,760
framework

1972
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,440
we're talking about optimization we're

1973
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,359
talking about sociocultural things but

1974
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:13,680
kind of from an abstract point of view

1975
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,599
how are we going to take this into our

1976
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:17,200
experience of consciousness and of

1977
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,160
perspective

1978
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,559
so i'm going to return to this slide

1979
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:22,480
again and again which is that

1980
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,880
it's a question what does free energy

1981
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,720
principle and active inference

1982
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,640
say about the relationship between the

1983
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,240
world and agents

1984
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,839
so that's this feedback between the

1985
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:33,520
world and the agents and the nested

1986
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,400
agents

1987
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,799
and here we're adding on this level of

1988
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,119
the agent is having conscious awareness

1989
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:41,359
it's thinking i am a strange action

1990
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:42,400
perception loop

1991
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,319
or at least it's acting like it says it

1992
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:46,640
or it's thinking that it's saying it

1993
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,640
and just as we've talked about before

1994
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,559
with this slide we want to be building

1995
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:50,960
on

1996
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,839
the fields of action of inference of

1997
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:54,480
physics

1998
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,640
of experience we want to be tying these

1999
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,920
threads together

2000
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,319
while also being aware that just being

2001
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:01,520
convinced will never

2002
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,000
be enough so that's why it's such a fun

2003
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:04,640
area

2004
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,079
why it's so great to do research in this

2005
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:10,640
area and to learn about it and also to

2006
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:11,599
welcome

2007
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:13,680
collaboration and to welcome people

2008
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,040
sharing their perspective

2009
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,960
because i really believe that no matter

2010
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,319
how many papers you've read about

2011
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:19,440
consciousness

2012
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,079
it does not make that opinion any more

2013
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:22,720
valid

2014
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,400
there's other topics where potentially

2015
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,319
you couldn't say that as flippantly

2016
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:28,160
but in the area of consciousness it

2017
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,599
can't be a counting game

2018
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:31,839
it's just not it's something that is so

2019
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:33,599
essential to our experience and so

2020
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:36,400
it's such a deep area a perfect area for

2021
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,040
transdisciplinary synthesis

2022
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:42,240
cool let's get to the paper because

2023
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,160
it's also all about the specifics we

2024
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,599
want to be really specific about what

2025
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,480
the authors

2026
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:49,680
say and do so that we can build off of

2027
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,520
it with other specific work

2028
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:54,240
so that we can actually um use their

2029
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:54,960
perspectives

2030
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,520
as catalysts for our own development not

2031
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,200
push ideas out of our head and replace

2032
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,480
it with you know the fristen

2033
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,359
update but rather be catalyzed and

2034
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:04,319
spurred to new

2035
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:07,920
culturally informed creative states by

2036
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:10,319
reading and by discussing so that's why

2037
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:13,200
really especially for 9.1 and 0.2

2038
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,119
for the last home stretch of 2020 and

2039
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:16,720
for 2021 just

2040
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,400
if you're listening to it we want to

2041
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,000
know your experience and

2042
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,520
we want to hear your questions in the

2043
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,119
youtube chat

2044
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:26,480
or have you on live however it has to be

2045
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,960
this paper is called the projective

2046
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,000
consciousness model

2047
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,839
and phenomenal selfhood it was published

2048
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:34,559
in december of 2018 in

2049
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:36,880
the uh frontiers in psychology journal

2050
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,319
in the division of theoretical

2051
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:40,319
philosophical psychology

2052
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:42,559
and the authors are willa ford bennequin

2053
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:44,079
fristen and ridroff

2054
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:45,839
so that's kind of giving you some

2055
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:47,599
information on when this paper was

2056
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:48,319
published

2057
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:50,559
and on what areas the authors want to

2058
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:52,240
place their work within

2059
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,760
let's take some quotes from the paper

2060
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,920
and look at the main aims and claims

2061
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:59,280
of the work they write can we

2062
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,520
describe this integrated multimodal and

2063
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,760
centered spatial structure of conscious

2064
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,520
experience in a rigorous way

2065
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,799
great question i love the setup and they

2066
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:09,520
write

2067
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,760
and can we give a good account of why it

2068
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,280
should be thus organized

2069
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,359
here we answer both questions in the

2070
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:16,880
affirmative great

2071
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,559
questions i love the setup and it's

2072
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:20,000
something we can evaluate

2073
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
whether that's a hearty affirmative or a

2074
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,359
half-hearted or uh

2075
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:25,920
overly confident or underly confident or

2076
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,280
okay it's affirmative but then what do

2077
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,319
we do

2078
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:30,319
these are all great questions to have

2079
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:32,160
and i just love that the authors can be

2080
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,680
really clear about this

2081
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,599
great research and also a great

2082
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:37,520
suggestion by a community member

2083
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:40,640
to um read this paper overall

2084
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:43,240
the pcm delivers an account of the

2085
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:45,039
phenomenologically available

2086
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:47,280
generic structure of consciousness and

2087
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,440
shows how consciousness allows organisms

2088
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,280
to integrate multimodal sensory

2089
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,480
information

2090
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,039
memory and emotion in order to control

2091
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:55,760
behavior

2092
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:58,000
enhance resilience optimize preference

2093
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:58,960
satisfaction

2094
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,640
and minimize predictive error in an

2095
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,000
efficient manner

2096
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,760
sounds chill if we could we should

2097
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,480
great the way that i would rephrase it

2098
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,760
without

2099
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,960
any of the jargon of act imp is how can

2100
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:13,599
we apply

2101
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:15,200
active inference to the study of

2102
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,960
consciousness in all of its

2103
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:20,160
unified yet coherent mysterious

2104
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:23,359
dynamic and profound facets so there for

2105
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,359
the purposes of scientific writing

2106
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:27,039
highlighting a lot of the vocabulary

2107
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:28,880
keywords and research fields related to

2108
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,640
control theory information signaling

2109
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:31,599
geometry

2110
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:33,839
math computation those are some heavy

2111
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:35,200
hitting ideas

2112
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,839
but let's also not lose sight that some

2113
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:39,839
of the other heavy hitting ideas include

2114
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:41,680
the mystery of consciousness

2115
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:44,720
and why we're the one that we are and

2116
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:47,039
whether cells have consciousness and

2117
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:48,799
whether ant colonies do and whether

2118
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:49,760
colonies do

2119
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,920
but not nest mates and nest mates but

2120
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,119
not colonies or

2121
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:55,920
ecosystems but not colonies just let's

2122
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:56,319
be

2123
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:58,480
open-minded so let's answer questions in

2124
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,520
the affirmative

2125
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:02,559
and be open-minded let's have yes and

2126
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:04,559
and let's accomplish yes and with

2127
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:07,359
everyone's participation

2128
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:09,760
the abstract begins with saying we

2129
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,440
summarize our recently introduced

2130
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,039
projective consciousness model

2131
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:15,119
and relate it to outstanding conceptual

2132
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:18,400
issues in the theory of consciousness

2133
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,400
the pcm combines a projective

2134
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,480
geometrical model of the perspectival

2135
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,400
phenomenological structure of the field

2136
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,359
of consciousness

2137
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:27,119
with a variational free energy

2138
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:29,760
minimization model of active inference

2139
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,440
yielding an account of the cybernetic

2140
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,200
function of consciousness vis the

2141
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,119
modulation of the field's cognitive and

2142
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:36,799
affective dynamics for the effective

2143
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:39,119
control of embodied agents

2144
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:42,240
long sentence double double points for

2145
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:46,319
using uh affect and effect

2146
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:49,920
long sentences but slow it down unpack

2147
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:50,640
it

2148
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:51,920
i think that we've gone through the

2149
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,160
keywords well enough at least

2150
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:56,240
a first pass to show you why it would be

2151
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,720
great to connect across all these areas

2152
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:01,760
abstract part two the geometrical and

2153
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,680
active inference components are linked

2154
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,359
via the concept of projective

2155
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:06,400
transformation

2156
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,240
which is crucial to understanding how

2157
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,640
conscious organisms integrate

2158
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:14,079
perception emotion memory reasoning

2159
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:17,039
and perspectival imagination in order to

2160
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:18,000
control

2161
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,720
behavior enhance resilience and optimize

2162
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,400
preference satisfaction

2163
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,520
so sounds cool the pcm makes

2164
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,440
substantiative empirical predictions

2165
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,680
we'll see about that and fits well into

2166
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,520
a neural computationalist framework of

2167
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,880
course it does

2168
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,960
it also helps us to account for aspects

2169
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,160
of subjective character that are

2170
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,920
sometimes ignored or conflated

2171
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,920
pre-reflective self-consciousness the

2172
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,520
first person point of view

2173
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,599
the sense of mindness or ownership and

2174
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:46,160
social self-consciousness

2175
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:48,559
close the abstract with saying we argue

2176
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:49,520
that the pcm

2177
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,920
though still in development offers us

2178
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,920
the most complete theory today

2179
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,079
of what thomas metzinger has called

2180
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:57,520
phenomenal selfhood

2181
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:00,880
now i don't know medslingers work

2182
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,119
incredibly well or what this topic

2183
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:04,160
bridges out to

2184
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,520
kind of an interesting way to end the

2185
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,520
abstract but so it goes

2186
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,440
um that's what we might be getting to

2187
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,119
how are the authors going to

2188
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:12,880
get from all of these keywords like

2189
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,640
cybernetics and geometry

2190
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,520
to getting to potentially the most

2191
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,440
developed framework to date in their

2192
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,160
opinion

2193
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,960
of what is called phenomenal selfhood so

2194
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,960
phenomenology experience selfhood

2195
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:28,480
having a self well they start in section

2196
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:29,520
one with the introduction

2197
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,520
and go pretty directly to section two

2198
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,280
methodology i think this is great

2199
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,319
because it really gets

2200
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:36,319
into the details quickly you could

2201
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,160
philosophize for a thousand books

2202
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,880
people have so what's the methodology

2203
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,319
how can i identify

2204
01:07:42,319 --> 01:07:44,480
what you're actually doing in this paper

2205
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,160
as a researcher

2206
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,240
without hearing 30 pages about your

2207
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,760
understanding of what descartes did or

2208
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,760
didn't say

2209
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,119
three they're going to talk about

2210
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:54,640
phenomenological invariance and the

2211
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,000
functional features of consciousness

2212
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,520
which are also we're going to go into

2213
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,920
them later and they talk about the

2214
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:00,640
phenomenal

2215
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,720
logical invariants what they are the

2216
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,240
five of them we'll go through them

2217
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:05,760
and then talk about how they're related

2218
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,160
to projective geometry in the pcm

2219
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,520
so basically they're going to start with

2220
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,520
their invariance and if you have a qualm

2221
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,039
with an invariant you want a sixth one

2222
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:14,319
you want to collapse to four

2223
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:16,399
great let's write another paper but

2224
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:17,279
they're going to start with these

2225
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,560
invariant features

2226
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,319
and then they're going to introduce that

2227
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:22,000
plus projective geometry

2228
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,319
to say projective geometry is the bridge

2229
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:25,120
we're gonna take

2230
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:28,158
to get these five invariant features we

2231
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:30,080
see figure one which has an account in

2232
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,238
the pcm model of psychological phenomena

2233
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:33,359
in figure two

2234
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,439
which shows projective geometry in

2235
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:36,799
relationship to the necker

2236
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:38,319
cube which is like kind of a cool

2237
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:39,920
illusion that i'm looking forward to

2238
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,279
showing you

2239
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:42,799
then they go to the five functional

2240
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:44,479
features of consciousness which are also

2241
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:45,679
what we're going to

2242
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:48,799
address and they talk about the

2243
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:50,238
projective consciousness model

2244
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:52,319
which is remember the phenomenological

2245
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:54,479
invariance plus projective geometry

2246
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:57,439
equals part of the pcm now we're going

2247
01:08:57,439 --> 01:08:58,560
to talk about

2248
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:01,040
the pcm and the functional features of

2249
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:02,319
consciousness the functional

2250
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:04,080
cybernetic functions that they talked

2251
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,439
about earlier

2252
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:08,880
and fuse that in the capacity of using

2253
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,319
active inference and free energy

2254
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:11,839
minimization to get some of these

2255
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:13,359
functional dynamics

2256
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:15,359
then they'll show figure 3 a simplified

2257
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:17,120
2d print

2258
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,880
projective consciousness model based

2259
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:21,198
simulation of a pit challenge

2260
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:23,279
and then figure four give a overall

2261
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:24,880
sketch of the projective consciousness

2262
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:27,199
model

2263
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:29,439
in section four they talk about the hard

2264
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:31,279
problem of consciousness

2265
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:33,040
representationalism and phenomenal

2266
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:35,040
selfhood the hard problem

2267
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:37,359
and computational functionalism is um

2268
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:39,040
variously phrased by

2269
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,359
uh professor chalmers and others as

2270
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:43,040
basically being about what the substrate

2271
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:44,319
of consciousness is

2272
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:46,319
why is it that when you hit your hand it

2273
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:48,238
hurts but when you hit some brain

2274
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:48,880
regions

2275
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,560
uh it doesn't hurt and when you hit some

2276
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,000
other brain regions you just

2277
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,238
pass out you come back or you die or

2278
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:55,520
something in between

2279
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,840
how is that happening in the brain or is

2280
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,000
it an antenna is it a generator

2281
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,280
these are the questions then they

2282
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,520
go from the computational functionalism

2283
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:07,360
to talking about the pcm and

2284
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,440
representationalism now all these terms

2285
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,920
computation function and representation

2286
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,040
are pretty loaded

2287
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,480
we've gone into them on a couple of

2288
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,560
other discussions but

2289
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,560
be open-minded as to how they could

2290
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:19,600
recombine

2291
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,239
in the context of pcm and then they're

2292
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:23,600
going to take those kind of

2293
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:26,080
more quantitative terms computation

2294
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:26,800
function

2295
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,880
representation representation is a

2296
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,080
little bit of a bridge and they're going

2297
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:30,960
to bring that

2298
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,840
into the projective consciousness models

2299
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,760
phenomenological components

2300
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,280
so that's going to be about subjective

2301
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:38,960
character subjective character being

2302
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:40,719
what it is-ness the what is it about to

2303
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:42,480
be a bad

2304
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:45,280
and also the phenomenal selfhood of the

2305
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:46,880
philosopher that they concluded with

2306
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,480
discussing in their abstract

2307
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:51,840
and then they conclude so looks like a

2308
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,199
great roadmap

2309
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:55,679
let's in this introductory video in the

2310
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:58,320
um time that i've left here

2311
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,239
let's go through the functional features

2312
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:01,440
and the invariances

2313
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:02,800
of consciousness because we're not going

2314
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,199
to have time to go through them in 9.1

2315
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:06,159
or 9.2

2316
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:07,920
with all of you contributing your

2317
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,080
perspectives and it's good to get them

2318
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,520
out here because these are kind of like

2319
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:13,440
the big five for the functions and the

2320
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,199
big five for the invariances

2321
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:17,040
and if you have a qualm with the model

2322
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,440
you should first ask is there a function

2323
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,840
or is there an invariant that i think is

2324
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,040
extraneous

2325
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,560
um is there one that i think is missing

2326
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:25,840
is there one that i think is just off

2327
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:26,400
base

2328
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:29,040
so if you have a question about one of

2329
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:29,840
these five

2330
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,600
things you think this doesn't go far

2331
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,280
enough or this goes too far or

2332
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:34,800
but some conscious systems don't have

2333
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,960
that great that's the question you want

2334
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:37,840
to ask

2335
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,840
so there's five in each category if you

2336
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,280
think there should be more or less or a

2337
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:42,159
different one

2338
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:44,800
that's one entry point now if you agree

2339
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:45,520
with all them

2340
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:46,800
and you say yep those are the perfect

2341
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,280
five in each category then

2342
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:52,560
you can evaluate given what projective

2343
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,080
geometry is and what the pcm

2344
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,880
is do they address the functional and

2345
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:57,199
the

2346
01:11:57,199 --> 01:12:00,480
um uh experiential invariance

2347
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,960
of consciousness so that's how we're

2348
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,320
going to read this paper

2349
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,679
and that's where i hope there's a lot of

2350
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:08,080
footholds for people who

2351
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:09,679
maybe have thought about consciousness

2352
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:11,360
but this is a new way to hear about it

2353
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,159
for them

2354
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:14,960
it would be great to have their comments

2355
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:16,159
what are the five

2356
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:17,600
functional features of consciousness

2357
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,080
according to the authors

2358
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,159
and the way that they sort of justify

2359
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:23,520
this is by saying

2360
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,920
um we claim that the overall function of

2361
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:26,960
consciousness

2362
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,040
is to address a general cybernetic

2363
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,880
problem or problem of control

2364
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:33,040
control theory consciousness enables a

2365
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,960
situated organism with multiple sensory

2366
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,640
channels to navigate its environment and

2367
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,719
satisfy its biological and derived needs

2368
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:39,520
efficiently

2369
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,199
this entails minimizing predictively

2370
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:42,800
erroneous representations of the world

2371
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:45,120
and maximizing preference satisfaction

2372
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,560
a good model of consciousness must be

2373
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,080
able to explain how this is accomplished

2374
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:49,040
the pcm thus

2375
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,800
emphasizes the following interrelated

2376
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,400
functional features of consciousness

2377
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,320
here's why i paused before putting it up

2378
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:56,000
but after justifying it

2379
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,239
because even things that do control

2380
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:00,719
theory might not have consciousness

2381
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:03,040
full stop that's the whole thing that i

2382
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,560
was getting into with the ant colony

2383
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:05,040
test

2384
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:09,199
is okay so then if i have a robot

2385
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:10,480
and it has something that allows it to

2386
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,719
do multimodal integration across

2387
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:14,640
sensors with a generative model with a

2388
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,480
deep with a counter factual whatever it

2389
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:17,040
is

2390
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,239
does it have consciousness and then

2391
01:13:18,239 --> 01:13:19,840
that's where the person goes oh it needs

2392
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:20,560
a brain

2393
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:21,920
and so then they go down the rabbit hole

2394
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,920
a different way so the function is

2395
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:24,880
important but

2396
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,560
again it's not the whole story

2397
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:27,920
especially yet

2398
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,679
here are what they characterize as the

2399
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:31,840
five functional cybernetic features of

2400
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,440
consciousness that we'd want to at least

2401
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:34,159
explain

2402
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:36,719
so maybe just passing these five is

2403
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:38,320
necessary but it's not sufficient

2404
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:40,800
but it's important one global

2405
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,719
optimization and resilience

2406
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:43,920
consciousness helps the organism

2407
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,520
reliably find the globally optimal

2408
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:46,880
solutions available to it given

2409
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,000
competing preferences

2410
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
knowledge base capacities and context

2411
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
making the organism more resilient

2412
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,440
this is a mechanism of global or

2413
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,360
subjective here in the sense of

2414
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,199
subjective bayesian optimization

2415
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:58,880
which does not always obtain objective

2416
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,560
optimality though it must approximate

2417
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:02,080
the ladder reliably enough

2418
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,960
uh or you die if you don't objectively

2419
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:05,679
enough

2420
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:07,280
figure out how to walk down a staircase

2421
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,400
you're not going to walk down many

2422
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:09,280
staircases

2423
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:11,520
now a few things on this first many

2424
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,120
people think consciousness is epi

2425
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:13,760
phenomenal

2426
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:14,880
so whatever is happening in our

2427
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:17,840
awareness is not going back to guide

2428
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,000
so this plays a little fast and loose

2429
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,280
because it's saying well consciousness

2430
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:23,920
helps the organism reliably find

2431
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,360
it sounds like consciousness is coming

2432
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,040
back and this is the whole cartesian

2433
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:27,760
dualism

2434
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,640
paradigm is like i know that carl

2435
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:31,840
firsten and others have many more

2436
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:32,719
nuanced works

2437
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:34,480
including i think therefore i am related

2438
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:35,840
works so i'm not

2439
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,840
gonna go into it but it's like if

2440
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,280
consciousness is something that reaches

2441
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:39,679
back

2442
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:42,640
into the physical how is that or if

2443
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,400
consciousness is purely a descriptive

2444
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,679
epi-phenomenal

2445
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:48,239
epiphenomena above the phenomena of

2446
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:49,520
mechanistically or

2447
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,760
um materially defined components like

2448
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,440
neurons message passing whatever it has

2449
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:53,840
to be

2450
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,080
ants no matter how emergent their

2451
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:56,880
properties are

2452
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,280
in the weak emergent sense do they ever

2453
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:01,280
amount to strong emergence and actually

2454
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:04,480
cause the system even the downward

2455
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:05,440
causation

2456
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,040
and causal entropy and the

2457
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,640
renormalization group

2458
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:10,480
that still is a very philosophically

2459
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:11,920
agnostic with respect to whether it's

2460
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:12,800
causal

2461
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,760
so another thing to say here is that

2462
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,760
global optimization

2463
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,440
given the preferences knowledge base

2464
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,440
capacities affordances and context

2465
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:23,360
so so it's not global optimization so

2466
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:24,960
it's local optimization

2467
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,199
or it's global exploration of a

2468
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:28,640
conditional space

2469
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,480
conditional upon the things that we want

2470
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,400
it to be conditional on

2471
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:35,920
like how far you can reach but then

2472
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,760
i don't know about you all but my

2473
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,360
consciousness doesn't always help me get

2474
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,360
to the globally optimal points

2475
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:44,480
unless that global optimum is defined

2476
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:47,280
as this not objectively best space of

2477
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:47,920
like

2478
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:50,480
well you just didn't go the right way

2479
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,320
but it seemed optimal given what you

2480
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:52,719
knew

2481
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:55,600
it's like okay and then okay and it has

2482
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:56,560
to be reliable enough

2483
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:59,920
so i'm on board two global availability

2484
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,360
the contents of consciousness must be

2485
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:02,800
generally globally available in the

2486
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,000
sense of poised

2487
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,199
to be treated of by our effective

2488
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:09,040
cognitive and perceptual systems as the

2489
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,320
occasion requires

2490
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:13,199
so for example you know here's idea one

2491
01:16:13,199 --> 01:16:14,000
idea two

2492
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,080
memory four the color you know the

2493
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:17,520
number all these things are just

2494
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:20,560
apparently one layer away from accessing

2495
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,320
the workspace this is drawing heavily on

2496
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:23,920
the global workspace theory attention

2497
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:24,640
schema

2498
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:27,360
modeling of some other researchers i

2499
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,960
would just point out global doesn't

2500
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,480
make sense to me the brain isn't the

2501
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,400
globe cognition isn't the globe

2502
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,560
availability it's like yes but then

2503
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,640
again you define available as like

2504
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,159
i knew it yesterday but i don't know it

2505
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:40,159
now so it's not available

2506
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:41,920
um or what if it's part of my extended

2507
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,600
cognitive process and it just takes me

2508
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:44,960
five minutes to find it

2509
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:49,040
so okay relevant but globally available

2510
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:52,239
um and also our awareness is

2511
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:54,239
hardly the tip of the iceberg um or

2512
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:55,440
maybe it's

2513
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:58,000
a whole iceberg and a half so i wouldn't

2514
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,040
even know what it would mean to be

2515
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,120
globally available

2516
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:02,960
motivation of action and modulation of

2517
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,400
attention

2518
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,640
attention scheme of theory consciousness

2519
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,000
is generally implicated in the

2520
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,280
motivation of action

2521
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:11,440
based upon affective dynamics and memory

2522
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,440
this drives the modulation of attention

2523
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:14,719
though consciousness is not to be

2524
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:16,400
narrowly identified with attention so

2525
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:17,679
that's kind of attention scheme of

2526
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:18,800
theory breaking upwards

2527
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,199
out of the just um like lstm like a

2528
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:22,800
neural network that has an intentional

2529
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,880
parameter we want to go into the

2530
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,159
experiential dimension

2531
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:28,000
not just the oh well it's a laser that

2532
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,440
spends a lot of its time here

2533
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:31,360
or um you know it's a camera that auto

2534
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:33,120
focuses on this level

2535
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:36,239
we want to go beyond that and say um

2536
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:38,239
whether or not it is getting input like

2537
01:17:38,239 --> 01:17:40,560
a camera in some of its sensory organs

2538
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,520
the experience is somehow generated but

2539
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:44,960
i'd also point to this motivation of

2540
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,199
action and modulation of attention

2541
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:49,040
it's very very important these are

2542
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,960
phrased as if consciousness

2543
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:53,120
functionally functions of consciousness

2544
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:54,000
right

2545
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,440
motivates action and modulates attention

2546
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:59,440
or it could be epiphenomenal

2547
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:00,560
consciousness that is

2548
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:02,320
and so it could be the experience of

2549
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,400
motivation of action and the experience

2550
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,000
of modulated attention

2551
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,480
so in that framing we made consciousness

2552
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,159
epiphenomenal and we basically said yeah

2553
01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:11,360
attention is something that happens with

2554
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:12,000
all the neurons

2555
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,440
and the firing patterns and whatnot and

2556
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:14,560
you know the drugs everything that

2557
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:15,280
happens

2558
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:17,440
and then it gets to some synergetic

2559
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:19,040
compromise where it's like looking at

2560
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,239
this thing at this time

2561
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:21,840
and then you're just experiencing it

2562
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,520
it's not simply a cartesian theater

2563
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:24,159
model

2564
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:27,199
it's still a bottom up top-down um

2565
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:30,560
situation but there's no simple outs

2566
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:31,040
here

2567
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,960
it's neither that consciousness is

2568
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:35,840
reaching back and motivating action

2569
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,280
neither is it that it's modulating

2570
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,120
attention through what dials

2571
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,960
you know show them to me oh well that's

2572
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,159
what meditation is

2573
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:43,600
yeah but then all of a sudden you're

2574
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,120
getting into this area where i think a

2575
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:45,760
lot of

2576
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,040
stuff that's not related is pretty

2577
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:49,440
important and then the fourth one oh

2578
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:50,239
whoops i said

2579
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:51,840
big five well let's just think of it as

2580
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,600
the big five the big fifth function is

2581
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,040
going to be the secret function

2582
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,360
but the fourth function is simulation

2583
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,920
enhancement maybe that gets us too

2584
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:01,520
consciousness facilitates the use of

2585
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,040
simulation in the broad sense of

2586
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:03,840
imagination

2587
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,360
not the narrow sense like simulation

2588
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:07,679
theory um but maybe that's the direction

2589
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:08,640
to go

2590
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,239
in the service of solving cognitive

2591
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:12,080
perceptual and affective problems and

2592
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,760
more generally in the anticipation

2593
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:15,280
and programming of actions and the

2594
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,880
response to their outcomes

2595
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,800
so simulation enhancement could be for

2596
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,320
example um

2597
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:23,199
i wake up and it's very dark in my room

2598
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:24,719
but i have a generative model

2599
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:27,920
um or an accessible model not um

2600
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,719
being too formal here of my room so even

2601
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:31,120
with

2602
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,679
my eyes closed or with very dim light i

2603
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:34,320
can

2604
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,159
enhance my simulation and think oh wait

2605
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:37,840
you know if i open the door this way

2606
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:38,480
it's going to

2607
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,960
wake up my roommate or if i do this at

2608
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:41,679
this time

2609
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:43,760
then down the road this is going to be a

2610
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:45,120
different sensory input that i don't

2611
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,159
want to experience

2612
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:48,880
so that kind of rich mechanistic

2613
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,159
understanding of the world

2614
01:19:50,159 --> 01:19:52,320
is what humans excel at and it's what

2615
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,000
the current machines that we deal with

2616
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,040
do not deal with

2617
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,760
well um you can ask it a question like

2618
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:58,560
could you know

2619
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:01,120
this building wear ice skates and it

2620
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:02,480
might be able to parse

2621
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,640
whether those terms mean different

2622
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,080
things and whether they're keywords used

2623
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:08,080
by the same people or not on twitter

2624
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:10,719
but will it be able to understand and

2625
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:11,760
address that question

2626
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:14,000
and that's kind of what the geb book

2627
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,520
really is fun to think about

2628
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:17,600
so again four functional features for

2629
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:18,880
consciousness

2630
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,199
should there be a fifth one are one of

2631
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:22,159
these extraneous

2632
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:23,840
do you have a different function for

2633
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:26,080
consciousness what is your understanding

2634
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:27,679
is consciousness have function

2635
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:30,000
or is consciousness something else how

2636
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,600
would it affect things if it had a

2637
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:32,320
function

2638
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:33,920
how would we measure the function what

2639
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:35,440
is dysfunction

2640
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,040
all these questions any questions that

2641
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,480
people want to have

2642
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,560
maybe be cool for people who watch it

2643
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,560
like to post questions they have and we

2644
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:43,040
can have

2645
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:45,920
a norm of just asking the questions that

2646
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:46,480
we have

2647
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:49,679
out loud because let's ask the questions

2648
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:50,480
we have

2649
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:52,000
i don't know any other way to say it

2650
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,679
right now

2651
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:55,840
the second thing that we'll talk about

2652
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:56,800
is the

2653
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,400
invariance of consciousness the

2654
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,000
phenomenological invariance and

2655
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,320
here i believe there are five so these

2656
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,040
are the things

2657
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:05,120
that are really what their model is

2658
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:06,560
going to come down to with respect to

2659
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,960
phenomenology and philosophy

2660
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:10,320
so this is what they're going to focus

2661
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,400
on this is what the mathematical model

2662
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:13,600
needs to aim for

2663
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,600
this is what their formalisms should

2664
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,040
explain predict

2665
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:20,320
integrate encompass um so this is like

2666
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:23,600
the big core philosophy idea that we

2667
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:24,400
want to do

2668
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,920
all of the math and all of the

2669
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:28,480
computational stuff to get at

2670
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:30,320
with some type of bridge the bridge is

2671
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:31,679
projective geometry

2672
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:34,080
perhaps so what does it mean to be a

2673
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:36,080
phenomenological invariant

2674
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:39,360
and they write the following are the

2675
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:39,920
deeply

2676
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:42,000
interconnected invariants that we think

2677
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,440
characterize consciousness

2678
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,199
we take them as postulates for

2679
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:46,639
mathematical treatment

2680
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:48,639
citation that you could follow up on and

2681
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:51,199
construct the pcm on their basis

2682
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:53,199
so it's kind of like axioms like they're

2683
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:54,880
taking these as like root statements

2684
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,639
that kind of don't need to be justified

2685
01:21:56,639 --> 01:21:58,320
they're kind of like observations

2686
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,159
but of course this is something that we

2687
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:01,760
all want to know is

2688
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,440
could there be another one could one of

2689
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:04,800
these be redundant what if you have four

2690
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,080
out of five do you get 80

2691
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:08,239
on consciousness or what if we figure

2692
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:10,320
out or imagine a system that has a

2693
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,480
three out of five is it you know what

2694
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:14,080
does that mean for that system

2695
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:15,520
what are these phenomenological

2696
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,679
invariants one

2697
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:20,960
relational phenomenal intentionality

2698
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:23,199
so break it down by the words all

2699
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:24,880
consciousness involves the appearance of

2700
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:25,920
a world

2701
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,080
of objects properties etc in various

2702
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:30,239
qualitative or representational worlds

2703
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:33,199
representational ways to an organism so

2704
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:33,920
again

2705
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,520
they're not thinking too much about

2706
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:37,520
worms and fruit flies and ants and ant

2707
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,280
colonies maybe they are i'd love to hear

2708
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:40,159
it from an author

2709
01:22:40,159 --> 01:22:42,800
or from a colleague if they are but um

2710
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,480
these are the debates that we're having

2711
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:46,639
which is like right if you observe the

2712
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:48,480
worm moving away from the gradients

2713
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,880
as if it had a representational

2714
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,800
relational phenomenal

2715
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:56,639
intentionality is that evidence enough

2716
01:22:56,639 --> 01:23:00,239
and that's the question two situated

2717
01:23:00,239 --> 01:23:02,400
three-dimensional spatiality of course

2718
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:03,840
also there's time sometimes called the

2719
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:04,960
fourth dimension

2720
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,480
the space the presented world like

2721
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,159
objects or etc

2722
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:11,679
is three-dimensional again big asterisk

2723
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:13,920
and perspectival unfolding in an

2724
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:15,920
oriented manner between a point of view

2725
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:18,159
and a horizon at infinity where all

2726
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:20,480
parallel lines converge

2727
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:21,920
the origin of this point of view is

2728
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:24,159
elusive though normally it seems to be

2729
01:23:24,159 --> 01:23:25,679
located in the head

2730
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:27,840
the space is normally organized around

2731
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,920
the lived body so this is like

2732
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,560
bringing us to embodiment to inactivism

2733
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:34,560
to ecological psychology

2734
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,800
to intercultural and developmental

2735
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:37,760
psychology

2736
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:41,120
to um ken wilbur's integral theory

2737
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:43,440
also connecting us to lived experience

2738
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:44,880
and to spatiality

2739
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,440
and to the ways that the spaces that we

2740
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,239
live in

2741
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:51,280
influence who and how we are so all of

2742
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:53,600
the awesome active stream participants

2743
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,520
who have taught us so much about

2744
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,719
embedded systems

2745
01:23:56,719 --> 01:23:59,440
and embodiment we'd really love to hear

2746
01:23:59,440 --> 01:23:59,920
what

2747
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:03,360
is work in this area that impinges

2748
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:06,560
on one of these invariants

2749
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,960
multimodal synchronic integration

2750
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:12,000
synchronic means at the same time

2751
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
consciousness involves the synthesis or

2752
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,920
integration into a unified whole of a

2753
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,520
multiplicity of qualitative and

2754
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,840
representational components from sensory

2755
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,320
modalities memory and cognition so

2756
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:23,199
diachronic

2757
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:25,360
means at a different time synchronic at

2758
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:26,239
the same time

2759
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:29,040
so memory is diachronic but it's of

2760
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,400
sensory modalities

2761
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,560
so it could be a hearing event from six

2762
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:33,520
months ago

2763
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:34,960
um maybe you know and there's the whole

2764
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:37,199
question of imagination obviously big

2765
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:40,159
question but just to a first pass um

2766
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:42,159
events from the past that influence us

2767
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:45,440
in the future are diachronic or another

2768
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,800
way to think about it is they modify the

2769
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,239
system or they put it onto a different

2770
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:49,120
trajectory

2771
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,560
that's different than if that

2772
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,159
difference-making cause to use the

2773
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:53,280
waters terminology

2774
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:56,000
hadn't occurred consciousness seems to

2775
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,199
be both diacronic

2776
01:24:57,199 --> 01:24:59,360
and synchronic like when we're listening

2777
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,760
to music and seeing flashing lights

2778
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:03,920
there's like synchronization in the same

2779
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:06,320
moment that's also multi-sensory

2780
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:07,840
but there's some really interesting work

2781
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:09,600
about the time durations of different

2782
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,040
kinds of experience

2783
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,360
so clearly something is happening there

2784
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:15,199
with sight and sound

2785
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:17,120
and just people who are born with or

2786
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:18,320
without hearing and

2787
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:20,880
born with or without sight all these

2788
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,880
different people can navigate in the

2789
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:23,760
same world

2790
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,080
so that says something about sight you

2791
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:27,040
know it's not just

2792
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:29,040
us watching a projector if there's

2793
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:31,120
people who can navigate without sight

2794
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:32,560
so that's kind of what they want to

2795
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:34,480
bring it back to four

2796
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:36,400
temporal integration which i just hinted

2797
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,920
at before but this is a little deeper

2798
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,199
level

2799
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:40,719
consciousness involves at least the

2800
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:42,159
retention of immediately past

2801
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:42,800
experiences

2802
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,719
and pretension of immediately future

2803
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:47,120
experiences as integral elements of its

2804
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:50,800
species present the uh ever present now

2805
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,800
as it were and the foundation for more

2806
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:54,639
expansive forms of temporal integration

2807
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:56,320
such as distant memories and long-term

2808
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:57,440
planning

2809
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,920
distant past distant future now just to

2810
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:01,760
give one kind of funny note

2811
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,199
when i was reading this i thought what

2812
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:05,440
is protection what does it mean in this

2813
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:06,639
context

2814
01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:08,800
so according to google protection is a

2815
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,320
philosophy word

2816
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:12,800
that means anticipation of a future

2817
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:13,840
event

2818
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:16,000
so i dug a little deeper into the

2819
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,280
merriam-webster

2820
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:21,199
definition of protent p-r-o-t-e-n-t

2821
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:24,400
tent like a professionally set up tent

2822
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,719
it's an archaic transitive verb meaning

2823
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:27,440
to stretch

2824
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:30,960
forth or to extend now

2825
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:33,920
nowadays one might hear about portending

2826
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:34,880
future events

2827
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:38,239
not protecting them um and the words

2828
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:39,600
actually have different meanings

2829
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:42,719
so to pretend p o r t e n d

2830
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:46,159
por tend is to um convey something

2831
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:47,840
through like a symbol or an omen

2832
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:50,880
like the the owl pretended difficult

2833
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,960
times or something like that

2834
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:56,320
but um portenting is something that the

2835
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:57,120
agent does

2836
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:00,320
in response to the symbol so um upon

2837
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:01,440
seeing the owl

2838
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,679
you know the farmer decide portented

2839
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:05,600
that this was going to occur

2840
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,199
and so i would just kind of bring up

2841
01:27:07,199 --> 01:27:09,120
this idea that maybe they're so similar

2842
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:10,800
sounding and they're so kind of close in

2843
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,159
their word usage

2844
01:27:12,159 --> 01:27:14,239
that the english language just couldn't

2845
01:27:14,239 --> 01:27:15,360
tolerate

2846
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:17,920
um that much ambiguity because

2847
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:19,760
portenting and portending they sound

2848
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:21,760
like 99 identical

2849
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:24,320
and so then maybe portending took

2850
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:26,480
popularity over protent

2851
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:28,560
because it removes agency from the actor

2852
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:30,560
and so it's one way to remove action

2853
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,520
from language

2854
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:35,040
and so now protecting or portenting

2855
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:37,440
it's now a philosophy word it's archaic

2856
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:38,639
it's an old word

2857
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:40,400
because we can't have action in speech

2858
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:42,080
right no but

2859
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:44,080
non-ironically it is really interesting

2860
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:45,440
to think about how these words change in

2861
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:46,320
meaning and

2862
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,159
the more action we can embed in our

2863
01:27:48,159 --> 01:27:49,920
speech patterns and our interaction

2864
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:52,400
patterns the better

2865
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,960
subjective character so subjective

2866
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:56,719
character is defined by the authors

2867
01:27:56,719 --> 01:27:58,639
as involving a pre-reflective

2868
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:00,000
non-conceptual awareness

2869
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,800
of oneself and their individuality now

2870
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,480
one could be totally off base

2871
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:06,159
so they can be wrong is that part of

2872
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:07,440
consciousness to be wrong about your

2873
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:09,040
individuality or is it just that you're

2874
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:11,199
having an individuality

2875
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:13,199
hard to say but the authors have it as

2876
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:14,560
an invariant

2877
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:17,840
they write also that two to five are

2878
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:21,600
in fact implicated in one so relational

2879
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:24,800
phenomenal intentionality is really the

2880
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:28,320
most important key invariant so that's

2881
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:30,400
the relational thinking and that's why

2882
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,480
i feel like the active inference and

2883
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:34,239
free energy principle communities

2884
01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:36,800
are very adjacent to complexity thinking

2885
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,239
to systems thinking

2886
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:41,199
relational thinking design thinking as

2887
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:42,159
well as

2888
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:44,960
team collaboration frameworks because so

2889
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:46,000
many of these

2890
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,920
social work and team relation frameworks

2891
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:49,760
as well as other types of thinking

2892
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:51,040
including complexity

2893
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:52,880
they all deal with this relational

2894
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:54,960
insight so there's so much to learn

2895
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:58,000
and to do here and to understand about

2896
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,920
what are the implications of relational

2897
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:01,760
thinking on consciousness

2898
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:04,239
on our own experience if not on actually

2899
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:06,719
making claims about consciousness

2900
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:09,120
cool let's just kind of close out by

2901
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,120
going through and looking briefly at a

2902
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:12,800
few of the figures and just

2903
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:15,199
what they're about take a 30 000 foot

2904
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:16,960
view so that when you're reading through

2905
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:18,080
the paper

2906
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,360
you kind of know where you're coming

2907
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,520
from so figure one

2908
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:24,880
has um a b or and c and um

2909
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:28,080
a is a projective solution to a

2910
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:30,960
vr mediated disassociation in phenomenal

2911
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:31,520
selfhood

2912
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:34,480
so this is kind of like um from the

2913
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,719
experience of uh the euclidean

2914
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:38,320
view like that we're looking at

2915
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:39,760
minecraft here

2916
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:42,560
and then the person their head is in

2917
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:43,520
this like block

2918
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:45,840
in the lived space in the right side of

2919
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,280
figure a

2920
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:49,440
and um but they're imagining the space

2921
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,679
as if it were on the left side of a

2922
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:54,480
so i can imagine my office right now in

2923
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,159
terms of the right angles again

2924
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:57,760
even when i look out i don't see right

2925
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,520
angles if i were to

2926
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:01,360
combine like this and i look back down

2927
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:02,719
and look at the angle that the room was

2928
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:03,440
just making

2929
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:06,480
it's a 90 degree angle but it looks

2930
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:08,080
normal within my generative

2931
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:10,639
and usually verified experience that it

2932
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:11,840
is 90 degrees

2933
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:15,280
because why projective geometry so

2934
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:17,360
what do we have to do well it turns out

2935
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:19,040
to add in this element of the visual

2936
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:20,960
field in the projective geometry

2937
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:24,239
in b we're going to show this like sort

2938
01:30:24,239 --> 01:30:24,880
of

2939
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:26,800
they call it an anti-space beyond the

2940
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,400
plane i'm not even gonna

2941
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:30,480
go into what that may or may not be

2942
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:31,760
because i don't want to um

2943
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,520
go down too deep but it's kind of like

2944
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:35,040
there's some mapping

2945
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:37,440
reflected in b and c what they call

2946
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,280
god's eye vantage point

2947
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:42,239
there's certain mappings from b and c

2948
01:30:42,239 --> 01:30:43,520
just like there's a mapping

2949
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:46,000
between the understanding that i'm in a

2950
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,600
euclidean office

2951
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:50,239
and then my lived experience where

2952
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:52,880
apparently wherever my eyes are

2953
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:54,719
or something like that right a little

2954
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:56,000
bit behind there a little in front of

2955
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:56,800
there

2956
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:01,040
um how are we going to square the circle

2957
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:03,280
almost literally with the generative

2958
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:04,880
model of the euclidean office

2959
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,800
with my lived experience of the wacky

2960
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:07,920
angles

2961
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:09,920
and what's interesting here is the

2962
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:11,520
visual focus

2963
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:13,280
and so where are all of these different

2964
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,960
centers is this kind of related to like

2965
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,080
what if we feel like our emotional

2966
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:17,120
center is somewhere

2967
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:20,159
else in our body or what if we um have

2968
01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:20,960
the experience

2969
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:23,520
of not just a simple outer body like

2970
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,280
floating above your body looking down

2971
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:27,840
but more expansive experiences so we'd

2972
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:30,480
love to go into that phenomenology with

2973
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:33,120
someone potentially from alias or any

2974
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:34,480
other colleague

2975
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:37,520
um and so there's certain mappings just

2976
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:39,120
like euclidean to non-euclidean office

2977
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:39,920
there's this like

2978
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:43,120
god's eye mapping you can evaluate for

2979
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:44,400
yourself whether you think that's god's

2980
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:45,280
eye

2981
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:48,400
figure two is a projective solution to

2982
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:49,600
the neck or cube

2983
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,679
and so here's what's happening in this

2984
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:53,440
image on the left side

2985
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:56,480
is like two versions of the so-called

2986
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:59,760
necker cube illusion so it's a cube

2987
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:02,400
visual illusion and it turns out it's

2988
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:03,199
illusion

2989
01:32:03,199 --> 01:32:06,080
first off just looking at these two for

2990
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:07,679
one or for both just ask yourself

2991
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:09,600
do i see them as um

2992
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,800
[Music]

2993
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,440
how should i even say this the biggest

2994
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,000
side

2995
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,880
that's close to you is it on the top

2996
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:17,600
left

2997
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:20,320
of each square or is it on the bottom

2998
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:21,840
right

2999
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:24,960
and you can flip sometimes some people

3000
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,320
different people in different ways

3001
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:28,639
can flip in their mind seeing it as if

3002
01:32:28,639 --> 01:32:30,320
the biggest side of the box

3003
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:33,360
were coming down to the right or

3004
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:34,880
whether the biggest part of the box is

3005
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:36,639
kind of going up into the left

3006
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:39,760
okay now here is why they

3007
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:42,800
are suggesting that this um visual

3008
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:45,760
illusion exists because there's no

3009
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,280
perspectival cues

3010
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:49,520
we're looking into a projection on a

3011
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,840
flat plane

3012
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:54,880
and so there's sort of like two optimal

3013
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:55,920
solutions

3014
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:58,639
to the perspectival question and so

3015
01:32:58,639 --> 01:32:59,520
because there's two

3016
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:02,000
such similar um evidence competing

3017
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:02,800
models

3018
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:05,199
free energy minimizing models it's b

3019
01:33:05,199 --> 01:33:06,159
it's not

3020
01:33:06,159 --> 01:33:07,520
they say it's undecidable free

3021
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:09,520
energy-based inference which is to say

3022
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:12,320
that in our optimization perception we

3023
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,000
continue just oscillating it's like

3024
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,719
you know it's the old woman it's the

3025
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:17,440
young woman

3026
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:19,440
it's the old woman it's the young woman

3027
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:21,120
okay that's a visual illusion

3028
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:22,560
but this is one that has to do with

3029
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,400
projective geometry

3030
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:27,199
where it's like it's coming towards me

3031
01:33:27,199 --> 01:33:28,719
like but i'm getting sensory evidence

3032
01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:29,840
that's going that way

3033
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:32,719
in a different simulated frame and then

3034
01:33:32,719 --> 01:33:34,159
you perceive it that way now it's top

3035
01:33:34,159 --> 01:33:35,600
down so it's like this um

3036
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:37,280
back and forth resonance and there's a

3037
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:39,280
lot of interesting research on this

3038
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:41,840
what breaks the symmetry quite literally

3039
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:42,800
and the answer is

3040
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:44,560
lived experience from the point of view

3041
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:46,400
simulation so here

3042
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:49,120
if i'm closer to one side of the square

3043
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:50,560
i don't have any little squares to pick

3044
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:51,040
up

3045
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:54,960
but it resolves it not absolutely you

3046
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,800
still know that square has a different

3047
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,960
side or the cube has a different side

3048
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:00,560
and you can even imagine what it might

3049
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:02,800
look like like oh i'm seeing the six

3050
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:05,120
is the on the die it's closest to me if

3051
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:07,120
i were on the other side i would see a

3052
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:08,000
one

3053
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,760
and it would look bigger and i wouldn't

3054
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:11,520
be able to see the six

3055
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:14,080
but where i'm at i just see a big

3056
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:16,000
rectangle six or something like that

3057
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,280
and so that kind of captures a lot of

3058
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:18,880
these aspects of the geometry of

3059
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:19,840
consciousness

3060
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:21,360
where you can simulate being in

3061
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:22,880
different places but you're always

3062
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:26,400
in a certain spot visualizing it what is

3063
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,080
that spot that's the privilege point of

3064
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:30,080
view that's the point of reference

3065
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:32,159
what about it is special well it's like

3066
01:34:32,159 --> 01:34:33,520
a non-arbitrary point

3067
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:35,760
in a projective geometry what kind of

3068
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:37,199
projective geometry

3069
01:34:37,199 --> 01:34:39,440
well something that takes our allegedly

3070
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:40,880
euclidean world

3071
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:43,760
and maps it into this like vanishing

3072
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:44,840
point

3073
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:47,679
experience i think i got some of the

3074
01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:48,560
main

3075
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:50,960
uh threads to link there but that's kind

3076
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:52,000
of what they're

3077
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,159
suggesting and free energy is going to

3078
01:34:54,159 --> 01:34:55,520
be the optimization

3079
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:58,960
and action and inference paradigm within

3080
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:01,840
a simulation broadly construed

3081
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:02,960
understanding

3082
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:06,239
about how symmetry is broken

3083
01:35:06,239 --> 01:35:09,920
in terms of experience so big stuff

3084
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:12,159
interesting topics you know to be

3085
01:35:12,159 --> 01:35:14,320
wanting to address this is

3086
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:17,360
big by the authors

3087
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:21,360
figure 3 is a pcn based simulation of a

3088
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:22,880
pit challenge and on the very bottom

3089
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,080
you'll see this is like from another

3090
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:24,560
paper

3091
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:25,679
so if you're curious about this

3092
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:27,600
simulation definitely go

3093
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,480
check out the other paper that they

3094
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:31,360
reference but

3095
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:34,480
what we can look at here is um starting

3096
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:35,520
on the left side

3097
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:38,080
so there's like a bunch of barbell

3098
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:39,040
shapes

3099
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:42,719
and basically the barbell uh has to do

3100
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:44,320
with it's like a map they can walk

3101
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:46,000
around in so they can wander around but

3102
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,600
they kind of have to make it across

3103
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:49,760
this pit to get to like a rewarding

3104
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,440
place

3105
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:54,800
so there's an anhedonic uh in a safe

3106
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:57,280
space a challenge room and a goal room i

3107
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:59,199
believe is what they call them

3108
01:35:59,199 --> 01:36:01,119
and then they're going to be thinking

3109
01:36:01,119 --> 01:36:02,480
about that that

3110
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:05,600
moving circle like let's see if i can do

3111
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:08,000
this there you go this moving circle

3112
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,639
is like the agent moving through the map

3113
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:11,119
here's

3114
01:36:11,119 --> 01:36:12,800
its expectations and where its prior

3115
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:15,520
beliefs are and then here is it

3116
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,480
resolving its uncertainty in a it's kind

3117
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:20,719
of like looks like a radar dial

3118
01:36:20,719 --> 01:36:22,880
but that white spot in the middle is

3119
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:24,239
like the

3120
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:27,679
the non-arbitrary origin that's like the

3121
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:30,960
consciousness zone and so from the pov

3122
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:34,400
point of view of this organism

3123
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:36,960
in its foc it's field of consciousness

3124
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:39,360
which is like some geometry mapping

3125
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:42,800
from the um experienced space

3126
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:45,760
into its generative model it's

3127
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:47,440
navigating that mapping

3128
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:50,480
somehow through consciousness and then

3129
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:52,480
that's also able to bear

3130
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,639
on the difference between like having a

3131
01:36:54,639 --> 01:36:56,400
weaker imagination

3132
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,480
and a stronger imagination they have

3133
01:36:58,480 --> 01:36:59,840
this active inference

3134
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:02,639
engine with um multi-sensory integration

3135
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:03,040
and

3136
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:04,719
this looks like something definitely to

3137
01:37:04,719 --> 01:37:06,239
go into for the

3138
01:37:06,239 --> 01:37:10,159
9.1 and for our own future uh research

3139
01:37:10,159 --> 01:37:13,360
but basically we can

3140
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:15,920
run model scenarios we can say yeah i

3141
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:17,119
guess if it

3142
01:37:17,119 --> 01:37:19,280
it's a funny thing to say you know i can

3143
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:21,280
imagine that if you were to do this

3144
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:22,159
experiment

3145
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:24,239
you might find informative results

3146
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:26,159
suggesting that enabling an

3147
01:37:26,159 --> 01:37:29,239
agent to have imagination in an

3148
01:37:29,239 --> 01:37:33,040
action-oriented geometry might enable it

3149
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:35,920
to do better than a model that doesn't

3150
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:36,480
therefore

3151
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:38,400
spending most of its time learning about

3152
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:39,920
relationships that may or may not be

3153
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:40,800
relevant

3154
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:42,719
in the geometrical frame that sensory

3155
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:43,920
data actually occur

3156
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:47,440
in again long sentences abound but

3157
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:50,000
i think that um there's a lot there in

3158
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:50,800
figure three

3159
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:52,400
and also a lot to learn about how

3160
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:55,040
they're framing free energy

3161
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:58,239
all right last figure figure four

3162
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:01,199
figure four is an overall sketch of the

3163
01:38:01,199 --> 01:38:03,840
pcm the projective consciousness model

3164
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,679
and i think there's a few different

3165
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:06,960
dimensions here

3166
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:10,400
so one is the observer at the center

3167
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:13,199
with their lived space uh steven this

3168
01:38:13,199 --> 01:38:15,119
really reminds me of the parry personal

3169
01:38:15,119 --> 01:38:17,119
space so i hope that you'll have a lot

3170
01:38:17,119 --> 01:38:18,320
to teach us

3171
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:21,840
in this domain and within this domain

3172
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:23,199
this field of consciousness

3173
01:38:23,199 --> 01:38:25,760
field of affordances let's think about

3174
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:27,600
it from many different perspectives

3175
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:29,440
just by saying one thing i'm not always

3176
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:31,199
meaning to limit i'm just saying that

3177
01:38:31,199 --> 01:38:34,000
this is one way we can think about it

3178
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,920
let's imagine

3179
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:38,560
that there are perceived and imagined

3180
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:39,119
events

3181
01:38:39,119 --> 01:38:41,280
now observations are just models of

3182
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,800
observations so maybe there's less of a

3183
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:45,360
distinction there than might be seen

3184
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:48,480
but in this geometry

3185
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:50,880
observer centric with all of this

3186
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:53,600
projective geometry mapping happening

3187
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:56,960
can we think about aligning your vector

3188
01:38:56,960 --> 01:39:00,000
through time down a gradient

3189
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,119
that goes from red to green so it's

3190
01:39:03,119 --> 01:39:04,239
funny because it's a gradient that

3191
01:39:04,239 --> 01:39:06,000
colorblind people of certain types may

3192
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,360
not be able to perceive

3193
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:09,679
which just so perfectly entails

3194
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:11,360
everything we're talking about here

3195
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:14,480
which is that um action in some like

3196
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:15,360
absolutist

3197
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:16,880
sense is moving downhill

3198
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:18,719
thermodynamically there's very few

3199
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:20,320
people who would say that action moves

3200
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:20,800
uphill

3201
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:22,560
thermodynamically bring them on the

3202
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:24,480
stream but

3203
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:27,679
it has to go uphill conceptually or

3204
01:39:27,679 --> 01:39:30,000
symbolically in certain cases

3205
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,080
if not just simply logistically in terms

3206
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:34,320
of going uphill to go downhill later

3207
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,800
and so here we see a gradient reflecting

3208
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:38,159
the free energy

3209
01:39:38,159 --> 01:39:41,199
going um from a culturally based

3210
01:39:41,199 --> 01:39:44,239
green is okay and low surprise

3211
01:39:44,239 --> 01:39:47,119
and then red is high surprise high alert

3212
01:39:47,119 --> 01:39:48,000
high attention

3213
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,360
where have we seen that before um taking

3214
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,440
that kind of a culturally imbued color

3215
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:54,080
scale

3216
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:56,159
and then aligning a time vector as a

3217
01:39:56,159 --> 01:39:57,440
dimensional projection

3218
01:39:57,440 --> 01:40:00,480
onto that figure as a way to say that

3219
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:01,199
actually

3220
01:40:01,199 --> 01:40:03,360
through space and time in the context of

3221
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:05,280
the projected geometry and affordance

3222
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:06,880
capacities of the organism

3223
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:10,320
it is still downhill in a sense so

3224
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:13,920
i don't know where this um necessarily

3225
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:14,880
fits in

3226
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:18,080
with uh all the mathematical formalisms

3227
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:19,840
here looks pretty nice to talk about

3228
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:22,000
like the action perception

3229
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,400
prediction imagination loop this is

3230
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:25,760
another loop we might want to learn

3231
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:27,760
about we've talked a lot about loops

3232
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:30,000
related to like agent and environment

3233
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,760
but now we're almost thinking like

3234
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:34,880
the agent within the agent is going from

3235
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:38,320
action perception prediction imagination

3236
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:40,560
so that's something happening inside of

3237
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:44,239
us potentially and then again on the

3238
01:40:44,239 --> 01:40:45,520
right side is looking

3239
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:47,920
at time series that's the directions we

3240
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:49,920
want to take all free energy research is

3241
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:50,960
like

3242
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:53,679
through time through space any other

3243
01:40:53,679 --> 01:40:54,960
dimensions we come across

3244
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:56,960
we'll go through those two but that's

3245
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,000
definitely the cool

3246
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:01,040
dimension to think about is deep causal

3247
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:01,760
inference

3248
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:04,560
with the sound and what's visualized in

3249
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:05,440
the figure

3250
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:07,840
so other people may see very different

3251
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:08,719
things in this

3252
01:41:08,719 --> 01:41:12,400
figure and we welcome hearing about it

3253
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:15,679
let's close with some just um final

3254
01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:18,560
thoughts and questions to end on which

3255
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:20,239
maybe we'll start ending with questions

3256
01:41:20,239 --> 01:41:24,400
more they write in their paper

3257
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:27,040
computationalist a posteriori that means

3258
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:28,800
after the fact

3259
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:31,199
identity theory allows that apparently

3260
01:41:31,199 --> 01:41:33,040
contingent processing constraints

3261
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:36,800
may be essential to real consciousness

3262
01:41:37,119 --> 01:41:38,800
as long as the computational model

3263
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:41,280
captures the phenomenological invariance

3264
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:43,280
meets the functional constraints and

3265
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:44,639
survives the tribunal

3266
01:41:44,639 --> 01:41:46,960
of prediction and experiment we should

3267
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:48,400
happily accept that some

3268
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:49,920
apparently contingent and only

3269
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:51,840
empirically knowable constraints

3270
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:53,360
pertaining to the physical realization

3271
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:54,960
of consciousness are actually essential

3272
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:55,679
to it

3273
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:57,840
so that is basically like saying look if

3274
01:41:57,840 --> 01:41:58,960
we do

3275
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:01,040
the if we can explain and predict the

3276
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:03,280
invariance the five invariants

3277
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:05,840
and we can capture these functional

3278
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:07,360
attributes there's four of them

3279
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:10,000
but again both of those sets the

3280
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,280
invariances and the functional

3281
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:12,480
attributes

3282
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:15,679
anyone is game to add remove or change

3283
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:17,280
it just needs to be justified and

3284
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:19,280
understood so they're saying look if it

3285
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:20,960
does both of those things which is why

3286
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:23,040
i spent so much time on it in this talk

3287
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:24,239
was because

3288
01:42:24,239 --> 01:42:26,320
that's their claim it's not just broadly

3289
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:28,239
we could do active inference and think

3290
01:42:28,239 --> 01:42:29,520
about consciousness

3291
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:32,960
it's saying if we make these invariances

3292
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:34,239
part of our model

3293
01:42:34,239 --> 01:42:36,639
and we at least get all the functional

3294
01:42:36,639 --> 01:42:38,400
attributes that we want

3295
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:41,679
then any model that is surviving

3296
01:42:41,679 --> 01:42:44,320
unique explanation and predictions the

3297
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:46,320
tribunal

3298
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:49,840
the uh the troika as it were if it does

3299
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:50,639
all of that

3300
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:53,600
then it is basically going to come along

3301
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:55,360
with some wacky baggage like a parameter

3302
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:56,239
we don't understand

3303
01:42:56,239 --> 01:42:57,840
or the god's eye view and then they're

3304
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:59,119
just saying you're just gonna have to

3305
01:42:59,119 --> 01:43:01,360
accept that as contingent

3306
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:05,119
so fun thought by the authors just

3307
01:43:05,119 --> 01:43:08,960
a really well written and conveyed paper

3308
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:11,280
and i hope that it broaches onto many

3309
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:12,639
areas that we've

3310
01:43:12,639 --> 01:43:14,880
talked about in other active streams

3311
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:17,040
here's my closing set of questions

3312
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:20,000
one how would we recognize a framework

3313
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,440
for consciousness

3314
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:23,679
and a related question is what might a

3315
01:43:23,679 --> 01:43:25,600
framework for consciousness be

3316
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:27,360
what if it's a poem oh well it can't be

3317
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:29,199
a poem how do we know

3318
01:43:29,199 --> 01:43:31,600
or what if it's a drawing or what if

3319
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:32,239
it's a set

3320
01:43:32,239 --> 01:43:34,560
of ontologies narratives formal

3321
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:36,080
documents and tools

3322
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:39,280
could it be that onft could it be bolts

3323
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:41,360
business operational legal technical

3324
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:42,320
social

3325
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:45,440
um could it be acceptance could it be

3326
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:48,000
fundamental agnosticism um could it be

3327
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,119
free energy principle

3328
01:43:49,119 --> 01:43:51,760
how will we know and that is really the

3329
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:52,320
key

3330
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:54,880
question for theories of consciousness

3331
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:55,920
is not

3332
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:58,639
do you feel right it's how will we know

3333
01:43:58,639 --> 01:44:00,320
and do you hold yourself to that

3334
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:03,040
standard because we can do a lot better

3335
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:04,639
in this area and this paper is an

3336
01:44:04,639 --> 01:44:06,960
example of great work in the space

3337
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:08,480
a next question is what might a

3338
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:10,639
framework for consciousness enable

3339
01:44:10,639 --> 01:44:12,560
and that's pretty broad what would it

3340
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:13,760
change in our action

3341
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:16,159
practice would we put more people in

3342
01:44:16,159 --> 01:44:18,159
fmri scanners or less

3343
01:44:18,159 --> 01:44:20,480
would we communicate with people who we

3344
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:21,840
don't think of as being able to

3345
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:23,280
communicate with at this point

3346
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:26,239
or not why not um how might it change

3347
01:44:26,239 --> 01:44:27,520
our legal systems or

3348
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:30,080
our social systems what if we could

3349
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:30,880
measure

3350
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:33,199
different kinds or types or levels of

3351
01:44:33,199 --> 01:44:34,400
consciousness

3352
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:36,080
and then that's really why we need to

3353
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:38,159
get down to the brass tacks on what it

3354
01:44:38,159 --> 01:44:39,679
might look like what it measures

3355
01:44:39,679 --> 01:44:42,880
and what the predictions are because if

3356
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:44,400
we don't know the unique predictions or

3357
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:45,199
experiments

3358
01:44:45,199 --> 01:44:46,880
and this is alluding to earlier when i

3359
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,480
said that there's a lot on the table

3360
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:49,679
someone's going to say well i have a

3361
01:44:49,679 --> 01:44:51,600
consciousness ometer and

3362
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:54,400
this is a 2 and this is an 11 and this

3363
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:55,920
type of object that you care so much

3364
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:57,600
about is actually it's not conscious so

3365
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:58,719
i'm just going to unplug it

3366
01:44:58,719 --> 01:45:00,400
but this other one that i care a lot

3367
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:02,320
about i measured it with my device and

3368
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:03,119
it was very

3369
01:45:03,119 --> 01:45:05,760
conscious it's very worthwhile to save

3370
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:06,719
and

3371
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:09,520
where will people make a stand and the

3372
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:10,719
stand has to be

3373
01:45:10,719 --> 01:45:13,360
on the common ground and the space of

3374
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:14,639
recognition

3375
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:16,400
of frameworks for consciousness in my

3376
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:18,400
opinion i'm open to changing my mind on

3377
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:18,880
that

3378
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:20,560
but i think if we don't meet at how

3379
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:22,239
we'll recognize such a framework what it

3380
01:45:22,239 --> 01:45:23,199
might look like

3381
01:45:23,199 --> 01:45:24,960
and start with respecting world

3382
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:26,719
knowledge traditions and by respecting

3383
01:45:26,719 --> 01:45:28,159
differences in our opinion

3384
01:45:28,159 --> 01:45:31,280
and we stay in a hegemonic mode in a um

3385
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:34,800
absolutist mode in a um non-pluralist

3386
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:37,520
frame culturally methodologically if we

3387
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:38,239
don't go

3388
01:45:38,239 --> 01:45:41,199
down um the pluralistic route it's gonna

3389
01:45:41,199 --> 01:45:41,520
be

3390
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:44,080
i think very bad for practical

3391
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:45,679
implications

3392
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:48,880
and then lastly um what are the next

3393
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:50,480
steps for active inference

3394
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:52,719
in this domain what do we want an active

3395
01:45:52,719 --> 01:45:54,239
inference conscious

3396
01:45:54,239 --> 01:45:57,360
agent to do or how can we build on

3397
01:45:57,360 --> 01:45:58,239
active inference

3398
01:45:58,239 --> 01:46:00,880
now do we want to go deeper into

3399
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:01,600
consciousness

3400
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:04,800
deeper into action we spoke about action

3401
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:06,320
policy selection and machine learning

3402
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:07,760
could we put consciousness machine

3403
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:09,520
learning what would be the philosophy

3404
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:11,520
and the implications of that these are

3405
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:12,639
all big questions

3406
01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:15,280
but how are we going to take this paper

3407
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:17,199
and develop in the directions of active

3408
01:46:17,199 --> 01:46:18,320
inference

3409
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:20,719
even if only making um educational

3410
01:46:20,719 --> 01:46:21,760
content

3411
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:24,880
and then lastly um maybe always a good

3412
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:26,239
question to address

3413
01:46:26,239 --> 01:46:28,880
is what is the goal of this research

3414
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:30,800
sure we're curious about consciousness

3415
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:32,480
but aren't we curious about so many

3416
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:33,440
things

3417
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:36,239
what makes it worthwhile to do this

3418
01:46:36,239 --> 01:46:37,440
research

3419
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:40,800
why are we doing it how have we selected

3420
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:42,960
or how why have we selected or how how

3421
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:44,560
have we selected our why

3422
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:46,400
every one of these combinations we

3423
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:47,840
really need to keep in mind

3424
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:50,480
especially if it's about us about our

3425
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:52,159
experience about consciousness about

3426
01:46:52,159 --> 01:46:52,960
people

3427
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:55,440
it's just again can't be said enough

3428
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:57,440
that there's too much on the table

3429
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:59,760
to not have this be participatory

3430
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:00,960
inclusive

3431
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:03,840
cross-cutting intercultural the list

3432
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:04,239
just

3433
01:47:04,239 --> 01:47:07,360
goes on so everybody who's listening and

3434
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:08,000
thinking about

3435
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,960
it thanks so much this kind of uh i

3436
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:12,400
guess went a little bit longer than

3437
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:14,239
one might have predicted but c'est la

3438
01:47:14,239 --> 01:47:17,520
vie right when active streaming why not

3439
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:20,639
thanks for participating we will provide

3440
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:22,159
follow-up forms to the

3441
01:47:22,159 --> 01:47:23,920
live participants we actually will

3442
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:25,520
believe it or not

3443
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:27,840
we will request your feedback

3444
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:28,719
suggestions

3445
01:47:28,719 --> 01:47:30,960
and questions so if you have any

3446
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:33,199
thoughts again i tried to drop a bunch

3447
01:47:33,199 --> 01:47:34,560
of times really specific

3448
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:36,400
moments where somebody could just pause

3449
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:37,600
the video and say

3450
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:40,239
yes this thing right here i do or don't

3451
01:47:40,239 --> 01:47:41,520
agree with or this does or doesn't

3452
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:43,040
resonate with my experience

3453
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:45,040
that would be epic because let's hear

3454
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:46,639
from a lot of perspectives on

3455
01:47:46,639 --> 01:47:48,400
consciousness it's important to hear

3456
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:49,280
about that

3457
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:51,119
and then also just any feedbacks or

3458
01:47:51,119 --> 01:47:53,679
suggestions or collaboration offers for

3459
01:47:53,679 --> 01:47:54,080
the act

3460
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:56,719
imp stream always welcome you can stay

3461
01:47:56,719 --> 01:47:58,719
in communication with us

3462
01:47:58,719 --> 01:48:01,760
any of our channels or means but

3463
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:04,080
thank you all for listening those of you

3464
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:06,320
who are listening live or those of you

3465
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:08,080
who will listen in replay

3466
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:10,080
because the future is always now isn't

3467
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:11,199
it

3468
01:48:11,199 --> 01:48:16,879
see you later
