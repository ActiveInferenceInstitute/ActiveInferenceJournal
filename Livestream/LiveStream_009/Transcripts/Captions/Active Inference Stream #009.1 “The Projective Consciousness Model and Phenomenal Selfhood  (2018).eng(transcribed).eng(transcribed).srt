00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,560
team com today in the

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,439
act imp stream we will be talking about

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,960
a really interesting paper so i'm quite

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,000
excited

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,400

communication

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,920
learning and practice related to active

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,960
inference

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,440
you can find us at our website our

16

welcome here

26
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,000
and also just as far as video etiquette

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,359
for live stream

28
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,039
remember to mute if there's any noise in

29
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,960
your background raise your hand so that

30
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,119
we can hear from everybody on the stack

31
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,720
and use respectful speech behavior etc

32
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,600
just to quickly go through the rest of

33
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,600
the meetings that we'll be having for

34
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,880
2020. today on november 24th we're

35
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,320
talking about the projective

36
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,080
consciousness model and phenomenal

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,200
selfhood

38
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,240
next week in 9.2 on december 1st we're

39
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,000
going to be talking about the same paper

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,400
so anything that gets raised today

41
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,040
whether you're

42
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,520
participating live or watching replay

43
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,280
let us know about it so we can cover it

44
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,360
in 9.2

45
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,159
on december 8th and 15th in 10.1 and

46
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,240
10.2 we'll be discussing the paper

47
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,280
a variational approach to scripts and

48
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,960
then on december 22nd

49
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,280
and 29th we'll be talking about

50
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,159
sophisticated

51
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,840
effective inference and that will be

52
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,680
another more on the modeling

53
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,119
side paper to discuss cool

54
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,399
today in act im stream 9.1

55
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,479
the roadmap will be as follows we'll

56
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,640
start off with some introductions and

57
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,200
warm-up

58
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,719
questions and then we'll get to 9.1

59
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,080
we're going to be talking about the

60
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,758
paper called the projective

61
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:10,800
consciousness model

62
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,360
and phenomenal selfhood by williford at

63
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,040
all 2018.

64
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,680
and the punchline of this paper is

65
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,680
basically about the combination of a few

66
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,560
different fields

67
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,280
geometry cybernetics neurophenomenology

68
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,720
etc

69
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,480
and by combining these fields under the

70
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,840
framework of active inference

71
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,360
there might be something there to

72
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,800
understand or explain about

73
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,160
consciousness

74
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,280
so we'll go through the aims and the

75
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,680
claims of the authors the abstract and

76
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,800
the roadmap

77
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,360
and then at multiple points here and

78
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:39,920
throughout

79
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,000
we want to take time for questions so

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,440
really anyone who

81
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,120
raises their hand we'll just as soon as

82
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,720
we can

83
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,800
cut there because it's so interesting

84
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,760
what people

85
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,280
have come to mind during these

86
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,200
provocative topics

87
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,920
then we'll go to the author's study of

88
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,800
consciousness

89
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,280
and talk about the two lists that they

90
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,720
make and what those lists

91
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,959
do for the paper and do for their theory

92
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,400
and those are the functional features

93
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,319
and the phenomenological invariance of

94
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,440
consciousness

95
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,680
and then at the end we'll go through the

96
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,560
figures

97
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,560
and with however much time we have we'll

98
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,040
go into thinking about what each figure

99
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,360
might represent or invoke

100
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,440
and as stated in 9.2 we're going to be

101
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,280
discussing this same paper again

102
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,040
so save and submit any questions you

103
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,040
have and get in touch with us if you

104
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,360
want to participate

105
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,159
great for the introductions and warm-up

106
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,159
please just introduce yourself

107
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,200
and your location say hello and as short

cool that is everyone so great thanks

140
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,919
for these introductions everybody

141
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,720
let's do some warm-up questions and

142
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,000
there'll be a few of them

143
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,160
and anyone who would like to talk just

144
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,199
jump on with raising your hand

145
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,520
let's try to hear from everyone as well

146
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,120
the first question

147
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,479
and i'll do actually the first and the

148
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,240
second question together since i think

149
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,520
that they're very related

150
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,759
the first question is what interests you

151
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,520
about studying consciousness and the

152
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,080
second

153
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,320
question is what are some ways that we

154
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,199
can study

155
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,080
consciousness um maybe someone's a

156
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,440
skeptic maybe they don't think that we

157
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,960
can study consciousness or maybe they

158
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,080
have a really awesome

159
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,160
uh idea about how we could do that so

160
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,320
lee uh go ahead what's your first

161
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,560
thought

162
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,520
uh yeah so um i mean i primarily come

163
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,320
from the

164
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,000
uh phenomenological angle and um

165
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,680
particularly kind of neurophenomenology

166
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,199
really and what i'm really interested in

167
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,479
is agency so can the

168
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,840
can the models uh that come out of uh

169
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,080
coming out of neuroscience can they

170
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,199
help us to um increase our uh

171
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,240
our agency so for example um

172
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,080
if you can become reflectively aware of

173
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,240
simulations modal simulations that are

174
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:18,880
going on

175
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,280
in your system then do those become

176
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,120
affordances for actions that we can take

177
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,759
and so you

178
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,080
increase the scope of of agency so

179
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,520
that's kind of what really interests me

180
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,600
about this

181
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,720
cool thanks shannon

182
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,639
i love that you bring up agency right

183
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,919
off the bat

184
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,680
um something that's really interesting

185
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,400
for me about consciousness which i don't

186
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,759
study at all is when we lose our sense

187
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,800
of agency

188
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,639
like when we're in flow states if we're

189
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,240
making music or

190
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,599
i guess people get in flow states if

191
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,000
they really like exercising

192
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,800
and we're completely immersed in the

193
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,479
experiment experience

194
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,639
but not consciously aware or we don't

195
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,080
have the same kind of intentionality

196
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,120
that we do as if maybe we're we're like

197
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,479
writing down

198
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,520
a math problem or trying to speak over a

199
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,400
live stream and

200
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,919
and thinking very carefully about each

201
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,080
of our words and

202
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,800
i guess just the phenomenal quality of

203
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,800
those two types of experience

204
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,160
is really interesting to me i agree

205
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,680
and it's part of this what is

206
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,520
consciousness question and what is the

207
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,560
role of awareness

208
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,560
so when we're really paying attention to

209
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,000
doing a task with our hands

210
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,520
when we're really paying attention to

211
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,280
balancing on a beam or something like

212
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,000
that

213
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,520
are we truly at our most self-aware at

214
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,240
that moment

215
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,080
or are we at our least self-aware or in

216
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,680
which ways are we self-aware we're not

217
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,000
thinking about our biographical history

218
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,080
per se but in another sense we're the

219
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,000
most embodied and an active

220
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,400
sort of circuit for action so where is

221
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,919
that going to fit in with active

222
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,840
inference and with this idea that we are

223
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,919
embodied in an environment so what is

224
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,680
yeah really more experiential of the

225
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,240
self

226
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,599
doing something that might take up your

227
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,680
whole body or bring your full attention

228
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,440
to bear or doing something that asks you

229
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,199
to write a personal statement

230
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,879
something like an autobiographical or

231
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,479
narrative self

232
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,319
cool if anyone else wants to go on the

233
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,080
first two those are good questions

234
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,879
or the last question here is just like

235
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,240
what is another

236
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,160
theory or framework for consciousness

237
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,000
that you know of or have heard about

238
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,280
doesn't need to be your

239
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,680
theory to um support or deny here just

240
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,720
like what is something

241
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,520
else that is in the space of this paper

242
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,520
and then what's just something that you

243
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,479
liked about it or found absent from that

244
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,279
model

245
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,679
so all just starts with something that i

246
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,360
found missing from a lot of models and i

247
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,200
really want to know where agency

248
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,880
and where a lot of other topics fit into

249
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,519
play here is it's often a little unclear

250
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,720
whether consciousness

251
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,560
is something that reaches back into the

252
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,240
system and intervenes

253
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,680
or whether it's something that's just

254
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,279
purely epi phenomenal

255
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,360
or kind of um just there can be

256
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,040
awareness but awareness may not have

257
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,160
causal power

258
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,600
so is consciousness something that's

259
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,680
just getting spun off to the side

260
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,160
and produced but not reaching back into

261
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,800
the system

262
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,640
or is it something that's actually

263
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,399
essential potentially even in an

264
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,480
evolutionary or adaptive context

265
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,480
for maintaining coherent behavior

266
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,880
stephen

267
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,519
yeah i'm i'm interested in in this

268
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,360
question of self-consciousness

269
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,839
that seems to be and i like just the

270
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,240
idea of general consciousness being

271
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,600
thought about because i think in

272
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,320
psychology this idea of the self

273
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,560
and the idea of the individual has

274
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,640
become so dominant and the idea of

275
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,240
broader consciousness was kind of

276
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,680
left 100 years ago for the philosophers

277
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,680
to deal with so this idea of i have a

278
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,440
self and i have this

279
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,240
um idea of a psychology and this

280
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,000
perspective on the psychology

281
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,720
has become kind of all-encompassing but

282
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,200
now

283
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,160
this ability to bring consciousness in

284
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,120
more broadly

285
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,959
sort of dissolves a lot of those

286
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,760
problems because it it kind of stuck

287
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,600
psychology at this single scale of

288
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,880
analysis

289
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,800
um so that's one of the things i think

290
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,560
that um

291
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,839
is quite exciting by all of this

292
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,518
cool sasha

293
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,720
um one thing that i i find missing i

294
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,560
feel like a broken record sometimes

295
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,040
um is the developmental side of

296
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,079
consciousness

297
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,519
um and even if we're thinking about

298
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,920
humans you know our favorite species

299
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,800
uh how does consciousness develop across

300
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,839
a lifetime

301
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,880
and what are the different uh stages or

302
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,200
versions of consciousness that we pass

303
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,360
through um and is there a sort of a

304
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,040
developmental trajectory because um

305
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,360
i tend to think it's not like flipping a

306
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,160
light switch

307
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,079
like it's not that we are born and we're

308
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,519
immediately plugged into

309
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,240
this um same consciousness that we're

310
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,000
experiencing today

311
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,959
so um yeah that's kind of what i would

312
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,000
like to see from

313
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,680
a consciousness model is different

314
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,839
levels or

315
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,760
versions of it that we can start to

316
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,000
describe like much like the flow state

317
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,320
or

318
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,279
um sleep cool shannon

319
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,240
yeah i like both of those um points that

320
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,079
stephen and sasha brought up

321
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,959
and not just how does our our personal

322
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,640
consciousness develop over time but how

323
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,360
does our

324
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,720
consciousness like our group

325
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,120
consciousness um develop

326
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,279
so like as an infant a lot of your

327
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,519
conscious experience is really coupled

328
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,480
with

329
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,519
the mother or the caregiver and

330
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,000
like slowly you might develop a sense of

331
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,880
of yourself

332
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,720
as an individual separate from that

333
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,240
caregiver

334
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,240
but also when we gather in groups you

335
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,640
know when we gather at concerts or

336
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,680
we gather at protests or in events where

337
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,920
we're

338
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,560
a mix of explicitly or implicitly

339
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,920
interacting with each other

340
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,480
we start to behave like like one group

341
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,240
and in some sense we start to really

342
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,279
feel

343
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,600
like one group rather than like just

344
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,120
myself in a room full of other people

345
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,760
yep cool and something in the ant

346
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,399
literature

347
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,639
people have wondered about is the nest

348
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,000
mate conscious is just

349
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,600
the colony conscious but not the nest

350
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,120
mate then what is really

351
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,880
happening with this transition from

352
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,800
individual to group

353
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,720
and the development of that also

354
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,480
interesting the formation of group is it

355
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,240
kind of like how many sand grains make a

356
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:22,639
heap

357
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,000
you know once there's three people it's

358
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,839
a collective consciousness or do they

359
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,680
have to be doing contact improv or do

360
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,399
they have to be

361
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,880
rhythmically synchronized what are those

362
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,279
dynamics what might be metrics

363
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,040
what might be things that we could come

364
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,800
to the table and agree on

365
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,320
as far as measurements are concerned so

366
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,680
that we could kind of move the needle

367
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,880
forward in research

368
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,120
or is this a question that because of

369
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,639
its maybe fundamental

370
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,399
difficulty in measurement is it a

371
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,839
question that's sort of forever

372
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,160
going to be in the speculative domain i

373
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,680
think that the authors of this paper

374
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,800
would suggest that

375
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,040
scientific study of consciousness is

376
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,000
meritous

377
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,560
and that there's value in approaching

378
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,160
with even a mathematical

379
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,720
bent approaching how we could study

380
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,600
consciousness

381
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,680
though it's by no means obvious that

382
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,200
mathematics is the way that we're going

383
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,680
to

384
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,240
express the language or the structure of

385
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,279
consciousness

386
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,959
especially when we start to think about

387
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,120
all these different dimensions like

388
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,279
group versus individual and what you

389
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,800
know who is individual

390
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,560
we were never individuals that type of

391
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,639
thinking what does the brain region know

392
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,160
that the neuron doesn't and the brain

393
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,760
know that the region doesn't

394
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,440
all these questions are gonna come into

395
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,440
play and a lot of the

396
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,079
neuro and social parts are gonna get a

397
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:32,800
little bit

398
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,519
um not swept under the rug here but this

399
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,079
paper

400
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,720
is clearly a little bit more on the cut

401
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,680
and dry

402
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,160
projective geometry side and there's a

403
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,079
lot of discussion of neurophenomenology

404
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,480
but you don't see any pictures of cells

405
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,399
you don't see any actual details of

406
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,399
neural mechanisms it's just assume well

407
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,480
you could wrap mechanisms and mechanisms

408
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,279
kind of close to the end to get this

409
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,959
type of a systems behavior

410
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,880
and so we'll get a little bit more into

411
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,720
it so at any point of course people are

412
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,680
welcome to

413
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,880
raise their hand we'll just try to

414
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,880
immediately whatever springs to mind in

415
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,880
a relevant moment so no worries about

416
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,920
these prompts let's talk about the paper

417
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,000
which is the projective consciousness

418
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,920
model and phenomenal selfhood

419
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,600
by williford at all in december 2018

420
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,000
in frontiers in psychology theoretical

421
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,959
and philosophical psychology

422
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,680
the aims and the claims of the paper are

423
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,959
basically as such

424
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,000
they ask can we describe this integrated

425
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,160
multimodal and centered spatial

426
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,839
structure of conscious experience in a

427
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,040
rigorous way

428
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,880
and can we give a good account of why it

429
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,160
should be thus organized

430
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,920
here we answer both questions in the

431
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,279
affirmative great

432
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,240
big if true let's see these be answered

433
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,040
overall

434
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,880
the pcm delivers an account of the

435
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,560
phenomenologically available

436
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,560
generic structure of consciousness and

437
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,920
that speaks to steven's point about the

438
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,199
general consciousness

439
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,880
and shows how consciousness allows

440
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,880
organisms to integrate multimodal

441
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,480
sensory information memory

442
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,639
and emotion in order to control behavior

443
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:01,839
enhance resilience

444
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,600
optimize preference satisfaction and

445
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,199
minimize predictive error in efficient

446
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:05,920
manner

447
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,000
and this is again to my earlier point

448
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,199
about does consciousness

449
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,720
get spun off of the system or does it

450
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,399
reach back in so does

451
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,480
consciousness control behavior and

452
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,600
enhance resilience

453
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,360
or is that systems with controlled

454
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,440
behavior and enhanced properties like

455
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,240
resilience

456
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,399
do those systems spiral off

457
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,480
consciousness as an observer

458
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,480
that's vague here but the way that we

459
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,760
phrase these sentences

460
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,759
is essential it's like active versus

461
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,680
passive mistakes were made versus i made

462
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,600
a mistake versus you made a mistake

463
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,720
pretty different and the non-uh jargony

464
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,120
way

465
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,759
might be to ask how can we apply active

466
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,920
inference as this unifying framework

467
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,839
to the study of consciousness in all of

468
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:44,959
its unified

469
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,440
coherent mysterious dynamic and profound

470
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,480
facets

471
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,680
and we'll see when they get to the

472
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,040
functional features and the

473
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,199
phenomenological invariants

474
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,120
which aspects of consciousness they

475
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,480
think are sort of

476
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,360
the key features to explain and really

477
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,040
integrate across

478
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,360
into one common framework so that's what

479
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,240
we hope to be

480
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,639
getting at today even though this paper

481
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,360
is not

482
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,120
the whole citation network we're

483
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,480
definitely going to be exploring a lot

484
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,079
of the key ideas

485
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,800
and questions about how and where active

486
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,639
inference and the free energy principle

487
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,560
could link back to consciousness so

488
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,160
here's the abstract briefly

489
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,480
they write we summarize our recently

490
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,000
introduced projective consciousness

491
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,040
model pcm which is rudroff at all 2017

492
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,040
and relate it to outstanding conceptual

493
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,519
issues in the theory of consciousness

494
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,519
the projective consciousness model

495
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,680
combines a projective geometrical model

what's experienced

modulation of the field's cognitive

thought processes and affective like how

effective in the same

513
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,799
sentence abstract part two the

514
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,679
geometrical

515
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,599
and active inference components are

516
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,919
linked via the concept of projective

517
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,839
transformation so we'll definitely have

518
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,119
a slide where we look at what a

519
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,119
projective transformation is

520
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,959
which is crucial to understanding how

521
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,799
conscious organisms integrate

522
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,679
perception emotion memory reasoning and

523
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,839
perspectival imagination in order to

524
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,400
control

525
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,400
behavior enhance resilience and optimize

526
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,559
preference satisfaction

527
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,360
the pcm makes substantiative empirical

528
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:35,919
predictions

529
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,360
and fits well into a neural

530
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,039
computationalist framework

531
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,280
it also helps us to account for aspects

532
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,799
of subjective character that are

533
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,039
sometimes ignored or conflated

534
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,960
pre-reflective self-consciousness the

535
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,400
first-person point of view

536
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,559
the sense of mindness or of ownership

537
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,240
and of social self-conscious so maybe we

538
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,320
will get to some of these social topics

539
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,480
and they close by saying that we argue

540
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,720
that the pcm though still in development

541
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,720
offers the most complete theory to date

542
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,799
of what thomas metzinger has called

543
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,880
phenomenal selfhood so that's combining

544
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,080
this phenomenology

545
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,840
component with a selfhood element any

546
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,840
thoughts on the abstract or we can move

547
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,400
forward

548
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,080
bring them up during the roadmap so the

549
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,400
abstract is just the header of the paper

550
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,160
it's kind of like the metadata for the

551
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,160
in-group and out-group discussion

552
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,760
the roadmap is how they're actually

553
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,760
going to implement these kinds of claims

554
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,559
that are suggested

555
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,640
in the introduction in the abstract so

556
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,640
first with a more formal introduction

557
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,960
to the topics they discussed in the

558
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,840
abstract

559
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,720
and then they went straight to

560
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,320
methodology which i think is very

561
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,919
important especially when discussing

562
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,720
something that's abstract like this

563
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,919
then they talk about the

564
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,760
phenomenological invariance and the

565
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,120
functional features of consciousness

566
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,320
which we'll go through on separate

567
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,760
slides

568
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,679
and specifically they talk about these

569
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,080
invariants in terms of a projective

570
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,799
geometry feature of the pcm

571
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,320
they talk about the functions and then

572
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,919
talk about how the pcm

573
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,280
links the functional features of

574
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,600
consciousness within an active inference

575
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,720
and a cybernetics

576
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,480
framework so they're taking some of the

577
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,840
invariants combining them with

578
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,120
projective geometry

579
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,559
they're taking some of the features and

580
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,960
combining that with cybernetics uh

581
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,640
in the sense of active inference as a

582
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,480
modern phrasing of cybernetics

583
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,160
and free energy minimization as an

584
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,919
optimization process and they're kind of

585
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:18,880
connecting

586
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,120
experience cybernetics projective

587
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,640
geometry all these different things

588
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,679
together

589
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,679
and asking whether it makes sense they

590
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,440
then have all their four figures

591
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,679
which we'll go through today that range

592
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,679
from sort of sketch-like accounts

593
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,520
of psychological phenomena to some early

594
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,799
solutions to otherwise challenging ideas

595
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,440
like illusions necrocube and then they

596
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,320
sketch out

597
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,799
a few different representations and

598
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,000
simulations that they

599
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,880
run or ran elsewhere they then return to

600
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,760
this question of the hard problem

601
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,400
representationalism and phenomenal

602
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,640
selfhood so the hard problem

603
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,400
is the hard problem of consciousness

604
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,160
attributed to chalmers and others

605
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,840
that relates to basically where the

606
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,600
rubber hits the road how does

607
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,360
consciousness arise or what is it i

608
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,679
think there's many hard problems

609
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,280
and who knows which ones we think are

610
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,520
easy but actually are hard the point is

611
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,360
they're going to come at that nexus from

612
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,919
a computational and a functional angle

613
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,320
then they talk about representationalism

614
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,200
in the pcm

615
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,360
and i feel like representationalism

616
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,559
we've heard about a bunch

617
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,480
on active stream with a bayesian

618
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,880
structural representationalism

619
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,240
and now we're going to come at it from a

620
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,240
different angle from a geometric and a

621
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,840
cybernetic angle

622
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,600
they then talk about how the pcm is

623
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,600
linked to subjective character

624
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,000
as well as phenomenal selfhood which is

625
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,200
clearly one of the things that they're

626
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,400
out to describe

627
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,880
and then they conclude so they're gonna

628
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,440
go

629
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,320
from taking a few different threads of

630
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,360
phenomenological

631
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,640
neuro research and tie that with some

632
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,360
more mechanism agnostic control theory

633
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,000
approaches

634
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,240
like cybernetics active inference and

635
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,840
optimization approaches like free energy

636
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,799
minimization

637
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:57,760
they're going to bring in this

638
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,679
projective consciousness uh projective

639
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:00,799
geometry bit

640
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,720
to tie it all together and then we get

641
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,240
to the conclusions and also some of

642
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,400
their thoughts on where to go next

643
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,200
so let's just pause there i've written

644
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,840
out a few

645
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,080
questions but does anyone just have a

646
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,880
thought or

647
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,520
a question or when they read the paper

648
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,039
like what was the first

649
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,720
thought was there something that

650
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,080
resonated a lot

651
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,640
was there something that seemed

652
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,240
ill-defined or you would have defined it

653
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,760
a different way

654
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,480
or just something you were curious about

655
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,600
stephen well one thing i thought was

656
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,000
interesting was this idea of

657
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,480
perspectival

658
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,520
consciousness so this idea that

659
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,799
when you're consciously taking a

660
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,200
perspective on your situation

661
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,240
um which you normally might think of as

662
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:46,559
c

663
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,960
in it but it could be some sort of

664
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,480
embodied sense

665
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,280
so i think that was kind of important

666
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,080
and there

667
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,840
and how that differs from maybe the

668
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,159
unconscious

669
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,200
um dynamics that are just going on

670
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,960
that they don't necessarily deal with so

671
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,480
it's somehow sitting

672
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,159
i don't know sitting on top or sitting

673
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,919
alongside it but there's

674
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,720
somehow this perspectival piece that

675
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,120
somehow kicks in

676
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,159
yeah and we often think about vision

677
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,320
in talking about how active inference is

678
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,159
to be differentiated from let's just say

679
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,640
a sensory relay model where you know

680
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,679
photons come in

681
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,320
your brain categorizes them and makes an

682
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,360
image and then you act

683
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,720
and here it's like it's a generative

684
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,760
model of the world that you're

685
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,280
experiencing that's why there's color

686
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,880
and good resolution around the edges and

687
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,000
no blind spot

688
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,520
and then it's like well then why do we

689
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,280
see what appears to be coming from our

690
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,000
eyes or

691
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,440
from a position that's right there and

692
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,799
that's where we're going to come back to

693
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,400
with a lot of these questions about the

694
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,600
projection itself

695
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,840
and why we appear to be situated lee

696
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,080
sorry yeah i don't know if it's relevant

697
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,000
but um i was just thinking about

698
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,200
so the the discovery of perspective uh

699
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,320
you know back in the in the

700
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,960
enlightenment and i was thinking well

701
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,320
obviously you know if this is a sort of

702
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,640
a more generic theory of consciousness

703
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,760
then

704
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,120
i was wondering if it connected perhaps

705
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,440
to metzinger's idea of transparent

706
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,080
states

707
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,000
so that uh you know the projected

708
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,760
geometry would have always been there

709
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,280
but they would have been transparent and

710
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,159
somehow

711
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,400
you know in the process of the discovery

712
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,120
of perspective uh it became something

713
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,400
that we were able to pay

714
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,320
attention to more more consciously

715
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,760
anyway just a thought

716
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,640
cool idea let me actually unpack that

717
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,400
first what would you describe as the

718
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,480
transparent state because i don't know

719
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,159
of that terminology specifically what is

720
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,120
a transparent

721
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,840
state here so i think in mexico's model

722
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,440
so transparent states would be

723
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,159
those states that we are that we view

724
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:44,960
the world through

725
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,880
so we then we're in a stable we don't

726
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,480
know that we're having a particular

727
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,919
state whereas

728
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,760
he he contrasted to us a meta i think

729
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,000
really so an opaque state would be

730
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,080
a state where we where we understand

731
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,480
that it's as

732
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,880
a sensory state if you know what i mean

733
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,559
cool the transparent state it's kind of

734
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,080
like what is water

735
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,840
the water we swim in it's like the water

736
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,000
is transparent so when you look out in

737
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,880
all directions

738
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,400
it's not being seen specifically yeah

739
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,440
like you're looking through it you're

740
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,799
looking through it but you're not able

741
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,640
to actually observe it as a state of

742
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,200
of your as a state an embodied state

743
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,320
that you're having if you see what i

744
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:20,880
mean

745
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,039
yeah just to unpack this one bit for

746
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,080
steven um

747
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,760
it's kind of like without a theory of

748
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,600
error you could just look forever and

749
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,480
you could just have

750
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,039
any model could replace this idea about

751
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,400
what fills up space

752
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,559
then there's this chemical theory of air

753
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,080
and there have been various chemical

754
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,640
theories of

755
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,080
air and whether there's four types of

756
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,840
things they mix or whether it's protons

757
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,520
and neutrons and different ratios and

758
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,640
things like that

759
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,799
and then once you have a theory of air

760
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,320
you could ask things like what if i

761
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,080
compressed all of the quote invisible

762
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,360
stuff in this room and all of a sudden

763
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,960
it looks like blue or something it's

764
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,279
like

765
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,520
whoa it kind of is there there's unique

766
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,679
experiments there's unique predictions

767
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:56,720
i'm taking something that was

768
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,520
transparent in the niche that actually

769
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,559
was real ontologically real and then

770
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,320
through attention and awareness and

771
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,480
affordances we're able to now like

772
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,799
look at it so we've developed projective

773
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:09,679
geometry

774
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,120
and it's like whoa what if it really

775
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,000
were projective geometry all along but

776
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
then now with the projective geometric

777
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,559
tools

778
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,640
we're coming back to experience that and

779
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,840
it's actually something that steven and

780
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,679
i were talking about just this weekend

781
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:22,159
with

782
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,360
a little bit like what people's

783
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,600
experiences of perspective have been in

784
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,640
the past

785
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,039
um because there is those sometimes

786
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,240
funny pictures

787
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,480
um at least comical sometimes where it's

788
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,240
like a person's face and it looks like

789
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:34,799
it's from

790
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,120
almost a cubist angle but it's like a

791
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,799
renaissance painting and

792
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,080
there's probably so much to say from an

793
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,279
art history perspective about the

794
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,799
evolution and the development

795
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,279
of perspective but at the very least it

796
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,159
seems like people

797
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,760
throughout time have been differentially

798
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,279
excited by different types of

799
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,960
representations of perspective

800
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,039
people weren't doing photo realistic

801
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,080
charcoal drawings

802
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,240
in a different era even if they necess

803
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,080
could have had the um

804
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,400
technologies to do so so something is

805
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,760
happening there with perspective and how

806
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,159
it's

807
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,840
changing the way that we interact with

808
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,400
the visual world cubism of course was

809
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,200
shocking

810
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,000
and uh when it came out and so now where

811
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,279
are we with perspective

812
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,120
um there's a lot to say about that

813
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,279
stephen

814
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,559
yeah i mean one of the things that's

815
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,679
interesting with like imagined

816
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,320
feelings in space is that they can be

817
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,640
kind of transparent so if you like

818
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,480
what's the energy of someone or if i

819
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,039
imagine the energies of people

820
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,080
around me it's like a quality those

821
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,919
qualities they don't

822
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,559
like if you imagine something in space

823
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,640
it doesn't become completely opaque it's

824
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,000
not like you can't see that you're in

825
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,360
the room anymore

826
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,120
you know so even if you're on stage as

827
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,200
an actor and you imagine that you're in

828
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,240
a scene

829
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,799
with a king and it's an empty stage and

830
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,200
you start to imagine the whole stage you

831
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,600
it's still slightly transparent in

832
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,760
relation to the physical

833
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,880
perceptive conscious physical space if

834
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,720
that makes sense so those two things are

835
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,520
kind of

836
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,480
interplaying yep but yeah and to bring

837
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,080
that to the affordances in the field of

838
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,840
affordances field of consciousness it's

839
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,240
like

840
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,159
the generative model isn't just of what

841
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:11,360
the video camera

842
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,279
would see if it were next to your head

843
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,880
the generative model is actually

844
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,840
generating

845
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,720
this field of action that's scaled

846
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,240
geometrically so that things that are

847
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,240
closer to you and better within reach

848
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,640
are seemingly at hand and things that

849
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,240
are distant are seemingly distant and

850
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,520
one example that steve and i were

851
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,880
talking about was like

852
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,080
there might be an object on the other

853
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,080
side of my monitor that i'd have to kind

854
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,799
of go around

855
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,520
to reach and just right with a quick

856
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,320
judgment

857
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,600
it feels like something on the other

858
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,360
side of my monitor is actually further

859
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,080
away

860
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,240
than something that might be linearly

861
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,480
closer um or further away sorry but like

862
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,840
i can reach it directly just by reaching

863
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,120
my hand over i can reach two feet over

864
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,000
with my arm just grab

865
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,080
it but the 18 inches linearly to the

866
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,080
monitor i have to end up doing a 36 inch

867
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,919
route so it feels longer away

868
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,880
so even within our at hand concepts and

869
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,240
the way that we talk about

870
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,600
what is accessible or what is um

871
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,399
relevant

872
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,399
these all have to do with the grasping

873
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,159
and the comprehending and the action

874
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,640
distortion of a space so there's really

875
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,080
a lot here about the perspectives that

876
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,960
we take

877
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,480
and if we say there's one perspective

878
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,399
and it's mine there's one perspective

879
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:14,880
and it's

880
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,279
my cultures or is it hey we're all at

881
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,880
this party and we're all gonna have

882
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,640
different perspectives of this party

883
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,480
okay which perspectives can hang which

884
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,080
ones can't those are the kinds of

885
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,679
discussions that you get to there

886
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,600
instead of is it right wrong the way i'm

887
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,559
seeing it because you know not

888
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,000
everyone's to see the party like you see

889
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,360
it because no one's head

890
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,120
is overlapping with your perception

891
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,720
because everyone's affordances and

892
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,799
location are different for example

893
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:41,120
sasha yeah i really appreciated in this

894
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,600
paper um a kind of connection

895
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,520
um uh we're always talking about on this

896
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,240
stream

897
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,840
um between uh you know taking in

898
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,720
information and

899
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,520
acting um and so it's this feedback loop

900
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,559
of two things

901
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,600
and i really like this converting

902
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,640
uh thinking about our space into

903
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,799
thinking about the space of affordances

904
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,760
so that it's not just a you know a blank

905
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,440
slate of information that

906
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,080
uh you could access or not but it's

907
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,039
really what you

908
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,520
are able to do with that information and

909
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,200
how you're going to act on it

910
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,600
so i yeah i just thought that was a

911
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,120
really nice connection and

912
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,840
fits in very well with what we're

913
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,279
talking about and kind of

914
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,720
builds up this um similar theme of

915
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,559
how you're going to connect action and

916
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,000
perception

917
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,240
cool and just one other example that

918
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,120
that kind of

919
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,880
uh made me think about is like when i'm

920
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,480
dissecting an insect

921
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,600
under a microscope um it's very small

922
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,159
movements

923
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,159
of the fingers but it in the field of

924
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,320
vision of a microscope will swing the

925
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,240
forceps like you know 30 degrees so

926
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,240
it'll be a a radical motion

927
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,640
under the microscope but it has the

928
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,559
exact same embodiment

929
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,200
feel as like swinging one's arm almost

930
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,720
as if what matters is

931
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,799
how much i'm seeing my body move within

932
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,000
a visual field

933
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,760
and how radical of an affordance it is

934
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,360
like flailing my arm versus a more

935
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,399
fine-tuned movement

936
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,000
but a fine-tuned movement with the arm

937
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,760
is like one inch but that's represented

938
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,279
by a certain number of degrees

939
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,440
and that ends up being like visually

940
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,200
almost the same number of degrees

941
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,520
that i can move the forceps so even

942
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,960
though it's at a different spatial scale

943
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,080
because the attention and the

944
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,320
affordances are down at that scale

945
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,799
and i have the visual ability the umvelt

946
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,399
to perceive at that smaller scale which

947
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,000
couldn't be seen if it were the naked

948
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,720
eye

949
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,559
it takes on a feeling like it's in the

950
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,120
regular vision regular body world

951
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,200
and then also the uh forceps don't have

952
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,320
nerves but they're

953
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,360
sensitized so there's a lot to say and

954
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,399
think about there

955
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,799
um a few questions that i just wrote

956
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:43,600
down here just

957
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,320
like these are of course perennial

958
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,120
questions

959
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,559
they're not going to be answered in a

960
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,159
couple minutes but

961
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,600
what's exciting about studying

962
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,360
consciousness what do we

963
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,679
agree on what do people agree on what do

964
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,440
people disagree on and then

965
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,159
also what do people agree is unknown

966
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,080
what are the known unknowns where might

967
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,760
there be unknown unknowns

968
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,559
and then also to always return to what

969
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:06,880
is

970
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,039
active inference doing here what could

971
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,120
it do here what could some other

972
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,360
theory do here what do you think shannon

973
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,279
yeah so your story about the forceps and

974
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,200
the microscope reminded me of

975
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,760
the first example of like extended

976
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,720
consciousness

977
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,240
that i learned about and in a philosophy

978
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,919
of mind class in undergrad

979
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,279
and our professor was talking about

980
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,559
divers um who are they're not actually

981
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,919
diving they're in a room

982
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,720
and they're controlling a camera like on

983
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,679
a little submarine

984
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,279
that's underwater and they start to

985
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,799
feel like they are the submarine

986
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,440
so much so that their body's actually

987
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,640
responding

988
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,720
to the the pressure differences that

989
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,000
they would experience if they were

990
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,240
diving so if the submarine comes up

991
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,399
very fast they'll actually ex feel like

992
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,080
they're experiencing the bends

993
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,760
that would happen if they were a diver

994
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,360
coming up so fast i don't know if this

995
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,880
is a true

996
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,440
um story i've never looked it up but

997
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,880
it's

998
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,880
very intriguing that your consciousness

999
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,559
can be can be so extended that you end

1000
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,399
up having these embodied effects that

1001
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:13,039
you

1002
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,080
perhaps could empirically measure if you

1003
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,240
if you were if you had some sensors on

1004
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,279
on these people as they were

1005
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,880
experiencing these extended conscious

1006
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,919
moments

1007
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,440
cool lee um i was just going to ask

1008
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,600
shannon um

1009
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,279
do you know whether that depends on

1010
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,880
whether the uh people

1011
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,720
controlling the remote sub were have

1012
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,720
previously dived as well so they kind of

1013
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,760
got the

1014
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,360
you know the embodied experience as part

1015
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,799
of their model

1016
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,960
i think for that for specifically the

1017
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,480
bends it would or maybe they would have

1018
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,600
to know about

1019
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,080
the bends because that's a very specific

1020
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,440
thing that doesn't happen to your body

1021
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,360
in any other case

1022
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,440
yeah one thing that makes me think of is

1023
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,399
like uh

1024
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,720
the drop in a techno song when

1025
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,000
everything's building and the tension's

1026
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,600
building but that's actually a cultural

1027
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,039
regime of affordance

1028
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,200
and different sub-genres of electronica

1029
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,399
or different people who are

1030
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,000
aren't familiar with electronica they

1031
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,760
might get chills going down their spine

1032
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,279
it's like oh this is the sickest drop

1033
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:07,679
ever

1034
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,000
but somebody else might just not be

1035
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
tuned into that regime of attention

1036
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,760
and therefore it's like okay wait what

1037
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,600
happened why is it just why did the

1038
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,000
drums stop something like that so

1039
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,919
similarly it's like the diver

1040
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,760
if they're part of this deep generative

1041
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,679
model and then they're they're emulating

1042
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,679
it or they're simulating it somehow

1043
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,000
um this diving then they may have a

1044
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,120
deeply learned

1045
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,880
reflex about changing their blood

1046
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,159
pressure let's just you know

1047
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,320
go with star experiment being vaguely

1048
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,519
you know feeling true

1049
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,399
just ish that you could if you're doing

1050
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:39,440
a first-person shooter

1051
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,039
immersive video game your heart is going

1052
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,799
to start pounding not because you need

1053
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,000
increased blood flow that's a

1054
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,360
psychological response

1055
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,320
so trained psychological responses in

1056
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,159
increasingly immersive environments like

1057
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:50,640
ar

1058
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,240
and vr will generate physiological

1059
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,200
responses

1060
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,880
and that is actually part of the thrill

1061
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,720
that was i mean there's so

1062
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,320
much happening here and it doesn't

1063
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,640
really go into the ar vr here but like

1064
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,960
what if we unprojected our projective

1065
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,159
geometry what

1066
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:08,399
would happen or what about these uh sort

1067
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,000
of alice in wonderland type

1068
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,399
simulators for the ar and the vr where

1069
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,839
you re you reach towards something but

1070
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,520
your arm moves twice as fast

1071
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,800
or you reach towards something and your

1072
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,480
arm doesn't move you crash into stuff

1073
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,918
and it just feels like you're like super

1074
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:20,719
disoriented

1075
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,040
or the glasses are flipped all of these

1076
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,079
transformations

1077
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,199
are just super deep interventions

1078
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:30,159
into the structure of sense and action

1079
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:30,800
so

1080
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,839
there's a lot that is now possible here

1081
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,918
with how we can on the fly

1082
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:39,040
remap these things in 1920 the cubist

1083
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,520
could

1084
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,280
put a light on one side of the cube and

1085
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,040
draw it and then halfway through the

1086
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,399
drawing move the light and get a

1087
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:45,599
different perspective and that was kind

1088
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,679
of cool like a mashup of perspectives

1089
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,760
in one two-dimensional plane but now you

1090
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,599
could be experiencing like

1091
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,199
a lot more stuff happening and the cube

1092
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,399
could be mutating it could be a

1093
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:55,918
hypercube and stuff like that

1094
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,320
it's kind of next level with respect to

1095
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,680
our geometry

1096
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,040
and how it relates to our sense in

1097
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,960
action

1098
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,720
any other thoughts or questions here

1099
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,160
before we go to the functional

1100
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,760
features just think of them as they come

1101
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,240
up

1102
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,280
so the authors highlight four functional

1103
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,839
features

1104
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,000
of consciousness which are global

1105
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,680
optimization and resilience

1106
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,160
global availability motivation of action

1107
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,680
and modulation of attention

1108
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,200
and simulation enhancement so their

1109
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,400
goals are basically these are the things

1110
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,760
that they say

1111
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,480
notice that it's very

1112
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,640
mechanism-independent it doesn't say you

1113
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,480
got to have neurons you need glia

1114
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,160
it doesn't say it has to be at this time

1115
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,839
scale these are all like things that you

1116
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,359
might say about

1117
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,599
a cybernetic system a control theory

1118
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,800
action perception

1119
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,119
system so these features are the

1120
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:45,920
abstract

1121
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,440
functional features of consciousness

1122
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,520
which through neurophenomenology will

1123
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,280
get brought into the brain

1124
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,760
perhaps but just at the functional level

1125
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,520
these are the functions of consciousness

1126
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,440
and they write we claim that the overall

1127
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,880
function of consciousness

1128
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,280
again is it that consciousness is

1129
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,960
getting spun off by systems that have

1130
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,000
these functions

1131
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,160
or is consciousness literally the

1132
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,880
function that maps back into the system

1133
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,480
and gives these features um

1134
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,200
presence in the world we claim that the

1135
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,000
overall

1136
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,599
function of consciousness is to address

1137
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,680
a general cybernetic problem or problem

1138
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,640
of control

1139
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,280
consciousness enables again ambiguous a

1140
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,400
situated organism

1141
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,839
with multiple sensory channels to

1142
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:28,160
navigate its environment and satisfy its

1143
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,480
biological and derived needs efficiently

1144
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,880
this entails minimizing and predictive

1145
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,400
this entails minimizing

1146
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,720
predictively erroneous representations

1147
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,440
of the world

1148
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,760
and maximizing preference satisfaction a

1149
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,280
good model of consciousness

1150
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,800
must be able to explain how this is

1151
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,200
accomplished the pcm thus emphasizes the

1152
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:45,760
following

1153
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,280
interrelated functional features of

1154
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,880
consciousness so

1155
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,720
ask yourself if there was a robot that

1156
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,280
could do intermodal

1157
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,920
sensory things and memory and it was

1158
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,760
doing counter factual simulations and it

1159
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,440
had motivated looking action

1160
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,440
and modulation of attention global

1161
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,520
availability of some variables or some

1162
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,640
processes and

1163
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,560
it was resilient within some resilience

1164
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,760
of course we're not resilient to getting

1165
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,280
hit with a hammer on the head

1166
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,520
we are resilient to you know a train

1167
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,320
coming at us from

1168
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,640
a mile away but not an inch away i mean

1169
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,240
it's always going to be about

1170
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,560
where you draw the bounds oh i mean

1171
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,359
that's out of bounds

1172
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:20,400
you don't need to be resilient to that

1173
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,320
kind of an insult to this drug but to

1174
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,680
this molecule you are

1175
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,240
so i would just ask if we had a robot

1176
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,160
that had some of these features

1177
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,000
would we include it in the conscious

1178
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,599
club or

1179
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,640
would dennit include it in the club no

1180
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,320
would a pan psychist yeah they might say

1181
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,920
well it's something it's like to be that

1182
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,880
robot

1183
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,640
but where are we really getting if we

1184
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,320
just say it's something it's like

1185
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,440
to be this robot and this thermometer

1186
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,000
and this networking system well if the

1187
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,079
only way we can ask it is the exact same

1188
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,160
affordances that we as observers have

1189
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:52,960
today

1190
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,800
like measuring electromagnetic

1191
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,320
frequencies or something like that

1192
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,320
then aren't we going to be debating

1193
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,680
these things forever

1194
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,440
because no one really disagrees that

1195
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,520
these things all appear to happen

1196
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,520
for systems that we think are complex

1197
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,359
goal directed systems like humans and

1198
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:08,800
cats and things like that

1199
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,359
but isn't the question about what else

1200
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:12,079
we're going to do

1201
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,400
beyond this so hopefully that's where

1202
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,079
the projective geometry

1203
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,000
it's kind of like that's the uh hook

1204
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,599
that they hang their coat on

1205
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,520
so to speak they're gonna bring it all

1206
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,040
to projective geometry

1207
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,359
and they're gonna say this is what

1208
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,040
explains all these functional features

1209
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,480
and the invariants which we'll get to in

1210
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,520
a second

1211
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,440
and it makes some other predictions that

1212
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,040
would be unique and testable

1213
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,240
so they're going to say yeah there's

1214
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,760
probably a lot of ways that theories of

1215
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,280
consciousness could explain these

1216
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,000
features

1217
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,760
like attention schema theory or the

1218
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,440
global workspace theory or

1219
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,440
integrated information theory all these

1220
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,359
different frameworks for consciousness

1221
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,119
but we're going to take these things and

1222
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,560
we're going to go in a new direction by

1223
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,800
talking about the projective geometry

1224
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,079
so what supports in their eyes

1225
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,640
the need for not just a quantitative or

1226
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,240
a formalized framework but also

1227
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,560
specifically the projective geometry

1228
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,160
and for them it's about these

1229
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,320
phenomenological invariants

1230
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,079
so it's kind of like universal basic

1231
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,760
income it's like it's universal

1232
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,280
you know these are invariant what part

1233
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,720
of that don't you get so these are the

1234
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,440
things that

1235
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,359
generalized systems of consciousness you

1236
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:15,040
could debate with them whether

1237
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,400
these systems that they're talking about

1238
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,560
are the right ones or whatever but

1239
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,640
these are the invariant features of

1240
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,880
experience and phenomenology

1241
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,240
and they have them as relational

1242
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,320
phenomenal intentionality which is that

1243
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,320
all experience and all consciousness

1244
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,680
is about relations especially between

1245
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,720
one and another system like internal and

1246
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,920
external relationship even though as

1247
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,960
we're gonna kind of see it's a little

1248
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,400
bit trippier than that but

1249
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,680
basically it's about the relation of

1250
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,599
like the i to

1251
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,560
not i it's like i thou i i you these

1252
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,599
kinds of things

1253
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,960
there's a situated 3d spatiality

1254
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,880
and that means that you're starting

1255
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,480
you're in a situated spot you're not

1256
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:54,800
just

1257
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,200
everywhere experiencing a 3d simulation

1258
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,960
but it's always perceived as from a

1259
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,000
situated spot

1260
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,040
in spatial dimensions three of them and

1261
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,520
then through time three and four there's

1262
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,520
this multimodal synchronic integration

1263
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,079
which is

1264
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,079
in a snapshot it's multimodal and then

1265
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,520
four is through time

1266
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,440
everything is happening so this is kind

1267
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,800
of capturing through space or through

1268
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,240
senses and then through time

1269
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,920
saying yep you're at a concert and

1270
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,680
there's the light and the sound and

1271
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,599
things bumping into you all of that is

1272
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,119
happening in this integrated way you

1273
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,079
don't just experience

1274
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,440
those separately um at the very least

1275
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,720
the illusion

1276
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,359
appears to cover integration across

1277
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,200
senses which are qualitatively different

1278
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,880
like a chemical is different than a

1279
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,560
photon from the sun

1280
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,240
and then there's this temporal

1281
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,920
integration through time which is kind

1282
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,040
of related to the

1283
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,240
perceived event durations uh there's

1284
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,240
messages that can be flashed on a screen

1285
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,119
or sounds that can be outside of your uh

1286
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,880
awareness but there's also ones that can

1287
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,200
be

1288
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,359
within your awareness at a certain

1289
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:54,400
duration of time

1290
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,880
so if it flashes for a second it's able

1291
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,040
to be at a time scale that's integrated

1292
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,400
into consciousness

1293
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,839
um there might be time scales that

1294
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,440
influence you below that

1295
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,359
but it doesn't become aware so like

1296
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:06,400
that's kind of conscious and

1297
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,440
subconscious

1298
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,119
but it's dealing with that um a little

1299
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,200
bit uh

1300
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,880
blurry about whether consciousness is

1301
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,720
just the whole neurosystem

1302
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,480
and anything that gets integrated into

1303
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,760
the nervous system through time is

1304
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,680
considered to be temporarily integrated

1305
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,079
or is it that there's experiences that

1306
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,680
actually play out over certain time

1307
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,200
scales that we experience

1308
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,599
and then lastly kind of related to one

1309
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,440
is this subjective character

1310
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,319
which is that it's about the subject and

1311
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:32,720
one

1312
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,560
and five are very similar but in fact

1313
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,160
they hold that

1314
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,240
two through five are all implicated in

1315
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,200
one

1316
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,400
okay so they have the functional

1317
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,839
features it's pretty abstract and

1318
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:42,880
cybernetic

1319
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,520
and then they're like okay what are the

1320
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,160
invariants

1321
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,400
almost the axioms that we want to be

1322
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,359
building from

1323
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,760
that we want our theory to be able to

1324
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,720
address

1325
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,560
and then they're they laid them all out

1326
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,079
one through five and then they're like

1327
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:56,880
yep

1328
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,160
turns out that two through five all

1329
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,240
collapse back on to one so

1330
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,040
really one is the part we need to

1331
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,839
explain

1332
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,839
in how they've set up the problem so

1333
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:07,200
it's relational it's about the

1334
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,240
relationship between

1335
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,400
the agent and the world it's phenomenal

1336
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,400
it's based upon experience

1337
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,520
and it deals with intentionality and

1338
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,640
that is gonna bring in

1339
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,920
agency affordances all these kinds of

1340
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,359
things that have come into play

1341
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,800
okay any thoughts on the invariance or

1342
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,599
the functional

1343
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,440
features of consciousness because in a

1344
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,960
sense that's what's

1345
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,280
that's what frames the paper and it's

1346
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,040
what frames the discussion the kinds of

1347
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,720
answers they're going to come to is

1348
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,720
these are their checklist for how

1349
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,839
they'll know they'll succeed

1350
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:39,440
or this is the recipe these are the

1351
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,800
ingredients this is like what they're

1352
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,839
cooking with

1353
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,880
for the paper so if anyone thinks of it

1354
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,000
they can raise their hand

1355
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,760
i just want to clarify that because it's

1356
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,680
like you could think about

1357
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,240
this stuff all day but at least for a

1358
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,839
journal club it's like what did the

1359
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:56,079
authors actually specify to do did they

1360
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,200
answer something that

1361
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,960
um yeah so stephen

1362
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,680
um yeah i suppose also coming back to

1363
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,280
what lee was saying about

1364
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,440
um perceiving things in terms of

1365
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,240
our cognition in relation to our history

1366
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:12,560
i

1367
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,640
when we started getting into perspective

1368
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,800
painting and thinking about things that

1369
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,839
way

1370
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:22,960
you get this sense of how much is it

1371
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,359
about

1372
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,720
us constructing

1373
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,160
cognition as a cultural

1374
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,079
way of being how much are we actually

1375
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:33,280
constructing

1376
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,720
this relational phenomenal

1377
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,640
intentionality

1378
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,440
culturally and that then because in

1379
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,520
indigenous cultures you see they

1380
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,160
think a lot more about shape-shifting

1381
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,200
and

1382
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,680
the land being much more fluid and

1383
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,200
unfolded

1384
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,079
um whereas we tend to have it much more

1385
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,359
linear

1386
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:56,480
and structured and straight edged

1387
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,720
so there's there's some question there

1388
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,839
about

1389
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:02,640
how much this consciousness becomes like

1390
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,240
a construct

1391
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,520
that we actually put on the world yeah

1392
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,560
one um researcher who's done a lot there

1393
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,800
is the professor tanya lerman and

1394
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,240
collaborators at stanford

1395
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,720
and she studies um like hearing voices

1396
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,920
in various

1397
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,760
uh cultures and so what is the

1398
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,200
difference between a society that says

1399
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,720
hey the voices that you hear

1400
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,400
are your ancestors they're telling you

1401
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,760
cool stuff or

1402
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,400
it's a molecular thing and it's all

1403
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:28,960
random

1404
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,200
or it's bad voices that are actually

1405
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,319
getting into your head

1406
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,640
that is going to be shading the

1407
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,079
experience of the people experiencing

1408
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,319
voices and so when we're talking about

1409
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:39,359
consciousness

1410
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,119
what if one society they tell everyone

1411
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,119
and multi-generations it's completely

1412
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,640
baked into their culture it's like yeah

1413
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,760
it's an illusion you know

1414
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,319
dennitopia everybody it's an illusion

1415
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:49,520
and just the ideas that come to your

1416
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,359
head they're literally defined by being

1417
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:52,319
illusory

1418
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,160
and you're basically just in this

1419
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,800
perpetual auto gaslighting scenario just

1420
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,160
don't worry about the policies we're

1421
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,760
pushing on you just go with it

1422
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,640
and then another culture says actually

1423
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,160
the spark of awareness is

1424
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,079
what should be followed even if it

1425
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,760
appears to disassociate from social

1426
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,319
norms

1427
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:09,839
that's going to be a different outcome

1428
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:11,920
and so all of those different cultures

1429
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,520
could contain

1430
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,440
individuals that are 100 convinced that

1431
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,640
they're right so

1432
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,400
being right isn't the same thing or

1433
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,440
thinking you're right isn't the same

1434
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,480
thing as having an answer to the

1435
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,760
consciousness question

1436
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,359
and yeah there's a lot of implications

1437
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,839
with how we actually are constructing

1438
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,960
our world and our perspective so that is

1439
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,480
very related to lee's point i think

1440
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,000
he's frozen for a second but yeah i

1441
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,599
agree that was a really good point about

1442
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:34,319
how

1443
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,400
um it's like we're in feedback we're

1444
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,240
doing niche modification for how we

1445
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:38,960
perceive and

1446
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,480
what affordances we have in the

1447
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,720
consciousness space if you train up

1448
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,119
people

1449
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,920
in a insight meditation tradition since

1450
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:46,960
they're children or something they're

1451
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,319
gonna have affordances

1452
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:50,720
in their consciousness uh it's another

1453
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,160
framework good or bad

1454
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,920
layer on top of that with a judgment but

1455
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,200
they're depending on what

1456
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,480
people are taught about their

1457
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,560
consciousness growing up that is going

1458
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,599
to

1459
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,200
color their experience and what

1460
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,280
affordances what trajectories they take

1461
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,880
later on um so very interesting stuff

1462
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,640
and i wonder like what the authors think

1463
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,760
about that or

1464
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,400
how they conceptualize these issues so

1465
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,119
just to

1466
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,119
cover this projective geometry bit

1467
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:16,800
because they write

1468
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,040
the concept of 4d four-dimensional

1469
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,640
projective transformation

1470
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,280
is central to the model as it yields an

1471
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,800
account of the link between perception

1472
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,640
imagination and multi-point of view

1473
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,480
action planning so they're going to try

1474
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,000
to link some of the cool stuff like

1475
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,359
we've talked about in this action

1476
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:32,720
perception loop we've asked where is

1477
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,599
imagination

1478
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,560
where is um imagination and speculation

1479
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,079
and all these different things that we

1480
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,480
appear or experience engaging in and

1481
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,200
then also

1482
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,359
how do we square the circle with the

1483
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,200
fact that we're so situated in our

1484
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,319
affordances

1485
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:49,200
yet we can also imagine things that are

1486
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:49,920
seemingly

1487
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,520
uh related to our affordances like a

1488
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,520
city's grid it doesn't seem like it's

1489
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,040
tied directly to my affordances of

1490
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,000
course in a traveling sense

1491
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,920
it is but not like it doesn't depend on

1492
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,119
where i'm sitting in my building in a

1493
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:00,000
different city

1494
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,440
so geometry is about um

1495
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,599
the shape and the size of things whereas

1496
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,760
topology is about how they're connected

1497
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,760
so in topology we talk a lot about nodes

1498
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,520
and edges and about connectedness

1499
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,440
and structure whereas in geometry

1500
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,760
structures related to angles and sides

1501
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:16,319
and

1502
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,880
edges and things like that and euclidean

1503
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,839
geometry

1504
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,640
is kind of like linear algebra is a

1505
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,359
specific

1506
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:26,720
uh case of geometry where certain

1507
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,880
prerequisites are true like parallel

1508
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,720
lines don't intersect and the angles of

1509
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,800
a triangle are 180 degrees

1510
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,119
there are non-euclidean geometries just

1511
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:37,200
like there are non-linear models

1512
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,280
and non-euclidean geometries which is

1513
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,559
kind of like the out group

1514
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,319
to the exclusion of euclidean so it

1515
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:44,319
includes a vast number of

1516
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:47,040
esoteric geometries and the way that you

1517
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,720
can move from some geometries to other

1518
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:49,520
geometries

1519
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,079
is through a projection and that

1520
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:53,440
projection is called

1521
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,839
a map so it's kind of like seeing the

1522
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,200
map that's in front of you it's like

1523
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,160
it's a map

1524
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,160
it maps your representation onto the

1525
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,240
territory so this is like a map that

1526
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:02,880
maps

1527
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,960
one territory onto a different territory

1528
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,200
or one geometric projection

1529
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,240
of a territory onto another so you could

1530
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:10,960
map between

1531
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,800
two different kinds of maps of the world

1532
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,319
you can map between a flat one

1533
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:16,000
and a spherical one with certain

1534
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,440
distortions taken along and things like

1535
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,079
that

1536
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:20,000
but the key mathematical features are

1537
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,160
that in the euclidean paradigm

1538
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,800
there aren't special points um there

1539
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,319
aren't points at infinity

1540
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,480
it just is like a vast plane that

1541
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,319
doesn't end there's no horizon there

1542
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:31,440
might be a

1543
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,200
angle of vision that you can't resolve

1544
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,800
below but there isn't a horizon

1545
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,119
and a flat plane and then the art the

1546
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,720
origin is arbitrary in that

1547
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,160
every point you choose you could just

1548
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,839
say oh well this is you know zero zero

1549
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,040
zero and the

1550
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,640
local neighborhood is exactly the same

1551
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,240
here as it is everywhere else it's all

1552
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,880
square contrast it with non-euclidean

1553
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,960
geometries which are like

1554
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,559
you can imagine though there are many

1555
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,160
non-euclidean types

1556
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,240
have features that include things like

1557
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,280
special points

1558
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,280
or points at infinity like there is a

1559
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,559
ring of points at infinity and they're

1560
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:02,160
all equally infinite far away

1561
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,079
there can be horizons there's

1562
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:05,200
non-arbitrary origins

1563
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,119
all this kind of stuff and they're

1564
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,200
basically going to write

1565
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,760
the perspectival phenomenal space so our

1566
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,599
perspective of what we're experiencing

1567
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:16,240
in a geometric understanding allows us

1568
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,240
to locate ourselves and navigate in an

1569
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,839
ambient space that is nevertheless

1570
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:21,680
essentially euclidean so you can be

1571
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,920
in a 90 degree room but you can be

1572
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,520
having this like wacky distorted

1573
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,800
hyperbolic experience

1574
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,280
of this 90 degree room and kind of

1575
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,119
seamlessly integrating across that even

1576
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:32,480
if there's a bunch of cubes or connected

1577
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,760
you can climb through it you can

1578
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,920
navigate in this euclidean world

1579
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,680
and measure the angles they're 90

1580
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,119
degrees it's all euclidean

1581
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,440
but your perception is still going to

1582
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,880
have this distorted effect where things

1583
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,760
closer to you

1584
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,000
are seemingly different than things

1585
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,119
further from you and that means that the

1586
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:47,599
angles

1587
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:49,280
as you look at them unless you're in a

1588
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,040
very specific position

1589
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,040
will not look like 90 degrees look

1590
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,160
around the room you're in even the

1591
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,800
corners don't look like 90 degrees

1592
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,880
and they basically say because um the

1593
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,640
euclidean space has no privilege points

1594
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,240
no points at infinity no horizon no

1595
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,440
non-arbitrary origin

1596
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,880
it very strongly suggests that a

1597
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,200
non-euclidean frame must be operating

1598
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,319
with a help of sensory motor

1599
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:10,079
calibrations to preserve the sense of

1600
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:11,520
invariance of objects across the

1601
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,280
multiple perspectives adopted and relate

1602
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,040
the situated organism to the ambient

1603
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,160
euclidean space

1604
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,760
it's like put your hand on a 90 degree

1605
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,839
angle you can pretty much feel from

1606
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:21,520
proprioception it's 90 degrees you look

1607
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,200
down it's not 90 degrees

1608
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,599
feels normal everything's chill because

1609
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,680
we're experiencing this distortion of

1610
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,520
the euclidean space

1611
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,000
okay any thoughts on the projective

1612
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:32,720
geometry

1613
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,880
or about geometry or where would

1614
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:41,040
geometry fit into a consciousness model

1615
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,520
i just concur with them that there's

1616
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,240
some functional

1617
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,079
attributes that would point towards

1618
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:47,599
non-euclidean spaces but then

1619
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:49,280
every time like wait what and the how

1620
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,960
with geometry just

1621
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,200
how is it giving us experience again i

1622
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,640
guess that's sort of the uh

1623
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:59,040
the question but uh yeah sasha

1624
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:01,440
um yeah i also thought this was really

1625
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,200
trippy um i really liked

1626
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,839
uh the 9.0 kind of pre

1627
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:10,240
uh pre-digestion of this uh topic

1628
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,839
so i found that really helpful um

1629
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:16,079
yeah i think this is kind of trying to

1630
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:17,200
walk us through

1631
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,880
um the possible you know points of view

1632
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,000
on consciousness that um not only does

1633
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,160
each individual have a different

1634
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,119
perspective

1635
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,079
um necessarily in euclidean space um

1636
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:30,800
like we're all

1637
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,599
seeing it from different locations let's

1638
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:34,160
say

1639
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,319
but that even the the mapping is

1640
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,160
different between individuals

1641
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:41,359
onto our own non-euclidean

1642
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:44,160
you know projection of uh experience and

1643
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:44,640
so

1644
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,800
i think that's that's kind of many steps

1645
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,079
to walk through

1646
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:52,000
to recognize how different um

1647
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,800
we see the world and how we can define

1648
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,240
this word perspective

1649
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,559
so i think that is really uh an

1650
00:51:58,559 --> 00:51:59,760
important aspect of

1651
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,480
understanding consciousness is uh where

1652
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,119
individual

1653
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,960
perspective is baked into the whole

1654
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,400
process yep

1655
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,720
and it makes me think about like um let

1656
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,680
me see it through

1657
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,440
your perspective or do you see it how i

1658
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,359
see it so we have visual metaphors for

1659
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:14,640
alignment and then we have put

1660
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,160
you know walk a mile in someone else's

1661
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,599
shoes or put yourself in their shoes

1662
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:19,440
those are embodied and active

1663
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,280
metaphors of understanding what else

1664
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,720
someone's experience is like

1665
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,119
and then what we're saying here is um

1666
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:26,160
somehow

1667
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,800
we should integrate that how you see it

1668
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,920
and how you walk it

1669
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,160
together so that your perspective is

1670
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:32,960
based upon

1671
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,280
both how you see it and the shoes that

1672
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,400
you're walking in so your

1673
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,520
actual embedded extended body

1674
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,280
and how you walk in those shoes and

1675
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,880
there's people for whom they can't

1676
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,960
walk a mile in any shoes so what are

1677
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,119
other metaphors that help us go beyond

1678
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:47,440
just

1679
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,680
simple walking to really understand that

1680
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,920
more generally we're talking about like

1681
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,480
perception and action and that because

1682
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,319
perception and action are linked in

1683
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:59,520
us in fact perspectively linked in us

1684
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,520
it's also that way in someone else's so

1685
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,119
it's not just about coming to agreement

1686
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:04,079
with what they

1687
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,319
think or believe or state they believe

1688
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,640
nor is it about specifically reenacting

1689
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,559
their action sequences which we wouldn't

1690
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:11,920
either be able to do

1691
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,440
or wouldn't even have the same

1692
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,200
perspective on them as they do

1693
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,160
how are we going to collaborate and so

1694
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,359
there's like a lot of

1695
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:21,040
interesting stuff and i would hope that

1696
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,960
this provides a little bit more

1697
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,680
structure to sometimes discussions about

1698
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,400
everything from issues people disagree

1699
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,240
on to accessibility

1700
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,640
how could we whether we um bring in

1701
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,319
projective geometry or not how can we

1702
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:34,720
just

1703
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,960
start with the idea that everyone is

1704
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,640
going to have a unique perspective

1705
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,440
and then work for something collective

1706
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,319
rather than

1707
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:43,760
get to this point where it's like well

1708
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,760
we disagree okay well now what

1709
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:49,680
um yeah alex go ahead uh

1710
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,000
yeah i just wanted to say this this

1711
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:52,720
brings up

1712
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,119
uh it it reminds me of general

1713
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:56,319
relativity in a way

1714
00:53:56,319 --> 00:54:00,640
um like conscious is some sort of uh

1715
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,480
fundamental it's a

1716
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,640
if two folks are in different

1717
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,079
perspectives uh

1718
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,079
and they can observe the order of events

1719
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:11,920
occurring in different ways

1720
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,040
are in if they can uh

1721
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,760
observe events uh occurring out of order

1722
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,280
based on their perspective and

1723
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,880
a third remote

1724
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,720
thing that they're looking at uh

1725
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:31,200
maybe consciousness is the way of uh

1726
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:37,359
stealth observant uh of a larger system

1727
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:41,119
when uh the system is

1728
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,960
essentially a manifold uh

1729
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:49,760
the consciousness is the uh

1730
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,000
recognition of relativity in actual

1731
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,040
space

1732
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,599
right and this projective geometry seems

1733
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:56,400
to

1734
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,839
kind of be getting there if we are

1735
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,079
unable to observe the entire world and

1736
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:03,440
we're only able to observe from our

1737
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,119
perspective

1738
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:07,760
consciousness is the recognition that

1739
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:08,640
that is an

1740
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,760
invariant across space and other

1741
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,839
agents uh should have the same

1742
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:19,119
uh i don't know phenomena i apologize

1743
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:20,400
for

1744
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,680
uh terminology i mostly oh that's that's

1745
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,559
awesome

1746
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:26,559
i i i really like this you said the

1747
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:28,079
recognition of general

1748
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,160
relativity is consciousness and so in

1749
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,359
euclidean space

1750
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:33,359
it's like the invariant is angle's going

1751
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:34,799
to sum to 360

1752
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,079
and this is going to work this way and

1753
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:37,599
the parallel okay so those are

1754
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:39,440
geometrical invariants

1755
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,359
but because the world is so

1756
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:43,119
quintessentially perspectival

1757
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:45,760
and embedded and inactive actually the

1758
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:46,960
invariant

1759
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,319
is this relationship of um action and

1760
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:51,119
perception

1761
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:54,000
and that you move in a apparently

1762
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
non-euclidean space

1763
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,319
because the invariant is actually like

1764
00:55:58,319 --> 00:55:59,040
the locus

1765
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,680
of what is generating awareness is um

1766
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,480
consciousness

1767
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,680
and then the two examples that came into

1768
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,920
mind are first off you hear a noise with

1769
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:06,720
each ear

1770
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,839
at a different um time and you hear your

1771
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:10,559
you know in

1772
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:12,480
photons probably hit lights at your eyes

1773
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,599
at different times but also they see

1774
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:14,160
different things

1775
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,400
but you get a monocular perception from

1776
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,599
two different eyes

1777
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:19,040
and you know but you can push one eye

1778
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,640
you can violate an expectation and

1779
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,799
you can see two images but basically

1780
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:24,400
when it works it's binocular

1781
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,760
and then i was thinking of a concert

1782
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,599
where like the bass is on one side and

1783
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,280
the treble speakers are on the other

1784
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,599
and then it's like the group they're

1785
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:32,880
actually hearing the events in a

1786
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,160
different order

1787
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,079
one person hears one note before the

1788
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:37,760
other one and vice versa

1789
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,400
but especially locally that doesn't mean

1790
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,079
it's incoherent

1791
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:44,160
so what is happening there that's kind

1792
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,760
of this group consciousness question and

1793
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,040
just thanks for bringing it to the

1794
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,359
general relativity

1795
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:51,599
level because also with the general

1796
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:52,400
relativity

1797
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,839
um innovation it was a movement from

1798
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:59,200
a cartesian newtonian euclidean all

1799
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,400
these things

1800
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,640
um movement towards like yeah maybe

1801
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,640
gravity isn't like a nonlinear force

1802
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,400
operating on a euclidean

1803
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,839
field but rather it is a non-euclidean

1804
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:10,799
distortion

1805
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:14,000
of another thing and so there's really a

1806
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,520
lot to say there and then also there's

1807
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,200
like a lot of inroads to quantum and

1808
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,160
consciousness

1809
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,599
whether it's uh hemorrhoids in penrose

1810
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:24,240
and about the work on microtubules or

1811
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,079
whether it's just other more broader

1812
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:28,400
physics grounded theories there's so

1813
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,440
much there about

1814
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,160
where quantum itself might fit in so a

1815
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,520
lot of points of contact there with

1816
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,280
non-euclidean geometry

1817
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,480
perspective and um and then the fact

1818
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:38,880
that we

1819
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,040
don't overlap with any other system in

1820
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,160
terms of our

1821
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,720
perspective and so then how do we take

1822
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:45,839
that and it's like

1823
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:47,680
well just like you can build a computer

1824
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,440
in a world of general relativity

1825
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,520
can't we design information and sense

1826
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,680
making and attention systems that work

1827
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:54,880
in a world where people have different

1828
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,799
perspectives i'd hope so stephen

1829
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,680
yeah i like this like really broadening

1830
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,480
the idea

1831
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,440
of relationships because i think what's

1832
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,839
really helpful with this diagram is it

1833
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:10,000
and talking about the map as a way of

1834
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,520
projecting between types of spaces

1835
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,799
rather than this idea of projection as

1836
00:58:15,799 --> 00:58:17,599
representations in the mind being

1837
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:18,880
projected on the world

1838
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,119
which it's kind of a slight danger with

1839
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:22,000
that

1840
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,680
language you know because it gets used

1841
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,599
in that

1842
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:27,359
in that representational way if it's

1843
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:28,880
somehow

1844
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,960
the way that we engage a type of spatial

1845
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:33,760
arrangement

1846
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,680
almost bringing in spatial cognition

1847
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:36,799
work but

1848
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:39,599
bringing it much more into the body um

1849
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:40,960
and i think this relates maybe some of

1850
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,319
the work with harry heft

1851
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:43,839
he does some really interesting work in

1852
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:45,839
the world of spatial cognition

1853
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:47,839
um and it'd be interesting to see his

1854
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:49,680
perspective on this

1855
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,440
yeah what you said about projection so

1856
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,200
that's like in the psychotherapy

1857
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,720
it's like you're not seeing how it is

1858
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,480
you're projecting you're you know you're

1859
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:56,880
you're

1860
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,480
um you're envisioning you're biased

1861
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,000
you're projecting onto the world

1862
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,920
you're projecting that emotions onto

1863
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,599
them but it's like what if you start

1864
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:04,319
from

1865
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:07,359
hey it is a projection you are

1866
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:09,839
in a projection you are the projection

1867
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:12,319
your experience is the projection

1868
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:13,760
of all these things that we're talking

1869
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,440
about so it's like let's start from that

1870
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,640
point of view that

1871
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,079
you're not treating this person like a

1872
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:19,520
robot you're assuming they're having

1873
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,240
emotions

1874
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,079
so you're engaged in this relational

1875
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:24,000
projection that's intentional

1876
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,400
about your relationship so how could we

1877
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,599
connect for example

1878
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:30,000
optimism about the relationship to how

1879
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,760
you are going to map their facial

1880
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,520
expression onto your behavior

1881
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,440
not onto what they think but on how

1882
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,640
you're going to act in a certain

1883
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,440
situation

1884
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,160
that's a pretty uh different context so

1885
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,280
i think that's like

1886
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,119
very uh interesting to bring the

1887
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:44,319
psychological

1888
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:46,240
projection the almost the

1889
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,400
psychotherapeutic use of the term

1890
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,960
to geometric progression uh and i'm

1891
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,640
sorry geometric projection

1892
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,400
and then connecting non-euclidean

1893
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,920
geometric projections

1894
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,200
to um general relativity

1895
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,040
and to control theory and about systems

1896
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,000
design all these different things

1897
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
so just a few quotes that we can kind of

1898
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,119
go through here

1899
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:09,760
um basically this is just a summary of

1900
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,839
what they believe the pcm's strengths

1901
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:12,160
are

1902
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,880
and how they summarize it which is that

1903
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,480
the structure geometrically

1904
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,040
of multimodal lived conscious experience

1905
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,200
closely approximates a projective

1906
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,319
three space so that's like a

1907
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,160
three-dimensional space with kind of

1908
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:24,799
this

1909
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:28,319
geometer's lingo on which a projective

1910
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:30,960
transformation i believe pgl4 is saying

1911
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,559
it's a four-dimensional projection

1912
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:34,960
projected down but we could hear from a

1913
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,240
geometer with a little bit more

1914
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,359
information here or what would the

1915
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:39,599
physics community notate this as

1916
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:41,119
our model fits intuitive data but it

1917
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:42,880
also helps account for other phenomena

1918
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,559
that might seem at first unconnected

1919
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:46,160
including working perspectival

1920
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,640
imagination inferences about the points

1921
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,040
of view

1922
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,119
and aims of others like the intentional

1923
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:52,880
stance modulo

1924
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,880
active inference and many peculiar

1925
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,000
phenomena associated

1926
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,760
with consciousness so obe out of body

1927
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,319
experience chiatoscopy

1928
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:02,799
derealization oceanic and mystical

1929
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:03,680
experiences

1930
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,839
it also sheds light on some visual

1931
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:07,200
phenomena which we'll definitely

1932
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,720
get to and it sounds like there's a

1933
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,000
bunch of papes and they're probably

1934
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:10,960
writing more

1935
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,720
so if any of the authors want to you

1936
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,400
know share what they're thinking or

1937
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,480
doing now that's cool

1938
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,240
here is an example we talked about a

1939
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,559
little earlier which is that when we

1940
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:21,200
consider

1941
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,880
like think about the empire state

1942
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,960
building we think about it

1943
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,280
um in perspective like looking up at the

1944
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,119
pers at the empire state building or

1945
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:30,880
just floating away far away so that it

1946
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,240
basically looks euclidean because it's

1947
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,280
far away

1948
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:36,000
but it's going to be both conceptualized

1949
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,680
independently of any particular point of

1950
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,119
view like you could zoom in in your

1951
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:39,760
little brain

1952
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,160
autocad simulator and imagine yourself

1953
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,680
on the 40th floor

1954
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,520
looking at a 90 degree angle in an

1955
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,000
i-beam and you wouldn't have any

1956
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,839
deception that it's actually euclidean

1957
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:51,920
90 degrees but then at the same time we

1958
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:52,880
can naturally

1959
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,440
co-experience almost this like looking

1960
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,039
up at it and understanding that no it's

1961
01:01:57,039 --> 01:01:59,280
still not going to look 90 degrees so

1962
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,799
that's what optimally allows with this

1963
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:02,079
projection

1964
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:04,720
the perspectival accessing of euclidean

1965
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,079
models of the world in memory for

1966
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,520
appraisal and updating

1967
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,760
of such models for active sampling so we

1968
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,839
get to benefit from the sort of

1969
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:12,720
statistical

1970
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:16,240
uh uh reality realism let's say at least

1971
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,119
not reality

1972
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:19,520
of having a model that's actually

1973
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,039
rectilinear for example

1974
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:23,839
but then also have this total fluid

1975
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:24,720
projection

1976
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,400
that allows us to act and perspective

1977
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:28,640
perspectively

1978
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,079
understand yourself in that space so

1979
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,079
there's the relative perception and then

1980
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:33,119
there's that perspective

1981
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:34,559
independent objective knowledge base

1982
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:36,240
which doesn't mean it's correct it just

1983
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,920
means that it's about an object

1984
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,839
it's of an object it's not truth

1985
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,760
objectivity it's objective like

1986
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,119
it's about this box on my desk and

1987
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:46,799
protective geometry helps functionally

1988
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:48,640
connect subjectivity so being about the

1989
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,079
subject that's relational

1990
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:52,319
and then epistemic objectivity again not

1991
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:53,760
truth just

1992
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,000
knowledge about objects allowing us to

1993
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,760
see consciousness as a kind of mediator

1994
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,359
between the situated organism and the

1995
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:00,240
objective world

1996
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,520
it inhabits very cool stuff

1997
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:06,720
they also write so active vision

1998
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:09,039
thus becomes like a palpation of a 3d

1999
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:11,200
spatial user surface to feel

2000
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,720
the epistemic affordances that are

2001
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,720
quantified by expected free energy

2002
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,640
this anticipatory palpation with

2003
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,240
temporal depth requires a generative

2004
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,839
model that encompasses the consequences

2005
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:22,240
of actions and their effective values

2006
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,640
so in some other work by fristen and

2007
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,079
colleagues where they've looked at for

2008
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:26,640
example

2009
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,039
reading and informational foraging with

2010
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:30,960
the ocular motor with the eye muscles

2011
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,799
and so the way that the eye scans around

2012
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:34,240
the page it's not based upon

2013
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,720
maximal reward it's based upon the

2014
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,319
maximally informative

2015
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:40,960
observation that could be made and what

2016
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,160
is that observation

2017
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:44,319
maximally informative in the framework

2018
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:45,520
of well

2019
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:48,079
top-down priors about semantics so when

2020
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:49,440
somebody is coming towards you there's

2021
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:49,920
like

2022
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,680
subconscious isokaid movements that

2023
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,119
first assess for example

2024
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:55,280
the um broad category of person that it

2025
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,039
belongs to and then they will zoom in on

2026
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:58,720
different components of the face

2027
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,559
and culturally informed areas of the

2028
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:02,559
face that might signal different types

2029
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,280
of things like

2030
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,280
um whether there's going to be a good

2031
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,559
relationship in the

2032
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:09,680
future or not and so it is so

2033
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,200
interesting what the authors did which

2034
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,000
is to tie

2035
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,920
this information foraging optimal

2036
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,680
foraging info foraging

2037
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:18,960
info thermodynamics perspective take it

2038
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,640
from the cybernetics where it already

2039
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,319
had been very well entrenched

2040
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:24,720
and now say like that's our experience

2041
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:26,400
of vision that's why even when your eyes

2042
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,760
are secating

2043
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,200
at the level that you're actually

2044
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,319
perceiving it's actually a lot smoother

2045
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:33,920
because our experience is sort of

2046
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,760
smoothed out over those

2047
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,160
underlying circades that being said

2048
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:39,200
those cicadas are

2049
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:42,000
driven in a top-down way as a compromise

2050
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,680
with top-down forces let's say

2051
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:46,079
by culturally informed priors your eyes

2052
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,680
won't know how to scan if you don't know

2053
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,119
how to read the language you won't know

2054
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:50,480
which parts the letter are informative

2055
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:51,520
which part's the word

2056
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:52,960
but when you're fluent in the language

2057
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,559
then we know that like all the letters

2058
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:56,079
in the middle can be mixed up

2059
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:57,119
because you're really just doing a

2060
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:59,119
generative model of the text and that

2061
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:00,640
turns out that it includes information

2062
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,680
about font

2063
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,200
and it includes sentence structure all

2064
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,799
these other things you can't understand

2065
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:06,319
the sentence with the words mixed up in

2066
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,440
a different order

2067
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:08,799
if the letters are in this in the right

2068
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:10,400
order but the words are mixed the

2069
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,599
semantics

2070
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:14,720
don't allow the top down to inform the

2071
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:15,520
bottom up

2072
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,000
so your visual foraging is bunk because

2073
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:18,880
you're going to be looking at the

2074
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:19,920
difference between a b

2075
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,160
and a d but you're not going to

2076
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,359
understand what the sentence's

2077
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:24,559
meaning is because that's the level

2078
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:26,559
we're actually at

2079
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:28,480
this framing of expected free energy

2080
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:29,920
through projective transformation in

2081
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:30,799
imagination

2082
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:32,880
provides a method for envisioning how

2083
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,400
things would look feel or be

2084
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,160
from another hopefully better location

2085
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,839
and thus guide action it's like

2086
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:39,599
where would i be looking at if i were

2087
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:42,000
figuring out what this word were

2088
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,599
under my generative assumptions about

2089
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:45,440
language

2090
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,720
it is important to emphasize that

2091
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:47,760
according to the projective

2092
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:48,880
consciousness model

2093
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,480
free energy minimization is always

2094
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,319
operating as the fundamental algorithm

2095
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:53,839
governing the field of consciousness and

2096
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:55,520
thus there's never an end to the process

2097
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,440
as there is never in practice a solution

2098
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,280
that reduces free energy to zero

2099
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,799
which because it's defined as this

2100
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:02,839
informational distance against a

2101
01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:05,280
non-stationary uh

2102
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:08,240
realism world uh it means that basically

2103
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,559
it's always going to be bounded by zero

2104
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:13,280
and this i thought was very funny hegel

2105
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:14,880
might be happy to know that on the

2106
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,799
projective consciousness model

2107
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:18,559
consciousness is thus always somehow

2108
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:20,240
unhappy even when it reaches the best

2109
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,000
possible states available to it

2110
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,119
so this is the uh well

2111
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:27,920
known hegelian dialectic of thesis

2112
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:28,720
antithesis

2113
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:31,839
synthesis often shown as a loop as if it

2114
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:33,520
were just this run around rock paper

2115
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:34,240
scissor

2116
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,160
here it's actually like a virtuous or a

2117
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,440
vicious spiral

2118
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,559
and it's just showing how this semantic

2119
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:41,920
ordering of events

2120
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,400
with thesis antithesis and synthesis

2121
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,039
it's like

2122
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:48,079
it never ends free energy minimization

2123
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:49,839
optimization cybernetic control

2124
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,920
processes multi-scale evolutionary

2125
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,039
adaptive systems

2126
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:55,920
they don't end they can't take a break

2127
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,359
there can be relaxing

2128
01:06:57,359 --> 01:07:00,400
times but they can't rest in the actual

2129
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,280
like stasis there can be stasis with

2130
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:03,760
respect

2131
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,520
to a certain dimension but that's

2132
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,839
reflected by this seething activity

2133
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:09,200
that actually structures the strange

2134
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,440
attractor so that the system returns to

2135
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,640
these homeostatic

2136
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:15,680
preferred expected and optimal states

2137
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:18,079
and if you prefer over evolutionary time

2138
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:19,119
something that isn't

2139
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:21,680
optimal or isn't functional you're not

2140
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:22,559
going to exist

2141
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:24,160
that model will not exist of the

2142
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,480
statistical regularities in their niche

2143
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,000
because their preferences the

2144
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,760
observations they seek out will include

2145
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:30,480
things like

2146
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,039
toxins or jumping off of cliffs these

2147
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:34,319
are not adaptive

2148
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:37,119
observations uh interoceptively or from

2149
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:38,480
a visual perspective

2150
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,640
and so you end up not seeing models that

2151
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,319
prefer those things and so it's like

2152
01:07:42,319 --> 01:07:44,079
this endless preference hunt

2153
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:46,720
policy adaptive selection stuff

2154
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:47,599
happening

2155
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:52,400
um pretty cool stuff by the authors

2156
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,839
any thoughts before we just look through

2157
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:57,839
the figures before we close out

2158
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:02,319
see you sash thank you so

2159
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:04,559
just to spend a couple minutes on each

2160
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:07,119
figure and just see what they kind of do

2161
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:09,200
and then maybe we could either reach out

2162
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,559
to the author or

2163
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:12,640
just everybody who's listening to this

2164
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:13,839
treat it as an open call

2165
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:15,920
to come participate if you're curious

2166
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:16,880
about this or

2167
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,719
something does or doesn't add up let's

2168
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:20,238
hear about it cool

2169
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:22,080
so figure one is this account of

2170
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,679
psychological phenomena

2171
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:26,560
and i think it's almost like minecraft

2172
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,560
helps us understand their simulation so

2173
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:29,679
let's just imagine that they're doing

2174
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:31,439
this in minecraft so and the a

2175
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:34,000
is like the builders mode of minecraft

2176
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,839
which ironically is still from a

2177
01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:36,719
perspective

2178
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:38,080
even though they're trying their hardest

2179
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,679
to represent the euclidean world it

2180
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:41,198
turns out that can only be done

2181
01:08:41,198 --> 01:08:43,120
like the position of a camera wherever

2182
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,719
that camera is there's no

2183
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:47,040
location independent representation of

2184
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,158
this euclidean space

2185
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:49,520
unless they did like just a matrix they

2186
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,279
said look just render it yourself but

2187
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:52,238
when you rendered it

2188
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:53,920
it would have to be from a perspective

2189
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,279
you can't have all the perspectives at

2190
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:56,880
once or flatten it in a dimension that

2191
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:57,600
doesn't uh

2192
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,960
work like that but then the lived space

2193
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:04,399
s2 which is um they're using geometric

2194
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:05,600
notation i'm not totally

2195
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,439
sure about it maybe again a geometer

2196
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:08,799
could come on but like basically what

2197
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:10,000
they're saying is

2198
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,158
even if you have this block of interest

2199
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:14,238
when you put a person's head there or

2200
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:14,560
they're

2201
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:15,839
gener the locus of their generative

2202
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:18,158
model um they're gonna see things in

2203
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:20,000
this distorted way

2204
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,960
b is the anti-space beyond the plane at

2205
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:23,839
infinity

2206
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:26,080
so i don't know exactly what it is but

2207
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,520
it's it was interesting they said with a

2208
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:29,359
transparent plane at infinity so it's

2209
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:30,960
actually bringing this like transparent

2210
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,399
uh notion back but this is like it's the

2211
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:35,198
opposite

2212
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:38,799
of what you see in some way i i guess

2213
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:41,198
it's like it's the yeah it's everything

2214
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:42,560
what you don't see it's like when you're

2215
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:43,679
watching the sunset

2216
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:46,000
what is not being seen and maybe is the

2217
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,120
anti-space

2218
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,839
and then this um god's eye projection

2219
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:50,799
are like

2220
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:53,359
somehow a transformation of the space

2221
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:54,000
that

2222
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,880
includes a lot of the planes of symmetry

2223
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:57,679
they write

2224
01:09:57,679 --> 01:09:59,199
almost all the space is visible but

2225
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:01,120
completely warped and the world model

2226
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,640
manifested structures with complex

2227
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:03,679
symmetries

2228
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:06,239
so that's quite interesting because when

2229
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:07,920
whether you agree with it being god's

2230
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,760
eye or not i would say it's just another

2231
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,280
projection of the system

2232
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,199
um or just another at least as we're

2233
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:14,320
seeing it but

2234
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,159
maybe it's in like a ton of dimensions

2235
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:17,440
or it has like other

2236
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:19,920
trippy features but this is kind of like

2237
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,040
highlighting just

2238
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:24,080
the uh the the invariances of the visual

2239
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:24,800
field

2240
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,880
but that doesn't guide action like if

2241
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,000
you're a baseball player and you're

2242
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,600
running towards the ball

2243
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,679
maybe there's like you know the one

2244
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:33,280
symmetry would be all the grass when you

2245
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:34,640
look down and all the blue sky when you

2246
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:35,760
look up and then there's a ball and

2247
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,120
that's like breaking the symmetry in

2248
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:39,600
some very nuanced way in a dynamic way

2249
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,000
but what do you want to actually see as

2250
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,440
the ball comes towards you

2251
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,199
well it's actually what we do see which

2252
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:46,560
is that the ball gets bigger and

2253
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,080
apparently more manipulatable

2254
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,760
and we can do increased resolution on

2255
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,440
things like its speed when it's further

2256
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:52,480
away

2257
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,960
that helps us um estimate where to go

2258
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,640
but when it's close we can fine tune

2259
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,880
so it's like exactly what you would want

2260
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,080
as an embedded agent

2261
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,400
is what we're experiencing and so we're

2262
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,840
not experiencing this like

2263
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,920
whoa it's just like hidden symmetries

2264
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,520
nor are we experiencing

2265
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,840
like the minecraft or the grand theft

2266
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:10,719
auto

2267
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:14,000
perspective where in our own embedded

2268
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,239
situated experience relationally

2269
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:18,000
engaging with affordances and the field

2270
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,440
of consciousness and the field of

2271
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:23,120
affordances are very related interesting

2272
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:26,320
stuff great representations at very

2273
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:27,679
least just stuff to think about and

2274
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:28,320
learn

2275
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,159
this one i thought was very informative

2276
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:31,600
so this is a cue

2277
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,320
um we can think of this visual illusion

2278
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,040
as a cue

2279
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,760
that's ambiguous so it's called the neck

2280
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,280
or cube and basically depending on how

2281
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,239
you see it

2282
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:42,400
cough cough you can either see the

2283
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,880
bigger wider side as like pointing up

2284
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,239
into the left

2285
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:47,760
which is left and right already our

2286
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,440
relational spatial and

2287
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,520
down and to the right so it's like you

2288
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,800
know

2289
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,400
which let's just let's just have a quick

2290
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,239
show of hands raise your hand if

2291
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:58,000
in looking at either of both of these

2292
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,080
option one is gonna be i see it um

2293
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,679
basically going up to the left two is

2294
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:03,440
down at the right and three is it

2295
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,480
switches for me

2296
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,960
okay option one who sees it go up into

2297
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:09,840
the left primarily

2298
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,560
okay option two who sees it go down and

2299
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:15,040
to the right primarily

2300
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,560
and then who sees it just like rapidly

2301
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:19,040
fluctuating

2302
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:22,560
okay yeah i'd say

2303
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:23,840
it seems like people raise their hand in

2304
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,159
every category small sample size but yes

2305
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:27,679
it's an illusion it's something that is

2306
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:29,600
ambiguous and the reason why

2307
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,520
is it's a three-dimensional cube at

2308
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:33,120
least it suggests it hints

2309
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:34,480
at being a three-dimensional cube but of

2310
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,159
course it just lines on a page

2311
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:39,280
okay we unpack that in a very generous

2312
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:40,320
optimistic

2313
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,800
way as being a two-dimensional drawing

2314
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,719
of a cube if a child drew that you'd say

2315
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:45,920
the child is trying to draw a cube

2316
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:46,400
they're not

2317
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,640
drawing like a logo with like you know a

2318
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,080
double helix and two

2319
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,000
you know it suggests a cube it hints at

2320
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,920
a cube but it's a two-dimensional

2321
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:55,679
projection onto a piece of paper well

2322
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:56,400
duh

2323
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,000
but it turns out that without shading

2324
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
one of the sides or adding a light which

2325
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,640
implies a perspective it's like you can

2326
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,640
flip between these two solutions so to

2327
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,239
speak of how to represent it

2328
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:08,800
and so you in relation to this cube is

2329
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,480
actually this ambiguity

2330
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:13,040
that's being um flipped back and forth

2331
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:13,760
between

2332
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:16,640
and then specific um situations might

2333
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,000
cause it to um prefer

2334
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,120
one side or the other yeah lee what do

2335
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:21,679
you think about that

2336
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:25,360
well i think this i mean i'm really

2337
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:26,640
interested in this because it kind of

2338
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:27,600
relates to

2339
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,040
um to the the point about unconscious

2340
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,320
simulations

2341
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:36,320
so if you're looking at it and it flips

2342
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:36,960
which it can

2343
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,280
which it can do and it does do if you

2344
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,719
start to pay more attention to that you

2345
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:41,920
you realize that

2346
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,000
it doesn't just flip there's a sense in

2347
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,840
which there's um there's a kind of an

2348
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,040
unconscious doing which is

2349
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:48,640
probably i'm assuming to do with the

2350
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:50,480
predictions that you're making

2351
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,400
so you know if i pay really close

2352
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,840
attention what i notice is

2353
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:57,199
that i'm isolating or tracing maybe

2354
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:58,960
different portions of the

2355
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:01,920
cube in different ways and then labeling

2356
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,360
them in different ways so i kind of go

2357
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:04,480
oh that's a you know

2358
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,400
if this bits is a corner or that's the

2359
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,760
front or that's the back

2360
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:10,480
so and it's that that actually makes it

2361
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:11,360
kind of shift

2362
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,360
and i think it points to this idea you

2363
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:15,040
know like that the you know the

2364
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,719
perceptual world is is kind of a

2365
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:18,400
co-construction

2366
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:21,520
in a way but it's it's the it's that i

2367
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:23,199
suppose what i'm interested in is that

2368
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:23,600
it's a

2369
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,360
it's a kind of a doing you know there's

2370
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,199
a there's a way in which we're active in

2371
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:27,760
it

2372
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,640
which is more often than not transparent

2373
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:32,320
you know we don't necessarily

2374
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,400
say for example a more real world

2375
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,440
example might be

2376
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,280
um you know if we look at a tree we

2377
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:38,960
might label it an object you know

2378
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,320
typically we do

2379
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,640
but um but actually it's kind of more of

2380
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,960
a it's more of a process but we don't we

2381
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:46,640
don't see it that way because we just

2382
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,320
kind of you know we look at it and

2383
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,000
you know for all intents and purposes if

2384
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,440
it's not sailing because we wouldn't

2385
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:52,480
notice that

2386
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:55,760
but anyway yeah well no it's super

2387
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:56,560
interesting

2388
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,560
and the semantics and the illusion it's

2389
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,560
like there's the old woman young woman

2390
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,320
illusion um and then there's like the

2391
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:03,679
bunny and the uh

2392
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:06,880
duck and those the semantic level can be

2393
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,560
like i'm looking at a bunny

2394
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,000
and then you'll basically not see the

2395
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,920
duck as much okay so the semantics can

2396
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,600
inform us especially when you label for

2397
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:14,880
action like this is the side with a

2398
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,320
handle all of a sudden be like no i can

2399
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,400
feel it dragging i'm only seeing now one

2400
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,000
of those two sides fixed i'm keeping my

2401
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:20,480
eyes

2402
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,159
right where i want the handle to be and

2403
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:23,679
all of a sudden it feels easier to keep

2404
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:24,560
it in one

2405
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,080
zone and then also it's like there's

2406
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:28,000
illusions that are super ambiguous for

2407
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:28,880
some people

2408
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:30,080
and other people like i'm sorry i just

2409
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,360
don't see the young woman in that

2410
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,880
illusion i just don't see the bunny

2411
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,800
i don't know what i i don't see that

2412
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,080
dress as that color

2413
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:39,120
remember that whole thing so that's like

2414
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,520
because of the subconscious you know the

2415
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:42,400
iceberg

2416
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,560
of the actual neurophenomenology the

2417
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,000
underpinnings and the mechanisms

2418
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,679
some people are near a critical

2419
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:49,760
transition point in their perception

2420
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:51,280
where just by scanning their eyes the

2421
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,280
ballerina will flip one way or the other

2422
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,840
other people because of how their deep

2423
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:58,000
priors guide their visual foraging and

2424
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:58,960
their infogener

2425
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,800
and their information foraging and their

2426
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,239
by generation of model

2427
01:16:02,239 --> 01:16:03,760
they just will never be able to have the

2428
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,440
ballerina switch directions neville

2429
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:06,640
never be able to have the

2430
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,000
duck go one way if you haven't seen a

2431
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,520
duck you're not gonna see it in the back

2432
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:10,640
of the head of a bunny

2433
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:13,760
yeah steven yeah i saw an interesting

2434
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:16,000
presentation by

2435
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,400
lotto he does some work down in

2436
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:19,600
neuroscience with

2437
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,239
cirque du soleil actually and he showed

2438
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:22,719
this

2439
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:24,400
picture i think it was very similar

2440
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:26,640
picture and he said that we mostly see

2441
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:27,679
it from above

2442
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:29,440
because we expect to see things from

2443
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,440
above first

2444
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:32,719
which i thought was kind of interesting

2445
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:34,560
so there's kind of like

2446
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:37,040
you do end up with this kind of inactive

2447
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:38,159
situated

2448
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:40,640
piece because it's like well i'm sucking

2449
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,000
something here i'm probably looking from

2450
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,440
above if i'm looking for above

2451
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,120
these things pop out and then well maybe

2452
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,800
it's um

2453
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,239
so you know i thought that was kind of

2454
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:49,440
interesting that reminds me of

2455
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:50,400
children's cereal

2456
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:53,440
being put lower on the aisle to get them

2457
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:54,880
in their zone of affordances it's in

2458
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,480
their proximal zone so you can do niche

2459
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:57,520
based partitioning

2460
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:00,239
of surveillance capitalism great i love

2461
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:00,800
it

2462
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:02,960
and then also uh there's a lot of other

2463
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,320
uh natural

2464
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,760
situations where we can track what an

2465
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,199
animal looks at and yeah they're looking

2466
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:08,480
at things that are actionable

2467
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:09,920
and that's like us grabbing something

2468
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:12,080
from the top there's not maybe foraging

2469
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:12,960
for branches

2470
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,320
you don't visualize it from the top but

2471
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,400
that's something that we can't do

2472
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:17,920
but really we specialize in picking up

2473
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:19,920
things that were above okay let's look

2474
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:20,719
at just this last

2475
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:23,360
two figures so figure three i think is

2476
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,560
uh related to this

2477
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,719
uh paper 2018 paper that they mentioned

2478
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:27,600
in the very end

2479
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,120
for more details on this family of

2480
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,719
simulations but

2481
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:32,719
essentially it's showing like multiple

2482
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:33,840
views

2483
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:36,400
of the expectation map and the prior

2484
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,679
belief map and

2485
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:39,679
basically an agent has to move from the

2486
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:41,679
left side to the right side

2487
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:43,440
so like it moves from here's it's left

2488
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:44,960
here it's starting and it has to move

2489
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:46,000
through his pit

2490
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,840
i don't know if that's a bad state or

2491
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,360
what about it but basically here it is

2492
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,000
blue

2493
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,679
it believes there's a goal over here

2494
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:53,199
it's going to pierce into this darker

2495
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:55,440
blue with its zone of proximal awareness

2496
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:56,159
essentially

2497
01:17:56,159 --> 01:17:57,840
move through the pit resolve uncertainty

2498
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,199
about what actions to take

2499
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:00,880
here the action path is simple she keep

2500
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,239
walking in a straight line

2501
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:04,880
um even though it looks like narrow and

2502
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:05,280
then

2503
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:08,000
finally it gets in contact with the goal

2504
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:08,960
state purple

2505
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:12,640
and so from its local geometrically uh

2506
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,159
distorted point of view projected point

2507
01:18:14,159 --> 01:18:15,040
of view there's a free energy

2508
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:15,920
thermometer

2509
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:18,320
and it's like first it scans around and

2510
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,280
then it's like okay

2511
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,199
i'm gonna go that way towards the goal

2512
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:22,800
and reduce my uncertainty and then it's

2513
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,080
just getting lit up

2514
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,840
and that's interestingly where dopamine

2515
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,040
comes into play it's something i would

2516
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,000
love to talk about

2517
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,320
soon because i've worked on dopamine the

2518
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,640
free energy principle perspective

2519
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:33,920
dopamine is usually thought about as a

2520
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:36,159
reward molecule oh it makes you happy or

2521
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:37,679
it's the reward you know slot machines

2522
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:38,560
and all that

2523
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:41,040
but if we think about it in this context

2524
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,560
dopamine firing patterns

2525
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:46,159
in this phase anticipatory of the reward

2526
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:48,640
actually have to do with free energy and

2527
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,239
um when you get to the reward your

2528
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:51,520
precision is confirmed because you

2529
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:52,880
already believed there was a reward

2530
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:53,520
there

2531
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,679
so actually and this is shown in figure

2532
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:57,679
4

2533
01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:01,600
as you approach the max zone of maximal

2534
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,000
information uncertainty reduction

2535
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,480
that's when the free energy is getting

2536
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:07,360
out of control

2537
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:09,600
so to speak and then when the goal is

2538
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,239
achieved precision is achieved again

2539
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:14,159
so when we think about what the

2540
01:19:14,159 --> 01:19:15,920
neurophysiology actually is

2541
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:17,280
and how different interventions in our

2542
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:19,120
neurophysiology might map on

2543
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,880
to differences in what about somebody

2544
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,320
who doesn't have motivation

2545
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:23,760
even though they know the goal is right

2546
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,360
here but they're just not

2547
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,440
even if they can see there and other

2548
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,040
people say it's well lit you can just do

2549
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:29,440
it

2550
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:31,199
and they just don't have the motivation

2551
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:32,560
maybe someone else is here and they go

2552
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:33,760
actually i like the other side

2553
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,840
more or all these different things

2554
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:37,280
without passing judgment on what these

2555
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,440
states are what level of analysis or

2556
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:40,960
what culture says they're rewarded or

2557
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:43,840
not just how can we map some of these

2558
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:47,360
cybernetic parameters onto the neuro

2559
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,120
and eventually the phenomenological

2560
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:50,400
parameters

2561
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:53,040
and i think figure four gets out a lot

2562
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:53,760
of similar

2563
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:56,239
ideas because it's talking about this

2564
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:58,000
relationship between the lived

2565
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,800
space and the peripersonal space one

2566
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,560
might almost be able to save

2567
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:05,520
and also events that are perceived or

2568
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:06,400
imagined

2569
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,120
and that surprisal and then reduction of

2570
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,080
uncertainty

2571
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:12,400
this sort of realignment reordering of

2572
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:13,280
either action

2573
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:16,880
or the inference side to reduce surprise

2574
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,800
about the world given this very deep

2575
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,080
generative model

2576
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,080
um that's kind of where it's at and

2577
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,520
those were some really cool ideas

2578
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:24,800
brought up in the paper

2579
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,719
and just if anyone else wants to raise

2580
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:28,159
their hand just a few more interesting

2581
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:29,120
notes on this

2582
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:30,960
figure i thought were cool they show a

2583
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,480
loop from um

2584
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:35,600
prediction to the uh perception to

2585
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,440
prediction of the change in free energy

2586
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:39,760
imagination and then action and so we've

2587
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:41,360
been talking a lot about cycles that go

2588
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:42,639
like perception

2589
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:46,239
action world right perception agent

2590
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:48,800
action world like that but here this is

2591
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,080
a loop that happens

2592
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:52,960
in an organism or in a model of analysis

2593
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,800
still it's a nested markov situation and

2594
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,000
it doesn't replace the other one it's

2595
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,520
not the other one the other one is about

2596
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:58,719
agents in the world

2597
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:00,239
and this is actually like saying in

2598
01:21:00,239 --> 01:21:02,080
these reflexive conscious

2599
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:05,280
systems what is actually the loop

2600
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:09,199
that allows imaginated imaginated events

2601
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:11,679
to influence action so i don't know if

2602
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:13,120
this is and it shows which directions

2603
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:14,080
different things can influence

2604
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:16,000
each other here it has perception and

2605
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,840
action influencing each other so maybe

2606
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:18,480
that's the

2607
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:20,480
other world in the agent loop but then

2608
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:21,920
here's these other processes playing out

2609
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:22,560
just very

2610
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,320
cool and then here's like the vector of

2611
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,480
time on a free energy landscape

2612
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:29,280
through time and it's projected and it's

2613
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:30,639
going downhill

2614
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:33,199
so to speak through time in this like

2615
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:34,560
vector weird way

2616
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,400
and as i understand it and i barely

2617
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,480
understand it that's where the math

2618
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:41,120
and the research is is it's like okay

2619
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,280
chemical reactions always go downhill

2620
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:45,760
well a candle burning is still downhill

2621
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:46,800
okay what about

2622
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,360
a cell well a cell is also downhill in a

2623
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:49,920
really

2624
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:52,880
specific way well all of our policy

2625
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,239
actions are downhill

2626
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:57,679
in what landscape that's the free energy

2627
01:21:57,679 --> 01:21:58,560
optimization

2628
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,560
how is the landscape changing that's a

2629
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:02,320
relationship of how our meta

2630
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:03,679
optimization proceeds

2631
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:05,440
amidst different kinds of environmental

2632
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,719
regularities

2633
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:09,760
so um yeah that's all

2634
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,679
i would say about these figures before

2635
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:13,840
we close anyone else have any

2636
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:15,920
last thoughts what would be something to

2637
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:19,360
go into more in 9.2

2638
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:24,800
yep let's do um alex and then stephen uh

2639
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,840
i'll try to be brief um uh it's

2640
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:28,639
interesting to me

2641
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:30,480
like relating this to the interview

2642
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:32,239
principle that

2643
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:33,920
if you model these dynamic systems as

2644
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,360
agents which are trying to

2645
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:39,040
uh export energy from their

2646
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:42,639
identity um uh

2647
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:45,360
by performing action and greater systems

2648
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:46,400
that they're a part of

2649
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,159
their action actually creates new

2650
01:22:48,159 --> 01:22:49,840
unknowns that they have to perceive and

2651
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,040
solve

2652
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:53,679
and maybe cognition is just the boundary

2653
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:55,920
between

2654
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,560
direct feedback and the larger

2655
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:00,080
environment they are a part of

2656
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:03,280
like maybe it is the self-referential

2657
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,280
like structure that necessarily creates

2658
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:06,960
itself

2659
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,360
i don't know cool awesome thoughts

2660
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,520
steven

2661
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:12,960
yeah well just thanks for unpacking

2662
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:14,719
these diagrams because i had looked at

2663
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:16,239
this paper a fair bit

2664
01:23:16,239 --> 01:23:18,400
once in the past but some of this stuff

2665
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,159
was really hard to

2666
01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:22,400
so this is this is really helpful um i i

2667
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,080
think this idea of

2668
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:29,120
the that there is this imagination

2669
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:32,159
that's going on is really useful i i

2670
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:32,719
think

2671
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:34,639
i don't know how many other papers

2672
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:36,480
really deal with this so i think that's

2673
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:37,280
quite

2674
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:39,520
quite interesting and one bit in the

2675
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:40,960
paper that we might want to think about

2676
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,560
that i did notice is this

2677
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,239
this it does say in the paper something

2678
01:23:44,239 --> 01:23:46,480
about how this doesn't try and deal with

2679
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,239
all the subconscious dynamics

2680
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:50,880
underneath but that it's about trying to

2681
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:51,679
find this kind of

2682
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:55,679
extra layer of conscious imagination

2683
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:58,480
or projection so it might be interesting

2684
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:59,120
just to

2685
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:02,639
explore that next time cool

2686
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:04,960
