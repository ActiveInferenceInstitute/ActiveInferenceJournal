learning and practice related to active

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,559
inference

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,280

remember to mute if there's noise in

27
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,079
your background raise your hand so that

28
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,239
we can hear from everyone on the stack

29
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,280
and use respectful speech behavior

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,360
just as a quick little announcement

31
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,640

pst last week we had 10.1 on the script

35
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,119
paper and today we're having a follow-up

36
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,640
discussion on the scripts paper 10.2

37

and then for the final two weeks of

38

december we're going to be reading the

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,920
paper sophisticated

40
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,000
affective inference so check out the

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000

or in 2021 or if you have an idea for an

45
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,320
event that we could do on the active

46
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,119
stream

47
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,159

so if you go to activeinference.org and

53
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,040
check out this aweber link

54
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,560

collaborating in 2021

56
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,040
on the live stream and on other really

57
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,960
cool projects

58
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,560
great so today in active 10.2

59
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,560
we are going to start with introductions

60
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,919
and warm-ups

61
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,640
and then we're gonna go through 10.2

62
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,920
we're going to be talking about the

63
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,000
variational approach to scripps paper

64
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,360
that we've been talking about for the

65
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,480

through the aims claims

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,239
abstract and roadmap today and then

71
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,080
there's some new sets of questions about

72
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,920
types of scripts and how the scripts

73
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,480
look

74
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,440
and other questions and then we'll um

75
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,400
look through the figures which is

76
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,280
something that we

77
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,760
brought up last time and next week

78
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,200
there's going to be a different paper so

i'm interested in acting for

122
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,400

128
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,280
for these questions feel free just to

129
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,960
raise your hand we're happy to

130
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,240
hear from anyone so one question since

131
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,800
many of you were here last week is what

132
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,000
is something that

133
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,560
you thought about differently after our

134
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,759
conversation

135
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,639
last week and so while people are

136
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,840
raising their hand

137
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,039
um i just really liked this

138
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,520
way of thinking about scripts and genres

139
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,800
for our encounters

140
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,960
and at the life trajectory level and at

141
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,240
the sort of sub

142
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,919
scene level what genre are we drawing

143
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,720
our scripts from rj

144
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,080
uh so after last week's conversation uh

145
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,520
what i ended up really thinking about is

146
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,440
what happens when

147
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,880
we lose our scripts so

148
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,840
it seems like scripts are are um

149
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,440
a framework for representing like like

150
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,960
how how we how we move through these

151
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,520
complex

152
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,960
social interactions um so what happens

153
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,600
when

154
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,039
say like in the spanish inquisition

155
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,800
where it was a process by which they

156
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,720
were actively trying to remove

157
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,160
scripts that people had um what happens

158
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,680
in the absence of them

159
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,039
when we tear them away so that that's

160
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,240
that's i've been thinking about that a

161
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,560
lot last week

162
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,840
interesting question blue

163
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,400
i've been thinking really a lot about um

164
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,160
like the transparency of active

165
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,639
inference versus like other types of

166
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,479
like deep learning and how they're kind

167
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,000
of a black box and really what

168
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,639
rj uh had said last week about how

169
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,479
active inference is more like a blanket

170
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,560
of black boxes i thought that that was

171
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,600
pretty cool and i've been like

172
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,919
kind of you know twirling that around in

173
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,440
my head for the last week

174
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,600
cool and it's almost like um if the

175
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,880
sentence oh go ahead sasha

176
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,199
um uh kind of the opposite of rj

177
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,800
for the last week i've been thinking uh

178
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,479
what's not a script

179
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,759
um and can there

180
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,120
be an absence of a script because um

181
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,520
we're we're just as apt to follow

182
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,840
another set of directions as we are

183
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,759
um the cultural set of directions that

184
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,440
we get for interactions

185
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,880
so um that's been kind of uh vexing

186
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,120
because it's similar to the problem with

187
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,280
um thinking about free energy and active

188
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,280
inference that once you see it

189
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,599
then you wonder like what's not in that

190
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,639
category

191
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,000
and um how do we

192
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,599
kind of draw the correct boundaries

193
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,599
around uh the definitions

194
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,080
of these terms because yeah once you see

195
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,280
scripts you really see it

196
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,479
around around you in every situation

197
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,120
yeah to your point there sasha it's like

198
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,759
if a

199
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,479
first-time ever social experience or a

200
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,840
very ritualized one

201
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,759
if the scripps concept can include both

202
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,520
of those as well as the internalist and

203
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,800
externalist concept

204
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,319
it's kind of like how many grains of

205
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,319
sand in a heap like how

206
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,400
reproducible or how strong does the

207
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,720
pattern of a social encounter have to be

208
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,879
before we're going to deem it scripts of

209
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,919
a certain kind

210
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,440
blue so to kind of to

211
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,039
piggyback on what you and sasha were

212
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,319
both saying like i've been thinking

213
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:58,879
about

214
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,520
like is maybe everything is a script

215
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,479
like is a chair

216
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,960
a script really like i mean a chair has

217
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,960
like a set role and like a thing we do

218
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,840
with it or it can

219
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,599
you know take on a new like script so

220
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,120
like what what about all of these like

221
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,879
objects in our everyday society really

222
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:13,919
like once you

223
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,919
once you see a script like what is not a

224
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,919
script like i i have a hard time like

225
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,240
you know unfolding that well it's like

226
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,520
the wood is

227
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,840
cheering you know the chair is a noun

228
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,840
but it's a it's a process and it was it

229
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,759
built and it will eventually not be a

230
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,400
chair

231
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,759
and so while it's chairing we can draw

232
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,679
a blanket you know put a seat cover on

233
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,120
it and use it

234
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,279
in the functional interface of being a

235
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,440
chair and so especially when things

236
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,320
become

237
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,440
um sufficiently compartmentalizable

238
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,680
or interfaceable so that they have a

239
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,959
functional way

240
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,040
of dealing with them instead of just

241
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,320
getting lost in the

242
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,560
becoming and unbecoming of chairs we can

243
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,480
start to think all right well yes that

244
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,080
is happening but also there's this

245
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,040
stable pattern

246
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,560
that i can sit on that's why we're

247
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,640
calling it a chair and so it's like this

248
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,040
emergence of reproducible function

249
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,320
and pattern out of continual becoming an

250
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,279
unbecoming

251
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,160
and so that is to the point with a lot

252
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,920
of discussions about the markov blanket

253
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,120
or the fristen blanket

254
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,360
whatever it ends up being in these

255
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,440
questions about ergodicity as well

256
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,160
like does everything by virtue of having

257
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,600
inputs and outputs

258
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,880
is everything going to be under this

259
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,600
umbrella or is this kind of umbrella

260
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
only going to be over things that have

261
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,240
um input output relationships of some

262
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,640
type

263
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,959
over some spatial or temporal scale

264
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,360
steven

265
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,519
i think this also made me think about

266
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,600
where sense making comes in

267
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,320
um and how this approach to scripts it

268
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,040
kind of

269
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,279
it helps extend the active inference

270
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,200
work with deontic queues

271
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,320
you know they talk about the traffic

272
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,839
lights and a lot of other things in the

273
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,080
models and this starts to extend

274
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,360
these sort of top-down cues into

275
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,959
narratives and stuff like that but

276
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,320
there's still

277
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,839
the the more existential kind of

278
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,240
participatory sense making and the kind

279
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,040
of

280
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,839
existential sense making processes which

281
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:08,480
are maybe

282
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,440
um they're still open to sort of somehow

283
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,519
integrate with this more

284
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,399
scripted kind of way of making sense of

285
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,760
the world so i think that's

286
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,079
that's something that i'm interested in

287
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:20,959
in

288
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,000
where do they start to sort of mesh or

289
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,480
override each other in different ways

290
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,320
cool all right let's go to the next

291
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,160
warm-up question

292
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,360
how could a different idea of scripts

293
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,519
relate to how we regulate the behavior

294
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,800
of ourselves and

295
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,480
others so depending on how somebody

296
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,079
thinks about scripts

297
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,160
how might they be likely to treat their

298
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,000
own behavior differently and how might

299
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,320
they

300
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,880
be likely or willing to engage in

301
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,560
different kinds of regulations of other

302
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,079
people's behavior

303
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,399
so let's just say that there's some prop

304
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,279
in a script

305
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,839
so something like a uh artifact or an

306
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:00,720
object

307
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,880
so if just like to rj's example about

308
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,959
wanting to uproot a script

309
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,720
so then you could say well you can't use

310
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,720
this symbol or you can't use this

311
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,079
combination of words

312
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,079
or we're not allowing anything from this

313
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,360
genre of script

314
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,800
and we're going to know it because it's

315
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,640
going to have this

316
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,600
style and so depending on how we

317
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,279
formalize these scripts

318
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,839
maybe in order to regulate other

319
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:24,399
people's

320
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,279
deployment of scripts we might take very

321
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,000
specific

322
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,079
um sub components like a certain set of

323
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,680
words or an artifact and then say well

324
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,000
this

325
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,839
is or isn't ruled in rj

326
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,519
uh yeah so so on this um uh

327
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,519
one one thing uh going going back to the

328
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,160
last question just what you kind of uh

329
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,399
stole the words out of me about what i

330
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,440
wanted to say which was

331
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,959
is a uh is a chair a script for wood

332
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,920
um but uh i i also want to know like on

333
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,560
this

334
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,480
is i i got to have a conversation

335
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,000
yesterday with eric sapp

336
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,720
from public democracy and a lot of the

337
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,760
stuff they've been doing

338
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,839
uh as i mentioned to you before dan is

339
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:04,880
like um

340
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,600
using uh like traditionally what would

341
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,120
be used for for advertising

342
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,160
uh for for for like public good so

343
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,560
uh what they've done in one case was was

344
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,440
be able to

345
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,120
uh use the same tools that they would

346
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,560
use to target advertising

347
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,920
to um uh target recent

348
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,680
people who have very recently picked up

349
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,959
a heroin addiction

350
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,560
um looking at their their behaviors

351
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,079
online be able to figure out that

352
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:28,399
they're

353
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,600
that they've recently picked up this

354
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,200
addiction or that they've very likely

355
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,600
had

356
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,040
and then give them on-ramps toward

357
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,959
treatment at the time when they are most

358
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,160
likely

359
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,560
um uh able to to move toward accepting

360
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,600
those types of treatments

361
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,040
they're they're not they're not very

362
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,880
deep into the addiction yet so

363
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,680
um i i brought up scripts to him uh and

364
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,360
we we talked a little bit about it

365
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,040
and it seems like their look at it is

366
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,880
like yeah it's it's almost like one if

367
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,079
if you can give people

368
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,600
the idea um that um they're using these

369
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,880
scripts and that they can change them

370
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,560
and that they're creating them in real

371
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,560
time or adapting to them in real time

372
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,279
then

373
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,120
um you kind of have the self-awareness

374
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,839
that can kind of help you

375
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,000
um uh moving down like we talked about

376
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,680
radicalization last week like if you're

377
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,240
aware

378
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,240
of of of the scripts that are in the

379
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,920
space maybe you can you can be

380
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,519
self-aware when you're using them

381
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,839
uh so i think that's one thing and then

382
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,519
um in addition like

383
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,800
recognizing when you're about to hit a

384
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,000
threshold where you're about to like

385
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,440
start using a script rather than just

386
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,040
some behavior which kind of ties to what

387
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,399
sasha was saying is like

388
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,079
at what point do we call something a

389
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,320
script so i'm not sure but but

390
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,200
anyway yep um it reminds me of the

391
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,160
gateway

392
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,800
idea like gateway drug or gateway

393
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,600
website or

394
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,760
gateway meme whatever it is it's like

395
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,440
using that metaphor it's like

396
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,120
whoa if you go through the gateway if

397
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,120
you pass through you're not coming back

398
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,880
it's all downhill from there

399
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,040
well that's one script it's a narrative

400
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,480
for how you could proceed through

401
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,920
different types of experiences

402
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,920
but could there be a sort of like

403
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,600
visitation metaphor it's like hey you're

404
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,560
gonna visit

405
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,360
this landia and then your family's still

406
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,560
gonna be waiting for you and they all

407
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,480
want you to become uh

408
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,959
safe and come home for example and then

409
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:05,680
that could be

410
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,639
a attractor that takes some of the same

411
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,120
setup

412
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,800
it's a similar genre at least in the

413
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,480
beginning of the movie but then

414
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,560
it goes a different way and so that

415
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,519
definitely is a

416
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,519
is a nice point there okay and then our

417
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,920
last warm-up question

418
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,440
what's something that you're still

419
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,120
wondering about or

420
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,399
something that you'd like to have

421
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,320
resolved by the end of today's

422
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,440
discussion

423
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,680
i really like this question also about

424
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,560
the

425
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,720
what's not a script or defining by

426
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,000
defining what isn't

427
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,040
another thing that wrote i wrote down to

428
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,440
ask about is the the transparency of the

429
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,880
concept is something that we'll probably

430
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,000
return to

431
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,920
many times and is it really more

432
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,480
transparent to

433
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,360
sub-compartmentalize it into a lot of

434
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,120
smaller black boxes or

435
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,720
are we doing something quite distinct

436
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,720
from that what else does anyone think

437
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,920
like

438
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,480
what could be a fun area to take this

439
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,360
script's

440
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,959
concept in or what could be somewhere

441
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,800
where we could go in the discussion

442
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,040
but if no thoughts here then no worries

443
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,399
because there's a bunch of

444
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,839
questions that will be asked in the

445
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,760
later stages so

446
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,079
good okay shannon i hope that you can

447
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:12,800
hear us or

448
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,839
rejoin when you can but

449
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,680
let's get into it and then anyone just

450
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,600
raise your hand when things come to you

451
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,639
and we'll go from there cool

452
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,880
so the paper that we are discussing this

453
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,639
week as with last week

454
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,120
is a variational approach to scripts and

455
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,680
we had

456
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,320
mao last week on the panel which was

457
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,360
great

458
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,240
the aims and claims of the paper we went

459
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,920
through those in 10.0

460
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,040
and heard it from the authors themselves

461
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,759
last week but the big question here is

462
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:44,240
about

463
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,959
unifying the study of scripts using the

464
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,639
active inference framework

465
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,560
in all of these different dimensions the

466
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,560
strong and the weak and the internal and

467
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,839
the external and

468
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,079
the social and the neural behavioral all

469
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,920
these different aspects of scripts

470
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,320
how are we going to reframe it within

471
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,240
the active inference framework and then

472
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,480
what would that do what would that give

473
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,320
us in terms of understanding or unique

474
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,120
predictions or explanations

475
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,000
in the abstract they also run through

476
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,560
this

477
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,000
notion that they're going to be

478
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,920
leveraging the resources of active

479
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,560
inference

480
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,040
to offer up a formal model of scripts

481
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,000
that's not just

482
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,720
a flowchart or a mind map or prose but

483
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,440
it's actually

484
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,320
a relationship amongst variables that

485
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,240
specifies how some of these

486
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,880
script uh variations like weak versus

487
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,360
strong

488
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,800
internal versus external can be

489
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,399
considered so we'll return to that in

490
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,480
the figures especially

491
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,040
and then in the road map we saw that

492
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,399
classic formula

493
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,279
with an introduction and then theory x

494
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,639
in this case script theory

495
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,320
and then active inference in section

496
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,040
three and then in the following section

497
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,839
a summation of theory x with active

498
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:52,480
inference

499
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,560
so that's the active inference account

500
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,600
of scripts

501
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,160
and this was an introductory work so

502
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,279
there's probably many

503
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,759
ways to follow down the rabbit hole for

504
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,079
a specific subtype of script or

505
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,439
other dimensions but um the main

506
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,160
dimensions

507
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,119
of variability in the scripts concept

508
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,439
that were highlighted by the authors

509
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,160
were this strong versus weak and

510
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,959
internalist versus externalist

511
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,640
so the strong scripts concept reflects

512
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,480
event sequences that are extremely

513
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,319
stereotyped or extremely

514
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,880
reproducible or um kind of like that

515
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,840
grand canyon

516
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,760
in the landscape it's like you're being

517
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,760
channeled along very strongly by a

518
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,720
specific

519
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,600
uh script whereas on the weak side we

520
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,799
see things that are

521
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,760
more probabilistic or potentially a

522
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,520
preference or bias or

523
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,200
more likely to go one way than another

524
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,440
but it isn't exactly pre-specified

525
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,120
and then on the y-axis we have this

526
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,960
internalist versus externalist

527
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,840
axis so the internalist perspective is

528
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,559
going to

529
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,960
look towards smaller things things that

530
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,120
are inside of the person like the brain

531
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,760
or the cells or computational things the

532
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,960
cells are doing

533
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,120
or something that the neurons are doing

534
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,600
in terms of secretion or firing or

535
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,840
electromagnetic rhythms whereas the

536
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,200
externalist perspective

537
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,600
as it just would sound like is thinking

538
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,640
about things that are

539
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,200
external to the focal agents so that

540
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,840
would be

541
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,760
the relationships in the social network

542
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,960
as well as quote

543
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,679
society and even broader things like the

544
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:24,559
ecosystem

545
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,000
cool so those were all things that we'd

546
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,160
talked about in the previous

547
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,880
weeks and now i want to

548
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,679
raise some new questions about scripts

549
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:36,559
relationships and

550
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,840
active inference so the first question

551
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,400
is

552
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,200
how might scripts of different kinds

553
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,919
whether

554
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,080
the strong weak internal external or

555
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,440
some other feature that people are

556
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,400
wondering about

557
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,559
how might they conceptualize of social

558
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,440
relationships

559
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,960
and in this case just for reference i'm

560
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,559
thinking of this social network on the

561
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:55,039
right

562
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,440
there's two blue nodes let's just think

563
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,720
of them as our focus

564
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,960
relationship so now we're moving beyond

565
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,280
the individual as the focal system

566
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,799
let's think about the edge and the

567
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,120
relationship as the focal system

568
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,080
and then seeing that edge in context of

569
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,799
a broader

570
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,840
network so what might anybody think

571
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,559
about

572
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,679
um how would scripts conceptualize

573
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,039
of social relationships and then i'll

574
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,480
just throw up the second question too

575
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,120
which is

576
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,240
how could active inference add depths

577
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,960
and tools or context to the social

578
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,000
scripts

579
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,480
concept

580
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,640
any thoughts from any domain are good

581
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,160
steven i might be curious

582
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,039
like to hear about from a practice side

583
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:39,520
how

584
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,039
how do we bring these ideas and then

585
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,760
make them like tangible and experienced

586
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,679
yeah i mean i i think this is this is

587
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,280
actually where this scale question

588
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,799
becomes kind of

589
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,240
kind of it becomes a challenge right

590
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,080
because as we're trying to net map

591
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,200
things out

592
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,360
um with social networks so there's a lot

593
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,919
of social network or participatory

594
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,080
inference mapping is one process which

595
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,840
is quite useful for looking at

596
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,960
and trying to understand how we relate

597
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,880
to each other's stories and experiences

598
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,159
in our network

599
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,080
but the question becomes is um

600
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,919
how do we relate this

601
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,000
um this kind of perspective we try to

602
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,360
take on stuff

603
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,440
with the scripts we use and then come

604
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,679
back to well how much of those scripts

605
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,679
are just manifestations

606
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,200
of embodied inactive ecological

607
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,720
behavior and we've kind of raiified them

608
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,880
so i i suppose um it becomes this

609
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,640
we we it's very much i think there's a

610
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,799
kind of a um

611
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,840
a situated um way

612
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,120
that we we kind of reenact or

613
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,120
recapitulate this whole thing depending

614
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,440
on

615
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,720
the discussion so you know like if

616
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,720
you're all sitting around a table

617
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,480
like in that board meeting where people

618
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,919
are putting together pictures of a

619
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,120
puzzle

620
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,600
they might be working with the scripts

621
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,280
of how they should

622
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,320
um assemble their perspectives

623
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,640
and then you've got someone in a who's

624
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,559
performing in a ritual

625
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,880
and it might be much more about how they

626
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,640
need to hold themselves

627
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,240
as a person so i think there's something

628
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,080
quite interesting that this whole

629
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:18,960
scripts thing

630
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,480
raises in terms of of the scale

631
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,480
question and i suppose that's partly why

632
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,520
you know

633
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,919
maxwell sort of ends up working a lot in

634
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,120
here as well because i think it ties

635
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,000
back to the question

636
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,440
of what scale is the script happening at

637
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,120
and that has a big impact when you try

638
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,760
to then

639
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,000
talk to people in a practice context

640
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,880
because

641
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,559
if you're working with a community or an

642
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,840
organization or

643
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,919
strategic strategy levels

644
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,880
doing strategic foresight they they may

645
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,039
be having their own kind of

646
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,159
um scripts that shape their

647
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,360
social practices in that kind of domain

648
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,640
so i think this is

649
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,200
this is kind of interesting what you

650
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,760
just

651
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,520
said there it reminds me of uh two

652
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,360
people like looking at a river

653
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,640
and they're seeing different things

654
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,159
they're seeing different scripts for the

655
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,679
river there's no disagreement about what

656
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:10,559
the river is doing

657
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,240
but one person looks at it and says yep

658
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,080
at the fork it goes left

659
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,600
and the other person says it goes with

660
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,840
the flow and today it's going left

661
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,400
and so in that sense um they're seeing

662
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,840
different scripts but they're not

663
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,520
disagreeing about what actually is

664
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,960
happening and so

665
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,039
it's like there's multiple concepts that

666
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,320
are being projected

667
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,039
onto the observables and then there's

668
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,960
the story about those two people

669
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,400
and how they reconcile their

670
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,480
perspectives by the riverbank

671
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,120
and so yes the scripps concept does seem

672
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,200
to apply everywhere

673
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,480
but maybe to begin to chisel away at

674
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,840
what isn't a script

675
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,400
i would say a chair could be a prop but

676
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,480
i don't think a chair has a model

677
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,440
where it is actually in agents doesn't

678
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,799
have agency

679
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,440
it's not an active entity in the script

680
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,159
though it can be

681
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,120
mobilized by actors in a way that a prop

682
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,000
can be can become

683
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,080
enlivened but it isn't with a generative

684
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,840
model of that situation

685
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,799
rj yeah i was going to say that the

686
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:09,360
chair

687
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,799
the chair is an object that can be a

688
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,799
part of a script but but

689
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,320
it i don't think it can it's not a

690
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,559
script itself and it can't

691
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,559
act out any scripts right because it's

692
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,080
not it's not an actor

693
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,520
um uh uh unless maybe

694
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,360
you know going out there it's like maybe

695
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,760
if it were a mechanical chair of some

696
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,240
kind

697
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,000
like a massage chair then it has been

698
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,480
script that has been encoded

699
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,400
by it by some other actor um but yeah

700
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,400
sasha and then stephen

701
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,159
okay that was a plot twist with the

702
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,320
massage chair

703
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,799
but perhaps the ability to

704
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,360
participate in a script does that does

705
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,559
that imply that

706
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,120
um you're able to respond differently in

707
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,240
different situations

708
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,799
because uh a chair will always be

709
00:23:58,799 --> 00:23:59,840
chairing

710
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,279
um but an individual

711
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,640
or a participat yep participator in a

712
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,440
script

713
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,120
um they can change uh

714
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,880
based on the context and the kind of

715
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,720
script that they're participating in

716
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,760
so maybe that's a key aspect of being a

717
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,400
participator in a script

718
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,679
stephen yeah i think this chair is quite

719
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,039
an interesting

720
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,760
example like in theater they often work

721
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,799
with masks

722
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,360
and the mask they might be so bringing

723
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,960
this back to the bodies like there's

724
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,400
there's something about the mask and

725
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,600
identity

726
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,240
and taking off a mask and i've really

727
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,200
thought about this before but i don't

728
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,880
know say a throne compared to another

729
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,000
chair

730
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,480
could the throne almost be coated with a

731
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,120
mask

732
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,559
you know i mean it starts to have an

733
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,120
identity and it's like

734
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,960
you know so i mean a red nose is

735
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,880
basically the smallest mask you can wear

736
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,559
it's basically become a clown

737
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,720
but they're all this work we don't tend

738
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,240
to do much with masks but if you go back

739
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:58,559
to

740
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,799
sort of indigenous cultures everyone was

741
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,480
working with masks you know

742
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,840
um so there's something interesting in

743
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,360
is there something about the script

744
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,960
which is about how we

745
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,000
broadcast and receive through this part

746
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,480
of the body thanks

747
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,679
rj uh yeah no no

748
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,039
um bouncing off what's steven's saying

749
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,240
um so one one of the things uh when i

750
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,039
first

751
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,559
read the paper i talked to you about the

752
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,080
standard like immediately after reading

753
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,200
the paper i think actually

754
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,400
was um that uh if you look at

755
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,880
uh there's a common rituals between

756
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,159
north american indians

757
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,159
nordic cultures african like all over

758
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,279
the place where where

759
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,240
um what happens is there's uh it's

760
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:42,640
either

761
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,520
dances something along those lines where

762
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,960
you use animal masks

763
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,080
and act out the scripts

764
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,760
that those animals use it's really

765
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,520
important especially for you know like

766
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:53,840
uh

767
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,520
so i i brought up to you dan one point

768
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,679
the bear uh in particular

769
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,200
because a bear's an animal that has a

770
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,520
set of of scripts that you can identify

771
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,960
that it's using um and

772
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,799
and if you don't have experience

773
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,760
um you know knowing like reading their

774
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,440
behavior then you're more than likely

775
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,960
going to get hurt or put yourself in a

776
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,720
really dangerous situation so like

777
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,480
um park services in north america

778
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,240
routinely make the point

779
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,720
that almost all negative bearing

780
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,320
counters happen because

781
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,320
people don't know how to interact with

782
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,760
the bear they run

783
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,279
um they they're they're not doing the

784
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,720
right behavior so even with like like a

785
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,080
black bear they play dead it's

786
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,520
don't play don't play dead with a black

787
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,559
bear because they're going to

788
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,919
investigate they want to figure out like

789
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:36,320
okay

790
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,799
easy you know easy meal they're they're

791
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:39,760
they're curious and they're gonna go

792
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,640
mess with you

793
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,760
um so what what these rituals did was

794
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,880
they gave

795
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,480
young people who hadn't had the

796
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,480
experience yet an opportunity to see

797
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,919
those scripts in action

798
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,440
then before they may have ever

799
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,039
interacted with the animal they may be

800
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:53,520
asked

801
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,760
to play out that script take the place

802
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,520
of the bear wear the mask

803
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,240
and and it gives you so acting out the

804
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,440
script of the other person

805
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,919
gives you a better sense of or in this

806
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:04,799
case the animal

807
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,159
gives you a better sense of what it's

808
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,919
like to be that animal so

809
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,080
um in that case like acting out those

810
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,080
scripts that other people may be using

811
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:12,559
or

812
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,480
you know other other other actors would

813
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,840
be using um

814
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,919
you know actually is an advantage in the

815
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,600
environment um

816
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,840
on you brought up the throne though and

817
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,640
it's like

818
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,360
yeah it's it's uh um well i like i like

819
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,200
the presentation of it as a mask for a

820
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:27,840
chair

821
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,559
um but uh uh it's it's really important

822
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,279
in denoting

823
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,120
the person who sits in this chair should

824
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,200
be acting a certain way

825
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,279
right and and when they don't it's a

826
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,279
joke right so i don't know

827
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,039
i was just thinking about like a few

828
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,320
things there there's uh

829
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,720
it's almost like there's a um a real

830
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,440
advantage

831
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,200
to understanding and then acting out the

832
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,200
scripts of others

833
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,240
nice rj the hero with a thousand shares

834
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,279
as it were um i also didn't bring up

835
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,760
wolves and i wasn't praised for that so

836
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,960
exactly oh wait blue so

837
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,799
just kind of thinking about like the

838
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,480
chair itself is actually

839
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,640
like supposed to act a certain way like

840
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,320
you're supposed to do certain things

841
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,039
with the chair

842
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,279
right and and i mean i'm always telling

843
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,480
my kids like

844
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,320
that's for sitting you've got the wrong

845
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,080
end of you on the chair like so

846
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,159
people get creative right like with the

847
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,679
different roles that sure can play it

848
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,360
can be like a step stool or it can be

849
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,960
you know some piece of gymnastic

850
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,399
equipment and it's just it's just

851
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:25,679
interesting to think about

852
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,399
changing the script even for a chair let

853
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,600
alone the person that's sitting in the

854
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,640
chairs

855
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,600
yeah it's like the setup for an improv

856
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,159
scene

857
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,159
and yeah the different kinds of chairs

858
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:37,200
are going to lend themselves to

859
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:37,679
different

860
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,919
scenes maybe with a throne maybe they

861
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,440
could enact a classical

862
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,919
monarchy script or maybe it's a monty

863
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,600
python it's a satire

864
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,279
or with certain kinds of chairs or in

865
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,600
certain context you can enact a chivalry

866
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,880
script and you can pull the chair out

867
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,000
for your colleague

868
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,159
so there's all kinds of ways that um

869
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,360
different props

870
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,159
facilitate or enable different scripts

871
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,120
to play out

872
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,279
and you can always do a mime like you

873
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,799
can sort of act out

874
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,520
a digging or you can act out playing

875
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,240
baseball

876
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,200
but you do need the props or extended

877
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,080
cognition

878
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,240
to actually do some of these scripts

879
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,720
that involve our extended niche

880
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,640
sasha um i just wanted to touch on

881
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,919
something steven said

882
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,039
uh that you said today we don't do much

883
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,960
with masks

884
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,960
um i i guess i would disagree because it

885
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,880
seems like uh a lot of us are doing

886
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,000
a lot with masks and um it's just

887
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,600
yeah kind of obvious to think that um

888
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,000
that's a prop that is gonna change our

889
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,880
behavior

890
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,840
in ways we might not even recognize and

891
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,559
um

892
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:48,159
yeah just important to think about um

893
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,279
how this uh new prop is changing

894
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:55,360
human interaction and scripts and

895
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,000
behavior in ways that we don't want or

896
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
really expect

897
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,039
a mask to change blue

898
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,520
so sasha didn't come right out and say

899
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,000
it but i'm gonna like maybe

900
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,159
point it at what you're saying maybe not

901
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:13,919
maybe i took it out of context but

902
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,559
um i think that we do do a lot with

903
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:17,600
masks like we

904
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,399
are right now using the biggest mask

905
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,640
ever like people are totally different

906
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,720
in like their online persona like some

907
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,919
people will hide behind

908
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,000
a computer screen and act in ways that

909
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,120
they would never ever

910
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,120
behave in real life right so they have

911
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,200
this like mask up they can create this

912
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,159
new persona

913
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,080
and and go forward in the world with

914
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,080
that

915
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,440
yep very true and with new props

916
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,679
there's new scripts there's the one

917
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,039
person's wearing a mask but the other

918
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,399
one isn't script

919
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,640
there's the is that person wearing an

920
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,880
n95 script there's all these things that

921
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,679
wouldn't have even made sense in 2019 so

922
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,520
that's the sense making and the cultural

923
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,640
sense making

924
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,519
and the tension and the friction when

925
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,399
there's

926
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,159
differences on opinion or differences in

927
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,080
behavior and it's about

928
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,720
not just estimates of state but actually

929
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,600
uncertainty

930
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,120
and estimates about other people's

931
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,480
uncertainty that's this whole like

932
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,600
recursive and

933
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,080
embedded element of active inference and

934
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,080
it's about navigating the uncertainty of

935
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,159
a situation not just maximizing

936
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:19,760
the state itself and that's something

937
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,120
we'll return to for sure stephen

938
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,480
yeah i think this is interesting when

939
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,720
you start to put the mask so this

940
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,679
i suppose i was talking about you know

941
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,919
playing with the mask physically within

942
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,600
the proximity of your face but yeah

943
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,399
there's

944
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,000
there's this kind of mask out there but

945
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,559
it in some ways it's become abstracted

946
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,679
and um like it's it's almost

947
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,519
like you can you put it on and put it

948
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,600
off it's it's it's sort of almost

949
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,760
part of the ecosystem that we've kind of

950
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,640
created which is

951
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,559
maybe a little bit unhealthy because we

952
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,919
don't um

953
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,360
there's actually one really interesting

954
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,120
activity i did once was a chat from

955
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,559
rwanda who

956
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,799
does healing work and he would get you

957
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,960
to put a mask on in front of your face

958
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,159
and read a poem that was really personal

959
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,559
and then you had to lower the mask but

960
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,399
it was like you were lowering the whole

961
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:07,760
of your

962
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,600
sort of masking identity and it left you

963
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,080
feeling this incredible rawness

964
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,480
which is really interesting so i suppose

965
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,279
um

966
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,080
yeah there is this tendency now that and

967
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,880
i think even maybe more since the 1980s

968
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,320
if i look back at videos of people in

969
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,320
the 80s on tv and that they're often a

970
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,519
lot more

971
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,120
nervous in front of the camera and now

972
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,679
people are used to putting up a

973
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,919
some sort of smiley face type of thing

974
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,679
and presenting and i think there's um

975
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,519
there's something quite interesting in

976
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,919
that that might relate to this paper

977
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,840
yeah i've been thinking about that too

978
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,640
like with the

979
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,039
selfie new affordance of being able to

980
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,559
add an arm's length

981
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,720
look back not just with a disposable

982
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,080
camera and snap the pick

983
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,720
and have the perspectival imagination of

984
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,159
being at your arm's end

985
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,720
but actually seeing it in real time and

986
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,159
then video chatting

987
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,159
or live streaming where you can see your

988
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,720
own face during an interaction

989
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,760
so it's like you're seeing the mask in

990
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,720
real time

991
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,799
and then that's sort of like um i think

992
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,559
it's a campbell quote it could be

993
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,080
someone else but like

994
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,080
if you think that you're rejecting the

995
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,840
mask that society gives you you're just

996
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,519
wearing the mask of rejection everybody

997
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,159
can see that

998
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,679
it's not exactly the quote but basically

999
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,360
it's like you can't not

1000
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,600
play the mask game there has to be an

1001
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,760
epithelium there has to be a facade

1002
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,760
there has to be an interface and so

1003
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,360
we're talking about designing that

1004
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,880
interface because somebody who goes

1005
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,760
around saying

1006
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,159
no this is me this is me i have no mask

1007
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:37,440
this is just what i am it's like

1008
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,960
right but there still is an external

1009
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,720
layer that's being presented right

1010
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,120
and if someone says no i'm all me

1011
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,679
there's no external level it's like

1012
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,159
whoa big of true of course but then it

1013
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,600
it's not a helpful viewpoint for the

1014
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,960
world because we do

1015
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,360
need to interface we need to send

1016
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,279
emotions reliably and receive emotions

1017
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,720
reliably and so

1018
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,039
um a lot there let's continue with some

1019
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,480
of these fun questions

1020
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,600
so the third question is um

1021
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,919
how do the network relationships the red

1022
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:06,640
nodes

1023
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,719
influence potentially indirectly the

1024
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,560
focal edges in the network blue

1025
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,079
and then the fourth question would be

1026
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,159
like a little bit more of a wild card

1027
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,918
what could be a fun or interesting

1028
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,918
social experiment related to active

1029
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:18,719
inference

1030
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,520
whether it's something that we do like a

1031
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:21,918
little

1032
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,520
experiment or just daily routine tweak

1033
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,960
or whether this is something that could

1034
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,280
be carried out with a larger scale

1035
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,079
laboratory online or in a social setting

1036
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,119
um

1037
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,918
so either these questions people could

1038
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:37,760
raise their hand on i would uh

1039
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,800
start with that third one and uh

1040
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,918
highlight that that edge it's a relation

1041
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,000
but it's like an atom in the world of

1042
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,960
relational thinking

1043
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,599
the edge is like the atom and so now

1044
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:50,239
we're in

1045
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,879
this network of edges which is what

1046
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,879
makes it kind of a tapestry and a social

1047
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:55,520
fabric

1048
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,800
and so if we want to understand the

1049
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,680
relationship between person a and b

1050
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,960
then we're always invoking all the other

1051
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,720
edges that stabilize them

1052
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,200
whether it's the who brings the food to

1053
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,400
these different people or

1054
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,839
how do they get their internet because

1055
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:10,800
they're not going to be able to connect

1056
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,680
if they're not going to get their

1057
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,640
internet and

1058
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,040
what are the norms that they're getting

1059
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,000
the other 23

1060
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,599
hours of the day and that's what shapes

1061
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,480
and in some ways can even define the

1062
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,000
focal relationship

1063
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,200
is again the other 95 of the person's

1064
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,480
life or a day

1065
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,760
that they're not in that relationship um

1066
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,760
during rj all right so um

1067
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,800
uh i'm just turning hand off there we go

1068
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,000
uh so on the last question i think i

1069
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,480
have

1070
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,160
um something i've been thinking about

1071
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,920
that may relate to the prior one on

1072
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,359
network relationships

1073
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,480
um so uh

1074
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,480
uh my dog achilles uh he usually

1075
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,280
wakes me up in the morning uh for for

1076
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,560
like the last year or so

1077
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,760
uh we we go on a walk at like 5 a.m

1078
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,400
um and he is usually raring ready to go

1079
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,280
on that walk so

1080
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,880
i never really had to worry about an

1081
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,720
alarm clock he always you know he would

1082
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,920
always pawn me awake

1083
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,720
um and if i like there's no snooze

1084
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,119
button

1085
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,520
on a dog it is you know he he's there

1086
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,640
until i wake up

1087
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,240
um but recently after thanksgiving um

1088
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,839
so i have achilles and my parents have

1089
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,440
his brother socrates

1090
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,280
and socrates has been staying with us so

1091
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,040
now socrates plays with him during the

1092
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,720
day where's in the hell out

1093
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,240
and uh ever since thanksgiving um

1094
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,440
he doesn't wake up in the morning

1095
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,640
anymore he doesn't want to wake up he

1096
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,920
wants to sleep in

1097
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,079
so he had a script that was present in

1098
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,280
the morning

1099
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,760
that he now no longer has and this has

1100
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,400
led to me

1101
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,320
over sleeping almost every day because

1102
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,640
i'm not i don't have any script

1103
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,800
for her for interacting with an alarm

1104
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,320
clock in the morning anymore

1105
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,839
uh so uh one i think that uh check

1106
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:56,880
you know going right back to the

1107
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,560
beginning of like what is not a script

1108
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,560
and and where's the transparency on like

1109
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,839
on being able to look at

1110
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,200
look at what these things actually look

1111
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,960
like i think um

1112
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,480
our wake up uh scripts are are probably

1113
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,839
some of the most transparent because

1114
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,359
they're the most consistent

1115
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,839
um and they're the most um uh you know

1116
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,440
kind of there's not a lot of

1117
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,520
uh outside interaction with those

1118
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,440
scripts it's it's it's uh very much

1119
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,119
like at the moment when you're waking up

1120
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,560
becoming conscious in the world

1121
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,839
so there's not a lot of priors of them

1122
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,760
maybe your dreams et cetera um

1123
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,160
so i think it would be kind of a fun

1124
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,280
experiment to

1125
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,920
to have people try to identify what it

1126
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,680
is their morning script actually

1127
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,200
is um identify where their first

1128
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,839
network relationship is in that script

1129
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:40,960
right because maybe it's

1130
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,160
i know some people who wake up and

1131
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,240
immediately go on their phone um

1132
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,440
uh or you know like so so then um

1133
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,400
uh try to see if they can't pick out one

1134
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,160
part of that script that's not good for

1135
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,839
them that they don't like that's that's

1136
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:54,640
not healthy

1137
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,839
um etcetera and then like you know

1138
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,200
bringing back to my question

1139
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,000
which i wanted to resolve last last week

1140
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,560
was

1141
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,240
how do you identify the threshold events

1142
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,920
where you're able to change scripts

1143
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,119
i think it would be a fun experiment to

1144
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,880
try to figure out like like what are the

1145
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,720
best methods for changing your morning

1146
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,160
scripts which are definitely some of the

1147
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,920
most difficult to change

1148
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,800
good questions rj thank you that um

1149
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,599
reminds me of

1150
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,280
somebody being asked what is your

1151
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,720
morning routine or what's your bedtime

1152
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,000
routine and

1153
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,599
i'm just projecting but a common

1154
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,200
response could be i don't have a morning

1155
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:25,839
routine

1156
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,760
it's like well surely you do have a

1157
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,160
probabilistic distribution of places you

1158
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,040
wake up and

1159
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,400
how often you brush your teeth even if

1160
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,800
it's zero percent but there's some

1161
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,839
distribution of routines

1162
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,200
that's the script it could be a weak

1163
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,880
script it could be a strong script but

1164
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,680
some people just

1165
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,040
brush off the question no i don't have a

1166
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,119
mask i don't have a routine

1167
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,960
it's like a way of not engaging with

1168
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,200
that but once you recognize that it's

1169
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,960
about the interface and it can be a

1170
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,480
probabilistic interface

1171
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,079
just to say a morning routine it doesn't

1172
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,599
need to be regimented it doesn't need to

1173
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:55,920
be

1174
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,079
externalist it also doesn't need to be

1175
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,119
internalist

1176
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,119
we're moving beyond internalism and

1177
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,320
externalism

1178
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,599
as well as beyond um restrictive

1179
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,560
strong or loose weak we're taking all of

1180
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,079
those possibilities

1181
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,359
and now we're just thinking yes so what

1182
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:13,359
is your morning script set or maybe what

1183
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:14,240
what genre

1184
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,640
are your mornings um is it an emergency

1185
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,760
movie

1186
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,520
is it a comedy and then also this

1187
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,119
question about the dependencies and to

1188
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,800
take it back to the social network and

1189
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,760
the scripts

1190
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,599
it's like we often don't know all the

1191
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,160
dependencies until we do a perturbation

1192
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,800
so like rj you didn't know about your

1193
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,720
lack of an alarm clock

1194
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,359
you know stimuli or script until there

1195
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,119
was another script that changed in a

1196
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,000
non-human

1197
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,480
animal and then that had a cascading

1198
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,640
failure in this network of dependent

1199
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,280
scripts

1200
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,200
so it revealed new relationships and

1201
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,599
dependencies because of a manipulation

1202
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,839
and so that's very related to active

1203
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,440
inference on a few levels just to

1204
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,240
provide one

1205
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,960
is we're always interested not just in

1206
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,000
coming to clarity on

1207
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
world states but actually coming to

1208
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,040
clarity on

1209
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,839
which interventions or which experiments

1210
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:02,960
or perturbations

1211
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,680
would maximally inform us while also

1212
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,200
remaining functional

1213
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,680
about those dependencies so then you

1214
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,520
could be um you know even when a dog was

1215
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,640
still waking up early you could have

1216
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,319
been experimenting with earlier later

1217
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:14,960
wake ups

1218
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,280
and maybe by bumping things by half an

1219
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,400
hour this way or another

1220
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,079
you would have discovered oh wait

1221
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,839
without the dog i don't have a way to

1222
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:22,560
wake up

1223
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,800
or if the dog is tired then there's this

1224
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,000
other relationship and

1225
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,680
nobody would connect the dog being tired

1226
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,040
to waking up early for

1227
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,319
most people especially if they don't

1228
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,000
have a dog but in this case it could

1229
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,240
have been explored or actively inferred

1230
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:39,839
with um rightful experimentation sasha

1231
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,560
um yeah that's really kind of funny

1232
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,400
about the morning routine

1233
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,720
because um yeah we of course all have

1234
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,240
one but maybe it's uh

1235
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,440
not not very glamorous or uh effective

1236
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,240
and it just reminds me of um these sort

1237
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,119
of

1238
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,240
uh glamorized morning routines of

1239
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,599
celebrities where like

1240
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,839
they spend um you know all this time

1241
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,440
putting stuff on their face

1242
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,880
essentially and it kind of signals like

1243
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,520
i have the kind of morning routine that

1244
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,839
i'm proud to tell other people about or

1245
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:16,560
should be uh you know a sensational

1246
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,520
youtube video

1247
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,560
that other people envy um and so

1248
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,079
kind of changing yeah what a morning

1249
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:24,880
routine

1250
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,359
is or should be and then also uh part of

1251
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,160
that whole like

1252
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,440
um kind of uh

1253
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,880
thinking about your morning routine is

1254
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,280
that it's very solitary when in fact

1255
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,839
of course we wake up for other people or

1256
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:38,880
other creatures

1257
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,760
and that um we kind of get sucked into

1258
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,040
someone else's script

1259
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,200
even before we know that we're part of

1260
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,640
it um

1261
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,319
like people who wake up to take care of

1262
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:49,760
their kids like

1263
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,200
maybe they don't want to be waking up

1264
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,599
but you know um and then

1265
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,800
how to use active inference in a way

1266
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,839
that um

1267
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:01,119
helps people modify their um morning

1268
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,560
script um in a way that

1269
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,400
i i guess it just kind of reminds me of

1270
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,839
like biohacking and

1271
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:11,359
and um being very like uh focused on

1272
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:12,960
every metric that you have

1273
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,000
so do you have to have all those

1274
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,640
metrics in order then to change your

1275
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,359
morning

1276
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:22,000
script or like to optimize that or is

1277
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,760
there a way where active inference can

1278
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,160
help us get around that

1279
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,520
kind of self-measurement obsession that

1280
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,240
biohacking can veer off into when it can

1281
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,599
be more focused on

1282
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,760
just uh yeah the the performance and the

1283
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,800
human script that we're participating in

1284
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,119
good question there sasha and it reminds

1285
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:44,240
me of just the

1286
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,359
imperatives in active inference being to

1287
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,720
reduce uncertainty and to design optimal

1288
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,000
experimentation

1289
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,119
and so instead of um in this reward

1290
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:56,560
framework thinking we're going to have

1291
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,040
the most rewarding morning

1292
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,480
thing it's gonna set you up for the most

1293
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,000
productive day or it's gonna feel the

1294
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,560
best

1295
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,480
it's all about optimization most most

1296
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,839
most and here

1297
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,520
we're actually saying yeah maybe we'll

1298
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,200
get there that'd be great but

1299
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,960
just where we are how could we reduce

1300
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,720
our uncertainty like maybe every morning

1301
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,079
you wake up and you're not sure whether

1302
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:15,040
you're going to take

1303
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,599
mechanism a of commute or b so how could

1304
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:18,560
we start by

1305
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,880
reducing uncertainty and decreasing

1306
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,280
anxiety about the coming day increasing

1307
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,240
clarity

1308
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,960
and then asking not what is the optimal

1309
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,880
state but what's the optimal experiment

1310
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,400
and policy that's within

1311
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,720
our scope of affordances not like waking

1312
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,400
up and instantly going to the strange

1313
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,760
attractor of thinking that

1314
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,000
something could be a different way um we

1315
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,960
can focus on our

1316
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,040
policies and then this beyond

1317
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,200
internalism and externalism it's just so

1318
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,079
critical

1319
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,160
because it's uh sort of the false

1320
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,440
dialectic of like

1321
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,839
worrying about oneself only and then

1322
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:51,839
disregarding systemic issues

1323
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,079
versus getting extremely obsessed with

1324
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:55,119
systemic issues

1325
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,040
and then losing the site over the

1326
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,800
affordances that we do have

1327
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,680
and in the middle um is the compromised

1328
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,200
language but we're going to not just be

1329
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,800
in the middle we're going to be all over

1330
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,599
the map

1331
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,599
and we're going to be able to dive into

1332
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,119
the internalist thinking when we need it

1333
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,319
we're going to be diving into the

1334
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,079
external thinking when we need it

1335
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,520
but we're always going to be able to

1336
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,160
return to the fullness of the niche and

1337
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,119
what's possible

1338
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:18,720
and getting other people's perspectives

1339
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,520
on the issue so that's i think a

1340
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,800
marked difference in active inference um

1341
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,839
let's uh go on to the next slide

1342
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,720
so this one's just kind of a little fun

1343
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,839
single question

1344
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:33,920
i was just wondering what does a script

1345
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,079
look like and so

1346
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:37,920
the movie script this is the lethal

1347
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,240
weapon for autographed edition

1348
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,520
script um one of a kind

1349
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:47,280
that's a movie script so the words are

1350
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,680
syntactically encoded and maybe the

1351
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,359
semantics are suggested

1352
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,200
or it gives stage directions like a

1353
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,800
dramatic script

1354
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,960
and then in the middle is this like peer

1355
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,720
pressure script like what's the script

1356
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,599
that keeps

1357
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,280
people driving on the right side of the

1358
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,359
road in america and on the left side of

1359
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,040
the road in the uk

1360
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,520
that is something that's enforced by

1361
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,680
semiotic cues like signs

1362
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,040
and um counterfactuals like if i were to

1363
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:13,599
drive

1364
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,599
on the other side of the road i would be

1365
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:16,720
in the

1366
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,280
felony script something like that but

1367
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,880
how does peer pressure play out and how

1368
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,119
do we visualize it and then just

1369
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,359
a big unknown is what do these active

1370
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:26,640
inference scripts

1371
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,599
look like how do we communicate the

1372
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:30,640
scripts

1373
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,520
and so instead of um using a movie

1374
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,480
dialogue

1375
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,400
to convey some of these probabilistic

1376
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,800
things or the peer pressure

1377
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,359
um narrative to talk about some of these

1378
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:41,920
things

1379
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,240
is there another visualization or

1380
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,680
representation

1381
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,079
just i'm not sure if anyone has thoughts

1382
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:48,880
yeah rj or

1383
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,000
and then anyone else go ahead uh well i

1384
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:52,960
i think um

1385
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,520
uh i i don't know if um i'm pretty sure

1386
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,480
i'm pretty sure the graphic

1387
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,359
was in was in the um was in the slides

1388
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:00,319
uh last time

1389
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:02,160
was like uh kind of you know just just

1390
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,599
uh you know

1391
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,839
2d representation of the axis of like

1392
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:07,119
strong script to weak script and

1393
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:08,079
journalist

1394
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,119
externalist and um you know the paper

1395
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:11,760
itself like

1396
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,040
like tried to show that it's like look

1397
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,880
these these are just um

1398
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,319
you know these don't have to be

1399
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,160
divergent views they're just

1400
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,079
different perspective yeah that's it yep

1401
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,359
um and i feel like

1402
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,920
uh you know the the actors script is

1403
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,280
just a

1404
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,280
it's a continuum it's a very strong

1405
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,480
externalist script

1406
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,920
you're either performing the script

1407
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,599
exactly or it's not it's not it's not

1408
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,200
being performed it's not happening

1409
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,040
um then you have like i brought up

1410
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,319
always sunny last time it's like

1411
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:37,599
it's a show that allows for a lot more

1412
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:39,680
improvisation so the scripts they use

1413
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,079
while strong and externalist are aren't

1414
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,000
as strong as say lethal weapon

1415
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,880
right um but then peer pressure is

1416
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,079
something that that's that's

1417
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,240
far more internalists your your

1418
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,079
interpretation of what you think the

1419
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:53,040
script is

1420
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,480
and maybe talking with people about what

1421
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,000
you think the script is and trying to

1422
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,800
work that out

1423
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,240
and it's a weak script where it's like

1424
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,920
you can even see there that like in

1425
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,599
in the picture that it's like not

1426
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,040
everybody is is

1427
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,480
acting out the same exact script

1428
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,200
and like you know like not the same

1429
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,800
exact movements whereas you look at

1430
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,839
something like

1431
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:14,560
um you know uh opposite end of of the

1432
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,280
the

1433
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,599
um the the political representation may

1434
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,119
be represented as like

1435
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,440
you know um uh or or i'm trying to think

1436
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,559
like historically

1437
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,160
uh like like um uh you know

1438
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,000
during during the third reich it's like

1439
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,680
these were mixes

1440
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,960
of um of internalist scripts of what you

1441
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,240
think you're supposed to be acting out

1442
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:34,880
but then there's

1443
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,640
also these strong scripts involved where

1444
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,000
it's like you are supposed to make

1445
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,119
exactly these motions etc great

1446
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,359
points there and yes the peer pressure i

1447
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,960
put it up there partially because

1448
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,920
it so directly calls us to move beyond

1449
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,760
internalism and externalism i mean

1450
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,160
what could be more external than other

1451
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:52,960
people

1452
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,040
yet at the same time what could be more

1453
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,079
internal

1454
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,079
psychologically or neurophysiologically

1455
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,400
than your interpretation of

1456
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,079
peer pressure and then on the strong

1457
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:03,680
versus weak just like you brought up

1458
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,000
um what could be weaker than an

1459
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,040
invisible

1460
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,000
and lightly guiding force in some cases

1461
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,319
like

1462
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:12,000
hey peer pressure is like you should

1463
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,559
wear uh shoes that have tied laces but

1464
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,240
no one's gonna like freak out

1465
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,599
but there's other peer pressure things

1466
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,040
that people will freak out and that's a

1467
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,000
strong script

1468
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,599
if 100 of the time that something

1469
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,760
happens socially enacted

1470
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,000
another thing happens it's quite strong

1471
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,559
because 100 of the time from state a it

1472
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:29,680
moves to state b

1473
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,839
mediated by an external force so that's

1474
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:32,960
strong and external

1475
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,640
but there's other cases where it's weak

1476
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,240
and internal at least

1477
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,960
in how it appears and again the goal of

1478
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,640
active inference isn't to be like

1479
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,280
yep we judge strong versus weak and it's

1480
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,079
strong

1481
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:47,520
it's rather to see this continuum

1482
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:51,119
as um an area of theoretical dispute

1483
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,720
yes but now just a parameter in

1484
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,040
our way of thinking about the world so

1485
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,640
that there can be sub-components

1486
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,640
or different people in the same crowd

1487
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,400
who are experiencing very

1488
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,559
different realities or having very

1489
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,000
different um

1490
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,839
sort of generative statistics for their

1491
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,920
decision making based upon

1492
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,839
some of these features we're discussing

1493
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:13,119
but yeah very

1494
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:14,800
interesting any other thoughts on the

1495
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,800
visualization otherwise there's um

1496
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,800
there's more we'll talk to because um

1497
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,160
it'll be good to have time for these two

1498
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,319
figures is that good

1499
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:24,800
all right let's go to these um two

1500
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,359
figures

1501
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:28,880
in the last half hour and just

1502
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,359
start out with just what are they

1503
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:32,000
showing

1504
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,240
because especially for those on the

1505
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,680
social sciences side

1506
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,599
it might be like whoa interesting

1507
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,440
conversation about the scripts and the

1508
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,119
chair and the being and the becoming

1509
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,160
but what are these variables and circles

1510
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,119
and lines so

1511
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,359
let's think about making that bridge

1512
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,119
between the qualitative things and the

1513
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:50,800
experiential and the social that we've

1514
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,680
been discussing

1515
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,319
with a more mathematical way that we're

1516
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:55,920
going to be returning to in all these

1517
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,280
different conversations

1518
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,359
so and as always people can just raise

1519
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:00,720
their hand but we're going to do

1520
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,040
maybe 10 to 15 minutes on each of these

1521
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,160
two figures

1522
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,960
so figure one in this paper is a simple

1523
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,520
generative model for policy selection

1524
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,800
and in act imp policy is always pi

1525
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,440
p for policy so this is what is being

1526
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,240
estimated

1527
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,640
the schematic depicts a generative model

1528
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,920
for policy selection

1529
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,760
it represents probabilistic beliefs

1530
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,920
about and then all of this

1531
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,119
is color coded so the first thing is

1532
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:31,200
a a is a probabilistic belief

1533
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,960
about how observations are related to

1534
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,559
the states that cause them so here's

1535
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:35,920
observations this is like

1536
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,040
red photon on my retina and this state

1537
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:39,680
is like

1538
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,839
i'm wearing a red shirt okay so then

1539
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,359
there's this mapping in this case it's

1540
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:44,240
pretty simple

1541
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,680
where if there's a red shirt and the

1542
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,280
lights are on then

1543
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,440
i'm gonna get red photons on my retina

1544
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,520
but one could imagine that there's state

1545
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,720
estimates that are social

1546
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,760
like this person is unhappy with me and

1547
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,000
there's some probability mapping onto

1548
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,480
different observations of body language

1549
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,520
or of um words for example so that's the

1550
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,000
a

1551
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,920
matrix it links the state estimates of

1552
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,760
the world to observations

1553
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,880
and a happens instantaneously in time

1554
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,280
now b is where we start taking lateral

1555
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,000
moves

1556
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,160
and this diagram goes from the left

1557
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,440
initial conditions

1558
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,359
to the right through the time steps one

1559
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:21,760
two three this is discrete time

1560
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:25,440
and b moving us from left to the right

1561
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,559
is mapping states onto each other so

1562
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,240
if we were talking about the red shirt

1563
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,440
well if you're wearing a red shirt at

1564
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,079
one moment

1565
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:34,079
basically 100 of the time you're wearing

1566
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:35,520
a red shirt the next moment so that's

1567
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,040
one simple format

1568
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,520
or it could be again social like given

1569
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,359
my estimates of this person

1570
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:44,000
what do i estimate the transition matrix

1571
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:44,559
is

1572
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,800
so knowing this person they get unhappy

1573
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,599
really fast

1574
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:49,200
but it's really easy to bring them back

1575
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,960
to being happy or

1576
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,400
they're always happy but once they get

1577
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,680
unhappy they're going to stay in that

1578
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,640
state for a while

1579
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,720
so you can imagine like a matrix where

1580
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,200
the on and off diagonals are different

1581
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,240
values

1582
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,720
and that captures whether once somebody

1583
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,160
is in a certain state is it an

1584
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,640
attractor state or a dwell state is it a

1585
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:07,440
state that they

1586
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,839
evacuate very rapidly like balancing on

1587
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:10,640
one foot

1588
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,160
so that's what's captured in this b

1589
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,520
matrix is how things change through time

1590
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,000
d is the initial conditions so those are

1591
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
states prior to sampling the world

1592
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,760
so that's like when we start having a

1593
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,200
conversation

1594
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,240
i am estimating your initial con

1595
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,720
conditions for that conversation um it's

1596
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,079
not that i know nothing about you i'm

1597
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,000
bringing in my estimate of before

1598
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,359
the conversation before i started

1599
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:35,119
sampling in this epoch

1600
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:38,640
where were you at and then in

1601
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,400
the top we have g which includes c

1602
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,400
which is the preferences in the outcome

1603
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,160
matrices and so g

1604
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,640
that's definitely um uh unpacking

1605
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,319
equations for another day

1606
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:52,640
for 11 as well as for other discussions

1607
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,400
but let's just clarify this

1608
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,440
upper half g bears on the selection of

1609
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,400
policy

1610
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,880
that's why in active inference we're so

1611
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,480
obsessed with free energy and how it

1612
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,000
relates to control theory

1613
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,800
cybernetics policy selection because all

1614
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,800
of the coolness of free energy

1615
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,240
is that it's a different way of thinking

1616
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,880
about how policy selection occurs

1617
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,880
so that's why g has an arrow pointing

1618
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,000
down to pi

1619
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,040
now pi is influencing only

1620
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,599
b's so this is what's pretty interesting

1621
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:22,319
is

1622
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:24,640
what is being estimated by the agent is

1623
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,680
like this whole

1624
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,800
graph okay but the connections within

1625
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:29,680
the model

1626
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,000
that are relevant are not from policy to

1627
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,960
state

1628
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,280
so it's not saying how will states be

1629
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,359
different as a function of me with this

1630
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:38,640
investing strategy

1631
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,200
or of me with this social strategy or me

1632
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,240
with this navigation

1633
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,520
strategy how will the states be

1634
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,680
different actually it's

1635
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:49,040
policy to state transition matrices

1636
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,680
so this is like saying if i undertake a

1637
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,480
policy where i exercise every day

1638
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,280
then i believe that the state transition

1639
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,079
matrix

1640
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:00,079
from being unhealthy to being healthy

1641
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:01,599
will be modified

1642
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:03,520
not that i will move from unhealthy to

1643
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,359
healthy that's the state estimator

1644
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:07,119
that'd be policy to state

1645
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,880
and it does result in the same

1646
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,880
conclusion functionally

1647
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,800
but it's actually very very different

1648
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,160
from a mathematical

1649
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,280
and from a programmatic standpoint to

1650
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,839
say that the policy estimate bears on

1651
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,480
how states transition into each other

1652
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,400
not just at the first level of what the

1653
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,440
states will be

1654
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,319
so again i can do policy one two three

1655
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:29,280
four five

1656
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,640
and instead of saying well if i do

1657
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,640
policy one then i would estimate that

1658
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,319
this state is most likely and if i do

1659
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:35,280
policy two

1660
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,599
this state is most likely that's the old

1661
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:38,640
way of thinking

1662
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,760
the b matrix way of thinking is under

1663
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,200
policy one

1664
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,640
the world is apt to change in this way

1665
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,119
under policy two the world is apt to

1666
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,640
change in this way

1667
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,280
and then that is related back to

1668
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,200
affordances and preferences

1669
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,880
in the c matrix as well as other

1670
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,960
components of g that include for like

1671
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,960
the curiosity and the maintenance

1672
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,160
of rewarding states and all these other

1673
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,720
features so what this graph is showing

1674
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,240
again just to sort of close out this

1675
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:08,640
little

1676
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:12,240
section is we're unpacking this idea of

1677
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,240
policy selection so just like if we were

1678
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,920
picking out how to drive from point a to

1679
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:16,720
point b

1680
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,520
we're unpacking this policy selection

1681
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,880
with an eye towards

1682
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,880
social interactions so where the state

1683
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,000
estimates are like

1684
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,680
whether the person is happy or unhappy

1685
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,599
with me what are the observations i'm

1686
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:28,160
going to see

1687
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,760
and how do those get mapped to each

1688
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,760
other what is their state through time

1689
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,200
or my state their time

1690
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,359
and then how does that change what were

1691
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:37,119
the initial conditions that set up the

1692
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:38,960
first observation we got

1693
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,079
and then as a function of a lot of cool

1694
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,240
stuff the sort of bulk of the iceberg

1695
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,760
in g how can policies be selected

1696
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,240
to shape the way that states transition

1697
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,520
to each other

1698
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,000
in a way that's most aligned with how i

1699
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
want the world to be

1700
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
and then agents that succeed and not

1701
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,040
succeed in those that don't

1702
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,599
don't so i hope that that sort of

1703
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:02,640
conveyed some of the

1704
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,680
attributes of this graph any thoughts or

1705
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,079
questions or what what's another context

1706
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:09,760
where this graph could be

1707
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:17,040
sort of lifted up and placed down upon

1708
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,599
yeah so while people are thinking and

1709
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:20,160
raising

1710
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,440
their hand um again

1711
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,400
i would just try to give one more bridge

1712
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,280
to the

1713
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,000
onboarding to active inference side

1714
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,760
because for those who are familiar with

1715
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:32,720
the formalism

1716
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,960
this is not even the full formalism

1717
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:35,839
they've probably

1718
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:38,880
already seen more expanded versions but

1719
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:39,680
for those

1720
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,400
for whom this type of diagram is

1721
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,520
relatively novel

1722
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,319
in a social sciences setting just always

1723
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:47,760
keep in mind that no matter

1724
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,079
how many letters how many edges

1725
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:50,880
superscript

1726
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,680
subscript greek letters you know

1727
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,040
cyrillic letters

1728
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,520
whatever there is we're trying to just

1729
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,480
be specific

1730
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,040
about what we're talking about and find

1731
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,200
a generalization or structure

1732
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,680
that allows us to map structurally

1733
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,400
analogies from different social settings

1734
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,200
so this could be um so many different

1735
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,359
systems will fit under this

1736
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:16,720
type of model as well as and importantly

1737
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,799
that strong versus weak internal versus

1738
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:20,079
external

1739
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:22,000
idea that we were talking about earlier

1740
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
so we can have the initial conditions be

1741
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,920
me going outside with no shoes and

1742
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,760
here's somebody else estimating

1743
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,440
um things about me or me estimating

1744
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,880
things about other people

1745
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,559
or this could be um the initial

1746
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:33,920
conditions of hamlet

1747
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,920
in a given production or this could be

1748
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,839
the initial conditions of 2020

1749
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:40,480
and so how in all of those different

1750
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,720
areas that qualitatively we were talking

1751
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,799
about how scripts could be used

1752
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:47,280
how are we gonna find a sort of uh

1753
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,319
skeleton

1754
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:50,880
scaffold that all these other situations

1755
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,520
will be able to kind of hang on

1756
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,680
in a way that respects the specifics

1757
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,280
about their situation

1758
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,839
um as well as might even provide us with

1759
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:00,319
new

1760
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:03,359
knowledge so for some of you that might

1761
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:05,200
be hearing it twice the same way in a

1762
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,280
row for some of you it might be zero

1763
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:10,559
and maybe for others it's in the middle

1764
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,720
any thoughts though before we go to the

1765
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,960
next figure which is probably a bit

1766
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,480
richer all right let's look at the next

1767
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,680
figure so anyways this was the skeleton

1768
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,079
generative model so hopefully we just

1769
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:25,680
familiarized ourselves with

1770
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,920
the idea that things about social

1771
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:28,960
situations

1772
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,520
could be abstracted and represented with

1773
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,000
uh

1774
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,640
vectors and matrices and policy now

1775
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:35,760
we're going to take that

1776
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,319
to and here's in the paper where they

1777
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:38,960
write about

1778
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:42,000
how that could map now let's look at a

1779
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,720
little bit more expanded of an example

1780
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:48,079
okay so now we're looking at not just

1781
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:48,960
the agent

1782
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,760
but also the agent and the world or what

1783
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,520
are called here the internal realizer

1784
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:54,880
and the external realizer

1785
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,520
because in figure one we were just

1786
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,000
looking

1787
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,200
at basically the internalist perspective

1788
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,960
we were just looking at you know you

1789
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,400
could imagine that a brain were doing

1790
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,920
that or a computer were doing that but

1791
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,440
there's nothing about the world there's

1792
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:07,920
no

1793
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,240
there's an estimate of the world state

1794
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,040
but there isn't

1795
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,920
an actual world state in this model so

1796
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,559
this is purely internal to the agent

1797
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:19,200
now let's look at figure two figure two

1798
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,640
is where we're going to start to

1799
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,720
bring in the world and we're gonna bring

1800
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,559
it in at a very specific position

1801
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:27,599
and that is generating the observations

1802
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:30,079
that's really crucial the world doesn't

1803
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:31,040
intervene

1804
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:34,000
by jumping into the internal model now

1805
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:34,720
it might

1806
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,200
in reality this is the

1807
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,599
instrumentationalism of active

1808
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,520
inferences we're going to model it as if

1809
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,359
the only interface that the world could

1810
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:41,920
have

1811
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,040
is with observations and so in this

1812
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,920
figure one the only inputs to the model

1813
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,400
were basically the initial conditions

1814
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:50,960
and then

1815
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,119
the observables and now we're picking

1816
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:54,640
right up here at the bottom of the

1817
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:55,119
figure

1818
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:57,920
and we're gonna graft the world in so

1819
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,680
here's those observations

1820
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,280
and those observations are being

1821
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,200
generated by world states

1822
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,000
which are 11 so here reading from the

1823
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:06,799
caption

1824
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:08,319
on the side of the external world

1825
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:10,079
there's only one process in play which

1826
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:12,000
is the likelihood of observation states

1827
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:12,559
the world

1828
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:15,440
11 and the transitions between these

1829
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,000
states

1830
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,520
in nine that's down here okay so

1831
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:23,599
this from the point of view of the agent

1832
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:25,920
is the generative process that's

1833
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,520
creating the observations

1834
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,440
so like there's a shirt that's

1835
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,280
generating the red photons

1836
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:34,079
that is hitting my retina for example

1837
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:35,680
but here's what's really interesting is

1838
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:36,799
this model

1839
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:40,960
of hidden state mapping observation

1840
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:44,559
transition matrix change in state

1841
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:48,240
emittance matrix observation again that

1842
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:51,440
is what we just saw in figure one

1843
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,160
flipped 180 degrees state estimate and

1844
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,599
transition matrix and then leading to

1845
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:57,040
observations

1846
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,359
that is this deep and fundamental

1847
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:00,400
symmetry

1848
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,559
that has been explored by axel constant

1849
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:04,640
and yella brunenberg and others

1850
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,359
it's this idea that we're gonna do this

1851
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:09,200
mathematical phrasing where like

1852
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,280
we know which side we're on we know

1853
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,280
which side is the internal side and

1854
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,920
which side is enclosed by the epithelium

1855
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,599
but mathematically

1856
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:21,200
look at 7 5 8 5 7

1857
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,640
and similarly 11 10 9 10 11.

1858
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:27,280
here you just have observation in the

1859
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:27,760
middle

1860
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,920
it's on the interface that's like the

1861
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,160
retina being hit by the photon

1862
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,640
and then there's a mapping on the

1863
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,000
internal side

1864
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,480
from the agent through some type of

1865
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:39,680
likelihood matrix

1866
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,640
to the observations so the agent is like

1867
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:43,520
reading

1868
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,440
it's trying to say what is the hidden

1869
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,200
state five given

1870
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,599
observation so what is the best seven to

1871
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:52,000
estimate five given the observation and

1872
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:52,640
then

1873
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,599
what is 8 what's the transition matrix

1874
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:56,880
from 5 to 5

1875
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,640
and then similarly for the next time

1876
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,960
step and then on the other side it's the

1877
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,240
exact same

1878
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,319
except the key difference is that in the

1879
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:07,440
case of the internal agents we have six

1880
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,079
and so in six we have policy here it's a

1881
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:11,359
flirting policy

1882
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:13,920
but in the world there are things that

1883
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:14,559
change

1884
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:16,720
state to stay in the world but we don't

1885
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:19,119
have policy control we don't have agency

1886
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:20,880
over those states

1887
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,400
and so then in order to select policy

1888
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,200
we have that g and that's kind of where

1889
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,039
we see the similarity to figure

1890
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:33,280
one so um it's just a very interesting

1891
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,079
formulation

1892
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:35,520
i'm sure each person is going to see

1893
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,119
their own thing in it and let's

1894
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:39,359
you know have some conversation or

1895
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,400
questions about

1896
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,200
uh what's unclear here but we're setting

1897
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:43,599
up

1898
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:45,920
the world and the agent the heuristic

1899
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,680
description of the generative model of

1900
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,280
the niche and of the agent

1901
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,280
we're setting them up in this

1902
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,799
intertwined and uh

1903
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:56,079
inextricable but also deeply symmetrical

1904
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:56,960
way

1905
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,720
where if it was an agent who's like an

1906
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,720
organism and the niche is the forest

1907
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,880
so the forest doesn't enact any strategy

1908
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,640
it has a certain layout of acorns but

1909
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:05,599
that's not

1910
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:07,440
a strategy that's like a chair for the

1911
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,440
squirrel and then the squirrel is the

1912
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,960
active inferring agent that's going to

1913
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,720
be doing things in this forest

1914
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:15,680
so we can capture that here but also if

1915
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:16,240
it was

1916
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,960
squirrel versus squirrel combat and each

1917
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:19,599
squirrel

1918
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:20,960
was going to be having a generative

1919
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,720
model of the other squirrel

1920
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,880
having a generative model of it these

1921
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:25,760
are higher

1922
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,640
order theory of mind recursive theory of

1923
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:29,440
mind

1924
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,599
it would be embedded in recursive

1925
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:32,799
because it'd be like about

1926
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:34,559
other active inference agents in the

1927
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:36,319
world and it could be

1928
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:38,640
deep it could be temporally deep it

1929
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,720
could include counter factuals it could

1930
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:41,359
include

1931
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:43,440
affect or valence that's what we'll be

1932
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,119
talking about in 11.

1933
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:47,520
but it's set up in this way that's very

1934
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,880
parsimonious

1935
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,440
because in the limit it allows for a

1936
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,559
true symmetry

1937
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:55,440
across the interface across the blanket

1938
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,559
in the niche

1939
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:58,160
where the niche can be learning and

1940
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,079
making a model of the agent and vice

1941
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:00,960
versa

1942
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,599
so in the extreme it allows for that

1943
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:04,880
type of richness of

1944
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:08,319
agent agent dynamics or this could be

1945
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:09,200
reduced to two

1946
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,440
inanimate objects so if there's two

1947
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:12,640
rocks that are just you know

1948
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,200
two bumps on a log and they're not doing

1949
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,200
free energy minimization or recursive

1950
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,039
estimation of anything they're just

1951
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:20,400
doing what they're doing with a certain

1952
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,000
state transition matrix

1953
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,160
that can be captured within a reduced

1954
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,640
version of this framework so

1955
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,200
yeah not trying to rant on it but i just

1956
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,559
think that's kind of an interesting

1957
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:31,359
piece of it

1958
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:33,599
and we often come back to this idea of

1959
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:35,280
niche construction and it's like

1960
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,039
wait isn't control theory about what's

1961
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,319
the best strategy

1962
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:40,160
where is niche construction coming into

1963
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:43,359
play internalism externalism

1964
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:44,960
it's like we're moving beyond

1965
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,720
internalism and externalism

1966
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,559
because we're saying you always need

1967
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:51,039
both you're always going to need both

1968
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:53,039
and there's going to be many types of

1969
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:54,319
interfaces

1970
01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:57,359
one important interface is seven

1971
01:04:57,359 --> 01:04:59,200
and observations which is like the

1972
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,200
sensory states the sensory

1973
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:04,000
capacities of the organism the umvelt

1974
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:04,880
and the actual

1975
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:07,119
observations themself that's like the

1976
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:08,000
handshake

1977
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,640
or the api call that actually crosses

1978
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:11,520
the interface

1979
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,440
those are critical but almost by

1980
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,359
definition because if there's something

1981
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:16,880
that doesn't cross the interface

1982
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,359
on the inbound side like a sense data

1983
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,240
that doesn't hit

1984
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:23,039
a neuron or on the outbound side like an

1985
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:24,720
action that doesn't act

1986
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,400
if it doesn't cross the interface and

1987
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,920
make the connection it's almost like it

1988
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,039
didn't happen

1989
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:31,920
and so we define the interface in terms

1990
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:32,480
of

1991
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:35,680
the connections that do happen and then

1992
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,440
we can always be sure to be talking

1993
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,599
about relevant features of the world

1994
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:42,400
and always in a way that moves beyond

1995
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:42,960
simple

1996
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,039
conceptions of internalist versus

1997
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:46,000
externalist

1998
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,880
will have the ability to find situations

1999
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:49,440
where

2000
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,079
the internal features given a certain

2001
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:53,839
blanket of analysis

2002
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:56,319
dominate the dynamics of the system or

2003
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:57,920
where given the inclusion of certain

2004
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,680
parameters in a certain time scale of

2005
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:00,480
analysis

2006
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:03,119
the external features dominate it but no

2007
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:04,000
one can say that's really

2008
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,240
a win for externalism or a win for

2009
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:07,280
internalism

2010
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,440
it's just a description of a situation

2011
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:10,960
so um

2012
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,559
i think it's an example about how we

2013
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:14,079
move beyond some of these

2014
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:17,359
theoretical um and literature grounded

2015
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:20,559
abstractions with a more

2016
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:23,039
abstract and general framework that

2017
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:25,839
actually lets us be more specific

2018
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:28,240
in the projects so we kind of escape

2019
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,920
this uncanny valley of

2020
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,000
whose team is better internalism or

2021
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,039
externalism

2022
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:34,880
we're going to escape that valley by

2023
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,079
taking one step

2024
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:38,720
towards abstraction by like whoa what if

2025
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,400
we thought about the agent and the world

2026
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,039
as

2027
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,119
acting across an interface in the most

2028
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:44,799
general possible way

2029
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:46,480
but it turns out that by framing it as

2030
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,559
an interface we're going to be able to

2031
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:49,920
be very very specific

2032
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,559
about the narratives of radicalization

2033
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:53,039
or

2034
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:55,039
the kinds of cues that are exchanged in

2035
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:56,559
a flirting relationship

2036
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:58,079
whereas if you're in the debate of

2037
01:06:58,079 --> 01:06:59,760
internalism externalism

2038
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,039
you could have whole academic

2039
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:02,960
conferences on

2040
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,640
narratives of radicalization or

2041
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:06,000
behaviors of flirting

2042
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,599
and potentially the people would leave

2043
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:09,760
that meeting still feeling like their

2044
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,680
side had won so there wouldn't be a true

2045
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,359
conceptual synthesis

2046
01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:16,880
so again a little bit another spiral

2047
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:17,680
away another

2048
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,920
tangent but that's why these kinds of

2049
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,359
formalizations

2050
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:23,440
and specifically graphical and

2051
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:24,640
computable

2052
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:27,280
ways of thinking about them can bring

2053
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,039
clarity to some of these long-standing

2054
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:30,400
qualitative questions

2055
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,559
and also necessitate the collaboration

2056
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:33,920
of basically

2057
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,400
quantitative and qualitative expertises

2058
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,079
rj

2059
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:42,240
um so so um i've seen like not

2060
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:45,359
exactly this this graphic but but um uh

2061
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:46,799
throughout each of the papers especially

2062
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:48,079
the ones fristen's involved with there's

2063
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:49,839
always some iteration of it

2064
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:52,319
um and some iteration of explanation of

2065
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:54,000
active inference and one thing

2066
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,599
um that i've seen alluded to

2067
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:00,720
in the words but not in the graphic is

2068
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,920
um this updating of the observation

2069
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:04,960
itself

2070
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,799
um and maybe this is being represented

2071
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:08,400
here and i'm not seeing it

2072
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,960
um but but what what offend is like um

2073
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:11,839
and and and

2074
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:13,920
i'll i'll get to to why this is uh uh

2075
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,039
fairly important to me

2076
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:17,359
uh in a second but but um it seems like

2077
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:19,040
well in any process of sense making we

2078
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:20,238
have this induction

2079
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:23,279
and at the state of induction

2080
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:25,839
uh you're actually like before you're

2081
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:27,520
getting to trying to parse meaning

2082
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,000
you're you're trying to like check

2083
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,040
whether or not

2084
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,359
what you've observed is even the correct

2085
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,679
observation so it's the double take

2086
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:37,679
um and and this is one of the reasons in

2087
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:38,960
intelligence analysis

2088
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,920
that like collection is separated from

2089
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:42,238
from

2090
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:44,399
from your your all other elements of the

2091
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:45,359
production cycle

2092
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:46,319
because that what they're trying to do

2093
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:47,359
is they're trying to make sure that

2094
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:48,399
there's not this like

2095
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:50,238
constant seduction of going back and

2096
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:51,600
checking again checking again checking

2097
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:52,560
again they're trying to make it so

2098
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,000
there's a pipeline so when something

2099
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,600
comes in it's going up the pipe it's not

2100
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,198
your job to look any further

2101
01:08:57,198 --> 01:08:58,479
into whether or not what you saw was

2102
01:08:58,479 --> 01:08:59,759
meant something or whether or not it was

2103
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:00,399
correct or

2104
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:02,399
it's just report what you saw push it

2105
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:03,839
through and now it's not your problem

2106
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:04,799
anymore it's

2107
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:07,520
somebody else's problem right um so like

2108
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:07,839
now

2109
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:10,399
at the at at the the scale of the

2110
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:11,520
individual though

2111
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:13,198
uh we're constantly double checking

2112
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:14,719
ourselves whether or not we we saw

2113
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:16,319
we thought we saw so like if i'm if i'm

2114
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:17,839
reading a paper and i find

2115
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:20,719
um you know um something cited and and

2116
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:21,120
and

2117
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,759
i kind of know where that's coming from

2118
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:24,880
so this happened when we

2119
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,399
were a few people on this call we were

2120
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:28,238
working together on on a paper for

2121
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:29,679
active influence and behavioral

2122
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:30,479
engineering

2123
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:32,799
and i was looking into a spirit decor

2124
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,158
and while i was doing that

2125
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:36,238
there's a big problem because there were

2126
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:37,759
so many different interpretations of

2127
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:39,198
what a spirit decor meant

2128
01:09:39,198 --> 01:09:40,960
so so what ended up happening is every

2129
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,040
time i saw the words i'm checking myself

2130
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:44,640
and going wait is am i actually

2131
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,319
observing what i think i'm observing i'm

2132
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:47,520
checking against priors

2133
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,560
and i'm updating my observation um so

2134
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,319
what what i'm kind of wondering is like

2135
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:53,920
um one like

2136
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,360
is this representing this graphic and

2137
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:58,000
i'm not seeing it uh and then two

2138
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,920
um i know that over time we're starting

2139
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:02,239
to see okay like actual computational

2140
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,040
models

2141
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,440
um using active inference are those

2142
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:06,080
models

2143
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:07,679
like if they were applied in an agent

2144
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:09,040
based model or applied in machine

2145
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:09,679
learning

2146
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:11,520
are those models trying to act that

2147
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:12,960
process out of like

2148
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,400
checking back on the observation and

2149
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,080
making sure that it's actually

2150
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,320
observing what it thinks it's observing

2151
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:19,920
rather than just taking data in

2152
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,080
does that make sense yep thanks for the

2153
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,280
question rj

2154
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:26,080
so it is lightly indicated in this

2155
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:26,560
figure

2156
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,320
as with the other figure there's a

2157
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:29,840
movement from left to right

2158
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:32,880
okay so the nodes are numbered by the

2159
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,719
kind of things that they are

2160
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:36,719
and so it's lightly indicated where the

2161
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:38,000
direction of time is going with these

2162
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,520
dotted arrows so like for example the

2163
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:40,000
first

2164
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,159
10 on the bottom left that's like a

2165
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:43,199
hidden state of the world

2166
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:45,679
right and through an 11 it emits an

2167
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:47,760
observation at time point 1.

2168
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:51,040
then there's a transition matrix 9

2169
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:54,159
and so if you did hourly checkpoints the

2170
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:56,000
9 matrix that you calculate is going to

2171
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,760
be the hourly transition matrix

2172
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:00,719
if you do one minute checkpoints like a

2173
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:02,560
discrete time with an interval of one

2174
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,159
nine is going to be a different matrix

2175
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:06,159
so it's kind of like how the the candle

2176
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:08,159
chart of a stock or a crypto looks

2177
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:09,760
different depending on what time length

2178
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:10,719
the candle is so

2179
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:12,560
it's not the same matrix for all time

2180
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,080
intervals it's always model

2181
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:17,199
interval dependent but 9 moves us from

2182
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:17,520
the

2183
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:20,000
left 10 to the right 10 and then at that

2184
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:20,560
10

2185
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,400
again it's the type 10 not like node

2186
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:24,080
number 10. it emits

2187
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:27,040
through the same or a different 11

2188
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,560
another observation

2189
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:31,760
now the early models all the 11s were

2190
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:32,480
fixed

2191
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,159
so like the hidden state could go from

2192
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:36,159
daytime to night time but like the 11

2193
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:37,280
was fixed

2194
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:38,960
and then you could imagine that a more

2195
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,480
advanced version of the model would be

2196
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:40,880
like

2197
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,199
yeah actually the hidden state through

2198
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:44,000
time

2199
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,520
it changes in how it emits 11. okay now

2200
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:51,199
flip the interface seven is perceiving

2201
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:53,920
the observation the left seven and then

2202
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:54,640
it's doing

2203
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,640
estimation of the hidden state s so that

2204
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,320
or five it just looks like an s and it

2205
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:58,560
is

2206
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,800
s in the models so it's kind of like at

2207
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,159
each time point we have this like

2208
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:03,920
10 hidden state of the world emits

2209
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,920
through 11 in observation that's on the

2210
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,760
interface that's that holographic

2211
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,600
boundary that chris fields is going to

2212
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,040
help us understand

2213
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,280
then on the organism side the

2214
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:14,880
internalist side

2215
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,920
seven does a state estimate five then

2216
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:20,400
we move through time the organism

2217
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,080
updates its estimate through time

2218
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,640
with eight and the world updates its

2219
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:25,600
actual state

2220
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,840
with nine its hidden state and then

2221
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,840
there's another time point another stack

2222
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:30,640
of that

2223
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:32,719
and so in the example that you gave with

2224
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:34,080
like going back and double checking

2225
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,440
information

2226
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,679
it's like you get an observation at one

2227
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:38,800
moment

2228
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,960
and then whether or not it's concordant

2229
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:42,320
with um something

2230
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,080
at least you're instantaneously sure of

2231
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,840
what it is but then

2232
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,280
here's another dimension that the

2233
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,120
computational models are going into

2234
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,280
which is at each time point it

2235
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:52,400
calculates

2236
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:56,320
an integral through time of policy

2237
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,320
so that's the part where we're going to

2238
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:01,040
talk about it in 11 and a few other ones

2239
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:03,280
but the simplest model would be like

2240
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,280
again red shirt or you know

2241
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:06,800
black shirt and then it's like the

2242
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,560
photon is the observation and the state

2243
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:09,760
estimates pretty straightforward it's

2244
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,280
like a two by two matrix

2245
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,040
there's an unchanging characters in the

2246
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,719
matrix because the red shirt always

2247
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:16,640
emits red and there's no ambiguity okay

2248
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,080
now we can start to relax those

2249
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:19,040
assumptions

2250
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:20,480
and we can think about okay maybe

2251
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,640
there's more ambiguity in the signal

2252
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:26,159
maybe there's a non-stationary 11 matrix

2253
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:29,199
maybe we can learn seven we can learn

2254
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:31,120
better about how observations are

2255
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:32,640
related to world states maybe we can

2256
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:33,040
learn

2257
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,440
eight better which is sort of like uh

2258
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:36,480
trying to reflect

2259
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,640
nine we can learn about how states in

2260
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:39,920
the world transition

2261
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:42,960
better and we can learn better policies

2262
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,480
too better sixes

2263
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:47,360
but that what we've just been focused on

2264
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:48,880
is really just the loop

2265
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:52,560
with the 10 9 10 9 in the world

2266
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,360
5 8 5 8 in the agent and then this

2267
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:56,239
interface

2268
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:58,000
that has a symmetry of the sevens and

2269
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,080
the 11's around the observation

2270
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,560
itself so yes they're the kinds of

2271
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:03,920
things that people are

2272
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:06,400
starting to roll out but i think that

2273
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,280
especially if you watch

2274
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:10,400
11 coming up you'll get a sense at how

2275
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,719
rudimentary these roll outs are

2276
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:16,120
really it's at like the uh ibm chess

2277
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:19,120
1995 status where like

2278
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:22,000
many many branches of counterfactuals

2279
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,440
are being processed

2280
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:26,400
and then evaluated and more modern chess

2281
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,239
computers don't use this branch

2282
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:30,719
rollout evaluation strategy in the same

2283
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:31,520
way

2284
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:34,640
so we're still in a very early stage

2285
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:37,920
that's basically defining what that

2286
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:41,679
rollout would be through time and then

2287
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:43,520
there will be other ways of

2288
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,600
heuristically approximating

2289
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,719
very good rollouts

2290
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,839
sasha

2291
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:56,800
yeah nice thanks for walking through

2292
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,640
that on the diagram

2293
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:02,560
uh with all the numbers um yeah uh

2294
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,640
just some things that rj reminded me of

2295
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:05,840
um is

2296
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:09,520
in thinking about data collection uh

2297
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:11,280
it would be great if we could separate

2298
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,840
um the data collection from the data

2299
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:15,920
interpretation and acting on it and

2300
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,400
um you know informalized uh kind of

2301
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,920
scientific approaches we

2302
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:22,320
can do that like um i'm just thinking

2303
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,159
about my own work when i do

2304
01:15:24,159 --> 01:15:27,679
microscopy and i'm looking at some cells

2305
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:31,360
under a microscope and i might have like

2306
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,280
an emotional reaction to how they look

2307
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,360
which is like they look really good

2308
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,280
and i want to analyze them or something

2309
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,199
went terribly wrong and they look like

2310
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:42,560
um not even cells at this point

2311
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:46,880
so um i think part of

2312
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,480
going through this process is being able

2313
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,159
to separate the individual

2314
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:52,480
steps so i have to actively prevent

2315
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:53,600
myself from

2316
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:57,520
uh yeah

2317
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:59,280
uh kind of throwing in the towel

2318
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:00,960
preemptively when i don't

2319
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,520
uh that when the data doesn't meet my

2320
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:04,480
expectations

2321
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,239
until i go to the next step of like

2322
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:08,480
randomizing and analyzing it

2323
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:11,440
such that i can remove my expectations

2324
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:11,920
um

2325
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:15,440
and just try to collect what is there

2326
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:18,800
and i think that yeah that's something

2327
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,080
that's nearly impossible

2328
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,560
to do in the human experience that we

2329
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:23,840
can't really separate

2330
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:26,159
um the data collection from the data

2331
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:27,360
interpretation

2332
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:30,480
and um yeah it just moves too fast

2333
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,800
and then in the um realm of like

2334
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,080
uncertainty and

2335
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:37,040
um yeah what does this word mean in

2336
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:39,199
different contexts as rj was saying

2337
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:41,840
that is the kind of thing that um in

2338
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:42,640
teaching

2339
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:45,840
like uh we try to think you know if you

2340
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,199
don't know every single word

2341
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:49,199
in what we're learning today it's going

2342
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:51,040
to be really hard to build on any next

2343
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,239
level concepts

2344
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:54,800
so and students will often say like well

2345
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,239
i don't really know this word so

2346
01:16:56,239 --> 01:16:58,719
i don't know but the first thing to do

2347
01:16:58,719 --> 01:16:59,440
is to like

2348
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,280
just look up what the word means so that

2349
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:03,520
you can move past that uncertainty and

2350
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:04,560
move on to

2351
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:08,000
move on to the next layers of things um

2352
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,800
and so that really to me makes me think

2353
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,320
of like social anxiety

2354
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:14,880
and people not being able to interpret

2355
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:15,679
social cues

2356
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:17,280
appropriately and that creating

2357
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:19,360
uncertainty which is just like it kind

2358
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:20,480
of snowballs

2359
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,239
once you're uncertain about one aspect

2360
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:24,960
of an interaction or a script

2361
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:27,040
you kind of are prevented from

2362
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,120
participating in the next levels or

2363
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,600
carrying out the script and so that

2364
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,360
perhaps is something interesting to

2365
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:36,400
discuss um in next week's interact

2366
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:39,760
uh discussions cool

2367
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:42,080
thanks i think that question especially

2368
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:44,159
sasha really makes me think about like

2369
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:46,960
script design and we're talking about

2370
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,960
the analysis and the descriptive ways of

2371
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,120
talking about systems but also about

2372
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:54,159
designing the scene and the stage

2373
01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:56,480
i think steven dropped off but is

2374
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:57,440
somebody with

2375
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:59,679
uh drama experience performance

2376
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:00,640
experience

2377
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:02,880
you know social performance performing

2378
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:03,679
our roles

2379
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,600
a lot of these terms are starting to

2380
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:08,239
blend with the mask and previously that

2381
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:10,080
would be seen as dramatic or ritualized

2382
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,520
now it's seen as a matter of public

2383
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,320
safety

2384
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:13,520
so many of these things are actually

2385
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,840
coming together in a way where

2386
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:19,360
we can um certainly within our own

2387
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:22,320
life if not at a higher level ask about

2388
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,560
what kind of scripts we want to design

2389
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,640
for moving forward especially about the

2390
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,239
uncertainty from all these different

2391
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:28,800
issues

2392
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:32,239
so um here's just a couple questions i

2393
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:33,760
wanted to throw up we only have you know

2394
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:34,480
three minutes

2395
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:37,600
so really just for the listeners live or

2396
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:38,320
in replay

2397
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:42,239
to add comments or start a discussion

2398
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:45,440
in whatever platform we're using just

2399
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:48,080
questions like thinking about how this

2400
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:49,199
could be a unifying

2401
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:52,320
topic how could this be a valuable model

2402
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,880
what unique insights are we looking for

2403
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,080
how could we

2404
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,800
rethink our experiences what would be

2405
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,400
explanations or predictions and what

2406
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:01,040
would be

2407
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:04,880
next steps for the research and um

2408
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,640
thanks for participating i'm gonna just

2409
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:08,880
pause it for um

2410
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:12,000
on this final slide as we

2411
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,920
hear our last thoughts so everyone

2412
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,840
prepare a little last thought if you'd

2413
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:16,719
like

2414
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:19,679
and to listeners thanks for listening we

2415
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:21,679
will have follow-up forms for the live

2416
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:23,360
participants it's in the calendar

2417
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:26,080
invite and anyone is welcome to provide

2418
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:26,719
us with

2419
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:30,080
feedback and stay in touch but for the

2420
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:32,000
last three minutes let's just hear

2421
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,400
from our panelists anybody who would

2422
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,640
like to what is a last thought

2423
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:37,840
what's something you're still wondering

2424
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:41,040
about or now that we're done with 10

2425
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,280
where does that leave us what are some

2426
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,040
last thoughts rj and then

2427
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:48,480
blue so we

2428
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:51,679
i think we we did find some conclusion

2429
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:54,960
on um what can't

2430
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:58,239
use a script um but uh

2431
01:19:58,239 --> 01:20:00,159
i still don't feel like we have a good

2432
01:20:00,159 --> 01:20:02,080
conclusion on what a script isn't what

2433
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:02,880
is that line

2434
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,960
so i'm going to be thinking about that

2435
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:05,920
the next week and

2436
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,679
i hope we we touch on that next

2437
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,520
discussion

2438
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:13,120
awesome blue so i'm just wondering

2439
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:15,760
left really wondering where can we use

2440
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:16,239
this

2441
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:18,960
to engineer social behavior or to change

2442
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:20,800
scripts that are perhaps

2443
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:23,840
unnecessary or unwanted in society like

2444
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:26,159
radicalization scripts or or things like

2445
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:27,600
that so that's where i'm left

2446
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:29,840
you know how do we then go out and apply

2447
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:32,719
what we've learned

2448
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:37,760
cool um either of the sashas or yvonne

2449
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:43,440
um yeah i similar to blue i'm left

2450
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,520
thinking about what is the application

2451
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:49,520
of active inference in scripts and um

2452
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:52,239
i guess in instead of feeling uh

2453
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:53,520
unsatisfied i feel

2454
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:56,880
excited about it that's my perspective

2455
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:00,480
that it seems that maybe at the end of

2456
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:01,679
the last conversation

2457
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:05,360
i felt uh ambivalent or confused about

2458
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:08,000
scripts and now i'm a bit more uh

2459
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,920
directed in their their use or their

2460
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:12,080
possibilities so i'm i'm really

2461
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:15,280
happy to kind of have uh talk through

2462
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:15,679
this

2463
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:19,920
and uh find a way out

2464
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:23,360
that makes me feel excited about scripts

2465
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:24,159
that hold

2466
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:27,520
space specifically for things like

2467
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,080
freedom of expression or speech or

2468
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:31,280
improvisation

2469
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:34,239
it's like um a protection within the

2470
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:35,760
script this is the part of the song

2471
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,120
where there's a drum solo

2472
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:39,120
so for this part you get to play in time

2473
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,400
and then for this part

2474
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,520
it gets to be wacky and so in that

2475
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:46,320
way we can um and like blue is saying as

2476
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:47,440
well with the design

2477
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,440
we could be able to converge on scripts

2478
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:50,719
that protect

2479
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:53,760
certain freedoms as intrinsic

2480
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:56,800
to the structure of the script and being

2481
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:57,600
able to

2482
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:01,120
have a discussion about that that is um

2483
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:03,040
nuanced like we hopefully are

2484
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:04,400
representing and learning how to

2485
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:05,840
represent here

2486
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,360
that could be a really productive

2487
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:09,760
discussion instead of just about

2488
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:12,159
rights versus um all these other things

2489
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:13,840
that can get tangled down in

2490
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:16,639
so everybody thanks so much for

2491
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:17,600
participating

2492
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,320
and for the great discussion as always

2493
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:21,920
this is it for 10

2494
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:24,320
we will have 11 in the final two weeks

2495
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:25,040
of december

2496
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:27,920
2020 the 11th hour the 11th active

2497
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:28,719
stream

2498
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:31,360
and then we will have 12 the clock will

2499
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:32,239
strike midnight
