hello everyone

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,240
and welcome to the active inference live

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,200
stream

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,280
this is active inference live stream

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,240
10.1

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,520
and it is december 8th 2020 we are

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,520
really excited to bring you a

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,920
scripted or unscripted not sure maybe

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,119
we'll figure it out

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,760
discussion on some exciting topics so

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,400
let's

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,640
get right into it i will share my screen

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,960
for the participants

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,960
welcome to the active inference lab

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,800
everyone we are an experienced

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,040
experiment and experience i guess in

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,559
online team communication

18
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,800
learning and practice related to active

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,600
inference

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,079
you can find us at our website on

21
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,200

or

24
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,960
public key based team and username this

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,520
is a

26
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,079
recorded and an archived live stream so

27
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,680
please provide us with feedback so that

28
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,559
we can improve on our work

29
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,399
all backgrounds and perspectives are

30
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,680
welcome here

31
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,600
and just as far as video etiquette for

32
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,959
live stream goes

33
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,720
remember to mute if there's noise in

34
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,560
your background raise your hand so that

35
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,920
we can hear from everyone

36
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,320
on the stack and use respectful speech

37
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,520
behavior

38
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,720
also just a logistical note all the rest

39
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,680
of the meetings

40
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,720
for 2020 are going to be at 7 30 to 9

41
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,439
a.m

42
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,479
pst and today we are in 10.1

43
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,479
discussing a variational approach to

44
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,880
scripts next week at the same time

45
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,159
we're going to be having a follow-up

46
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,079
discussion 10.2

47
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,000
and then in the last two weeks of

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,119
december we're

49
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,960
going to be talking about the paper

50
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,360
sophisticated effective inference

51
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,439
and that will be on the december 22nd

52
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,399
and 29th

53
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,720
so contact us if you want to participate

54
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,320
in these discussions or

55
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,040
in 2021 or if you have an idea for

56
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,159
something that we could do

57
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,200
on an active stream today

58
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,560
in act in stream 10.1 we are going to go

59
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:56,960
through

60
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,920
introductions and warmups and then we'll

61
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,360
go to template one

62
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,119
we're going to be discussing the paper a

63
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,759
variational approach to scripts

64
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,680
and if you want some background context

65
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,038
you can check out active stream 10.0

66
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,520
we're going to talk today about the aims

67
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,160
and claims

68
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,080
or the hopes as they were and the

69
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,400
abstract and the roadmap for the paper

70
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,160
thankfully with one of the authors on

71
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,720
board and then we'll talk about some

72
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,640
different kinds of scripts

73
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,120
talk about scripts and their uses ask a

74
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,040
few questions related to that

75
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,360
and then close with looking through the

76
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,800
figures and just discussing what they

77
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,400
might mean

78
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,959
and next week in 10.2 we're going to be

79
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,239
on this same paper

80
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,560
so save and submit your questions or if

81
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,400
it's after 10.2 just write them in the

82
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,360
comment section

83
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,640
and get in touch if you want to

84
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,480
participate

85
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,920
for the introductions and warmups let's

86
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,920
introduce ourselves just by giving a

87
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,760
short introduction or check-in

88
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,599
and then we'll pass it to somebody who

89
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,120
hasn't spoken yet

90
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,159
so i'll start i'm daniel i'm

and i'm working in cognitive computing

100
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,680
uh to try to establish how we can

101
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,040
formalize

102
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,959
epistemic communities through active

103
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,440
inference

104
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,959
cool then we'll pass to another first

105
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,239

organizational dynamics intelligence

110
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,239
analysis and narrative warfare keep it

111

consultant and i'm currently working on

123
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,919
agent-based modeling and a bunch of

124
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,520
other random things

125
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,440

of california

128
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,680
i'm also a phd student i'm interested in

129
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,600
music neuroscience or i work on music

130
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,720
neuroscience

131
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,639
and i'm interested in

132
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,919
music and social interactions so i was

133
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,199
really excited

134
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,919
for that social side of this paper and

135
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,880
i'll pass it to yvonne

136
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,759
hello my name is ivan i'm based in

137
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,960
moscow and

138
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,919
i'm interested in active inference as it

139
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,600
goes with the systems engineering

140
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,759
and i'm very excited about this paper i

141
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,560
found it

142
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,600
uh very interesting cool

143
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,240
thanks everyone for coming out and for

144
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,600
everybody who's watching it

145
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,320
live and replay so for the warm-up

146
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,039
questions

147
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,919
section everybody is welcome to throw in

148
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:24,960
a thought

149
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,000
i'll put up the uh first two questions

150
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,759
and just raise your hand so that we can

151
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,919
hear from anyone the first question

152
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,560
is what interests you or excites you

153
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,160
about studying scripts

154
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,720
so kind of what drew you to this paper

155
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,800
whether from the active inference side

156
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
or from the social sciences side

157
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,560
and then what's something that you

158
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,080
thought about after

159
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,039
reading the paper so while people are

160
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,479
raising their hand i'll start

161
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,039
i think what interested me in uh

162
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,479
studying scripts

163
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,240
was just addressing all of these

164
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,880
different social contexts with one

165
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,800
integrated framework that's kind of an

166
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,080
appealing idea

167
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,400
mao

168
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,000
well yeah and i think it's also it's

169
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,960
sort of a road map that links

170
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,080
internal and external manifestations

171
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,400
of our general understanding of the

172
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,440
world and

173
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,600
systems dynamics that get um

174
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,720
brought together

175
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,360
through these islands of negentropy that

176
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,039
become these scripts

177
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,840
if that makes any sense cool

178
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,520
rj um so

179
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,000
uh after i read the paper what i ended

180
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,960
up thinking about

181
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,160
is what what do the conditions look like

182
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,160
for threshold events for changing

183
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,840
scripts um

184
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,440
that's a really interesting to me and

185
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,919
then um

186
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,759
what kind of like what what would the

187
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,840
metadata be and this is something we had

188
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,400
discussed

189
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,759
uh before is like what would the

190
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,919
metadata be if we wanted to catalog

191
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,759
the scripts that are that are operating

192
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,240
in a system

193
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,479
cool and that um bringing up that

194
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,440
negentropic

195
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,080
idea the sort of organizing principle of

196
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,280
scripts

197
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,919
that's pretty interesting too because uh

198
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,680
in combining what both of you just said

199
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,000
how do we change a script from one

200
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,720
island of

201
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,440
stability or organizational attractor to

202
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,440
another organizational attractor

203
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,520
if we go from one organizing principle

204
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,280
maybe we don't like some aspects of it

205
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,039
but if we just go from order to

206
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,440
pure disorder that's not doing the

207
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,280
society of service so we want to move

208
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,800
from order to order

209
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,880
ideally through order but how is that

210
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,160
actually going to be

211
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,759
uh tracked or designed and then just

212
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,199
the last up shannon go ahead yeah that's

213
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,360
actually exactly the one question i had

214
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,720
written on my paper

215
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,000
um are is what age rj and um

216
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,759
daniel mentioned like what

217
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,120
can active inference help us to identify

218
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,720
like when a critical transition will

219
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,599
happen or when

220
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,400
we'll switch scripts um it's really easy

221
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:02,800
in

222
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,360
it's really easy i say but in in music

223
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,639
we have scripts

224
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,639
and it's either written on a piece of

225
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,680
paper or it's

226
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,759
the cultural transmission of how you

227
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,840
perform in this genre

228
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,879
of music alone or with others and

229
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,960
as long as you know that that's the

230
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,560
script that you're starting from you

231
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,000
know how the social interaction will

232
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,879
transpire

233
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,479
and then if you want to do an experiment

234
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,000
you're like you know

235
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,919
that's the constraints that you have and

236
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,360
you can pick out the interesting

237
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,879
features

238
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,640
that you want to empirically measure

239
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,399
like whether it's body sway or the

240
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,799
actual music that's being played

241
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,640
but um in the example that runs through

242
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,958
the paper of flirting

243
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,958
you don't necessarily know the goal of

244
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,399
the interaction

245
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,120
if you're observing it or the goal of

246
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,640
the interaction if you're in it

247
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,760
because it's not codified in like this

248
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,040
very formal or traditional framework in

249
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,080
the same way that

250
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,800
like a musical interaction is so

251
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
identifying the threshold or identifying

252
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,320
how those transitions happen

253
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,000
would be very different in those two

254
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,240
types of interactions

255
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,839
cool blue

256
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,600
so i was excited to really learn more

257
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,560
about um

258
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,480
how scripts can interact in a

259
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,760
hierarchical way

260
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,480
like just the paper kind of mentioned it

261
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,240
but didn't really unpack it uh

262
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,920
thoroughly and i just would like to

263
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,320
really kind of dive into that

264
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,040
yeah and the music and the cultural side

265
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,279
it's uh maybe with a musical ensemble

266
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,040
they could agree to play a different

267
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,200
song within the same style or agree to

268
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,480
play a different style

269
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,920
and then we could ask the same with

270
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,519
culture but it's a little bit more

271
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,399
challenging to

272
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,760
simply adopt a different cultural regime

273
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,600
but maybe within a culture there's a lot

274
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
of latitude so there's this question of

275
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,880
nesting and

276
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,080
horizontal interactions and about style

277
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,160
controlled novelty so i think there's a

278
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,360
lot of cool

279
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,279
ideas we'll be bringing up any other

280
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,959
comments here on these warm-up questions

281
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,199
mal

282
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,399
up you're me too

283
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,000
sorry so yeah that's the idea that's the

284
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,880
goal the um

285
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,800
eventually measuring where the threshold

286
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,480
happens um

287
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,800
we have another paper that's being

288
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,760
written and that's

289
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,959
trying to identify how scripts

290
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,079
tend to become overlapping through in

291
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,160
interaction in society and when they

292
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,839
become overlapping they

293
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,200
they become analogical so um the scripts

294
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
of femininity and masculinity are not as

295
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,800
segregated as they used to be for

296
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,160
instance i'm wearing no

297
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,680
nose sleeves

298
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,600
in these 1800s but would definitely have

299
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,800
been acceptable for men

300
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,560
nowadays it's not a problem anymore both

301
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,240
men and women can wear it so these

302
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,079
these scripts have tended to overlap and

303
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,760
we're seeing that because

304
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,079
the scripts overlap they become a little

305
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,000
bit meaningless because they're not

306
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
allowing us to predict anything

307
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,880
so there's going to be to be a point

308
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,560
which we're kind of sensing already

309
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,120
where the concept of gender as a strict

310
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,920
binary

311
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,040
is just breaking apart and we're seeing

312
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,600
new

313
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,440
uh new concepts emerge new new

314
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,800
possibilities so this

315
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,320
this is where the threshold can be

316
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,079
measured and i think we can definitely

317
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,200
formalize that

318
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,560
as far as codification um

319
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,519
art in general is just a series of codes

320
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,519
that once you have you get to break it's

321
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,279
just it's become this sort of script in

322
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,000
art where

323
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,079
you have to break the script you you

324
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,519
have to use what we know

325
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,399
in order to continually create novelty

326
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,040
but

327
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,200
think of all of the hollywood movies

328
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,360
that depict flirting

329
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,200
it's pretty much the same like there's

330
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,880
there's a few scripts that are possible

331
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,959
but if you look at it abstractly

332
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,880
it's basically you know you don't you

333
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,800
don't flirt necessarily

334
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,880
uh with someone you have zero intention

335
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,399
of ever ever becoming with

336
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,279
in hollywood movies or you don't flirt

337
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,480
with someone by

338
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,440
hitting them on the head with a flounder

339
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,000
you know like

340
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,839
like there's some things that you know

341
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,279
you're supposed to do and some things

342
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,880
you know you're not supposed to do

343
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,240
and the strictness depends on

344
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,519
how wide one vision of the script

345
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,279
becomes

346
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,360
thanks rj i just uh

347
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,639
something i picked up from what you were

348
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,880
saying there uh on um

349
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,920
on flirting in in in cinema like

350
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,639
i feel like a lot of the comedies i know

351
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,839
of are actually about

352
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,399
script breaking so even even like

353
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,480
outside flirting like something like uh

354
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,600
there's there's a like common category

355
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,920
like in in in the uk it's peep show in

356
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,720
the us it's

357
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,600
always sunny um where it's most of the

358
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,120
show is just about

359
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,600
failing to adapt to cultural scripts so

360
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,040
i just want to know like i feel like

361
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,399
there's there's some element there where

362
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,160
we actually like contrast like exactly

363
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,600
what it is we're not supposed to do as

364
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,399
well

365
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,480
yep there's the exception that proves

366
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,320
the rule and then there's the

367
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,959
the chess master who within the

368
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,480
structure of the rules

369
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,480
makes an innovation that appears in the

370
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,240
short term to be breaking the rules

371
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,440
and then there's this element of the

372
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,839
media which is showing us for example

373
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,440
maybe flirting scenes with things that

374
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,279
wouldn't work in real life

375
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,839
uh whether for anyone or for subset of

376
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:12,480
people but

377
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,040
often including very for example bold

378
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,920
maneuvers

379
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,160
they can't uh convey in the hollywood

380
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,079
reality meeting somebody getting to know

381
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,040
them over years

382
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,000
not as exciting not as a clear

383
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,040
foreshadowing so

384
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,519
maybe there are sort of rule or script

385
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,480
breaking things

386
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,480
but then when we see that representation

387
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,160
and maybe even starting to introduce

388
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,880
some of these

389
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,079
active ideas we see them in our sensory

390
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:36,639
states

391
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,480
and therefore we perceive them as likely

392
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,040
or plausible and then we come to embody

393
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,880
these beliefs about what is likely or

394
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,600
possible

395
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,399
or uh preferable in the world and we see

396
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:46,880
people

397
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,880
imitating behavior they see in the media

398
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,399
so that can be used for

399
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,920
good and for bad sasha

400
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,920
yeah this kind of loops back to the

401
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,279
question that i had after reading the

402
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,320
paper which is

403
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,000
um how do individuals convey

404
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,440
um their

405
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,639
true state or um their

406
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,079
you know unique perspective on the

407
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,959
script while conforming to the social

408
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,000
script

409
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,720
because um if we all acted like we were

410
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,680
in a rom-com

411
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,199
we would have different lives and

412
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,600
relationships but clearly we all have

413
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,720
very unique

414
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,000
um and uh personalized

415
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,040
um versions of that

416
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,440
and i don't think any of us live in a

417
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,320
rom-com but

418
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,760
you know please correct me if i'm wrong

419
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,279
yeah that's kind of the fun it's like

420
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,760
asking what's the genre what scripts

421
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,639
will my scripts uh or what genre will my

422
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,959
scripts be drawn from am i in a tragedy

423
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,480
am i in a war movie am i in a rom-com so

424
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,199
that's kind of

425
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,800
fun it's like what genre would your

426
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,440
theme music be what kinds of conversants

427
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,639
are you gonna

428
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,639
be interacting with um mao did you have

429
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,240
your hand raised and then aren't you

430
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:58,720
yeah

431
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,760
yeah go ahead so first thing is um

432
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,519
i think you mentioned the the

433
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,600
oppositeness and that's a really

434
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,279
interesting idea like the

435
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,360
that's also how new scripts emerge is

436
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,399
that you have these

437
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,800
these bubbles of counter discourse that

438
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,519
come

439
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,040
and that's either embody um embody

440
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,079
portray something that is real in

441
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,199
society but

442
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,959
often invisibilized or something that

443
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,839
um wants to push back on something that

444
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,600
feels oppressive to a large swaths of

445
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,240
society

446
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,920
so for instance one great study that i

447
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,839
saw i'm sorry about i i don't have the

448
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,680
name of it right now but i'll send it to

449
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,720
whoever wants it

450
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,519
it was about the portrayal of abject in

451
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,759
uk society and the point was

452
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,399
there's all these mako versions that

453
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:44,959
show you

454
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,240
first all these women how they are not

455
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,079
supposed to be so they take a woman

456
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,199
and they portray her as very ugly often

457
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,000
um lower class like they give her all

458
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,440
the qualities you're not supposed to

459
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,639
have and then they

460
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,880
take her through this transition and

461
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,880
they make over her life and suddenly at

462
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,759
the end of the show

463
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,600
she's happy her life is great her

464
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,199
children love her her husband loves her

465
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:07,680
again

466
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,600
it's great and it's like this this

467
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,680
movement from the abject that you're not

468
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,959
supposed to embody to the

469
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,560
to the ideal that you are supposed to

470
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,720
embody and on the second note

471
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,199
what you said i think sasha is that's

472
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,639
exactly right but the thing is

473
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,800
you are not the person in the rom-com

474
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,959
you do not perfectly embody what

475
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,279
she is even if they try to make her

476
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,720
relatable

477
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,680
you are connected through these tendrils

478
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,480
of semantics to a variety of things

479
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,800
that make you take what is possible and

480
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,680
adapt

481
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,320
all of these possible scripts into this

482
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:40,800
new

483
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,480
version of adapted contextual

484
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,560
anchored script which is why there is

485
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,800
variety as well

486
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,160
cool rj um i was gonna say

487
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,079
uh mao covered a lot of what i was gonna

488
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,360
say actually so we're

489
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,279
we're fairly saying i was just gonna say

490
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,639
like that um

491
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,560
i like actually i like the reference to

492
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,920
like makeover shows i was gonna i was

493
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,120
gonna talk about um

494
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,880
a very opposite end uh but

495
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,359
but uh greek art and stories where where

496
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,000
it's

497
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,839
it's very often and this is where like i

498
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,039
think joseph campbell

499
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,919
brings up the hero's journey um where

500
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,280
it's from some state

501
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,439
which is object negative not where we

502
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,400
want to be to

503
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,599
some other state none of us actually

504
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,359
live in the rom-com like but but the the

505
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,720
ideal being presented

506
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,640
um isn't something we're supposed to

507
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,160
mirror necessarily but

508
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,440
something that kind of acts as a strange

509
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,440
attractor um but

510
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,360
yeah but anyway mal covered most of what

511
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,799
i was gonna say there yeah rj

512
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,039
i i wrote down literally hiro's journey

513
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,880
because the makeover show if it's weight

514
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,600
loss or

515
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,640
about um norms for genders or house

516
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,360
makeover

517
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,919
or chefs it's always this hero's journey

518
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,200
and it's a scripted

519
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,120
hero's journey literally designed

520
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,880
journey and then the interesting part is

521
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,919
the policies

522
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,600
that they undertake thinking about

523
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,919
active those policies are not

524
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,840
our affordances they have a team and

525
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,679
they have a camera person and they have

526
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:00,000
a

527
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,280
coach so then it's like showing you

528
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,280
the first point and the last point on

529
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,559
the trajectory

530
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,400
and saying well now you figure out what

531
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,320
policy but the only example that you've

532
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,280
observed the only

533
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,520
example of what's a plausible affordance

534
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,280
is something that is defined as being

535
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,440
inaccessible to basically everyone so

536
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,640
that's just like such a

537
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,280
twisted way to play with how people

538
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,400
actually improve themselves

539
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,760
yet mao and then rj

540
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,240
yeah so that's that's exactly right you

541
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,000
you touched on a very important point is

542
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,360
that

543
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,280
take each script as though it was its

544
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,480
own little like

545
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,880
market blanket like it's not right but

546
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,760
imagine

547
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,240
um there's some parts of the scripts

548
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,600
that will interact with one another and

549
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,600
then there's these like blankets

550
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,799
that move a little slower and through

551
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,799
the blankets you can go to another part

552
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,320
of the script and you can do this at all

553
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,840
the levers so this was touching on the

554
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,400
idea that

555
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,240
someone else brought earlier that

556
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,320
there's layers of scripts and that's

557
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,600
absolutely true

558
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,640
you can break down every script into

559
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,760
smaller smaller scripts what defines

560
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,720
a script is its edges so entering the

561
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,200
script

562
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,960
and leaving the script what happens in

563
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,720
between can also be scripted but that's

564
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,480
at a lower level right

565
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,039
so for me to for me to speak here i had

566
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,559
to go through a series of things but

567
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,760
what really matters is that

568
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,600
i'm here now and that this will be

569
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,960
recorded but

570
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,200
um getting here it doesn't really matter

571
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,120
how right unless i'm coming from it

572
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,120
as a as an academic so i had a series of

573
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,400
steps that i did to get there as an

574
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,280
academic

575
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,240
the the way that you bring these scripts

576
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:32,960
together your

577
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,600
vectors from where you're coming from

578
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,160
define

579
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,240
also what kinds of policies you'll have

580
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,280
available to you

581
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,799
inside a given script cool rj and then

582
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,440
we'll continue

583
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,400
uh yeah uh oh also um real quick i like

584
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,840
that that's that's quotable

585
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,400
what defines the script is its edges um

586
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:52,960
but uh

587
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,520
i just wanted to add real quick uh that

588
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,720
it's probably

589
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,600
actually dangerous to optimize too much

590
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,880
to say like the rom-com

591
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,200
or the ideal like we don't actually want

592
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,120
to copy it exactly right like i feel

593
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,000
like maybe maybe

594
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,679
uh um there's there's something there

595
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:10,000
where

596
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,240
where we're supposed to actually mutate

597
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,919
the scripts we're being presented

598
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,440
over time and that like if we actually

599
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,200
optimize them exactly like a perfect

600
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,960
mirror then we actually get instability

601
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,760
but anyway

602
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,240
cool well i hope if you're listening

603
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,320
whether from the active inference side

604
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,000
hearing about scripts for the first time

605
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,919
or on the script side hearing about

606
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,000
active inference you're starting to see

607
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,159
where we are all getting excited about

608
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,880
at this intersection the paper that we

609
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,840
read today

610
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,960
is a variational approach to scripts and

611
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,840
the aims claims and hope of the paper

612
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,799
were addressed

613
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,480
in 10.0 so feel free to pause this video

614
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,320
and recursively watch the other one if

615
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,120
you want

616
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,919
but mao since you're with us what would

617
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,000
you say in your own words were the

618
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,159
aims and claims or the intentions of the

619
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,080
paper

620
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,200
so the goal was to bring together

621
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,240
fields that had different strengths the

622
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,679
active inference right now is

623
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,559
trying to move towards the the social

624
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,600
dynamics

625
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,520
it's doing a great job but there's still

626
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,960
some way to go

627
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,280
and in order to do so it doesn't have to

628
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,240
reinvent the wheel

629
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,200
on the other hand social sciences have

630
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,520
done

631
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,080
a lot of theorizing but it's it's

632
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,120
difficult to

633
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,080
assume causality it's difficult to see

634
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,280
them the true

635
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,240
mechanism of things without either doing

636
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,720
a lot of

637
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,600
qualitative work which itself has some

638
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,200
of the

639
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,679
the author's bias or specifically his

640
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,200
own expertise into it which takes a lot

641
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,080
of time

642
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,039
and it's the the kinds of

643
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,440
epistemic value you can draw from a lot

644
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,480
of these studies

645
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,679
is slightly lower and considered lower

646
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,720
by all of the formal fields so if we can

647
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,679
bring together

648
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,400
all of these fields offer a wonderful

649
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,159
tool to the social sciences we can bring

650
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,120
it all together and

651
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,159
bridge gaps in the in the communication

652
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:04,760
of

653
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,000
interdisciplinarity awesome

654
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,240
any comments on here but if anyone's

655
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,600
raising their hand good

656
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,240
and that reminds me a lot of the sort of

657
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:14,880
stem

658
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,679
the science tech engineering math

659
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:18,480
centrism

660
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,039
or bias it's tied up with reductionism

661
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,799
and a lot of other ideas

662
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,400
but then we see initiatives like steam

663
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,440
like throwing in the a for art or adding

664
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:29,679
in

665
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,799
crafts or maker diy all of these

666
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,280
different

667
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,039
things that are at the edges just like

668
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,200
you brought up at the fringe of the stem

669
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,720
narrative or at the fringe of the

670
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,640
accepted mainstream narrative

671
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,280
and it's people who are making a value

672
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,080
proposition

673
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,000
for some of these areas that haven't

674
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,280
been included in the

675
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,240
stem conversation so to speak and

676
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,080
there's various ways that this can

677
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,559
represent itself complexity science or

678
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,080
interdisciplinary work

679
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,559
project-based learning interdisciplinary

680
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,440
teams

681
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,960
this is really also why it's so

682
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,799
important to have different people's

683
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:03,679
perspective

684
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,320
on basically everything because this is

685
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,320
the shape that we enclose as a group

686
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,679
is everyone's perspective and that

687
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,120
includes our training all these

688
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:11,760
different

689
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,520
aspects so it's not just like a

690
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,039
unilateral uh

691
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,320
learning relationship where the

692
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,080
humanities have so much to learn from

693
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,480
machine learning scientists yes they do

694
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,600
and it's also

695
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,600
bi-directional so what does the

696
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,640
bi-directional

697
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,960
nexus look like and how are we going to

698
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,320
make that nexus

699
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,400
really a clean and accessible location

700
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,360
instead of just making it a a slide like

701
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,600
from one part of a playground to another

702
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,799
all right also in the abstract we uh

703
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,679
read that in 10.0 but mao again maybe

704
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:44,400
what would you

705
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,240
summarize this or i'm also just curious

706
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,600
like when you present it to different

707
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,440
contexts or audiences

708
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,200
so when you're in front of audience a

709
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,880
versus b let's say

710
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,880
what are two different ways that you

711
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,840
talk about what you're doing

712
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,960
um i i mean i tend to present it pretty

713
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,039
straightforwardly to anyone because it's

714
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,480
it's very simple

715
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,840
it's essentially just saying that um

716
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,480
we behave in ways that are predictable

717
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,039
because

718
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,679
our cognition about the world and our

719
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,200
position in the world is

720
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,919
also predictable through a bayesian

721
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:18,720
framework

722
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,320
most of our cognition is not perfect but

723
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,360
been that definitely basin and so

724
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,200
the beauty of active inference is that

725
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,600
it gives us a way to model

726
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,960
the different ways in which our

727
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,279
cognition can be slightly biased

728
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,720
or let's say not

729
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,520
classically logical but definitely

730
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,320
following

731
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,440
a gradient of optimization towards

732
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,400
x and this x is like minimization of

733
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,320
free energy so

734
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,960
through the scripts that are both um

735
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,679
let's say simple and

736
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,600
more formal so scripts that are

737
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,880
weaker so semantic fields and stronger

738
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,320
so behavioral links between some of the

739
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,840
semantic elements

740
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,640
we can essentially predict the behavior

741
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,080
and the thought process

742
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,039
of anyone as long as we have information

743
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:17,600
about

744
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,799
their position in the world

745
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,120
cool and if i could just build a little

746
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,320
bit on that

747
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,880
it's kind of like the scripts are

748
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,000
archetypes or

749
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,960
patterns that play out on landscapes and

750
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,400
that's kind of like water

751
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,840
on a landscape and the landscape in this

752
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,240
case is like a landscape of affordances

753
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,600
a field of affordances

754
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,039
that's things that we've talked about

755
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,039
but it's also potentially

756
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,080
quantitatively a landscape of

757
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,320
free energy minimization or there are

758
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,000
entities that we can model as if they're

759
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,279
doing optimization

760
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,240
in a variational bayesian framework on

761
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:54,640
some

762
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,559
landscape that we're also inferring

763
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,080
about as investigators

764
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,600
and then just like water on the

765
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,120
landscape there might be

766
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,360
a marsh where there's a lot of ways to

767
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,960
go and it's not quite clear it's very

768
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,520
flat

769
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,960
there might be other parts that are like

770
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,120
the grand canyon where if you're

771
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,720
in the canyon you're totally in the

772
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,240
canyon and if you're not you're totally

773
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:12,720
not

774
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,480
and so that would be like a very strong

775
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,480
script in the grand canyon and then a

776
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,840
marsh or like a flood plain

777
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,440
would be like a weak script so that's

778
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,960
one dimension and then the other

779
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,159
dimension which we're going to come back

780
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:22,720
to

781
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,120
is this internalist versus externalist

782
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,799
so we'll get to that in a second but

783
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:27,919
that's another dimension

784
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,559
about how active inference can integrate

785
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,159
scripts

786
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,080
in 10.0 we also talked about the roadmap

787
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,480
and it has again the structure that we

788
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,360
know and love

789
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,000
where you introduce another field here

790
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,679
script theory in section two

791
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,919
and then activate active inference in

792
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:46,880
section three

793
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,120
and then turn in the second part of the

794
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,080
paper to

795
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,960
an integrative discussion so if you have

796
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,039
any comments now about the structuring

797
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:55,600
of this

798
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,600
paper feel free

799
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,640
um so this is a structuring this very

800
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,799
natural branstad

801
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,080
that's this thing um and i think

802
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,919
i think it works really well because

803
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,360
we're still at a point where a lot of

804
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,279
people don't necessarily understand what

805
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,799
we mean when we talk about active

806
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,679
inference

807
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,320
it's it it doesn't feel that esoteric

808
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,480
but when you read some of the papers

809
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,240
about it some of the language is a bit

810
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,640
complicated there's a lot of equations

811
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,320
so people get like

812
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,640
okay no this is not for me whereas the

813
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,679
the the main idea is really simple

814
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,200
there's an attractor and phenotypes or

815
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:35,919
people or

816
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,360
entities tend to revolve as

817
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,000
around the attractor in their states the

818
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,840
attractor moves a little bit so that the

819
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,640
states are not

820
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,360
constantly at equilibrium that's really

821
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,240
that's really

822
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,919
the extent of what you have to

823
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,360
understand to go through active

824
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,840
inference

825
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,039
cool yep there's so many uh aspects to

826
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,080
what you just

827
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,760
added there it's always important to

828
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,760
provide little mini on-ramp

829
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,240
in the paper itself to active inference

830
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,760
without perhaps going into all the

831
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,480
details

832
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,919
and also it's important for the

833
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,080
community to be formalizing and

834
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,880
developing

835
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,440
the real frameworks that we can refer

836
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,080
out to

837
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,919
so that we can have a short version for

838
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,679
some papers like this and then have a

839
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,200
really rich version that people know

840
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,520
they can always come back to

841
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,559
let's talk about these two dimensions of

842
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,080
script variability so here is just one

843
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,720
slide

844
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,520
but this is people's life slash career

845
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,320
slash

846
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,600
decade long literature fiasco's back and

847
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,399
forths

848
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,880
it's great times and we're just gonna

849
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,760
lay all those

850
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,880
roughly out on this two by two grid

851
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,559
and there's some images that kind of

852
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,320
reflect a few of those dimensions or a

853
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,039
few of those

854
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,080
points in the phase space here but now

855
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:50,559
just

856
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,880
you know so much more about scripts than

857
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,320
us um

858
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,120
where are some examples of some of

859
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,640
scripts that people

860
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,200
might recognize or where has this been

861
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,960
an especially contentious debate

862
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,279
or is there a difference between field a

863
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,080
and field b

864
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,640
like uh disagreement that stems from one

865
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,240
having an externalist perspective and

866
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,840
one having an internalist perspective

867
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,640
well it's it's not some emotion and

868
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,799
disagreement it's just that

869
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,039
depending on what your paradigm is

870
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,200
you'll tend to focus on externalism

871
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,720
and another paradigm you're tend to

872
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,559
focus on internalism like for instance

873
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,320
behaviorism could never have gone to an

874
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,679
internalist perspective because it

875
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:30,480
literally

876
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,720
tries to evacuate anything that happens

877
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,559
inside cognition it's like

878
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,240
what's the input and the output so this

879
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,159
would be fundamentally externalist

880
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,279
um social studies will tend to

881
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,520
to move through externalist perspectives

882
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,279
because they don't necessarily also have

883
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,159
access to

884
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,559
what the perception from the individual

885
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,720
is of a certain of a certain fact all

886
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,440
you have is

887
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,399
movements of demographics and and how

888
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,200
these movies

889
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,919
um manifest in the world so of course

890
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,679
it's never as simple as that there's

891
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:00,399
always

892
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,080
internal elements and external

893
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,360
misconceptions and external

894
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,080
misconception

895
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,240
elements and internal misconceptions but

896
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,399
it's it's where you tend to focus

897
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,399
in our paper we're showing that active

898
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,320
inference allows us to bring both

899
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,159
together because a generative model

900
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,279
is a model of you and the world

901
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,320
and the beauty of this is through the

902
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,399
work of axel constant

903
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,120
and uh samurai vessel we can see that

904
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:25,840
the world

905
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,360
also has a model of view so we have

906
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,440
this dual connection that's possible

907
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,919
through internalism and externalism

908
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,159
a good example of an external script is

909
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:37,279
institutions

910
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,760
uh you you you have to go through

911
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,399
certain

912
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,960
um passages in order to get something

913
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,240
you have to have a passport to go to

914
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,279
another country

915
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:49,200
and in a an internalist script is well

916
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,000
how do i want to dress up for something

917
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,559
tonight

918
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,640
do i know what to wear am i going to

919
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,600
wear something like

920
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,840
it's it's probable that i'll get in the

921
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,080
club if i wear xyz

922
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,760
and there's some clubs that would stop

923
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,279
me from going into the club if i don't

924
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,880
wear the proper clothes this is

925
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,880
both an internal script that i have as

926
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,000
an expectation

927
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,519
of what the club will allow me to do

928
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,200
given xyz

929
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,279
the weak script is we have some clusters

930
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,640
of categories so um i know that

931
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,279
some colors go with some things i know

932
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,360
that some words are appropriate in some

933
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,080
places

934
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,760
and some words are not appropriate in

935
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,000
other places but i don't necessarily

936
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,760
know the order of the words or i don't

937
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,159
necessarily know the order of the colors

938
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:32,799
or

939
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,519
like i can wear pink up here and yellow

940
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,399
down here or

941
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,880
yellow and pink there's no necessary

942
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,760
order or

943
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,440
structure to what i have to do so long

944
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,279
as i stay within these clusters

945
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,480
a strong script is when you go to

946
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,480
a wedding there's a series of events

947
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,640
that will happen only one person wears

948
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,320
white et cetera et cetera so

949
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,039
it's way stricter as to where each

950
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,440
element of the semantic clusters

951
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,840
happen to fall both in time and in space

952
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,200
cool thanks for that rj

953
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,279
uh thank you for that explanation uh

954
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:08,960
because i i

955
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,919
when i first read the paper i was

956
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,000
thinking that it's not so much

957
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,640
disagreement as much as it is uh the way

958
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,240
that the priors that different fields

959
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,519
are using when they're approaching the

960
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,000
subject

961
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,600
and the subjects that they're studying

962
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,600
so like when i thought about it was like

963
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,679
externalist week maybe is like io

964
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:24,640
psychology

965
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,720
where it's a strong function of the the

966
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,399
organizational culture it's much

967
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,399
but and then maybe extraordinary

968
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:31,840
externalist strong

969
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,799
um would be closer to maybe maybe in the

970
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,240
realm of geopolitics where it's looking

971
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:36,880
at like

972
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,760
procedures after after regime changes so

973
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,880
yeah

974
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,600
yep and also the way um i've thought

975
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,640
about this like

976
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,240
internalist and externalist is that

977
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,320
there's very little disagreement on what

978
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:48,799
is

979
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,799
for example people can say yes there's a

980
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,240
virus particle that

981
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,399
consists of lipids and protein and their

982
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,240
society and people are moving around

983
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,679
but then somebody who writes a review

984
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,440
paper from the perspective of a protein

985
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,240
biologist

986
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,000
they're going to focus on the proteins

987
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,600
and so it shouldn't be too surprising

988
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,120
that because of their regime of

989
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,679
attention

990
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,840
and their knowledge affordances they're

991
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,880
going to recommend

992
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,279
some type of molecular binding agent

993
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,640
whereas somebody who studies it from the

994
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,320
sociological perspective knows that the

995
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,600
proteins exist

996
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,960
but then they're going to highlight

997
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,720
different features and therefore going

998
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,000
to make different recommendations it

999
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,640
would just be

1000
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,039
off-key if somebody wrote a sociological

1001
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,159
review paper and then

1002
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,159
went into a conclusion about a protein

1003
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:27,360
binding molecule

1004
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,200
so that's something that we need to

1005
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,559
really understand that we're all at the

1006
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:31,440
same table

1007
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,200
but it's our different perspectives that

1008
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,720
can either divide or

1009
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,480
integrate us mal

1010
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,080
yes so what you're bringing is really

1011
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,559
important is the silence of causal links

1012
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:42,960
so

1013
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,559
the beauty of active inference is that

1014
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,399
it allows us to draw

1015
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,279
um causal chains right or at least what

1016
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,279
we believe is the inference in

1017
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,159
regard to the causal chains where you

1018
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,080
come from

1019
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,840
defines what is salient in order to get

1020
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,880
to a goal

1021
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,440
so that's why scripts are not just like

1022
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,799
a point here

1023
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,559
and you get there however you want right

1024
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,800
that's that would be a very very very

1025
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,520
weak

1026
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,599
version of the script and anyone who is

1027
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,918
in the market blanket of where anyone

1028
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,239
tries to get to this point that's that's

1029
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,399
a very weak script but a strong script

1030
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,879
is well in order to get to this point

1031
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:21,760
there's

1032
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,960
x element that is salient um as you said

1033
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,760
earlier if

1034
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,359
if someone comes from a different field

1035
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,520
and tells you no no the important causal

1036
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,560
chain

1037
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,480
is through externalist things it doesn't

1038
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,239
matter what's inside your mind that's

1039
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,918
behaviorism right they would say

1040
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:37,679
it doesn't matter what you think so what

1041
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,679
happens is if you don't do it you won't

1042
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,639
go through

1043
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,639
and the internalists will be well it

1044
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,000
doesn't matter if you go through

1045
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,320
what matters is how you act into the

1046
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,040
world

1047
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,760
but um you're ryan pointing out that if

1048
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,159
you're

1049
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,079
we're all at the same table we have to

1050
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,359
realize that

1051
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,199
there both of these things are kind of

1052
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,359
true what really matters is how they

1053
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,760
causally interact to get to

1054
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,760
um a final product a final point

1055
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,680
great point and here's something to add

1056
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,680
on that is within active inference

1057
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,800
we talk about causal inference uh the

1058
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,560
latent causes in the world as

1059
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,440
are hypotheses about the system and so

1060
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,440
if one person hypothesizes that there's

1061
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,040
a causal link and somebody else says i

1062
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,640
think it's not as important as you think

1063
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,320
it is or i think something else is more

1064
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,200
important

1065
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,359
then what we can say is instead of

1066
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,119
getting into an inference

1067
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,000
duel we can get into an active inference

1068
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,960
collaboration

1069
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,720
where we say great well given your

1070
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,560
hypothesis about the causal network and

1071
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,200
mine

1072
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,520
what's the optimal experiment that we

1073
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,320
can do

1074
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,040
and optimal experimentation entails an

1075
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,160
ethical structure

1076
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,839
nobody says well my optimal experiment

1077
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,440
is that we're gonna uh move a thousand

1078
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,119
people to mars and we're gonna test them

1079
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:47,839
with this

1080
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,880
device that's not it's not tractable and

1081
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,240
it's not within our affordances and it's

1082
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,040
not ethical

1083
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,680
so then we can say that's actually not

1084
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,359
in the distribution of experiments we're

1085
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:58,320
going to consider

1086
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,520
gonna download that family of

1087
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,680
experiments and so we can come to the

1088
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,160
table

1089
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,760
and ask what is going to be the most

1090
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,280
informative experiment

1091
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,520
that we can collaborate on specifically

1092
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,119
to reduce our uncertainty

1093
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,240
about our shared world our shared niche

1094
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,440
interesting stuff mao that's exactly

1095
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,359
right like we can come up with new

1096
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,320
models of governance through this by

1097
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,160
understanding that it doesn't have to be

1098
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,200
a zero-sum game

1099
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,359
it can literally be a productive game

1100
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:26,720
where we're just

1101
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,359
optimizing through the the world of

1102
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:30,800
possibles that overlap

1103
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,880
and that are meaningful for everyone

1104
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,400
involved so

1105
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,000
if you could model i'm being

1106
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,320
i'm being a little um optimistic here

1107
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,359
but if you could model

1108
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,160
everyone's scripts and we could model a

1109
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,800
shared

1110
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,079
understanding of what would be a um

1111
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,079
a desired state of the world which would

1112
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,520
be like rg

1113
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,000
we have this g then we can find the

1114
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,680
policies that optimize

1115
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,359
for um our our sets of constraints

1116
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,280
that's just that's just beautiful right

1117
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,400
there

1118
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,599
awesome shannon i have

1119
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,359
um the sort of same question i brought

1120
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,040
up earlier

1121
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,040
about in music you know what the goal is

1122
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,640
you know what this um

1123
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,160
goal state is that you want to optimize

1124
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,240
towards in

1125
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,320
social interactions once you categorize

1126
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,320
them you know kind of what the goal

1127
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,200
state

1128
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,200
should be but if you don't know the gold

1129
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,839
state so you just have

1130
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,440
a couple different social interactions

1131
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,200
maybe you filmed them

1132
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,000
and and and you want to figure out can

1133
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,680
active inference if you if you do

1134
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,119
like an active inference model help you

1135
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,960
figure out what kind of

1136
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,119
social interaction the people in this

1137
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,640
video recording are engaging in

1138
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,240
oh okay now go for that so yeah so

1139
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,560
there's two things to this the first is

1140
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,720
because you're embedded in a culture

1141
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,440
that has a set of narratives you

1142
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,240
actually know

1143
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,400
what the what the goal is of given

1144
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,240
social interactions

1145
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,800
whether it's implicit or explicit you

1146
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,079
enter into

1147
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,079
into certain social interactions because

1148
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,680
you wish to enter in the goal or at

1149
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,079
least

1150
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,359
some polysemi of goals

1151
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,320
the second thing is if you are not sure

1152
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,680
you make inferences

1153
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,599
about what that goal might be and then

1154
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,839
you test those inferences by trying to

1155
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:19,680
you know optimize for a goal you might

1156
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,320
want

1157
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,200
or you um you check if your prediction

1158
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,040
was right and then you update so like

1159
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,200
it's it's this push and pull that allows

1160
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,599
you to get more information so

1161
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,560
um disambiguating reality is something

1162
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,280
that

1163
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,800
is shown in active inference to be

1164
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,720
fundamentally valuable so

1165
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,640
me figuring out whether or not you're

1166
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,320
flirting with me right now

1167
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,320
can be a goal in and of itself even if i

1168
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,240
don't care like i don't want to flirt

1169
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,680
and i don't care that you're flirting

1170
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,520
but i wanna i wanna know though i wanna

1171
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,040
are you flirting is this an

1172
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,040
accurate model of the world that i have

1173
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,160
so that's one thing that active

1174
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,440
inference allows us to

1175
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,760
model in human behavior the second thing

1176
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,640
is

1177
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,079
because we we have scripts that

1178
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,720
lead to certain pathways so certain

1179
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,440
policies policies lead to goals

1180
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,280
we can figure out what kind of policy

1181
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,119
you would sort of be engaged in and

1182
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,520
infer a potential goal you're leading

1183
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,400
towards

1184
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,440
if we're wrong eventually the model will

1185
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,240
update

1186
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,280
so we can see where are the attractors

1187
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,960
in certain behaviors

1188
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,720
which kind of behaviors tend to cluster

1189
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,560
towards something and based on this we

1190
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,000
could infer if we didn't already

1191
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,320
know what is the social goal of a

1192
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,480
specific action

1193
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,760
shannon yeah awesome the

1194
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,119
second part of your of of your answer um

1195
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,760
there's been a lot of like a this flurry

1196
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,240
of papers recently about using

1197
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,440
um the free energy principle in markup

1198
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,640
like it's this kind of thing in a very

1199
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,079
instrumentalist way

1200
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,320
right where where it doesn't mean that

1201
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,359
that group that we're

1202
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:57,440
looking at is necessarily

1203
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,079
embodying a markov blanket but we can

1204
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,680
predict things about that group if we

1205
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,520
model it that way

1206
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,640
and so if instrumental is reading

1207
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,839
for

1208
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,319
using active inference as a tool i'm

1209
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,160
wondering if

1210
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,880
it's going to keep moving in a similar

1211
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,720
way that machine learning has where this

1212
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,760
is a tool

1213
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,119
everybody has a vague concept of what

1214
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,680
machine learning is what it does

1215
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,319
um and then every company in the world

1216
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,000
has their machine learning algorithms to

1217
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,079
predict all of their customers behavior

1218
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,560
or they want to sell you some machine

1219
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,400
learning algorithm about

1220
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,160
categorizing some people you're

1221
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,640
interacting with or some data you have

1222
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,839
um is there

1223
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,319
maybe i don't have a specific question

1224
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,960
maybe i just wonder what do you see

1225
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,000
would what how do you see

1226
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,319
active inference just in this like i

1227
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,000
guess the social script of how we use

1228
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,920
tools and how industries um adopt tools

1229
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,800
and then how

1230
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,839
just the general public perceives tools

1231
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,760
how do you see active inference compared

1232
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,440
to its percep the perception of

1233
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,480
machine learning wow great

1234
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,920
question get it now sorry sorry

1235
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,280
i'm so glad you asked the question i

1236
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,599
didn't wait like i'm gonna do some

1237
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,040
shameless plugging right here

1238
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,599
i'm organizing a colloquium on this

1239
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:22,240
exact

1240
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,640
question um the equilibrium is going to

1241
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,880
be about active inference and collective

1242
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,880
intelligence but the real goal is to

1243
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,599
discuss

1244
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,040
the ethical future of

1245
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,640
active inference in terms of social

1246
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,240
justice so a

1247
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,720
can we not make active inference into

1248
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,640
this tool that will mostly serve

1249
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,800
capitalistic aims and that will serve to

1250
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,720
further oppress communities that have

1251
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,440
zero

1252
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,880
hermeneutic power now so that's it oh

1253
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,400
aim number one

1254
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,520
aim number two is to show that active

1255
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,079
inference

1256
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:58,240
is this wonderful tool because it's not

1257
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,079
opaque it's transparent so we don't have

1258
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,079
a black box where it's like

1259
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,280
all of these layers of nose you're not

1260
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,960
you don't know what they do but it works

1261
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,800
so so

1262
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,119
with active inference we can see the

1263
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,200
parameters of the generated model we can

1264
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,560
see how it evolves

1265
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,119
even if we're using machine learning to

1266
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,480
change the parameters

1267
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,560
we can still see what those para

1268
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,920
parameters are

1269
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,680
so i do see active inference becoming

1270
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,599
the future of predictive technology

1271
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,400
however i also see that because it's

1272
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,119
transparent

1273
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,400
and because we are doing this work

1274
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,920
of trying to bring together fields that

1275
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,359
are thinking about these ethical

1276
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,520
questions such as

1277
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,319
what is the perspective of a an

1278
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,720
oppressed group and how can it inform

1279
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,079
our understanding of social dynamics

1280
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,119
the beauty of active inference is that

1281
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:57,680
it it

1282
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,480
models your anchored position into the

1283
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,760
world

1284
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,560
this is a fundamental shift because that

1285
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,040
that's

1286
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,000
intersectionality right there if we can

1287
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,800
understand

1288
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,160
how intersectionality evolves in the

1289
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,760
world how how we can model

1290
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,480
a specific person's reality

1291
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,160
understanding it through mechanistic

1292
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,040
terms

1293
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,880
it doesn't have to become this sort of

1294
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,880
statistical noise that we have to move

1295
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,599
away and

1296
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:26,880
push people into categories you can be

1297
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,280
your own phenomenology we do not have to

1298
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,160
erase you

1299
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,960
and your reality impacts the world in

1300
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,520
certain ways so if we wanted to say to

1301
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,640
highlight a type of reality a lot of

1302
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,240
work is being done with autistic

1303
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:40,960
children

1304
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,359
or with gender non-binary like there's a

1305
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:44,000
lot of

1306
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,319
of people out there who whose realities

1307
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:47,920
are starting to emerge

1308
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,319
because they were erased before through

1309
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:51,680
active inference we could see like

1310
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,359
there's this island there

1311
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:55,280
that isn't quite responding like the

1312
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,160
rest can we can we zoom in on that can

1313
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,000
we see what's happening can we maybe

1314
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,400
stop

1315
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,440
thinking of society as well you either

1316
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,359
fit into the society's mold or you're

1317
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:06,880
you're moved away and

1318
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,720
can we think of society as something

1319
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,040
that has to adapt to its members

1320
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,319
fundamentally thanks for that

1321
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,560
amazing thank you for that thanks for

1322
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,079
this super interesting

1323
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,640
discussion i'll just add a few comments

1324
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,839
so one thing is that the

1325
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:24,079
instrumentalist reading which means

1326
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,680
using the framework like

1327
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,359
a toolkit rather than a depictor about

1328
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:32,640
what the world quote is instrumentalism

1329
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,800
and tool building is what allows for a

1330
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,880
plurality of narratives to co-exist

1331
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,280
including social justice and non-social

1332
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,319
justice versions

1333
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,599
so because there's a plurality of

1334
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,640
narratives that means there's going to

1335
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,400
be people who are using the tool who you

1336
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,280
disagree with

1337
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,280
just like linear models and just like

1338
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,040
trains so it's going to be something

1339
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,800
that includes a big tent

1340
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,480
um rj i'll get to you in a second the

1341
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,880
second thing is that the goal of society

1342
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,480
is really as you pointed out it's

1343
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,240
polysemis there's a lot of features to

1344
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:58,640
it

1345
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,319
and it just made me think what is the

1346
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:02,240
optimal skydiving height

1347
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,400
and what's the optimal skydiving policy

1348
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,440
and for some people

1349
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,200
because of cognitive diversity it's

1350
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,040
going to be like no just not for me but

1351
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:09,920
no regulation

1352
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,640
or not for me not for anyone or there

1353
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,000
shouldn't be any regulation and taking

1354
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,680
me to the top or i just like two feet

1355
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,079
tall

1356
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,200
every quadrant is going to exist so

1357
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,240
that is the richness of our culture and

1358
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,720
i am very hesitant as many people should

1359
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,280
be about attempts to quantify goals for

1360
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:27,839
society

1361
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,319
and the last point is that what active

1362
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:32,079
inference tools could allow would be

1363
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,640
better definition of institutions public

1364
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,359
private or

1365
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,440
new combinations so for example one

1366
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,440
organization could say our affordances

1367
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:39,760
are

1368
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,760
this this is our input this is our

1369
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,440
output and this is going to be a

1370
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,079
currency

1371
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,319
arbitrage mechanism that's it we're not

1372
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,000
going to be able to censor this other

1373
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,079
domain of your life on this other issue

1374
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:52,640
and so modularity and flexibility in

1375
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,599
institutions

1376
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,200
will become increasingly important and

1377
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,880
again that will allow for new

1378
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,119
narratives to diversify and that will be

1379
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:00,880
challenging as well as

1380
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,200
uh embracing for some rj and then mao

1381
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,319
uh i was gonna say two things um so so

1382
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:12,720
one um on uh how much transparency it

1383
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,280
offers to

1384
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,720
to give us um i think that from from

1385
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,960
what i've seen and i'm i'm not an expert

1386
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:19,760
in these areas

1387
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,400
but from what i've seen on on its on the

1388
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,079
approach toward applying active

1389
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:24,640
inference

1390
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,119
in machine learning models um has been

1391
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,880
that it offers a lot more auditability

1392
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,400
that's that's one thing because the

1393
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,920
causal change and then

1394
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,480
second uh is what's basically echoing

1395
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,680
what dan just said which is that i don't

1396
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,200
know that anybody will have any control

1397
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:37,680
over

1398
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,400
um other people's use of the tool so i'm

1399
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,160
sure it's already being applied in a lot

1400
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,079
of these models so i'm sure that it will

1401
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,200
end up being

1402
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,440
applied to do things that most of us

1403
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,240
wouldn't like

1404
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,640
but i think that it's commendable that

1405
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,160
you're taking efforts to give

1406
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,119
people on-ramps toward using it in

1407
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:56,560
positive directions

1408
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:00,640
awesome mao that's exactly it like while

1409
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,119
you can't stop a

1410
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:04,640
multi-billion dollar company from using

1411
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,760
the system

1412
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,319
um you can make it so that people who

1413
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:11,280
usually do not have the means to

1414
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,400
partake in the construction of a tool to

1415
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,599
become salient voices in the field

1416
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,599
one of the things that tends to annoy me

1417
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,200
when i go to a conference

1418
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,960
is mammals like it seems silly right

1419
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,160
but a mantle is just mostly one type of

1420
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,040
perspective

1421
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,839
and it doesn't to people who are on the

1422
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,440
panel it doesn't seem that way to them

1423
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,720
they're all different people

1424
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,119
with different perspectives but the way

1425
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:38,720
that you came into the world the way

1426
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,720
that you approach the research the way

1427
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:41,680
that you approach

1428
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,280
paradigms will have some attractive

1429
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,280
attracting commonalities because of your

1430
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,200
position and

1431
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,480
a lot of brilliant work has been done in

1432
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,040
shifting paradigms because new

1433
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,079
perspectives were coming into the field

1434
00:47:57,079 --> 00:47:58,319
intersectionality

1435
00:47:58,319 --> 00:47:59,920
probably could only have been possible

1436
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,240
because of kimberly crenshaw who came

1437
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,800
in in feminism from a very different

1438
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,800
point

1439
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,160
the second idea is that

1440
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,880
we don't have to necessarily control

1441
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,240
what the goal state is at every level

1442
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,680
but we can probably say that um

1443
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,400
there has to be bottom-up and top-down

1444
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,400
communication for things to flow more

1445
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,000
smoothly right now

1446
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,559
highly hierarchical system tend to go

1447
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,000
you know top-down and less

1448
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,640
bottom-up the communication is a bit

1449
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,520
bottlenecked in

1450
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,839
one direction and not the other through

1451
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:39,359
active inference we could allow

1452
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:40,480
governance

1453
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:45,119
choose to um allow a better

1454
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,079
modeling of what is the optimal goal

1455
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:48,559
state

1456
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:52,079
of ex actor and how can we

1457
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,359
model our vision of this local world

1458
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:57,920
to take into consideration all of these

1459
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,920
optimal goal states is it possible for

1460
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,280
us to optimize

1461
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,480
all or a maximum of their goal states um

1462
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,480
given where they are and what we have at

1463
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,880
our disposition

1464
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,440
cool one note there on the bottom up in

1465
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,960
the top down and about

1466
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,359
including people in the conversation is

1467
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:16,319
that uh

1468
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:17,599
you're really talking about a

1469
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:19,839
reimagining of this nexus

1470
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:21,440
of people and institutions it's a

1471
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,599
multi-scale re-understanding

1472
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,280
about who and what we are and we're not

1473
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,119
going to go into it in this stream but

1474
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,800
active inference and free energy has

1475
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,160
been applied to sub

1476
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,680
organismal things like the brain and

1477
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,440
different organs and physiology so we're

1478
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,880
not going to really talk about that

1479
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,640
but cells are also doing this kind of

1480
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,200
thing so it also allows us to look

1481
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,319
inwards and more internally and outwards

1482
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:43,599
and more externally

1483
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,680
without falling into some of these traps

1484
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,280
and then as far as um

1485
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,040
how we can make that nexus a better

1486
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,760
place the institutions and the power

1487
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,119
and the money can be pressured to stay

1488
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:58,160
on the rails and can be uh asked to have

1489
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,599
more transparent modeling or say if

1490
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:00,640
you're going to use machine learning on

1491
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,240
my preferences then i better

1492
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,319
know x y or z or if you're going to

1493
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,240
regulate water you better make promises

1494
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,280
x y and z

1495
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,280
and then also as far as rising up from

1496
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,280
the bottom and making the bottom up side

1497
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,400
of the communication

1498
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,319
you mentioned governance there's also a

1499
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:16,000
lot of cool work with digital governance

1500
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,440
related to active inference

1501
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,680
and then also just simply including

1502
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,559
people in

1503
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,480
relationships and conversations and

1504
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,680
teams because

1505
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,160
that is what the social fabric is so to

1506
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:26,880
not do that

1507
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,119
is to not be doing it and to do it is to

1508
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:30,000
be doing it

1509
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,760
so that's what i hope would be a cool

1510
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,520
way for people to be able to come

1511
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,319
together and

1512
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,880
talk about through these frameworks and

1513
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,240
linear models

1514
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,760
though they explain some variants in

1515
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,520
some situations you don't get

1516
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,520
this kind of conversation with a linear

1517
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,000
model so even if it does fall to pure

1518
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,680
instrumentalism with active inference

1519
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,119
and it's just a way to degenerative

1520
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:51,119
models that explain more variation in

1521
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:52,160
the environment

1522
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,400
and future models might explain even

1523
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,400
more maybe like a super neural network

1524
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,079
that's super next level with a physical

1525
00:50:58,079 --> 00:50:59,040
computer

1526
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,960
it might explain more variation but if

1527
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,559
it can't provide this kind of a

1528
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,079
transdisciplinary discussion then it

1529
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:04,800
won't be

1530
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,839
as cool as active blue

1531
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:12,480
hi so just to kind of piggyback on like

1532
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,000
what everybody's like been

1533
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,319
saying so i wonder like active inference

1534
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,319
is more transparent right than say like

1535
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:18,800
deep

1536
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,880
like neural networks but how is that

1537
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,240
like transparency

1538
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,240
affected when we don't really know like

1539
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,280
at every level

1540
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,520
it's like there's this nested hierarchy

1541
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,640
and so we don't know

1542
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,880
the affordances of all the components at

1543
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,040
every level going upward or downward in

1544
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,400
the chain of command

1545
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,960
and so i just wonder like how we can use

1546
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,480
active inference to maybe

1547
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,960
like when we don't know like maybe

1548
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,720
that's where we find the edges

1549
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,760
of the um scripts

1550
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,680
right like so like if we're looking at

1551
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,440
bottom up or top down is that like

1552
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,280
how we probe those edges for

1553
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,880
transparency when we don't know

1554
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,720
like or without transparency when we

1555
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,000
don't know what's happening at all the

1556
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:56,640
different levels

1557
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,839
i don't know if that makes sense if that

1558
00:51:57,839 --> 00:51:59,680
was just confusing yeah um

1559
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,760
just rj one and then i'll first though

1560
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,520
the transparent idea that came

1561
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,400
from the active um previous one where we

1562
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,240
talked about transparent concepts in

1563
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,680
philosophy like the ones that are the

1564
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,119
water that we swim in so now it's a

1565
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:12,800
different concept with the auditability

1566
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,920
of machine learning

1567
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,920
but similarly there's this idea about

1568
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,000
making the invisible visible

1569
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,319
and one suggestion i'd have before rj

1570
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:21,599
them out would be

1571
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:24,400
we aren't just coming to terms on the

1572
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,200
inference

1573
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,359
remember also that active means that

1574
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:28,720
we're coming to terms on optimal

1575
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,599
experimentation

1576
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:32,640
so we might say all right whatever

1577
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,160
inference you're making about the world

1578
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,000
the danger of some group in

1579
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,280
another country what is the policy

1580
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,040
and what is the experimentation what's

1581
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,720
the info gain we're looking for

1582
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,160
we don't need to go for the ultimate

1583
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,720
teleos goal of society i want this to be

1584
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,359
the case

1585
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:49,599
you can just say okay given the info on

1586
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:50,480
the ground

1587
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,960
in this other country what is the policy

1588
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,720
that you and i are going to continue

1589
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,359
and deepen our relationship over and

1590
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:58,880
that's what's way more important is that

1591
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,319
moving forward together

1592
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:02,240
on a journey and on a narrative of

1593
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,359
togetherness

1594
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,880
rather than coming to agreement on these

1595
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,480
goals and i get it people want to talk

1596
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,000
about goals but they're also

1597
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,599
things that can prevent us from thinking

1598
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:11,280
about policy too deeply but justifying

1599
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,400
it so clearly important

1600
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,440
so yeah rj and then uh just

1601
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,000
responding to what blue said uh and it's

1602
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,359
kind of making me rethink what i said

1603
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:20,960
earlier about auditability

1604
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,440
it sounds like uh from what i've read

1605
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,200
that it's less getting rid of a black

1606
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,119
box and more creating a blanket of black

1607
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:27,760
boxes

1608
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,400
so we know where the edges between these

1609
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,160
black boxes are but that allows us to

1610
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,359
get a better understanding of what's

1611
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:34,960
going on in each of them i suppose

1612
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,800
so okay wow

1613
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,760
so yeah so it all depends about in on

1614
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,000
the

1615
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,160
granularity that you're using so if you

1616
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,079
let's say that i started from

1617
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:49,359
each individual every person i don't

1618
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:49,920
model

1619
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,800
uh their i don't model their cells or

1620
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,079
their brain i model them

1621
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:56,640
and their behavior say and then you you

1622
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,760
scale up and up

1623
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,079
and up and up so the level of

1624
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:01,040
granularity

1625
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,720
of their affordances is going to be

1626
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:05,599
obvious

1627
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:07,440
at the individual level and the higher

1628
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,280
you go the more information lost there

1629
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,960
is which also makes it more computable

1630
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:11,359
right

1631
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:14,240
like if i if i if i start modeling the

1632
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,000
the behavior of a mark of blanket and

1633
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,280
then i look at all the other marker

1634
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,040
blankets at this level i don't have to

1635
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,160
recompute

1636
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,000
every individual i have the markup like

1637
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,680
it so

1638
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,839
it depends on you and your research if

1639
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:27,280
you want to start

1640
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:31,359
by modeling every cell in everybody

1641
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:33,960
and then try to find the emergent

1642
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,520
complexity

1643
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,040
that's great that's good and you can

1644
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,200
have more affordances based on this i

1645
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,319
think that's why

1646
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,480
scripts are so interesting because they

1647
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,079
allow us to

1648
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:48,000
um model the likely affordances

1649
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,359
of someone given where they are and

1650
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:53,040
given a set of parameters

1651
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,319
so even if it's not their absolute

1652
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:58,240
affordances we can assume that there's

1653
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,839
the probability of them

1654
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,920
going towards x and now if you start

1655
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:02,880
modeling

1656
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,880
all of the possible scripts and how it

1657
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,160
connects to

1658
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,520
semantic grounding so

1659
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,520
what does it mean for something to be a

1660
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,960
library what what is

1661
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,040
what is the clustering that i can do

1662
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,880
then you can start seeing that

1663
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,960
some clusterings will start overlapping

1664
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,880
in ways that make it more likely for the

1665
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,559
person to you know maybe go in this

1666
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:23,440
direction

1667
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,079
so for instance um i want to go to the

1668
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:26,720
library

1669
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,880
but i live far from the library and i

1670
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,880
happen to have a car

1671
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,079
well could i fly there

1672
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:36,720
it's unlikely right could i walk there i

1673
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,119
mean i

1674
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:41,119
could but i in the scripts of today's

1675
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:42,880
world you tend to want to do things

1676
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:43,760
within

1677
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,359
one or two hours if it takes more than

1678
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:46,720
that it's like you're wasting your time

1679
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,280
so

1680
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,960
i'm probably going to take a car if i

1681
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,160
don't have a car i'm probably going to

1682
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,359
like either call an

1683
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:53,680
uber because i happen to be in this shoe

1684
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,040
in in this um

1685
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,680
social demographic or i'll take a bus if

1686
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,280
i'm in a different social demographic

1687
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,640
you can also predict this based on

1688
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:01,280
whether

1689
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,040
you think i care about the environment

1690
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,880
so the script of someone caring for the

1691
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,640
environment probably won't take a car

1692
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,079
right they'll take like the bus or

1693
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:09,839
something so like

1694
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:13,680
you can predict the overlaps based on

1695
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,880
uh the kind of scripts that are um

1696
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,799
manifest and and measurable awesome

1697
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:22,880
um just a couple comments there as far

1698
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,240
as transparency

1699
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,920
often people want to know more about the

1700
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,599
details of a model and i would just

1701
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:28,000
offer

1702
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,839
do we really understand a quadratic

1703
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:31,520
model or addition

1704
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,680
or linear regression credit cards

1705
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:34,559
bitcoin

1706
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,480
we can use things without quote

1707
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,160
understanding them that's a story we

1708
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:38,480
tell

1709
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,799
ourselves about the model so i would

1710
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:41,680
offer that

1711
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,920
transparency could be approached from

1712
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,200
the angle of like

1713
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,359
dashboards and really studying the

1714
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,880
residuals of your model so if you're

1715
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:49,440
doing an

1716
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,160
online learning system and then you find

1717
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:52,480
oh

1718
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,200
we had this person in this canyon and

1719
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,720
the feedback surveys that we're asking

1720
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:57,119
them

1721
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:58,559
are suggesting they're not getting what

1722
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:00,240
they need so just

1723
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,400
you know philosophical debates aside how

1724
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,520
are we going to help this person

1725
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,680
at this time and perhaps it isn't that

1726
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:06,960
large of an intervention that needs to

1727
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:07,599
be made

1728
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:10,000
in that case so we can separate the

1729
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:10,640
perfect

1730
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,920
systems depictions goal from the helping

1731
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:14,960
real people like

1732
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,280
in the 100 000 people in this town

1733
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,799
there's 500 people who want to go to the

1734
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:20,720
library and will really benefit a lot

1735
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,319
how are we going to get these 500 and

1736
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:23,359
then how are we going to make it

1737
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:25,359
open-ended with a survey so that

1738
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,200
if people aren't part of our predicted

1739
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,280
500 they're still able to contribute

1740
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,799
these are things that are at the

1741
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:32,960
intersection of the model

1742
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,000
with just some pragmatics and logistics

1743
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,680
so i would say the last mile is going to

1744
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,079
be just the details of the system and

1745
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:40,400
this

1746
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,400
is like the skeleton wow

1747
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,880
oh i thought you had a second point i

1748
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,640
was waiting for your second point no

1749
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,920
that was it okay well no but that let's

1750
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:52,559
see again

1751
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:53,920
this is really beautiful what you said

1752
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,880
because we can promote

1753
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,160
the resilience of a community

1754
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:03,440
by looking at what is the true goal of

1755
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,280
people so like you said an open-ended

1756
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,440
survey for these people there's 500 who

1757
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,200
want to go to the library

1758
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,400
and the rest don't really so but

1759
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,280
do they all want to go at x times do

1760
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,160
they all live in the same area xyz

1761
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,079
knowing this information and knowing

1762
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:22,240
what people actually prefer what would

1763
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,359
be their goal state

1764
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:26,400
allows us to enable them through our

1765
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,079
resource from the top

1766
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:30,160
to pull down resources that would

1767
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,400
actually serve people's purposes

1768
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,319
i think that's beautiful social aim that

1769
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:36,240
we could promote through

1770
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:41,119
a new system of allocating resources

1771
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:45,760
depending on people's goals and benefits

1772
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,040
yep cool very fun and exciting and

1773
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:49,520
different

1774
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,079
active stream so i'll just go to a few

1775
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:52,559
of these

1776
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:54,799
questions many of which we will have

1777
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:55,839
already brought up

1778
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:58,319
in some guys but here we can just put

1779
00:58:58,319 --> 00:58:59,920
them all on one page and just

1780
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,520
think about what are sort of the

1781
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,599
questions that people might have

1782
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:05,680
again either from the acting community

1783
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,280
looking out or

1784
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,200
from the social sciences or from the

1785
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,280
neurosciences and looking in

1786
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,319
so how does active inference unify the

1787
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:14,960
disparate

1788
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,359
scripts concept so people can raise

1789
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:18,160
their hand but all

1790
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,480
emphasize the nestedness and the

1791
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:21,440
hierarchical

1792
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,040
like the vertical nesting and then the

1793
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,040
heteroarticle the collective behavior

1794
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,359
the horizontal the lateral these two

1795
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,480
dimensions

1796
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,240
and the ways that we can use the

1797
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,079
framework instrumentally

1798
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:34,480
to distinguish different models that's a

1799
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:35,440
way that we can

1800
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,920
get the strong versus weak scripts

1801
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,040
variation axis

1802
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,200
and the internalist externalists kind of

1803
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,119
together by just emphasizing

1804
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:46,000
the coherence or non-coherence

1805
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,599
strongness versus weakness

1806
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:50,319
of different empirical systems and take

1807
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:50,960
a look at them

1808
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,119
in this multi-scale way that obviates

1809
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:54,640
the internal external

1810
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,160
any if people have thoughts just raise

1811
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,000
their hand otherwise i just go

1812
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,880
through the oh yeah now go for it that

1813
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,799
was a lot of questions

1814
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:05,359
uh the first thing that come that comes

1815
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:07,680
to mind is you you mentioned

1816
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,839
a hierarchical hierarchical that's kind

1817
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:11,760
of beautiful so think about it in terms

1818
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:12,319
of

1819
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:15,520
um behaviors that lead to goals right

1820
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,599
so imagine that you have these

1821
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:18,720
hierarchies

1822
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,839
of goals um that both

1823
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:24,960
are related to time

1824
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,920
and to generality so for instance um

1825
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,760
i want to be a good person which is like

1826
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,720
the highest the largest possible script

1827
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:37,119
ever

1828
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:38,559
because like that's that's one thing

1829
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:40,640
that's like it's kind of binary

1830
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,480
it's like okay good bad person whatever

1831
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,960
then how do i be a good person well

1832
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,200
i can either be a good person in

1833
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,480
relation to

1834
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,599
um norm expectation or to

1835
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:54,319
values that i myself crafted or values

1836
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:56,400
that were given to me or like

1837
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,799
there's like it breaks down and then

1838
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:00,720
within these values set well it breaks

1839
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:01,920
down again into

1840
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,640
uh societal behavioral scripts etc so

1841
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,079
again see you can see that

1842
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,640
as the higher you go the less your

1843
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:09,200
script

1844
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,599
is a strong script it's a series of

1845
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:13,359
strong script that becomes this sort of

1846
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:14,480
cluster

1847
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:17,359
now you take your goal at any layer they

1848
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:17,680
pick

1849
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,760
any of them your goal is where you want

1850
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,839
to get because it happens to be a gate

1851
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:23,359
to get to like

1852
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:25,920
the next stage of your of your script

1853
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:26,799
right

1854
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:29,920
so to get to this goal there's several

1855
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,400
possibilities at the lower levels that

1856
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,240
lead in this direction

1857
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,119
we can thus unify the different uh the

1858
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:38,799
different types of scripts and how we

1859
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:40,160
understanding

1860
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:43,599
through this um sort of pyramid that

1861
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:46,000
goes from elements to goal and we can

1862
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,119
cluster which

1863
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:49,119
script doesn't lead to x goal et cetera

1864
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:52,319
et cetera and then we can understand how

1865
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:55,359
um the the individual

1866
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:58,240
models this system has a clear

1867
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,920
understanding of the system based on

1868
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,200
what they were exposed

1869
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,240
to so their environment is what they

1870
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,440
were exposed to

1871
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:08,559
their con their their cognition is how

1872
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:10,640
they brought together this sex position

1873
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,880
internalized it and started behaving

1874
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,319
behaving into the world

1875
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:15,920
um i feel like i answered the question

1876
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,599
but it was a very large question

1877
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:20,799
so let me nice that was very

1878
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:22,559
cool and just one other thought there is

1879
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:24,480
that the goal seeking

1880
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,799
uh let's not think that that's going to

1881
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:28,000
put our values

1882
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,079
in the background because goal seeking

1883
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,559
is even more about values

1884
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:34,880
so this is actually not sidestepping the

1885
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,640
question of coming to

1886
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,359
or stating our values or probable

1887
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,400
preferences for

1888
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,440
policy this is actually censoring it

1889
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,440
and then acting within it so that's the

1890
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:46,720
inference part all right

1891
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:50,480
the next question is in which settings

1892
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,359
would an active inference script model

1893
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:53,680
be

1894
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,920
valuable and kind of related to that

1895
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,920
would be in that setting we can already

1896
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:58,400
ask

1897
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,720
what would the metadata for the script

1898
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,960
look like and also i'm just curious like

1899
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,680
are there any empirical studies that are

1900
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,440
being done in the scripts framework or

1901
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:07,839
what

1902
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:10,400
next steps are you taking in this line

1903
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,839
of research or what would excite you

1904
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:14,720
out to see like done in a hypothetical

1905
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,839
dream experiment

1906
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:28,000
so um the first thing that i think of in

1907
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,440
terms of valuable is something that

1908
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:30,640
relates to

1909
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:35,280
let me check his name rj mentioned

1910
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,039
we can use

1911
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:42,000
the the the scripts idea in active

1912
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,440
inference and the way we modeled it

1913
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,480
through weak and

1914
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,839
strong to understand

1915
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:52,160
how social behaviors tend to radicalize

1916
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:55,280
or how some policy brought by the top

1917
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:58,559
will be received by the bottom so

1918
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:02,000
anything related to politics or to

1919
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,520
social movements would find such a model

1920
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:08,799
valuable the the i'm not sure what you

1921
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:09,359
mean by

1922
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:12,640
metadata so could you be a little more

1923
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,760
precise about that

1924
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,680
yeah rj why don't you go for that and

1925
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,280
maybe give some thoughts what were you

1926
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:20,319
meaning there sure um so first

1927
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:23,920
on um using actin this this

1928
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,240
this style model um in political

1929
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,000
atmospheres talk about

1930
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
organizations using active inference in

1931
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,440
ways we might not like

1932
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,760
um is is governments watching uh

1933
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,200
extremist ideology

1934
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,440
um so i was i was actually gonna say one

1935
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,799
place where i

1936
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:42,319
i wouldn't um i know it will be of

1937
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:44,480
interest to use it but i would love to

1938
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,319
see it used this way is to see

1939
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:49,039
how people radicalize um specifically

1940
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:51,119
the scripts we use to react

1941
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:54,319
to uh extremist content um and because

1942
01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:58,720
i i think that from my understanding um

1943
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,480
that this type of model would be very

1944
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,240
useful in identifying when a person has

1945
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:02,799
become

1946
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:04,319
uh what we'll call it like extremist

1947
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:05,680
audiology friendly where they're no

1948
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,039
longer going to call it out and say you

1949
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:08,880
know i don't agree with that or i'm not

1950
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:09,520
comfortable

1951
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:10,640
with somebody talking about saying like

1952
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,880
domestic terrorism um

1953
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,000
so so i could see it being

1954
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
extraordinarily useful for for

1955
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,520
governments in that context

1956
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,599
um when it comes to metadata for scripts

1957
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:21,119
like this is included

1958
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:24,079
um so the metadata might be um you know

1959
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:24,319
so

1960
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:26,640
so well the data might describe the

1961
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:27,680
script itself

1962
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:30,640
um the metadata might describe some some

1963
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:31,920
key attributes that

1964
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:33,680
aren't directly related as dan likes to

1965
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,119
say the metadata is the data and this is

1966
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:36,640
one of these areas where

1967
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,240
like that's definitely there's no the

1968
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,240
blur is is definitely large

1969
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:43,359
um so for me when i think about um how i

1970
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:43,839
would

1971
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:46,319
try to start describing the metadata for

1972
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:47,520
scripts it would be

1973
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,319
um does this res does this script

1974
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:51,280
require

1975
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,440
two people to know that it's happening

1976
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,599
so like for example um uh flirting

1977
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:57,920
it might be you know um one person can

1978
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,440
enact their scripts without the other

1979
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:00,160
person uh

1980
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,480
enacting it whereas like a script for

1981
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:03,920
swearing in the president of the united

1982
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:04,640
states

1983
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,400
that is a script that that's a strong

1984
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,760
script with explicit rules that

1985
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,200
everybody has to be aware of otherwise

1986
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,240
it doesn't work

1987
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,720
um so i i think that there's like

1988
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:13,920
categorization

1989
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,079
values that might be associated with it

1990
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:18,160
and then uh yeah but anyway i think

1991
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:19,359
there's a lot you could go into in that

1992
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:20,079
so i won't go

1993
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:22,240
too far down the rabbit hole cool let's

1994
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,440
do blue then

1995
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:26,480
shannon then mao

1996
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,680
so just to piggyback off of what rj was

1997
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:30,640
saying about

1998
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,720
radicalization it's interesting like

1999
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,160
when did radicalization

2000
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,760
become a script right and like this is

2001
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:36,960
what we're talking about finding the

2002
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:37,599
edges

2003
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:39,039
and so like where does the script even

2004
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:41,039
exist is it like an external construct

2005
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:42,720
like a societal construct this is the

2006
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,079
battle between internalism and

2007
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:44,960
externalism

2008
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,359
but when is there like a critical mass

2009
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:48,400
of

2010
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:51,280
internal scripts that develop that then

2011
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,200
it becomes this external script like you

2012
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,400
can be a radical

2013
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,000
like the first person to become

2014
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,760
radicalized like was just

2015
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:00,079
radical right like they just took their

2016
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:01,200
own initiative

2017
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,280
to to you know it was their own script

2018
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,880
it was like an internal construct

2019
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,039
and so where's the like the line really

2020
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:08,480
like when a script becomes

2021
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,200
an acceptable or even an alternative way

2022
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,280
like there's some kind of critical mass

2023
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,599
that has to accrue before before that

2024
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:16,559
happens and it's just

2025
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:19,520
something interesting to think about

2026
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:20,079
shannon

2027
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:23,119
then mo and then rj again i have a bit

2028
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:24,559
of a topic change so maybe you want to

2029
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:26,240
talk about that first and then ask me a

2030
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:26,799
question

2031
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:29,280
okay if it's on the same um idea mao

2032
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,880
then rj

2033
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,400
yeah so exactly so how do we figure out

2034
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,559
when someone is going to radicalize or

2035
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:38,000
specifically

2036
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,640
what leads to radicalization well the

2037
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,079
truth is radicalization

2038
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:45,520
tends to happen within clustering

2039
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:48,720
so it's not just someone who unless this

2040
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:49,760
person has

2041
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:53,280
specific like um

2042
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:56,079
psychological issues which make them go

2043
01:07:56,079 --> 01:07:57,680
off on their own tangent

2044
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:00,880
away from the cluster it tends to be

2045
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,160
that

2046
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,799
clusters form around narratives right so

2047
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:05,280
what is

2048
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,280
let's say a meninist group what is a

2049
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,920
meninist narrative well women are

2050
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,280
gaining too many rights and they're

2051
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,880
taking the spot of men and in some men

2052
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:13,839
in his group

2053
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:15,920
this narrative becomes women are trying

2054
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,679
to take down men

2055
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:20,399
to enslave them and then the narrative

2056
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:21,920
moves forward and it moves

2057
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:25,120
women are trying to destroy men and then

2058
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:27,040
what is the acceptable answer to this

2059
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:29,520
well we must destroy women

2060
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,439
and this is something you can see

2061
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:33,120
happening through the shift

2062
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,920
of the narrative the the people inside

2063
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,198
these clusters

2064
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:39,520
start bringing categories together and

2065
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,359
then pinging off each other

2066
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:44,000
and then i'm giving you this narrative

2067
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:44,719
and a lot of people

2068
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:46,080
oh yeah you're right this is the right

2069
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,759
narrative and then somebody else with

2070
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:49,920
slightly different a little bit more

2071
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,759
narrative keeps pushing on and you get

2072
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:52,000
this

2073
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,839
cluster and then people build on each

2074
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:55,520
other and the person on top or at least

2075
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:56,799
someone who's believing

2076
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:59,198
so much into this narrative which also

2077
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:01,198
identifies it with potentially violence

2078
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:01,679
which

2079
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:04,080
we could measure based on the type of

2080
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:06,158
narrative that's being used

2081
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:08,158
we will possibly be able to identify

2082
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:10,158
okay well this cluster of people

2083
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:12,158
and specifically this type of person in

2084
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:14,719
there is is more likely to do something

2085
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:17,600
really bad really soon what that means

2086
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:18,560
for our governments

2087
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,799
that's not up for me to decide ideally i

2088
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:21,920
think it would be

2089
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:25,679
um bringing help in this in these areas

2090
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:26,640
and being like well

2091
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,560
maybe maybe you need to rethink your

2092
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,719
narratives maybe we can help you soften

2093
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:32,080
whatever it is you're going through

2094
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:32,560
that's

2095
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,640
pushing you to to get towards these

2096
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,319
narratives

2097
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:39,359
thanks rj

2098
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:41,279
uh well now covered a lot of what i was

2099
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:42,880
going to say um once again

2100
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,759
perfect we're definitely synced um i

2101
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:47,359
would just add that it is definitely one

2102
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:48,238
of those areas

2103
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:51,279
where um uh i think

2104
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:53,759
we people who are who are working in the

2105
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:55,040
topic outside

2106
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:58,800
of governments um to

2107
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,000
try to create the speed bumps

2108
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,040
um so that like like that not not i

2109
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:06,880
don't want to say speed bumps it's hard

2110
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,480
to articulate like like

2111
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,400
the the like clearly express the

2112
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:11,520
limitations so that

2113
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,440
um government doesn't go and take this

2114
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:14,960
and then apply it badly like they've

2115
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:15,360
done

2116
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,360
with um with machine learning and say

2117
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:18,719
like the judicial system

2118
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:20,640
uh we're trying to predict flight risk

2119
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:21,840
and things like that they applied it

2120
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:22,800
very quickly

2121
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,960
and didn't really weren't really sure

2122
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,159
what they were doing and they applied it

2123
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:27,440
before they really understood what they

2124
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:28,239
were working with and

2125
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:31,199
obviously did a lot of damage so thanks

2126
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:33,120
just one last comment on this

2127
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,920
uh radical doesn't mean divergent or

2128
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:36,640
committed

2129
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,679
radical means from the root so i think

2130
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:41,679
that radicalization as a discussion

2131
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:43,920
should refocus us on the seed memes the

2132
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,679
germ memes in the space

2133
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:47,360
and the ways that generative models

2134
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:49,920
modelable by script and active inference

2135
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,080
could understand what leads to the

2136
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:53,840
adoption the phase transition of the

2137
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:54,800
seed memes

2138
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,640
and then the policy decisions that

2139
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,800
someone engages in are probabilistic

2140
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,199
and can be inferred downstream of these

2141
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:02,400
seed memetics

2142
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,760
and so those are the premises of the

2143
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,280
narrative so if someone thinks that

2144
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:06,400
they're in braveheart

2145
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:07,840
or if they think that they're in batman

2146
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,040
or if they think that they're a

2147
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,640
different role in a movie

2148
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,480
that's really what we're getting at is

2149
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:13,679
what is the genre

2150
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:16,159
of culture what kind of movie is it a

2151
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:18,159
good one short one long one

2152
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:19,920
what is the cast going to be how are

2153
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,199
they going to treat each other

2154
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:23,120
we can talk about it that way and that

2155
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,880
is what has been distorted in the public

2156
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:25,199
eye

2157
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:28,400
for too long shannon

2158
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:32,640
and then sasha thanks that was um

2159
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,239
a really informative discussion and that

2160
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:35,520
metaphor really brought it all together

2161
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,800
at the end daniel

2162
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:40,880
um so i don't study social

2163
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,280
interactions on that large of a scale i

2164
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:45,280
bring people in a lab i look at how

2165
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,159
maybe their

2166
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:49,440
motor activity coordinates in in like

2167
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:50,960
postural sway so something that you're

2168
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,560
not really aware of happening but it's

2169
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:53,760
happening all the time

2170
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:54,800
you're swaying and maybe you're

2171
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,679
mirroring someone um across from you

2172
01:11:57,679 --> 01:11:59,120
and you guys have been having a

2173
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,440
conversation of what the metadata

2174
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,239
looks like um but what is i want what

2175
01:12:04,239 --> 01:12:05,040
does the

2176
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,640
data look like if you were going to use

2177
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,400
this active inference model

2178
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,480
at something as large scale as these

2179
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:11,600
social movements that you're talking

2180
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:12,239
about

2181
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:15,280
um or at smaller scales like i i can see

2182
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:15,679
that

2183
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:17,600
the kind of data i would look at in very

2184
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:18,800
small groups

2185
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,199
would be you know patterns of motor

2186
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:22,320
activity

2187
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,800
maybe that i'm measuring from filming

2188
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,000
the body

2189
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,040
or motor activity in a brain um but in a

2190
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:29,520
large

2191
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,080
social group like that would you be

2192
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,840
looking at like gps tracking a phone

2193
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,120
like we've been doing a lot of

2194
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,120
modeling of how people interact in this

2195
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,320
um pandemic

2196
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,400
and where large clusters of people are

2197
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,600
interacting and

2198
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,040
we might have like super spreading

2199
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:45,040
events for covid19

2200
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:47,040
um or would these narratives that you've

2201
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:48,640
been talking about um

2202
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,080
sound like their verbal narrative so

2203
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,760
would you be looking at um

2204
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,840
social media profiles um you know

2205
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,520
twitter facebook

2206
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:58,960
and how

2207
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,199
honest are those data so i know that the

2208
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:02,480
data i'm measuring the

2209
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,440
the postural sway data my participant i

2210
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:06,880
mean unless they're actually

2211
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:10,320
swaying back and forth um intentionally

2212
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:11,760
like to beat music they don't have

2213
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:12,800
control over

2214
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,440
all of these small muscle movements in

2215
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:16,400
your body that are

2216
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,400
that are controlling your posture um

2217
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:21,040
it's really a very embodied

2218
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,280
behavior and i know that when i'm

2219
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,960
measuring it i'm getting an honest

2220
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:25,840
signal

2221
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,880
but if you're looking at um even gps

2222
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,880
data or if you're looking at

2223
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:33,920
social media narrative data the signal

2224
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:34,800
could

2225
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,480
like people could be intentionally

2226
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,960
signaling for

2227
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,640
others who share their view or others

2228
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,480
who don't share their view or

2229
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,320
intentionally not signaling because

2230
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,480
they're afraid of

2231
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:49,199
a response or all of the various things

2232
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:50,400
that could

2233
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,400
affect and make the make the signal that

2234
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,000
you're measuring not be honest so

2235
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,040
so what would the data look like in your

2236
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:58,880
that that would make your active

2237
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:01,040
inference model of this

2238
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:04,400
large social situation be

2239
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:08,080
closer to the truth thanks for that

2240
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:10,320
awesome question we're gonna do sasha

2241
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,840
then then

2242
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:15,600
rj yeah i guess continuing the

2243
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,480
conversation of

2244
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:20,080
how um i would like to see this used

2245
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,760
um thinking about scripts and

2246
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,120
stereotypes

2247
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:26,239
um i guess my my hope for seeing active

2248
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:27,280
inference as

2249
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:31,280
a tool is for people to um

2250
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:33,199
think about it think about their own

2251
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:34,400
role in

2252
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:38,640
their active inference story um and that

2253
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,080
instead of just thinking about machine

2254
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,640
learning and like um getting

2255
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,880
recommendations and ads based on your

2256
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:45,920
preferences

2257
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:48,960
that you actually um shape your own

2258
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:49,600
story

2259
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,679
and that you are building your narrative

2260
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:54,239
which then leads to policies and goals

2261
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:57,920
and so um taking a more active role

2262
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,600
in the kinds of things that will be

2263
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,239
predicted about us based on our actions

2264
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:04,159
um and to try to shape that in a way

2265
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:05,920
that signals um

2266
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:11,040
something deeper uh like our values

2267
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:15,840
ooh mao and on the data question two

2268
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:19,040
yeah so um i'm gonna try and uh if i

2269
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:20,640
forget a question they were important i

2270
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,159
really don't wanna so if i forget please

2271
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:23,440
remind me

2272
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,120
the first question was what kind of data

2273
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,600
well you're right social media would be

2274
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,159
super great because what you said about

2275
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:32,080
the honesty of data is that well

2276
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:35,280
social reality is manifest reality like

2277
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,440
if you behave a certain way because you

2278
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,199
know your group behaves a certain way

2279
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:40,880
well it's because you've integrated what

2280
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,120
the group wants and that's the script

2281
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,280
the the way we could see whether or not

2282
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,840
this is something that your cognition is

2283
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,480
entirely geared towards or is just

2284
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,640
fulfilling because xyz

2285
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:55,840
is how you behave in other groups so

2286
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,199
one of the things that would be

2287
01:15:57,199 --> 01:15:59,280
difficult to highlight

2288
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,520
is if you are let's say um part of a

2289
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:02,960
cult right

2290
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,560
you're part of a cult and you are of no

2291
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,760
contact with anyone else

2292
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,199
it would be difficult for us to figure

2293
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:11,040
out whether this type of behavior

2294
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:14,080
is also being contested inside we could

2295
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:14,880
maybe

2296
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:17,760
model this by looking at all of the

2297
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,040
other members and

2298
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:21,199
what kinds of interactions some people

2299
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:23,679
who tend to disagree a little bit

2300
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,600
tend to have we can't know for sure and

2301
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:26,960
that's kind of also

2302
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,679
that's we make inferences about the

2303
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:31,280
states of our agents

2304
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,960
based on what they put out into the

2305
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,800
world the observations they put out

2306
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,320
you're right that social media data

2307
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:37,920
would not necessarily be enough though

2308
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:38,640
because

2309
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:42,400
um you want to have data about what it

2310
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:45,520
means to be in the world even outside of

2311
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:46,640
the virtual world

2312
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,960
so if all you care about is online

2313
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:50,159
behavior

2314
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:51,440
then well i mean it doesn't really

2315
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,440
matter how you move but

2316
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,840
if what you care about is scripts as a

2317
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,679
whole in society well

2318
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:00,640
we would use um narrative data so what

2319
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:01,440
are the movies

2320
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,600
how do people in the movies behave and

2321
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,679
talk what is literature what are the

2322
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:07,600
words that are being used in what way

2323
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:08,800
with what valence

2324
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,120
is the positive or negative then you

2325
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,480
would use um

2326
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:15,520
your rights data about how people behave

2327
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:17,600
together to do experiments by connecting

2328
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,600
people and doing hyper scanning data

2329
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:20,000
like

2330
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,920
there's all of the data that would allow

2331
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:24,640
us to understand how a specific semantic

2332
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:25,520
cluster

2333
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:28,159
tends to be grouped and then tends to be

2334
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:30,560
connected causally all of this would

2335
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:31,840
allow us to derive

2336
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,719
scripts it all depends about on where

2337
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:36,320
you want to apply

2338
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,880
this knowledge what was the second

2339
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,960
question

2340
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,480
i think that covered i think i just sort

2341
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,560
of reworded my original question

2342
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,640
but that was great i think sasha had a

2343
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,320
question and i forgot sasha

2344
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:50,960
yes sasha

2345
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:55,120
yeah not so much a question just a

2346
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:56,840
statement for how can people

2347
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:00,800
um think about applying scripts and

2348
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,360
active inference to their own behavior

2349
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:04,320
and

2350
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:07,360
behave in ways that signal at our true

2351
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:09,120
goals

2352
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,760
in ways that are script and socially

2353
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:14,239
acceptable

2354
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:18,480
okay okay so um this is the really cool

2355
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:19,040
part

2356
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:22,080
of having a model that

2357
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:24,840
can take both higher level and lower

2358
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,360
levels and

2359
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:30,159
you're right that giving people power

2360
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:32,640
over their data

2361
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,719
would also help us figure out what their

2362
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:36,080
true goal is

2363
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:38,159
right so if you if you're like i want to

2364
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:39,520
take an active part

2365
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:42,159
in shaping my reality well essentially

2366
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:44,080
you're giving us what your true goal

2367
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:46,400
is so that's good for everyone so you're

2368
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,199
right

2369
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:49,440
um it would be great for society if

2370
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:50,560
people had this control

2371
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,000
i think that's where we're trying to get

2372
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,760
towards in ethical circles where we're

2373
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:54,400
like

2374
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,400
we're not just going to take stuff from

2375
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:57,840
you and then

2376
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,159
model and then you won't really have any

2377
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:01,840
benefit from it or if you have a benefit

2378
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,760
we define what that benefit is it's more

2379
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:04,719
like

2380
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:07,760
we can show you the data that is yours

2381
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:08,000
we

2382
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,159
can show you the data that is aggregated

2383
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:11,280
from you as well

2384
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,440
and you get to decide what kind of

2385
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:16,640
person you want to be based on this so

2386
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,800
we show you the affordance scape around

2387
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,400
you based on your profile

2388
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,080
well now you can pick what you want to

2389
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:25,040
do with this affordance escape

2390
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:27,840
cool and just so interesting about the

2391
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:28,480
inference

2392
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,400
and then moving towards action and not

2393
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,400
just targeting the ads or just targeting

2394
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,840
the consumption but actually targeting

2395
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,440
the participation as well

2396
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:37,440
rj and then we'll speed through the

2397
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:38,719
figures

2398
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:41,440
oh sure uh i would just add that this is

2399
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:43,040
definitely an area where it feels like

2400
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:43,360
the

2401
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:44,640
the data and the metadata of the

2402
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:47,040
descriptive data about the data

2403
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:49,840
uh definitely blur and also uh shannon

2404
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,199
you were talking about

2405
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:52,480
people not having control over how they

2406
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:53,840
sway et cetera and i just wanted to

2407
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,600
thank you for making me hyper aware of

2408
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:58,320
my own posture

2409
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:02,000
nice um cool well what a fun

2410
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,400
discussion these are the figures and i

2411
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,080
think for next week people can start to

2412
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:07,679
think about what questions they want to

2413
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,639
address

2414
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:11,280
and then um for now i would just denote

2415
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:13,040
we should talk about the figures

2416
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:15,040
and about how they relate to some of

2417
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:16,880
these more qualitative things we

2418
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,639
discussed today like maybe we could even

2419
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:20,639
work through one of these diagrams

2420
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:22,800
for flirting or for ordering a cup of

2421
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:23,920
coffee

2422
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:26,560
um figure two was a layout like a

2423
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:27,760
graphical layout

2424
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:30,320
of the internal and the external

2425
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:31,199
realizer

2426
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:33,199
and so we could ask where's the markov

2427
01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:34,719
blanket here and what does that say

2428
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:36,000
about how the world is what does that

2429
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,679
say about how we could model the world

2430
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:38,960
what are the points where we could

2431
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,719
intervene what are the experiments that

2432
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:41,920
could be informative

2433
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,760
whose perspective could we include when

2434
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:44,960
we're thinking about this

2435
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:48,080
like all these big questions that are

2436
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:49,280
what should be at the front of our mind

2437
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:51,199
when we approach a system like this

2438
01:20:51,199 --> 01:20:53,360
so that was pretty cool figure let's

2439
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:55,199
also come back to that

2440
01:20:55,199 --> 01:20:58,239
and uh that's basically it in our last

2441
01:20:58,239 --> 01:21:00,159
couple minutes we'll hear a final

2442
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:01,840
note so anyone raise your hand if you

2443
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:04,560
want to make a short note

2444
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,560
other than that though we will give a

2445
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,080
form for a survey

2446
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:11,040
and especially for 10.2 questions from

2447
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:12,719
everyone who's participating

2448
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:15,360
if you're watching it live or in replay

2449
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:16,159
just

2450
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:17,760
add a comment with something we could

2451
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,760
address in 10.2

2452
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:22,719
and uh stay in communication and other

2453
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:23,360
than that

2454
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,360
let's hear some last thoughts or what

2455
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:26,800
was your favorite part of the discussion

2456
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,840
from anyone who wants to talk

2457
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:35,280
um rj then mao um

2458
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:38,000
i after after this doug i'm definitely

2459
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,360
all the more interested

2460
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,679
in what kind of threshold events there

2461
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:42,639
are for

2462
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:44,719
the creation of scripts and for the

2463
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:46,960
breaking of them

2464
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:49,840
awesome okay

2465
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:52,639
um i'm super excited to see that people

2466
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:54,239
are interested because

2467
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:55,520
when i started thinking about this and

2468
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,520
and and started working on it with

2469
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:58,239
maxwell

2470
01:21:58,239 --> 01:22:00,000
my thought was i'm going to be this

2471
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,080
fringe researcher that no one ever

2472
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,560
quotes because no one cares

2473
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,320
and it has the beautiful side that no

2474
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,880
one will ever criticize what i do

2475
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,880
but but i'm really excited to see that

2476
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:13,360
people are being um inspired by this

2477
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:14,480
work people start

2478
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,800
asking questions and they bring in new

2479
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,719
possibilities um people from the field

2480
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:20,880
of music are interested which means that

2481
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:24,400
there's gonna be uh way more input from

2482
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,080
a variety of fields which is going to

2483
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:26,639
make this

2484
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:29,199
super rich and i'm really thankful for

2485
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:31,839
your um

2486
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:35,440
i'm not your administration um

2487
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:37,199
you you led this discussion really

2488
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:39,760
really well and that was very pleasant

2489
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,800
to be part of thank you

2490
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,880
action stream has the best norms and the

2491
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:45,920
best participants

2492
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,320
i have to say no i'm just kidding but

2493
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:49,520
really thanks everyone

2494
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,760
for making the discussion so excellent

2495

because that's really what it is

2496
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:57,840
and uh we hope to see you again in 10.2

2497
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,159
hear anyone else's thoughts see you in

2498
01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:02,639
future active streams so

2499
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:06,880
thanks and we will talk to you next time
