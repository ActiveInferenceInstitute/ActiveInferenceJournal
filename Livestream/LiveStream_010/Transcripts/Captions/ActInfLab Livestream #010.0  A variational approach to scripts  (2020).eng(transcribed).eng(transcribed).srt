1
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:09,360
all right

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,519
i think we're live hello everyone

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,759
welcome to the active inference live

4
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:14,320
stream

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,480
my name is daniel friedman it is

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,960
december 2nd

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,600
2020 and i am looking forward to

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,760
this discussion welcome to team com

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,320
team com is an experiment in online team

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,359
communication

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,760
learning and practice related to active

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,479
inference

and username this is a recorded and an

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,000
archived live stream so please provide

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,680
us with feedback so that we can improve

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,520
on our work

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,199
all backgrounds and perspectives are

23
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,440
welcome here and as far as video

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,680
etiquette for live streams goes

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,039
remember to mute if there's noise in

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,800
your background raise your hand so that

27
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,400
we can hear from everybody

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,360
and use respectful speech behavior also

29
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,600
just as far as schedules go

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,760
for the rest of 2020 we're going to have

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,200
four meetings

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,600
they are going to be on december 8th and

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,400
15th

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,240
discussing this paper that i'm going to

35
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,000
talk about right now a variational

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
approach to scripts

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,280
and then on december 22nd and december

38
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,000
29th

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,280
we will be in active stream 11

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,920
and we will read a more mathematical

41
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,799
paper

42
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,119
called sophisticated effective inference

43
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,119
simulating anticipatory effective

44
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,720
dynamics of the imagining

45
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,360
future so this is going to be the last

46
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:41,759
four

47
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,079
meetings of active stream for 2020 in

48
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:44,880
december

49
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,960
two on this paper two on the next paper

50
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,119
we have a lot planned for 2021

51
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,680
so if you're interested in participating

52
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,640
in 2021 in any way definitely

53
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,280
contact us if you want to and we also

54
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,719
look forward to doing

55
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,520
a few new kinds of events so if you have

56
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,200
an idea for an event or for a

57
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,880
collaboration that we could do with

58
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,759
activestream that'd be pretty cool

59
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,360
today in active stream number 10.0

60
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,720
finally getting up there in the double

61
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,400
digits

62
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,440
the goal will be to set the context for

63
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,120
the next two weeks of discussion with

64
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,879
everybody who wants to which is going to

65
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,280
be 10.1 and 10.2

66
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,360
the paper we're going to be discussing

67
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,560
is called

68
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,040
a variational approach to scripts by

69
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,920
albarazen

70
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,480
at all on 629 2020 on psi archive

71
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,959
this video as all the dot zeros are is

72
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,519
just an introduction or a context

73
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,440
for some of these ideas it isn't a

74
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,680
review or a meta-analysis or a final

75
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,800
word

76
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,879
and i'll really just be trying to

77
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,959
contextualize some of the ideas and

78
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,640
vocabulary of the paper

79
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,480
so the goal would be if you're in the

80
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,400
free energy principle or active

81
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,000
inference research community

82
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,440
this is going to be maybe a chance to

83
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,120
learn something new about scripts

84
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,440
certainly it was for me and then maybe

85
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,120
you're more familiar with scripts or

86
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,560
social scripts theory

87
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,400
at which point this hopefully would be

88
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,640
an inter interesting introduction

89
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,800
into thinking about active inference so

90
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,640
it is always going to be bi-directional

91
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,760
like that

92
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,000
and the punch line of this paper if i

93
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,239
could summarize it as such would be

94
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,400
active inference can unify different

95
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,519
conceptions of this

96
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,239
script concept leading to new avenues

97
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,760
and approaches for research

98
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,519
in fields such as social behavior

99
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,680
criminology and sexology

100
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,879
yep all of those are fields in

101
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,080
section 9.0 first we're going to go

102
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,400
through the keywords of the paper

103
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,519
then go through the aims and claims

104
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,000
abstract and roadmap of the paper which

105
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,760
are going to tell us a lot about how the

106
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,480
authors

107
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,159
lay out their argument as well as

108
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,519
structure what it is that they're trying

109
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,599
to do

110
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,640
in section c we will go to types and

111
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,959
uses of scripts

112
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,760
and uh draw on some quotations from the

113
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,720
authors

114
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,720
and then just look at the two figures

115
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,920
briefly

116
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,280
to understand what they might be

117
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,680
representing or doing in the paper

118
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,720
and in 10.1 and 10.2 which are the

119
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,159
up to up to coming weeks we will be

120
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,760
discussing this paper

121
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,079
so save and submit your questions get in

122
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,680
touch if you want to participate

123
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,639
and anyone is welcome to join first

124
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,639
we're going to talk about keywords

125
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,479
the keywords of this paper are as

126
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,639
follows first is active inference which

127
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,479
is great we always like to see that as a

128
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,400
keyword as well as the free energy

129
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,440
principle

130
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,240
so active inference is about the fusion

131
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,759
of action and inference

132
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,360
it brings together fields like

133
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,080
cybernetics ecological control theory

134
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,680
all these different things that we've

135
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,440
been talking about but maybe this is

136
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,040
someone's first active stream

137
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,520
free energy principle is a broader

138
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,160
physics

139
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,520
based or mathematics based framework

140
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,000
for understanding how multi-scale

141
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,960
systems exist

142
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,880
and what it is that they do active

143
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,479
inference is a process theory under the

144
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,600
free energy principle

145
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,120
we're not going to have slides for those

146
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,960
in this talk

147
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,479
what we are going to talk about to

148
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,080
contextualize the paper

149
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,160
philosophically and from a conceptual

150
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,120
perspective is

151
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,680
internalism and externalism as well as

152
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,479
the center

153
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,039
topic of the paper which is scripts

154
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:17,840
script theory

155
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,440
and specifically social scripts

156
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,520
we'll hear about two different

157
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,520
deployments or two different senses

158
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,160
of the script one is an internal

159
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,759
psychological schema

160
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,280
so that's like something happening in

161
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,759
your head maybe that would be amenable

162
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,120
to a psychological

163
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,160
or a neuropsychiatric intervention and

164
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,080
then another sense of scripts are in

165
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,520
terms of constitutive

166
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,919
behavioral categories so these are sort

167
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,000
of classifications of people

168
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,560
or of action sequences and they are

169
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,759
things that are enacted

170
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,000
but they may or may not hinge upon these

171
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,759
internal psychological schema

172
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,520
in fact we're going to go into a fair

173
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,919
amount of detail how the authors lay out

174
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,000
the differences amongst different uses

175
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,080
of the script concept but that's just to

176
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,600
prime it for now

177
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,560
let's get to this first philosophy point

178
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,080
but it's pretty broad it applies to a

179
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,319
lot of areas and that's internalism and

180
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,919
externalism so in active stream

181
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,080
5 that's 5.0 0.1 and 0.2

182
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,800
we specifically talked about internalism

183
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,919
and externalism

184
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,319
we talked about the paper multi-scale

185
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,400
integration beyond internalism and

186
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,360
externalism

187
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,280
so we talked a lot about how active

188
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,800
inference specifically

189
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,160
is able to reframe this debate or

190
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,280
dichotomy between

191
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,039
internalism and externalism or

192
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,319
internalism versus

193
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,960
externalism potentially can recast our

194
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,840
understanding

195
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,759
of how these systems work in a way

196
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,600
that's going to be amenable to better

197
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,400
understanding

198
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,960
control design predict etc that's what

199
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,479
we talked about in actin

200
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,440
act m5 but without going into too many

201
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,759
details of active inference now

202
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,319
let's think about three big ways that

203
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,479
we're going to use active inference to

204
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:01,199
transcend

205
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,240
this internalism and externalism debate

206
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,800
slash debacle and the three that we're

207
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,560
going to talk about right now

208
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,919
are one the fact that real evolutionary

209
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,919
adaptive systems are multi-scale

210
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,639
and nested so multi-scale nested systems

211
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,479
as a way that we can escape internalism

212
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,680
and externalism

213
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,599
a second way that we can escape

214
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,120
internalism and externalism

215
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,160
is with local causal closure and a third

216
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,639
route is with this uh relationship

217
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,759
between action and

218
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,240
inference so threes are three different

219
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,199
talking points

220
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,120
that you can think about are countering

221
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,440
the internalism versus

222
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,800
externalism dialectic so the first thing

223
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,680
is this idea that real systems

224
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,360
especially the ones that we care about

225
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,960
are multi-scale and nested they're

226
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,639
hierarchically embedded or they're

227
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,319
heteroarchical there's a lot of ways to

228
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,000
talk about them they're complex adaptive

229
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,199
systems

230
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,639
and the paper that we drew on in actin 5

231
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,080
and i'll return to here

232
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,560
is this paper in 2012 by dennis noble

233
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,120
called

234
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,440
a theory of biological relativity no

235
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,759
privileged level of causation

236
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,120
so his focus is on first clarifying

237
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,919
the so-called upward causation pathway

238
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,919
which is sort of a default understanding

239
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,680
for many people which is that smaller

240
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,240
things

241
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,280
quote cause bigger things to happen in

242
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,199
the sense that they compose them ergo

243
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,319
they must cause them

244
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,280
and we can look at how genes are related

245
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,039
to proteins and rna through a somewhat

246
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:27,759
special

247
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,240
connection and then how physical

248
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,919
entities nesting

249
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,839
wise compose each other into bigger and

250
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,360
bigger organizations

251
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,599
through organs organisms social

252
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,719
organizations

253
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,640
and then ecosystems technological

254
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,640
government schemes etc

255
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,000
and where noble critiques this simple

256
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,640
upward

257
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,040
causative model which lends itself to

258
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,800
reductionism because why wouldn't you

259
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,080
study the most basal

260
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,600
aspect of the system if that's where the

261
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,839
most causal potential were

262
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,760
uh relied upon he highlights this role

263
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,480
of

264
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,720
so-called top-down forces which are

265
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,839
structuring forces

266
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,080
from slower time scales as well as

267
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,399
broader scales of spatial analysis

268
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,120
about how states of organisms can

269
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,839
influence

270
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,279
downward in some sense smaller

271
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,959
things and there's the

272
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,120
larger versus smaller continuum that we

273
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,560
can still think about and to which

274
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,440
extent we

275
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,920
privilege or prioritize bottom-up or

276
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,800
emergent

277
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,360
uh phenomena versus top-down which could

278
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,440
also be considered emergent control

279
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,200
so really emergence is on both sides of

280
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,880
the coin but

281
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,800
at a given level of analysis the larger

282
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,560
scale can be considered external

283
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,880
so when the organism's epithelia is the

284
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,080
boundary condition

285
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,800
then society is external and proteins

286
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,560
and cellular features are internal

287
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,920
and if you were to go into a cell

288
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,680
internal would be even smaller than the

289
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,080
cell

290
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,839
almost by definition and so we can

291
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,800
think about how as there is no

292
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,640
privileged level of causation in the

293
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,360
sense that the

294
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,680
interactions within and among levels of

295
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,399
analysis

296
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,640
are what result uniquely in the system's

297
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,160
function and there's no way to

298
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,720
tune one aspect without uh necessarily

299
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,480
impinging upon another

300
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,560
we can say well yes you could

301
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,959
characterize things as being just

302
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,720
simply outside of another thing you

303
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,079
could say here's inside the house and

304
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,279
this is outside the house

305
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,880
so you can still have internal and

306
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,480
external as terms

307
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,079
but this idea of internalism and

308
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,240
externalism that the relevant causal

309
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,000
features are internal to an organism

310
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,760
versus our external to an organism

311
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,680
versus the interaction

312
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,160
it kind of is reframed in this very

313
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,640
fractal hierarchical framework

314
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,000
that the uh uh

315
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,399
no privilege level of causation argument

316
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,760
is taking us towards so that's a systems

317
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,640
biology approach

318
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,079
we're moving beyond internalism and

319
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,760
externalism because real world systems

320
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,880
are nested

321
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,920
a second type of argument that

322
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,079
evades the internalism externalism

323
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,959
discussion

324
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,399
is the idea of local causal closure

325
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,240
and this is figure 4 from the paper that

326
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,440
we discussed in

327
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,000
active stream 5 and it is showing an

328
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,040
auto catalytic

329
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,440
network and so here you have different

330
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,920
types of reactions and products

331
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,160
it's a metabolic network that involves

332
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,440
an auto catalytic

333
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,519
mechanism in the metabolic domain but

334
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,480
there's also

335
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,240
auto catalytic closure that might be

336
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,800
imagined semantically or culturally

337
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,959
so what this is so showing is that

338
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,120
because the interactions of specific

339
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,920
types

340
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,079
and the integration of ecological

341
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,519
resources as well

342
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,440
as well as multiple types of agents and

343
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,399
processes internal to the process

344
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,440
as many different features are perhaps

345
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,920
necessary and not alone are sufficient

346
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,959
to generate

347
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,320
the outcome of the system which is

348
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,079
autocatalysis you take away one of these

349
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:44,800
inputs

350
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,920
it's just not going to work it's like

351
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,320
taking away a vitamin from a human so

352
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,560
you take away a vitamin and they might

353
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,360
die

354
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,040
but does that mean that the vitamin is

355
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,240
the one and only thing that makes them

356
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,560
live

357
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,120
of course not but it does make us move

358
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,399
beyond this internalism

359
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,639
and externalism dichotomy because we

360
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,360
understand that all real systems are

361
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,200
at the interface between these two and

362
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,040
that's related to phrasings like

363
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,040
it is the nature of nurture to be

364
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,399
natured or

365
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,399
vice versa sort of just blurring the

366
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,839
line between them because they're such

367
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:14,959
causal dependence

368
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,519
for example with our microbiome the

369
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,279
relevance for the scripts concept here

370
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:19,920
is that

371
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,079
whether something like a feature is

372
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,600
internal or external

373
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,839
to one perspective or another it's part

374
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,839
of an integrated causal story about the

375
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,839
world as well as a perspective for

376
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:30,320
example

377
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,920
telling a story from a third part

378
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,360
person's perspective versus second

379
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,959
versus first

380
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,000
and another area that we might return to

381
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,079
is that the scripts require actors and

382
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,000
communities of practice to enact them

383
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,959
otherwise they're

384
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,680
not real so it's kind of like a tree

385
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,200
falling in a forest does anyone hear it

386
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,519
well

387
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,680
if there's a script in a file drawer is

388
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,360
it ever enacted

389
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,680
maybe that's how it enacts what it is

390
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,959
but

391
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,240
in the social sense it is not

392
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,639
implemented and this is uh

393
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,279
going to bring us to some other dramatic

394
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:01,839
drama

395
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,800
related dramaturgical concepts and this

396
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,000
idea about set and setting

397
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,680
and the context and the performer and

398
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,680
then just the last way that we can move

399
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,839
beyond internalism and externalism

400
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,920
is this fundamental relationship between

401
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,959
action and inference

402
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,560
so yeah it's playing out in nested

403
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,000
systems like point one

404
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,639
and yes uh it's also related to causal

405
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,320
closure in a sense like

406
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,880
uh point two but this one is actually

407
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,600
unique

408
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,560
in that it's saying no just

409
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,240
fundamentally wherever the causal

410
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,920
relations may be and whether this is a

411
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,240
one level system or a multi-level system

412
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,000
it's actually the fact that action and

413
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,760
perception are happening as an

414
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,880
integrated coupling

415
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,120
that we can debate about what is

416
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,880
external or what is internal

417
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,000
but we find that there's actually uh uh

418
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,519
somewhat of a reframing of this

419
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,120
issue of whether something that's

420
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,040
actually happening is outside versus

421
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,320
insight

422
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,800
okay so those are just a few internalism

423
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,399
and externalism questions that are more

424
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,440
general that are

425
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,720
going to be returned to when we're

426
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,639
talking about scripts and whether they

427
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,320
are internal or external to an agent

428
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,839
the main topic of today is this script

429
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,199
theory so what is a script broadly a

430
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,720
script is a pattern

431
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,440
of action and or thought and it turns

432
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,720
out there's a lot of ways that people

433
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,000
have thought about that and there's

434
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,720
also a lot of related topics which is

435
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,839
one of the reasons why

436
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,800
a unifying effort is being performed

437
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,360
here

438
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,120
because apparently there's a lot of

439
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,800
disagreement about

440
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,040
scripts and what they mean so terms that

441
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,160
i thought could be

442
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,320
relevant to call them besides for

443
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,920
scripts because they include for example

444
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,880
non-verbal

445
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,839
uh behavior something like an archetype

446
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,160
or a situation or scenario

447
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,279
a storyline or a narrative a creod

448
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,120
to use waddington's term from

449
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,480
epigenetics

450
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,880
so it's kind of like a pattern of action

451
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,480
and or thought

452
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,320
in one way or another depending on the

453
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,880
situation and the paper is going to go

454
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,920
on to explore

455
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,720
two specific axes of variation you can

456
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,360
think about

457
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,959
in the scripts concept

458
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,839
scripts are happening in various

459
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,000
contexts so first with no

460
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,160
citations i'll just provide a

461
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,519
quote from them and then a few examples

462
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,800
of areas where

463
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,199
it could be interesting so they write

464
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,279
the scripts construct has long history

465
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,880
spanning several disciplines

466
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,440
scripts have been applied fruitfully to

467
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,519
study human behavior in different fields

468
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,839
from disciplines centered on humans

469
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,120
individual human minds and their

470
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,399
interactions such as psychology

471
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,320
neuroscience and artificial intelligence

472
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,639
to the social sciences where has been it

473
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,720
has been used influentially in fields

474
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,759
like sociology criminology anthropology

475
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,040
and sexology

476
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,279
different definitions of scripts abound

477
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,199
with different focuses

478
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,120
the def the concept sometimes is used

479
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,639
under different names such as action

480
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,240
schemas

481
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,920
the idea that motivates the use of the

482
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,600
script construct in these scientific

483
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,480
approaches are

484
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,120
is at its core dramaturgical that means

485
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,240
it's related to

486
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,959
performance according to its proponents

487
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,040
what enables social agents to act in

488
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,199
situationally appropriate ways

489
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,759
is a shared set of instructions or

490
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,040
normative prescriptions for

491
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,880
situationally appropriate behavior

492
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,480
that's why it's called a script just

493
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,079
like the script guides an

494
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,880
actor it's sort of a loose version of a

495
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,440
script

496
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,360
that's going to not dictate exactly what

497
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,040
we say for example i'm not reading from

498
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,320
a script and most people aren't when

499
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,600
they're on a video call

500
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,959
but it's going to be a little bit

501
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,720
broader than that but of course not so

502
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,440
broad as to explain everything

503
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,680
the implication of this view is that in

504
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,880
order to act as

505
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,040
a cohesive social group in which every

506
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,120
agent knows and enacts their role

507
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,880
agents must share a common body of

508
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,120
knowledge i.e a script

509
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,560
that prescribes situationally

510
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,320
appropriate modes of being

511
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,560
this is metaphorically akin to actors

512
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,000
sharing a dramaturgical script

513
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,079
hence the name of the construct scripts

514
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,839
are used in scientific theories to shed

515
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,600
light on how internalized psychological

516
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,519
models are integrated with externalized

517
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,560
social models

518
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,480
by drawing on a pool of common styles of

519
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,759
performance and cognition through

520
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,120
contextualized acts

521
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,079
such as speech acts and their insured

522
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,760
actions driven by goals

523
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,319
so it's like all the world's a stage but

524
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,000
then they made a research field

525
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,199
about it we see it playing out on the

526
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,480
actual stage

527
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,640
because there's uh raised platforms

528
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,919
where people

529
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,839
perform and then there's non-raised

530
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,760
platforms where people perform

531
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,359
but there's scripts for many of these

532
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,039
situations sometimes literally written

533
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,359
out

534
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,640
other times more broadly

535
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,240
these kinds of scripts happen on the

536
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,000
sidewalk for example

537
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,840
it's interesting to think about how just

538
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,520
the ways that people

539
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,000
have uh viewed each other's bodies their

540
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,200
very personal space

541
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,280
and whether they step out of the way on

542
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,640
the sidewalk

543
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,640
depending on what someone is or isn't

544
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,000
wearing these are all

545
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,240
things that have changed over 2020 and

546
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,679
so we're seeing the script

547
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,880
update or change scripts happen in the

548
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,600
courtroom

549
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,320
whether it's the judge and the priority

550
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,880
that this person has by virtue of their

551
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,360
training and position in the room but

552
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,960
these types of formal

553
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,440
acts are places where scripts have been

554
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,320
applied because

555
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,919
in some senses the script is defined

556
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,760
like a religious service

557
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,000
and ritual spaces in general are places

558
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
where scripts can play out

559
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,520
and so here one can literalize

560
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,760
what is happening and talk about well

561
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,000
the angle of this object is at this

562
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,919
angle and the repetition of this happens

563
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,120
this many times

564
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,440
or there's an experiential element so

565
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,320
scripts

566
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,080
also reaches into this area of

567
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,760
experience and what makes something

568
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,200
important to somebody

569
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,320
and all that behavioral work one area

570
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,000
that we'll talk about in just a few

571
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,640
minutes

572
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,600
is the crime scene so scripts have been

573
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,799
applied to

574
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,600
really break down crimes in some ways

575
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,120
into their sub components

576
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,480
to understand the patterns and the

577
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,480
flowcharts by which certain crimes

578
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,679
are happening or not and also another

579
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,520
example might be computer scripts which

580
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,320
isn't really

581
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,120
talked about much here specifically the

582
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,080
entire

583
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,720
framework is computationalist in that

584
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,120
like active inference it holds us a high

585
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,960
value to at least be able to state

586
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,320
things in pseudocode or

587
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,720
algorithmically or as a process rather

588
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,480
than just an endpoint that's achieved

589
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,480
for example

590
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,080
but we can also think about these

591
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,840
scripts especially when they involve

592
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,200
our extended niche our shared

593
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,360
uh niche of attention and technology and

594
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,240
platforms

595
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,400
computer scripts are playing into human

596
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,320
scripts it's almost like one of them is

597
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,160
programming the other

598
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,960
let's return to that crime scene version

599
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,919
of a script

600
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,799
this is going to be some figures from a

601
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:39,600
book

602
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,720
from 2018 chapter called crime script

603
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,120
analysis

604
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,039
so this is first just a structural way

605
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,679
of looking at how quantitative data are

606
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,240
used

607
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,440
in the academic psychology model so we

608
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:55,760
see

609
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,480
behavior on the right and the arrows are

610
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:58,880
like

611
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,480
the hypothesized or empirically tested

612
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,200
correlations this is basically like a

613
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,559
structural equation

614
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,799
model but it's just saying there's all

615
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,760
these features

616
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,760
that are related for example to the

617
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,960
person's personality

618
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,919
on the top to uh things like their

619
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:16,960
behavior

620
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,799
and that can have many levels of detail

621
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,200
but this is just at the most broad level

622
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,960
the way that different features of the

623
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,400
person and the context

624
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,559
are statistically brought together

625
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,000
people developed

626
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,960
a little bit beyond this simple put all

627
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,240
their features into

628
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,240
a database and run a regression type

629
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,080
model to

630
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,280
this idea of a state transition diagram

631
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,440
which is drawing interestingly on

632
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,320
concepts like

633
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,200
markov chains and markov fields these

634
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,400
are things that come back

635
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,600
in active inference but they're used in

636
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,400
this

637
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,520
crime script community and this one

638
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,919
i believe shows the behaviors leading up

639
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,799
to drinking and driving which is a crime

640
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,840
and so this bottom

641
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,600
it says this is the drive's vehicle all

642
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,280
these arrows all these routes by which

643
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,159
they're led there

644
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,440
so maybe they were at home and um

645
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,360
then went out somewhere or they were

646
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,960
somewhere else and they came home

647
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,720
there's different funnels different flow

648
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,559
charts and the question

649
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,919
that we're going to ask here is could we

650
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,760
simplify and integrate this with active

651
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,280
inference so if we

652
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,960
go with no map and we just say let's

653
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,240
survey 500 people and then let's do some

654
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,320
expert analysis crowdsourcing some

655
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,760
natural language processing let's just

656
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,400
figure out

657
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,400
all the attributes that led to these

658
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,679
people uh

659
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,360
doing this crime then we might be able

660
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,120
to pull out a bunch of these nodes maybe

661
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,880
we could even make a flowchart like this

662
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,200
but could we have a more broad theory

663
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,159
other than just

664
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,840
interviewing hundreds of people always

665
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,280
knowing that there's going to be types

666
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,720
of crimes being committed that are going

667
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,840
to be outside of our

668
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,120
scope and just maybe have a more

669
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,720
integrated framework for

670
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,960
talking about how certain norms are

671
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,080
violated to

672
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,120
take into account a lot more features

673
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,520
and a lot more richness in the kinds of

674
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,200
ways that agents actually interface with

675
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,840
the world so that would be the goal with

676
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,200
scripture would be

677
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,000
in all these different fields that we

678
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,120
would be able to

679
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,200
simplify from just this web of

680
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,240
correlations

681
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,600
on the left and this network of flow of

682
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,280
all these probabilistic attributes

683
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,039
probably averaged out over important

684
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,000
subgroups

685
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,240
could we just take a step back and ask

686
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,280
about action

687
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,039
in general and thinking about these

688
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,480
specific actions

689
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,360
that violate formal or informal rules or

690
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,159
norms

691
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,240
could we use active inference in that

692
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,720
situation

693
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,600
here was just a social script paper that

694
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,360
i thought was pretty interesting

695
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,039
so it's called social scripts and the

696
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,880
three theoretical approaches to culture

697
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,400
by robert sinclair in louisville it says

698
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,480
abstract in attempting to investigate

699
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,320
the cultural sciences researchers have

700
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,039
developed

701
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,520
frameworks of which ratner's three

702
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,360
categories are most informative

703
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,840
the three categories are symbolic

704
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,840
activity theory and individualistic

705
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,039
approaches also social script theory is

706
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,720
a promising path in the integration of

707
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,200
symbolic and activity theory models

708
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,760
so that's pretty cool this is coming

709
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,400
from a non-active inference

710
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,440
community and it's a synthesis

711
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,799
of some of the major threads in cultural

712
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,600
research and again those three

713
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,480
categories

714
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,679
are the symbolic the activity theory and

715
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,960
the individualistic approach and

716
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,840
um this activity theory is kind of an

717
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,720
interesting thing it's

718
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,520
uh it's a strange idea to read about

719
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,080
that

720
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,799
people had to make a area of theory that

721
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:47,440
was about

722
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,080
action but it actually does touch on

723
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,919
things like action research today

724
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,480
activity theory and there's a deep

725
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,600
thread of this

726
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,440
and sometimes highlighting this thread

727
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,440
of activity theory is quite

728
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,559
useful so um here

729
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,640
is what is written in the paper

730
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,320
okay so first uh there's a discussion of

731
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,600
the early activity

732
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,440
theory and about how this activity

733
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,000
theory was getting integrated with the

734
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,799
neuroscientists the philosophers

735
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,159
computer scientists and cognitive

736
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,520
scientists

737
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,120
and then there's uh quoting from the

738
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,200
paper what is significant about the work

739
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,200
of these early cognitive scientists

740
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,640
is that they argued for a deeper

741
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,320
understanding of language in artificial

742
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,000
intelligence

743
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,480
shank and abelson in 1977 for example

744
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,080
noted that scripts protocols and

745
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,840
vocabularies were about language

746
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,240
so they naturally asked asked not only

747
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,720
about how computers code human behavior

748
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,720
but also about how languages are used to

749
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,159
negotiate social reality

750
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,520
minsky in 1985 noted that in addition to

751
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,640
using language

752
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,880
to structure frames scripts metaphors

753
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,480
and the society of mind

754
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,159
one needs to look at the mind as a

755
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,600
parallel processor

756
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,520
one capable of handling several scripts

757
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,919
simultaneously a situation comparable to

758
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,440
how human languages function within

759
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,799
social contexts

760
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,880
understandably linguistics became one of

761
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,159
the central disciplines within the

762
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,600
cognitive sciences

763
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,360
so that's about linguistics and computer

764
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,880
science and cognitive science and

765
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,400
artificial intelligence

766
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,279
and then this is a closing quote from

767
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,799
the paper

768
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,720
can the personal approach to culture

769
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,919
even be considered

770
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,000
a viable model for the cultural sciences

771
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
so that's the individualistic model

772
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,440
which is basically saying that the

773
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,520
priority of culture is just

774
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,640
operating individuals nest mates

775
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,960
it appears that the personal approach to

776
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,960
culture espoused by post-modernists

777
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,720
is not a viable model of culture who

778
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,480
would have supposed that

779
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,640
when this model is articulated by social

780
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,880
philosophers such as foucault badyard

781
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,919
and debord

782
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,000
the theory still lacks explanatory power

783
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,360
as it is not able to account for

784
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,640
activity theory

785
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,120
what constitutes activity in this model

786
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,039
is a passive embodiment of the signs and

787
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,200
symbols of mass media and mass culture

788
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,960
the most promising path consists in this

789
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,640
integration of symbolic models with

790
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,159
activity theory models

791
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,679
this is exactly what social script

792
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,600
theory has done so

793
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,640
very cool that in the social sphere the

794
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,799
social script theory was perceived of

795
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,559
as integrating the semiotics the meaning

796
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,159
and the communication of symbols with

797
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,919
the action and so

798
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,240
there's actually a action inference or

799
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,600
an action communication

800
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,720
action information nexus that was

801
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,760
integrated

802
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,559
in their vocabulary perhaps as social

803
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,360
scripts

804
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,039
because it has a computational bent you

805
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,640
know run that script

806
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,880
and you can even back 50 years ago

807
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,080
people were talking about running

808
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,279
multiple scripts and

809
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,760
the ecological dependency so these are

810
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,520
kind of classical ideas

811
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,919
that potentially under active inference

812
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,120
we could

813
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,840
uh learn more about and then just the

814
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,640
last

815
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,679
point here on this paper according to

816
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:50,480
activity theory

817
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,000
psychological phenomena are formed as

818
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,760
people engaged in socially organized

819
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,440
activity

820
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,880
since these activities are socially

821
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,400
formed they provide a social and

822
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,320
cultural influence on cognition

823
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,919
it should be noted that this concept of

824
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,480
praxis which is a german word i won't

825
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,520
pronounce and then

826
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,240
a russian word deathnost has a long

827
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,840
intellectual tradition

828
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,320
the focus on praxis in this essay is not

829
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,080
about that long tradition of pragmatism

830
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,279
and practice

831
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,640
but on activity theory which is

832
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,799
connected with vygotsky

833
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,279
and so it goes back to marks and angles

834
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,480
uh and some other

835
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,520
interesting directions but pretty cool

836
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,720
to see that there's actually the

837
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,000
pragmatism

838
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,399
and then there's an action threat so

839
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,880
activity research wasn't merely about

840
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,679
getting it done or being most effective

841
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,200
it was related to

842
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,000
that bodily concept body and motion

843
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,600
developmental component

844
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,919
by vygotsky and that led to ecological

845
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,000
psychology and so many other areas

846
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,760
so these are kind of cool threads that

847
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,200
are

848
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,520
combinations that are re-emerging within

849
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,600
the context of active inference

850
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,760
it's because what the free energy

851
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,720
principle and

852
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,799
active inference are searching for is

853
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,880
something to say about the relationship

854
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,000
between the world

855
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,559
and agents so here we're kind of

856
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,679
mutating this

857
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,760
common slide yet again and we're

858
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,279
thinking about agents who are

859
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,320
interacting in

860
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,799
a world and the world is a niche that is

861
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,399
shared by the agents

862
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,200
it's an ecological niche and that means

863
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,080
that it's a

864
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,960
niche of ecological resources as well as

865
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,919
shared attention

866
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,279
norms practice tools software

867
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,679
video conferencing this is where the

868
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,440
script concept is going to come into

869
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,039
play because we want something that's

870
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,960
computable we want something that is

871
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,320
ecologically responsive

872
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,080
adaptive can take on all these

873
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,559
interesting traits that we want

874
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,880
and yep the joint world niche is related

875
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,799
to their shared affordances of agents in

876
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,399
a niche what they can do

877
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,159
it's related to their umvelt what they

878
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,760
can perceive

879
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,240
as well as their culture memes norms all

880
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,399
these other things attention especially

881
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,919
and now we're going to bring this

882
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,240
scripts topic in

883
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,600
all right so the paper that we're going

884
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,159
to be

885
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,600
discussing in 10.1 and 0.2 is called a

886
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,399
variational

887
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,559
approach to scripts and the authors are

888
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,320
on the right side

889
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,440
the aims and claims of the paper are as

890
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,039
follows they write the aim of this paper

891
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,440
is to formalize the notion of script

892
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,200
using the modeling resources of the

893
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,520
active inference framework

894
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,200
the hope i like that it's not just a

895
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,200
claim there's a hope as well

896
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,520
is to shed light on the multifarious

897
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,080
uses of the construct of script as it is

898
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,679
used in the sciences that study

899
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,640
human behavior active inference is

900
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,840
relevant here

901
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,760
because it may provide the key to

902
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,520
formulating an integrative script

903
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,480
construct

904
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,799
so that's in their own words how they

905
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:43,520
wanted to

906
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,760
frame what they did in the paper and

907
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,760
then i would write in

908
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,159
non-active inference terms how can we

909
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,240
apply active inference to unify

910
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,320
the study of scripts in the social

911
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,279
neuro-behavioral

912
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:59,279
cultural and computational dimensions

913
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,840
the abstract is written here it is this

914
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,799
paper proposes

915
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,720
a formal reconstruction of the script

916
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,640
construct by leveraging the active

917
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,840
inference framework

918
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,679
a behavioral modeling framework that

919
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,039
casts action

920
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,600
perception emotion and attention as

921
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,840
processes of bayesian or variational

922
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,520
inference

923
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,600
we propose a first principles account of

924
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,440
the script construct that integrates its

925
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,039
different uses in the behavioral and

926
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,399
social sciences

927
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:27,919
we begin by reviewing the recent

928
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,600
literature that uses the script

929
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,559
construct

930
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,720
we then examine the main mathematical

931
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,320
and computational features

932
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,279
of active inference finally we leverage

933
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,039
the resources of active inference to

934
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:39,760
after

935
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,399
offer a formal model of scripts our

936
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,240
integrative model accounts for the dual

937
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,279
nature of scripts

938
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,520
as internal psychological schema used by

939
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,520
agents to make sense of event types

940
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,279
and as constitutive behavioral

941
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,760
categories that make up social order

942
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,159
close parenthesis and also for the

943
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,120
stronger and weaker

944
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,960
conceptions of the construct which do

945
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,200
and do not relate to explicit

946
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,360
action sequences respectively we're

947
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,279
going to get back to that binary

948
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,880
soon so the roadmap of the paper

949
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,200
is as follows they begin with an

950
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,960
introduction and talking about the

951
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,919
background of script

952
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,240
theory which was something that was a

953
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,360
new area

954
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,640
relatively for me they talked then about

955
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,159
internalist approaches

956
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,240
so remember the broader discussion of

957
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,919
internalism and externalism in

958
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,440
multi-skill systems

959
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,200
well here we're going to be focusing on

960
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,120
script theory social script theory so

961
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,080
the internalists

962
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,480
are those who are taking approaches like

963
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,159
psychology and neuroscience

964
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,080
as well as other reductionist-facing

965
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,440
approaches like artificial intelligence

966
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,559
then there'll be a section on

967
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,039
externalism which talks about the social

968
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,000
sciences which

969
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,240
by their nature are interested in

970
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,200
studying these

971
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,279
higher level forces larger scales of

972
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,640
analysis so

973
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,559
fields like sociology anthropology

974
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,480
criminology and sexology

975
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,360
often focus on the society looking in on

976
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,480
the individual

977
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,399
and so that is that pressure kind of

978
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:03,760
like a balloon there's pressure out

979
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,640
pressure in

980
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,240
it's actually like internalism and

981
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,000
externalism and there's a membrane

982
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,120
could it be a markov blanket who knows

983
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,399
we'll then uh move to the other

984
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,360
axis beyond internalism and externalism

985
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,679
is a strong versus weak conception of

986
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,840
scripts which we'll go through

987
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,679
they talk about the two extreme

988
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,440
perspectives

989
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,600
then they talk about variations on

990
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,640
scripts which

991
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,440
are kind of what you would expect the

992
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,240
performance

993
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,720
components that relate to spontaneity

994
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,760
and ecology

995
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,919
and mutational variations all these

996
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,200
types of things that cause scripts to

997
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,080
vary

998
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,080
after introducing script theory they

999
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,120
move to the abcs of active inference

1000
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,360
by providing first a introduction to

1001
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,480
active inference which is

1002
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,279
perhaps great for us all to check out

1003
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,799
and then

1004
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,360
talk about how shared generative models

1005
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,000
can be

1006
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,399
thought of and how sociocultural

1007
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,240
dynamics can be thought about

1008
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,320
in the culture-generating way as shared

1009
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,519
models

1010
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,080
figure one then has a simple generative

1011
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,919
model for policy selection

1012
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,960
which is a figure that we'll get to and

1013
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,919
then figure two

1014
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,919
is a heuristic description of the

1015
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,840
generative model of the niche and of the

1016
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,760
agent

1017
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,720
section four as is where they come

1018
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,279
together

1019
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,880
and talk about an active inference

1020
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,399
account of scripts

1021
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,919
so as usual introduction area a

1022
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,679
then active inference then we bring

1023
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,120
those two areas together

1024
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,159
in section four or five or so and in the

1025
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,240
active inference account of scripts

1026
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,480
there's a discussion of scripts as

1027
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,720
shared conceptual niches about types of

1028
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,760
events

1029
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,559
as well as scripts as representations of

1030
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,039
typified sequences of events

1031
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,640
so blurring the idea of types and events

1032
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,039
in a way that we'll get to and then

1033
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:53,760
there's a

1034
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,000
discussion and a conclusion cool so

1035
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,799
that's the

1036
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,960
roadmap i think that in this

1037
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,320
contextualizing video

1038
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,080
what would be helpful is to characterize

1039
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,120
not just the breadth of where scripts

1040
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,760
can apply or have applied or were useful

1041
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,800
weren't useful

1042
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,520
but zoom in on these two dimensions of

1043
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,359
variabilities and the specific problems

1044
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:16,960
that they cause in that field

1045
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,000
and then how what active inference does

1046
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,239
will end up alleviating perhaps some of

1047
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,079
these tensions

1048
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,079
this is about scripts and their

1049
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,280
discontents

1050
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,480
so here's what they write there are some

1051
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,079
issues that stand in the way of an

1052
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:32,960
integrated

1053
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,599
model of scripts across fields the first

1054
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,280
is that the concept gets implemented

1055
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:37,839
differently

1056
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,679
in different theories and disciplines

1057
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,359
which throws down on our ability to

1058
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,599
provide a unique definition that can do

1059
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,760
justice to all the use cases of the term

1060
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,280
in the literature

1061
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,040
similarly different terms can be used to

1062
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,960
describe very similar phenomena across

1063
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,918
domains of study

1064
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,079
like script or schema prepended with

1065
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,119
terms with

1066
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,200
with terms like socio cultural or

1067
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,160
cognitive

1068
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,079
some authors have attempted to unify the

1069
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,320
concept in our view these attempts have

1070
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,760
had rather limited success

1071
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,160
as the varied census of the term suggest

1072
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,359
so what's the issue

1073
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,480
the issue is that scripps doesn't have a

1074
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,119
coherence

1075
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,079
implementation and it also doesn't have

1076
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,520
a coherent definition

1077
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,480
now whether there is one chicken in the

1078
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,920
egg or egg in the chicken

1079
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,040
that's another question and

1080
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,520
remembering that what we want to do is

1081
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,160
explain

1082
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,200
predict design control scripts just like

1083
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,800
any other system

1084
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,280
we would want to have the best and the

1085
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,960
most flexible understanding

1086
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,280
of scripts that would capture all of the

1087
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,200
diverse situations where scripts are

1088
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,320
being deployed in

1089
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,440
but also integrated with more general

1090
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,160
theories

1091
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,800
so maybe sociophysics maybe some other

1092
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,599
quantitative

1093
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,040
frameworks and they're going to

1094
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,720
focus on two primary dimensions

1095
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,839
of variation i'll read the quote

1096
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,560
first in this paper we focus on two

1097
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,800
orthogonal distinctions that we suggest

1098
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,640
structure discussion on scripts in the

1099
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,280
literature the first is a split between

1100
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,280
internalist and externalist readings of

1101
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,440
the construct of the script

1102
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,760
on the internalist conception a script

1103
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,680
is defined as a cognitive structure that

1104
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,000
is typically internal to an agent eg

1105
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,839
encoded in their brain and that

1106
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,839
harnesses information about typified

1107
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,520
behavioral patterns that are appropriate

1108
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,599
in specific social situations

1109
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,240
on the other externalist conception

1110
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,400
scripts are cast as the basic fabric

1111
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,079
from which social institutions are

1112
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,000
crafted

1113
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,079
on this conception a script is a set of

1114
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,119
highly codified

1115
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,240
practices and rules

1116
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,160
practices norms standards beliefs and

1117
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,839
linguistic practices

1118
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,560
and rules that make up an institution

1119
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,200
some conceptions are not easy to split

1120
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,359
between internalist and externalist but

1121
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,200
the way in which an agent interacts and

1122
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,200
reproduces a script does seem to bear

1123
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,599
elements of the duality nonetheless

1124
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,160
and so that's where we return to these

1125
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,079
two extreme cases that were presented

1126
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:02,880
earlier

1127
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,800
which is the ultimate internalist versus

1128
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,640
externalist the internal

1129
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,800
psychological schema is the internalist

1130
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,760
perspective

1131
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,680
and it ultimately is going to tend

1132
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,800
towards neural

1133
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,520
reductionist perspectives the

1134
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,440
constitutive behavioral categories

1135
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,400
perspective

1136
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,560
is the externalist perspective bigger

1137
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,480
system society influencing the

1138
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,280
individual

1139
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,240
and that tends towards holism these are

1140
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,119
the two

1141
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,520
tensions to poles of the script theory

1142
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,200
and just as we've seen before

1143
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,800
we want to use active inference to

1144
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,240
reframe this variation

1145
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,560
along this axis from systems where it

1146
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,400
really does just plainly appear that

1147
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,079
it's a small thing that's bubbling up to

1148
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,280
cause a larger change

1149
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,760
or vice versa we want to take a new

1150
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,880
perspective on this question about the

1151
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,839
localization of scripts

1152
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,320
so that we can be better and act better

1153
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,359
in the world

1154
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,760
and the second dimension is a split

1155
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,440
between the weak and the strong

1156
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,079
readings of this term and the readings

1157
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:58,560
differ

1158
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,520
on how to explicitly uh think about the

1159
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,280
way that a script prescribes

1160
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,119
specific courses of action for the

1161
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,640
agents

1162
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,760
so in the strong concept of the script

1163
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,520
a script is a list of explicit

1164
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,200
instructions for situationally

1165
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,400
appropriate behavior

1166
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,000
either neurally encoded under the

1167
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,440
internalist reading

1168
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,760
or implicit in conventions maintained by

1169
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,640
the institution

1170
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,040
in the externalist reading the strong

1171
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,240
reading

1172
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,800
of scripts dovetails with work in motor

1173
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,440
control

1174
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,000
that casts the process of motor control

1175
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,280
as the execution of a motor

1176
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,240
representation

1177
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,160
which is cast as a list of explicit

1178
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,599
instructions for action

1179
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,800
so kind of like robotics the weak

1180
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,880
reading of the script construct relaxes

1181
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,800
the assumption that a script

1182
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,720
prescribes the precise order of events

1183
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,000
that it entails

1184
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,240
a weak script just encodes or harnesses

1185
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,920
information about the kinds of factors

1186
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,000
that an agent might encounter in a given

1187
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,440
situation type so let's graphically

1188
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,079
lay out these different variants of the

1189
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,359
script theory

1190
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,000
so on the x-axis is from weak to strong

1191
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,880
so weak is

1192
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,880
it's a tendency it's kind of related to

1193
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,079
information little

1194
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,760
quantitative amounts of reduction of

1195
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,520
uncertainty or preferences

1196
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,160
that are guiding bias implicit bias

1197
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,359
whatever it happens to be

1198
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:15,760
and then on the strong side it has to do

1199
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,359
with the certainty which a certain

1200
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:18,640
action is carried out

1201
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,560
so maybe some events are over on that

1202
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,079
end of the spectrum like a

1203
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,480
dramatic performance and then the y-axis

1204
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,480
is this internalist to externalist

1205
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,960
debate or tension where internalist

1206
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,240
things are smaller

1207
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,000
more inside of the epithelium more

1208
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,280
reductionist perspective

1209
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,119
externalist tends to be outside of the

1210
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,119
epithelium bigger things

1211
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,200
more holist so a strong externalist

1212
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,880
perspective would be like a marionette

1213
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,119
show or a puppet show because the

1214
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,599
behavior of these individuals

1215
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,640
is going to be driven by external forces

1216
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,839
to them

1217
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,400
and it's going to be very structured and

1218
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,359
deterministic

1219
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,920
in some way it could even be done by a

1220
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,640
machine

1221
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,760
holding the wires for example whereas a

1222
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,160
weak

1223
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,440
externalist situation might be something

1224
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,560
like people who are in a meeting and the

1225
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,880
body language or the ways in which

1226
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,680
certain people

1227
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,000
fit into socially prescribed or

1228
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,520
different cultural perceptions on a

1229
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,079
certain

1230
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,040
presentation that someone provides all

1231
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:19,680
of these

1232
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,160
different soft features could end up

1233
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:22,720
playing

1234
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,280
into the behavior of individuals that

1235
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,520
would be a very externally

1236
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,760
oriented thing but also there's the

1237
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,440
collective behavior in the ecology of

1238
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,079
the group

1239
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,640
so that's still externalist but it ends

1240
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,200
up being more probabilistic

1241
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,400
the strong internalist beliefs relate

1242
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,280
to highly computational ways of thinking

1243
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,480
about the brain

1244
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,200
and about the ways that certain action

1245
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,640
patterns are encoded

1246
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,960
based upon representation as was stated

1247
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,240
in the

1248
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,119
earlier quote and then the weak

1249
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,480
internalist perspective

1250
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,680
might see the mind as a

1251
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,079
chaotic dynamical system or something

1252
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,839
that's never returning to

1253
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,319
steady states or has a strange loop

1254
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:07,359
feature

1255
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,359
all these different aspects that make

1256
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:10,480
even though

1257
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,599
it is a focus on the psychology um

1258
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,400
so it could lean towards reductionism

1259
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,200
there's also

1260
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,319
a broader understanding about the

1261
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,240
potentially emerging components of even

1262
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,520
internal features

1263
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,119
all these different ways that we can

1264
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,560
think about scripts and then

1265
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,920
here's fristen the origin

1266
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,200
here and going to integrate across these

1267
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,160
quadrants

1268
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,640
with the active inference framework

1269
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,560
let's just look at one of the quotes in

1270
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,599
the paper

1271
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,280
they write our proposed formalization of

1272
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,400
the script construct

1273
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,400
via active inference allows for

1274
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,720
interesting avenues in social computing

1275
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,800
specifically we can begin to make

1276
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,720
predictions about how humans react to

1277
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,839
scripts

1278
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:55,680
by clearly identifying the formal role

1279
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,599
of internal and external script elements

1280
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,000
as well as what weak scripts and strong

1281
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,920
scripts entail in a cognitive and

1282
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,440
ecological structure

1283
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,280
we can begin to leverage the model to

1284
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,280
identify the moment-to-moment dynamics

1285
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,560
of interactions

1286
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,200
between social agents in a given context

1287
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,200
we can identify how narratives

1288
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,280
influence expected behavioral and

1289
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,119
contextual framing

1290
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,280
cool with our formal model of scripts

1291
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,520
we can map the direct interaction of an

1292
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,440
individual with social categories and

1293
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,160
events

1294
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,800
as well as its con commitments in the

1295
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,400
shared niche

1296
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,200
those dynamic

1297
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,960
those dynamics could not only

1298
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,560
could allow not only to model how

1299
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,319
scripts come to be widespread

1300
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,720
by simulating sensitivity to deontic

1301
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,319
cues and social coordination with

1302
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,000
interlocutors

1303
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,319
but also how scripts may come to change

1304
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,000
when an agent is faced with a script

1305
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,800
violation

1306
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,040
and its different ramifications these

1307
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,560
violations may be met with social

1308
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,359
punishment

1309
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,200
or be embraced when they tap into the

1310
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,800
previously invisible

1311
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,160
valuable social reality i'd love to hear

1312
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,240
more from the authors about that

1313
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,760
part this formalism may be scaled up to

1314
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,040
simulate agents as the niche and see how

1315
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,560
certain patterns of interaction and

1316
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,520
co-option may

1317
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,560
emerge also really cool idea finally

1318
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,720
the model and the predicted patterns may

1319
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,040
be measured against real empirical data

1320
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,359
and falsified or confirmed to test

1321
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:24,880
psychological hypotheses

1322
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,400
about adherence to scripts

1323
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,800
so all the areas that we care about

1324
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,200
especially in the social areas

1325
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,680
anywhere you can cast broadly a strong

1326
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,839
versus weak or an internalism versus

1327
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:41,119
externalism

1328
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,280
something you're basically talking about

1329
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,960
the spatial and the temporal scales and

1330
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,800
the systems that humans care about

1331
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,760
so if you're here and you're from script

1332
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,680
theory and this is active inference

1333
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,960
then maybe ask questions about

1334
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,800
what would make it useful for your

1335
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,400
communities or

1336
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,560
for the specific situations uh the

1337
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,680
script construct

1338
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,520
is something that also has to be enacted

1339
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,839
by a mental health worker or

1340
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,000
by a social worker by a government or by

1341
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,680
a startup so

1342
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,480
what tools exist from the script

1343
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,480
community to help us structure those

1344
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,560
kinds of

1345
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,680
flows so let's try to think about just

1346
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,119
bridging between our different

1347
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,720
communities and

1348
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,560
about these different approaches to

1349
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,800
research and

1350
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,319
learning from each other because i know

1351
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,000
that the scripps community probably has

1352
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,960
so much to

1353
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,800
share about how these tools

1354
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,599
and models that they've used have worked

1355
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:38,960
how has not worked

1356
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,119
how can we use active inference to

1357
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,480
confirm what they know

1358
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,800
and then also have a understanding about

1359
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,160
why things that they thought would work

1360
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,119
but didn't work

1361
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,040
didn't work or why things they didn't

1362
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,160
expect to work

1363
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,319
did work can we frame it in a way that's

1364
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,160
based upon their surprise in the world

1365
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,160
as actors with deep generative models

1366
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,760
and then also zoom out and think about

1367
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,200
the social context as

1368
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,880
being something that responds perhaps

1369
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,680
non-linearly to interventions

1370
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,680
so these would be kind of fun things to

1371
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,119
talk about

1372
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:10,319
we've had a lot of social sciences

1373
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:13,440
people on the active stream before so

1374
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,359
if that's something that anyone knows

1375
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:16,480
about script theory

1376
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,640
or any of these different areas of

1377
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,839
anthropology

1378
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:22,000
then it'd be awesome to hear from them

1379
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,760
because

1380
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,160
like i said a lot that we could learn as

1381
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,839
an active inference community about how

1382
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,040
these theories

1383
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,319
have taken hold in different areas and

1384
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:32,880
come to

1385
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,280
make impact in people's life so this is

1386
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,160
a real

1387
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,560
interesting bridge between people's

1388
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,599
lived experience

1389
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,880
and the mental health uses of scripts

1390
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:43,599
the crime

1391
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:46,079
dynamics and the way that governance is

1392
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,119
tied in with it so

1393
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,079
really interesting stuff um i hope that

1394
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:50,720
people

1395
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,599
can read the paper and attend one of the

1396
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,520
upcoming discussions or if they

1397
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,359
are seeing this video after we had the

1398
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:59,280
discussion then just leave your comments

1399
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,079
because

1400
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:01,760
you know the discussion just doesn't

1401
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,599
stop so

1402
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,880
just to go through the figures um

1403
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,240
this is figure one and i added colors

1404
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,119
to clarify a few of the different things

1405
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:14,160
that are happening here

1406
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,720
so the figure's caption reads as follows

1407
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,240
it reads as

1408
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,079
a simple generative model for policy

1409
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,839
selection this schematic

1410
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,599
depicts a generative model for policy

1411
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,839
selection it represents probabilistic

1412
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:26,720
beliefs about

1413
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,560
how observations are related to the

1414
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,760
states that cause them

1415
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,040
that's the likelihood matrix a

1416
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,560
there's also in this problem in this

1417
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,400
probabilistic model there are beliefs

1418
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,359
about the manner

1419
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,520
in which states of the world evolve over

1420
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,359
time which is the state transition

1421
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,119
matrix b

1422
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,359
and then there's beliefs about states

1423
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:46,960
prior to sampling the world

1424
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,880
which are green and they're indeed and

1425
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,319
then preference

1426
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:52,880
over outcomes c is not depicted here but

1427
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,640
as written on the top

1428
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,640
the calculation of g is related to the

1429
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,480
calculation of c the outcome preference

1430
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,440
matrix

1431
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,079
and also things like affordances what

1432
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:03,440
the agent can do

1433
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,880
and then this g is what modifies policy

1434
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:07,680
selection

1435
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,000
so perhaps someone coming from the

1436
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,119
social sciences

1437
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,200
wouldn't have expected this kind of a

1438
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,800
technical diagram to be

1439
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,760
in a paper about scripts so let's just

1440
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,440
think about what everything is doing in

1441
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,480
this figure

1442
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,839
and what all the edges and nodes

1443
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,000
represent because we've talked about

1444
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,400
this figure in more technical

1445
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,240
active streams for example like number

1446
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,200
eight or like the upcoming number 11

1447
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,520
but here let's think about what this

1448
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,040
does for script theory

1449
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,079
so each of these letters are like a kind

1450
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:39,920
of node so the two blue nodes are

1451
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,800
similar

1452
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,960
the kinds of red nodes are similar and

1453
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,960
the d is an initial condition node

1454
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,400
so everything that has a similar shape

1455
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,800
or coloration is like one type of thing

1456
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,599
and this figure reads from left to right

1457
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:52,079
from the

1458
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:53,839
initial conditions that's like time

1459
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,440
equals zero

1460
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,839
through different time steps and at each

1461
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,200
time step

1462
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,400
there are several things that are

1463
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,800
happening one thing that's not shown

1464
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,480
here many things are not shown here this

1465
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,240
is a pretty reduced format

1466
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,760
of the formalism but what's happening is

1467
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,800
that the agent

1468
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,440
is maintaining a state estimate through

1469
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,240
time

1470
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,359
and so that could be like uh what kind

1471
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:18,319
of relationship

1472
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:20,960
am i in or what kind of social situation

1473
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:21,599
am i in

1474
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,440
is this a friendly conversation or is

1475
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,119
this a fight that could be a zero or a

1476
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:25,760
one

1477
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,440
or the state estimate could be a lot

1478
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,760
more high dimensional a lot more nuanced

1479
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,720
and the state estimate is being carried

1480
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:33,040
out

1481
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,000
through time well what else is tied to

1482
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,240
the state estimate at each moment

1483
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,160
one thing it's tied to is oh

1484
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,400
observations so that could be any kind

1485
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,000
of observation it could be the person's

1486
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,920
tone of voice or their facial expression

1487
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,680
or the content of their speech

1488
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,559
or it could be an observation in a text

1489
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:51,680
message that says

1490
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,920
hey this person is not honest or

1491
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:54,960
something like that

1492
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,280
so many kinds of observations again this

1493
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,160
is just a big

1494
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,440
broad sketch but at each time step

1495
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,400
the state estimate which is am i in this

1496
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,920
type of conversation or that type of

1497
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:06,800
conversation

1498
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,040
again whatever it happens to be the

1499
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:09,920
state estimate

1500
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,440
is being mapped to the observation

1501
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,640
we're not going to worry about the

1502
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,480
mathematical details now

1503
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,880
but it turns out that what connects the

1504
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:19,839
state estimate

1505
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:23,200
to the observation is a belief

1506
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,200
about how the observations are related

1507
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,480
to the states that cause them

1508
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,640
so there's some sort of internal mapping

1509
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,559
let's just say again sidestepping this

1510
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,800
debate that we had a little bit earlier

1511
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,079
that um smiles mean the person is happy

1512
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,400
um and frowns mean they don't but then

1513
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,599
you think a little deeper and you

1514
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:41,440
realize well it's uh some if someone's

1515
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,720
trying to deceive you then they might

1516
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,520
smile

1517
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,200
so that might trigger your subconscious

1518
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,280
receptors your subconscious priors but

1519
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,319
maybe you look beyond those types of uh

1520
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:53,119
physiological responses so again there's

1521
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:54,559
layers of nuance that aren't going to be

1522
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:55,119
in this

1523
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,359
figure but just broadly the state

1524
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:58,240
estimate is

1525
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,800
updating through time as a function

1526
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,400
mapped to the observations that you're

1527
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,040
expecting

1528
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,079
and estimating to get the blue

1529
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:09,920
b is the beliefs about the manner in

1530
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,599
which states of the world evolve over

1531
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:12,880
time so here's like

1532
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,359
the person's happy they're smiling my

1533
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:17,599
policy my action selection is that i

1534
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:20,319
if i say something nice then i estimate

1535
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:21,760
that they'll continue to be happy and

1536
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,119
then they'll continue to emit

1537
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:25,680
this like happy sound and then here if i

1538
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,440
continue this policy so this is at

1539
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,079
zero time zero one two three so and this

1540
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:31,839
is like the first three moves of chess

1541
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:34,160
so you get starting state and then

1542
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,599
observations first round

1543
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:38,720
a movement guided by a policy

1544
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,280
this is also framed as a belief about

1545
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,200
how the world is expected to change

1546
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,599
so under certain estimates about how the

1547
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:46,720
world is

1548
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,040
how will my trades today in

1549
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,400
cryptocurrency

1550
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,440
manifest as future observations or

1551
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,839
given everything i know about the person

1552
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:57,119
all these norms and the social

1553
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:58,240
components

1554
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,520
how will my uh policy on a certain type

1555
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,720
of conversation

1556
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,720
end up changing future observations i

1557
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,119
have and then it turns out that in the

1558
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:07,760
free energy

1559
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,280
principle slash active inference

1560
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,280
framework the policy

1561
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,800
that's the whole control theory

1562
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,200
cybernetics elements to the theory

1563
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,040
that is guided by g which is

1564
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,119
framed a few different ways and it's

1565
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,480
kind of situational

1566
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,119
how exactly it's deployed but there's a

1567
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:25,599
lot of

1568
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:28,160
mathematical work in other live streams

1569
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:28,800
and in

1570
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,359
other talks other papers to go into this

1571
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:32,400
what is g

1572
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,319
and what do all of its calculations mean

1573
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:36,079
but basically it's a heuristic that

1574
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:37,200
helps the organism

1575
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,000
select good policy and good policy is

1576
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:40,319
not

1577
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,880
absolute because there's scripts for

1578
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:43,599
social failure

1579
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,000
there's scripts for success and so

1580
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,920
instead of getting into this realm of

1581
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,119
well what if the person

1582
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,119
consciously wants to succeed and all

1583
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:52,240
this sort of stuff

1584
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,760
we're going to take a statistical

1585
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,920
approach and we're going to have this g

1586
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,720
formalism that turns out to map onto the

1587
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,200
way

1588
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,440
that policy is selected even if it's in

1589
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,440
a distorted way or even a pathological

1590
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,400
way

1591
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,359
okay here is a quote from the authors

1592
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:08,160
they write

1593
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,920
with this in place it becomes possible

1594
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,359
to implement weak scripts in a

1595
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:12,400
generative model

1596
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,000
we submit that weak scripts can be

1597
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,760
implemented via the likelihood mappings

1598
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:16,480
a

1599
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,520
prior beliefs d and sensory preferences

1600
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,800
c of the agent

1601
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,440
thus weak scripts harness beliefs about

1602
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:23,839
how

1603
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:25,760
the expected salient social categories

1604
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,440
for figures in specific situations

1605
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,640
that's d

1606
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,800
and beliefs about how they generate

1607
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,480
sensory behavior a

1608
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,400
so when people are feeling this way

1609
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,400
socially then they respond this way from

1610
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,440
an observations

1611
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,359
way this is what you'll see you can

1612
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:41,119
imagine where that becomes pathological

1613
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:42,319
or whether there's challenges with

1614
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:44,839
intercultural or intergenerational

1615
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:46,559
communication

1616
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,400
in social situations the relevant social

1617
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,319
categories of role

1618
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:51,839
and appropriate behavior can only be

1619
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,520
inferred which requires the agent to

1620
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,599
mobilize the right kind of knowledge

1621
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:56,880
so it's not just enough to know you

1622
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,880
can't just know the 1001 phrases there's

1623
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,079
also an element of

1624
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,559
optimal experimentation in the space and

1625
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,400
being an improvisational partner you

1626
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,839
can't just go off of a

1627
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:09,680
hard-coded script an agent must infer

1628
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,440
the proper categories the proper

1629
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,599
associations and the proper mapping onto

1630
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,520
observations in order to navigate a

1631
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,119
social context adequately

1632
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:20,240
and to maximize her returns by the niche

1633
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,760
social capital this mapping changes

1634
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,559
in function of the context changes as a

1635
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:28,160
function of the context

1636
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,480
hence the weak script also feeds one

1637
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,559
understanding of the context per se

1638
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:34,559
so that's many ideas we've talked about

1639
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,000
with the environment influencing the

1640
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,359
individual and the individual

1641
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:39,040
influencing the environment often in a

1642
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,720
way that changes the probability of

1643
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,079
other things happening later

1644
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:45,359
that stigma g this also brings up this

1645
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:47,119
multi-scale idea

1646
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:50,160
where within an agent statistical

1647
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,800
uh changes can be happening and those

1648
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,960
can be resulting in changes in behavior

1649
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,680
all these different things so i just

1650
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,839
thought might be interesting because

1651
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:01,839
these kinds of figures are not usually

1652
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:03,280
found in the scripts

1653
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,960
papers that i looked through one other

1654
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,839
figure that will just be kind of quickly

1655
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:11,680
go through not reading the

1656
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,960
caption is just to look at this agent in

1657
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,520
the world

1658
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,079
model and just how different types of

1659
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:19,760
things are categorized on here so on the

1660
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,400
bottom of the image

1661
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,200
laser on the bottom of the image is the

1662
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:27,680
world

1663
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,359
and then the top of the image this box

1664
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:31,200
is the person and so

1665
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,800
perhaps there's some type of blanket or

1666
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,480
some mediating interface

1667
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,880
happening here and there's several types

1668
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,680
of things

1669
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,799
there are strong and weak components so

1670
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:43,520
using the previous dichotomy of some

1671
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,880
things that are sort of

1672
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,880
objectively a specific way and then

1673
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,880
other things are more probabilistic

1674
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,680
in nature so perhaps this is reflecting

1675
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,040
the observations

1676
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,359
coming in with a strong component here

1677
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:56,799
maybe that's just your

1678
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:59,040
visual reception it could be debated

1679
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,440
whether that's a strong component or not

1680
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,200
and then it's get getting passed off to

1681
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,720
these weaker components maybe

1682
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,480
conditional ones or ones that are

1683
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,760
related to stochastic processes and then

1684
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,119
there's a mapping from action back onto

1685
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:14,799
the world and the causal process of the

1686
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:15,280
world

1687
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,040
which might be a strong component or a

1688
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,599
weak component and the point is

1689
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:21,920
uh it shouldn't even have to be a binary

1690
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:22,640
per se

1691
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,559
it should be about our inference of

1692
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:26,160
those latent links in the world

1693
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,680
maybe for a certain thing you have

1694
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,040
enough information or you have the right

1695
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,319
side information

1696
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:32,079
or you have the right prediction in a

1697
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,559
given scenario where you can confirm it

1698
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:37,119
post hoc where you can perform optimally

1699
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:38,160
as if you knew

1700
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,960
the actual strong causes of an event

1701
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,400
other times it might be possible to

1702
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,240
find a pareto front with respect to

1703
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,559
policy where even if there's a long tail

1704
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:49,359
distribution

1705
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:52,559
of uh randomly distributed events it can

1706
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:54,079
still be possible to have

1707
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:56,400
incredible performance in real world

1708
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,839
settings for example

1709
00:55:57,839 --> 00:55:59,359
companies that are high reliability

1710
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:01,680
organizations errors do happen they just

1711
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,000
don't

1712
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,119
cascade in these organizations so how

1713
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,079
could we construct

1714
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:08,640
niche where different parts of this

1715
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,440
system

1716
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,680
and the actual unique interfaces that

1717
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,599
are numbered here

1718
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:15,680
and described a little bit more in the

1719
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,720
caption

1720
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,319
how could we design do systems

1721
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:20,079
engineering in this kind of an

1722
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:21,200
environment

1723
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,760
and potentially do things like reduce

1724
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,640
error rates or

1725
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,880
increase the accessibility or onboarding

1726
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,319
onto research communities

1727
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:29,920
you know just the kinds of things that

1728
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,599
we might want to care about

1729
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:33,280
all the social scripts all the reasons

1730
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,359
why people have been talking in pages

1731
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:36,880
and pages and pages of

1732
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,880
social sciences talking about different

1733
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,400
categories well

1734
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,079
here might be the opportunity to

1735
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:44,160
actually specify these categories

1736
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,079
we could debate whether specifying them

1737
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,680
is a good or a bad thing

1738
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,079
i would say if we all work together on

1739
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:51,839
it then it's a good thing to formalize

1740
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:53,280
it

1741
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,680
maybe there's people who disagree so for

1742
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,359
those who don't want to formalize script

1743
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:58,400
theory

1744
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,640
i'm not sure would be interesting to

1745
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,680
talk to them here

1746
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,240
but we're going to be talking about how

1747
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,440
active inference

1748
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,200
could lead to some type of integration

1749
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,839
here and then what that might allow

1750
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:11,599
so let's just think about a few general

1751
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:13,280
questions in closing here

1752
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,319
on the hour first what might

1753
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:19,359
a framework for scripts be so

1754
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,160
two axes of variations were laid out but

1755
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,000
there's other axes of variation and it

1756
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,280
was acknowledged that

1757
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,799
even sometimes it was hard to

1758
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:28,640
differentiate a theory as being

1759
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,480
somewhere on the internalist externalist

1760
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,359
spectrum

1761
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:34,640
and so what what will a framework for

1762
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,119
scripts

1763
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:38,160
be how will we know it when we see it

1764
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,000
will it look like an equation will look

1765
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,280
like four equations that can't be

1766
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,200
reduced will it look like 11 will we

1767
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,960
believe that later on it will be reduced

1768
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,400
or will we believe that later on it

1769
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,599
won't be reduced

1770
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:49,520
so what are we really going for here

1771
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,680
with this scripps theory

1772
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:55,280
what might we be able to do with a good

1773
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:55,839
script

1774
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:59,200
framework for example in online teams or

1775
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,799
in uh located situations could we

1776
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:05,839
do design in a way that was transparent

1777
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:06,640
for

1778
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,960
online behaviors so that people knew

1779
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,640
that they were signing up for a service

1780
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:11,200
that was

1781
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,839
using such and such uh in its decision

1782
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:15,680
making for its algorithm

1783
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,799
would people want to be interfaced that

1784
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:19,599
way

1785
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:21,839
in api for a person as one of my friends

1786
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:23,440
puts it

1787
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,119
could it be possible for humans and

1788
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:27,359
computers to co-program

1789
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:30,799
how formal should the scripps concept be

1790
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:32,720
if it turns out to explain a tremendous

1791
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,799
amount of behavioral variation

1792
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:37,200
then it might be possible to design

1793
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:37,839
another

1794
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:40,240
level of control for people it's kind of

1795
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,319
like surveillance capitalism did a lot

1796
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:43,920
with just linear models and

1797
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,079
did a lot with machine learning and is

1798
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:48,000
the next level just the next level of

1799
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:48,400
that

1800
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,760
is that really what we're working

1801
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,640
towards i don't think so

1802
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,480
one might want to ask what are the

1803
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,400
unique predictions and experiments

1804
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,880
so given that you think about scripts

1805
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,520
now from an active inference perspective

1806
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,680
what are the ways in which we can look

1807
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:04,640
at the previous

1808
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,200
literature on scripts reinterpret it and

1809
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,079
then think

1810
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:10,000
well knowing what they knew and the way

1811
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,280
that they phrased it and

1812
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,359
building on it and then knowing what we

1813
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:15,040
know from other areas

1814
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,040
what would be the most informative

1815
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,240
experiment to run

1816
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,680
so what predictions would we have that

1817
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,680
haven't been analyzed yet but already we

1818
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,359
can do it with the data we have

1819
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:25,359
like we could predict that there's uh

1820
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:27,280
more conformity in certain types of

1821
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,640
interactions than others

1822
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,040
and we could have an a priori way of

1823
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,119
pre-registering a hypothesis and then

1824
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:36,160
doing a deep dive into a social data set

1825
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,920
coming up with these answers that would

1826
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,440
be not predicted by someone else's

1827
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,040
scripts theory or impossible to predict

1828
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,559
with someone else's scripts theory

1829
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:44,079
and showing that it could predict well

1830
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:45,839
with active inference but also then

1831
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:46,319
there's the

1832
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:49,040
experimental design and so that's about

1833
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:49,520
what

1834
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:52,160
um experiment is going to optimally

1835
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:52,640
reduce

1836
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,000
your uncertainty about something

1837
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,599
specific so it's always going to be

1838
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:56,880
experiments

1839
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,040
not just open-ended but about learning

1840
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,480
something specific

1841
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,440
and so i would be curious just in the

1842
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,040
active inference community or

1843
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:08,240
the social side what are people curious

1844
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,000
to reduce their uncertainty about

1845
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,960
what do we want to test this on do we

1846
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,559
want to have this

1847
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:18,240
tested um in which field

1848
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,760
can it be done with data that already

1849
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,000
exist or could exist

1850
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,720
which is related to the question what

1851
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,319
are the next steps for active inference

1852
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:26,960
here

1853
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,040
so there's two figures and there's uh

1854
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,359
maybe an appendix in the paper and

1855
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:35,200
uh it lays out qualitatively

1856
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,160
mostly an agenda for formalizing and

1857
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,160
integrating the scripts concept

1858
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,240
and so i just wondered what are the next

1859
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,640
steps is it actually to

1860
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,480
pick a canonical type of interaction

1861
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,720
ordering food or something like that

1862
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:52,079
and uh chat bought it or do something

1863
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:53,440
with robots or

1864
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,839
is this gonna be something that we can

1865
01:00:55,839 --> 01:00:56,480
infer

1866
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,799
from video data is it going to be on

1867
01:00:58,799 --> 01:00:59,839
online teams or

1868
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:01,680
located is it going to be more

1869
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,760
mathematical how can we make active

1870
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:04,960
inference better account

1871
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,119
for not just sort of robot foraging

1872
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:08,160
behavior but

1873
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,559
human behavior and we've talked about in

1874
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:11,839
the last couple of weeks

1875
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:14,000
people who are implementing things like

1876
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,280
daydreaming access

1877
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:18,319
and memory and historiosity and risk

1878
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:19,280
averse

1879
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,079
optimization how can we start bringing

1880
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:24,240
some of these topics into play

1881
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,319
and then thinking about real social

1882
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:27,280
issues

1883
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,240
and how we might be using active

1884
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:31,359
inference to

1885
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:33,920
act in those situations and then lastly

1886
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,160
just as always we want to consider

1887
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:40,079
the goals of this research and uh

1888
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:43,280
i'd be curious to hear what the author's

1889
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:46,400
goals or interests are uh i think it's

1890
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:46,960
kind of a

1891
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:50,480
cool area they're making

1892
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,839
interesting progress sounds really cool

1893
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:55,440
to integrate across

1894
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:59,119
big areas of research and

1895
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:01,520
that's it kind of an interesting paper

1896
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:02,319
to read

1897
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:04,960
so i hope everyone can check it out and

1898
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,200
join a discussion

1899
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,599
thanks for participating there will be

1900
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:10,960
follow-up forms for the live

1901
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,480
participants

1902
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,440
and any feedback suggestions questions
