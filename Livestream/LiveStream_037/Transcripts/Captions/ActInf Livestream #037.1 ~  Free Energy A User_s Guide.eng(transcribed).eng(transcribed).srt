welcome to active inference lab

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,079
we are participatory online lab that is

10
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,000
communicating learning and practicing

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,840
applied active inference

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,239
you can find us at links here on this

13

slide

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,960
this is recorded in an archived live

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,320
stream so please provide us with

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,559
feedback so we can improve our work

and we'll be following good video

20
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,720
etiquette for live stream maybe people

21
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,640
can raise their hand visually so there's

22
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,640
not a little jitsi blip until we figure

23
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,760
it out or either way

discuss and

31
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,880
also appreciate having stephen mann the

32
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,920
first author here with us this paper

33
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,119
free energy a user's guide

34
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,640
and for

35
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,960
this 37.1 we'll start with an

36
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,280
introduction and then we'll just

37
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,880
fire up some

38
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,640
slides and

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,320
hear perhaps an opening and a

40
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,880
contextualizing statement from stephen

41
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,240
to be introduced last and then go into

42
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,759
whatever questions that everyone else

43
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,399
has brought and anyone watching live

44
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,119
so

45
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,719
i'm daniel i'm a researcher in

46
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,719
california and i will pass it to stephen

47
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,040

somebody who does

56
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,959
did some programming

57
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,800
went from being an educator to a

58
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,160
wayfinder

59
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,400
and i find guides really

60
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,920
an interesting topic to have

61
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,360
conversations around i'll pass it down

62
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,760
to blue

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,400
hi i'm blue i'm a research consultant

64
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,599
based out of new mexico and i will pass

65
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,440
it to the first author stephen

66
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,360
hi everyone i'm stephen i am a

67
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,200

currently a postdoc at the in the

69
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,599
linguistics department of the university

70
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,000
of surrey and a guest at the max bank

72
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,360
in leipzig where i live

73
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,599
all right

74
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,000
maybe stephen would you um or stephen m

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,280
would you like to

76
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,599
just give a little context on the paper

77
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,800
like how did this fit into your

78
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,120
phd or research interests how did this

79
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,360
specific collaboration come to be in the

80
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,879
format of the paper and the way it is

81
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,959
sure first uh thanks for having me and

82
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,319
thanks very much for last week's session

83
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,840
with dot zero i think you did a really

84
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,000
excellent job at uh overview and i'm

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,200
really looking forward to talking about

86
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,799
it today um

87
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,280
this paper came about because

88
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,000
we

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,440
uh myself and ross and michael the other

90
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,400
authors

91
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,640
had been in discussions

92
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,480
with a few other authors

93
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,599
around a symposium discussing active

94
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,200
inference and the free energy principle

95
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,000
and also uh predictive processing

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,040
at the

97
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,120
australian society for philosophy and

98
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,080
psychology conference in 2018 uh we put

99
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,560
together a small symposium

100
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,000
it went relatively well and

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,680
after a few more months of sort of

102
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,840
passing ideas back and forth

103
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,519
we approached michael weisberg the

104
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,519
editor of biology and philosophy about

105
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,840
putting together a topical collection

106
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,519
sort of like a special issue but sort of

107
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,399
um

108
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,798
collected digitally

109
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:21,759
and

110
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,520
eventually sort of after sort of

111
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,759
pitching it to him and managing to

112
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,199
get to talk to him in person um he said

113
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,560
that he and the other editors were quite

114
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,880
excited but what they wanted was

115
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,840
an introduction from us that would

116
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,880
explain the mathematics

117
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,360
and the philosophical

118
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,880
dialectics

119
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,600
behind sort of at the core of active

120
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,360
inference in the free energy principle

121
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,720
in a way that was accessible for

122
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,280
philosophers

123
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,040
and so we said sure we can do that and

124
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,880
that was a little while ago we started

125
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,639
soliciting alpha papers we've now

126
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,240
published most of the papers in that

127
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,759
topical collection

128
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,360
uh and since then

129
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,320
uh

130
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,160
at the same time sort of finalizing

131
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,880
finishing off my phd and then moving to

132
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,080
europe from australia where my phd was

133
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,919
we were getting to grips with the real

134
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,520
mathematical core

135
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,720
of uh active inference and trying to

136
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,080
figure out

137
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,400
what was the necessary mathematics to

138
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,479
explain the basics of the framework

139
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,880
and then how to present that mathematics

140
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,000
to

141
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,160
a philosophical audience who has sort of

142
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,320
some mathematical competence

143
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,800
and the result is the current pre-print

144
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,720
so we think we're probably about one

145
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,800
more set of revisions away from uh

146
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,880
submitting for publication and it will

147
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,639
eventually come out as the introduction

148
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,680
to that uh topical collection so what

149
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,280
i'm really interested in hearing from

150
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,800
everyone else today

151
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,680
uh

152
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,360
this the same thing we're interested

153
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,720
from hearing from the wider community

154
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,560
which is the reason we release the

155
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,919
pre-print which is just comments and

156
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,600
suggestions and any kind of corrections

157
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,479
that can help improve the paper um so

158
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,400
that its final form is sort of even

159
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,239
better as good as we can make it

160
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,639
okay thanks for the awesome context

161
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,880
stephen s

162
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,759
thank you yeah um we're really enjoying

163
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,759
this paper and one thing it'll be

164
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,440
interesting to

165
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,880
to think about even though you you sort

166
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,360
of aimed at maybe a philosophy audiences

167
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,280
some of the aspects of it

168
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,600
at this nascent kind of foundational

169
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,960
level

170
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,840
could help in an applied context that

171
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,880
may be

172
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,800
beyond the modeling

173
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,479
so we're kind of interested in some of

174
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,800
that so that might be something we might

175
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,639
tip into even if it's not

176
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,560
in the remit of this paper's

177
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,800
direct publication i think it would be

178
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,400
really helpful

179
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,240
in the broader sort of journey of using

180
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,360
active inference in the world

181
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,440
awesome

182
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,960
okay um

183
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,240
blue

184
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,520
or dean

185
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,360
would you like to start with a question

186
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,880
or we can return to one of the points

187
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,240
that were already kind of brought up

188
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,479
i'm good for now

189
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,360
um

190
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,400
okay

191
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,240
so

192
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,560
maybe just one starting point was just

193
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,280
what backgrounds like

194
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,039
how did you

195
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,960
go from thinking about who you wanted to

196
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,960
make the paper accessible to

197
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,680
to writing it a certain way and then you

198
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,919
mentioned it was for philosophers so

199
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,440
what is the impact in this

200
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,800
community

201
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,639
that you'd like to how would you like to

202
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,759
update their generative models

203
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,560
nicely put

204
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,039
first and foremost

205
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,440
we would like to fix in their mind the

206
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,080
relationship between

207
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,120
uh

208
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,599
variational inference and bayesian

209
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,960
influence

210
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,520
so i know that's something you've uh

211
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,160
talked about before it's something that

212
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,639
pre-dates the free energy principle and

213
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,400
active inference as an explanatory

214
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,680
framework for cognitive science and

215
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,639
biology and it's something which

216
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,639
as far as i can tell is sort of the the

217
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,560
first step in understanding

218
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,599
what's going on with that mathematics

219
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,039
um

220
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,879
so that's the sort of the key thing we

221
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:19,919
want

222
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,599
philosophers to sort of have in their

223
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,120
minds also because

224
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,639
almost all philosophers especially

225
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,960
philosophers of cognitive science but uh

226
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,120
but also philosophers of biology will be

227
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,319
familiar with bayesian inference at

228
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,719
least to some extent so by pointing out

229
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,240
that what active inference is is

230
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,000
something sort of a step to the right of

231
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,360
bayesian infants something that they can

232
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,679
start to understand by analogy with that

233
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,120
we hope it will stop them from sort of

234
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,279
getting scared of all the complicated

235
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,720
mathematics that you can read in a lot

236
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,320
of the papers

237
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,760
um

238
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,600
so that's on the math side on the

239
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,440
philosophy side a lot of the stuff in

240
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,560
section four of the paper was our

241
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,839
attempt to really strip back

242
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,399
a lot of the claims that were being made

243
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,839
but also

244
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,720
sort of categorize the claims being made

245
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,640
one thing that i noticed in reading the

246
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,560
literature and attempting to understand

247
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,519
it

248
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,360
was that

249
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,440
different kinds of claims were being

250
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,800
conflated

251
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,839
and there was jumping around

252
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,600
from claims in different domains

253
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,040
mathematical claims that suddenly uh

254
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,200
leverage to justify an empirical claim

255
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,120
and then suddenly move to an extremely

256
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,200
general claim about all of cognitive

257
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,000
science or all of biology in general

258
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,240
so

259
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,279
that's the second thing we want the

260
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,120
philosophers to get that it is possible

261
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,360
to disentangle these claims despite the

262
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,040
fact that they are habitually

263
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,680
sort of conflated or not made distinct

264
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,439
enough in the rest of the literature

265
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,800
all right one follow-up and then i see

266
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,880
stephen and dean um you mentioned that

267
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,320
bayesian

268
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,600
inference may be more familiar

269
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
especially because it's used in all

270
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,080
kinds of modern statistical descriptive

271
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,079
approaches as well as generative

272
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,160
just to hear it in your own words where

273
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,399
do you think variational inference is

274
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,200
more familiar so who does it represent

275
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
who's more familiar with variational

276
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,040
methods or who would be familiar and

277
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,399
then what are the key differences

278
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,480
sure so my understanding is that

279
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,320
uh

280
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,440
physicists statisticians and machine

281
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,160
learning practitioners

282
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,560
uh may well have come across variational

283
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,640
inference certainly will have had a much

284
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,640
better chance of having come across

285
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,120
variational inference than philosophers

286
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,880
at least as of 2022

287
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,720
what i understand variational inference

288
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,519
to be is a certain kind of

289
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,279
technique for choosing a probability

290
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,000
distribution over unobserved

291
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,200
uh

292
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,480
states

293
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,519
that started uh in physics as i

294
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,600
understand it with feynman although

295
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,399
i put a little footnote in the uh

296
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,720
pre-print pointing out that i haven't

297
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,640
been able to translate the stuff in that

298
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,880
feynman book to the later stuff

299
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,560
especially stuff that um

300
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,040
david mckay talks about in his textbook

301
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,839
on

302
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,600
information theory which includes some

303
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,519
issues in variational inference but as i

304
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,680
understand it started in physics

305
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,839
then was adopted into sort of statistics

306
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,519
more broadly

307
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,440
as a means of approximating bayesian

308
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,120
inference in cases where exact bayesian

309
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,720
inference is too difficult to carry out

310
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,600
to computationally difficult

311
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,519
and then move from statistics into

312
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,360
machine learning where it's possible to

313
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,240
actually

314
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,480
build machine learning algorithms or

315
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,160
systems that can perform variational

316
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,160
inference and then from there it ended

317
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,440
up being in the active inference

318
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,839
framework

319
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,600
all right thank you so dean first

320
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,519
stephen thanks for joining us i really

321
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,040
appreciate it um

322
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,800
here's a question for you

323
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,600
now that now that uh

324
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,839
an examination of the situation and the

325
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,040
situation

326
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,360
as you stated was kind of

327
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,040
uh math and um philosophy

328
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,959
have now i've got a relationship and

329
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,440
we're going to up out pops

330
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,000
a guidebook or a primer

331
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,440
when the when the pump is primed what do

332
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,320
you see as being the effect of that

333
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,800
that relationship between the

334
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,240
sort of philosophical audience and the

335
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,279
and the math that was used to get us to

336
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,920
this place

337
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,920
relationship between

338
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,440
the philosophical audience and the math

339
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,120
that was used to get us to this place i

340
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,480
mean

341
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,240
first and foremost

342
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,200
i want the philosophical audience to

343
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,440
gain a certain kind of facility with the

344
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,279
maths

345
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,399
i think

346
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,160
one of you i'm not sure who of you it

347
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,480
was but in the point zero

348
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,399
put it extremely well by saying it's

349
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,320
like learning how the horse moves in

350
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,200
chess

351
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,399
i think it might have been daniel but i

352
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,240
don't want to miss attributed to you

353
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,320
giving the philosophical audience the

354
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
basic understanding of the most basic

355
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,360
maths

356
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,920
will give them that first kind of tool

357
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,079
which they can then go on if they so

358
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,639
wish to build up and learn more of the

359
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,800
moves learn more of the complex maths if

360
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,480
they want to then go on and interrogate

361
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,160
the rest of that literature which is

362
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,920
more complex

363
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,920
we've tried to sort of

364
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,720
forego too much critical analysis in the

365
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,720
paper there is some in there

366
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,040
um we've tried to forego that a little

367
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,360
bit just in order to

368
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,519
get the understanding of that maths

369
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,279
across

370
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,519
okay

371
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,560
i can follow up there

372
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,600
um

373
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,240
what does it matter for

374
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,760
the philosophers so what are they

375
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,360
in your sense or

376
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,880
their sense

377
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,240
what will knowing the difference between

378
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,000
bayesian and variational help them

379
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,360
evaluate

380
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,600
or what will seeing it structured this

381
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,160
way help them evaluate

382
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,199
i think there's a few so i hope other

383
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,040
people also can think of philosophical

384
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,320
questions that

385
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,600
knowing the difference between the two

386
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,040
would help you change your mind on

387
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,360
yeah i mean

388
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,040
the simple answer is just it will help

389
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,360
them understand what fristen is claiming

390
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,279
and by fristen of course i'm using him

391
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,440
as just an umbrella for anybody who's

392
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,600
writing uh positively in the active

393
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,760
internet tradition attempting to

394
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,519
demonstrate that the active inference

395
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,839
framework can provide or inform certain

396
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,480
process theories that uh explain

397
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,440
cognitive or biological systems

398
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,800
philosophers need to know the difference

399
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,839
between bayesian inference and

400
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,000
variational inference because they need

401
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,199
to know

402
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,839
uh what it is that fristen is claiming

403
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,920
can be attributed to systems like this

404
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,800
okay blue on that

405
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,160
so i have a question and um like maybe i

406
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,680
missed it and i was looking i just did

407
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,199
like a quick control off on the paper

408
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,720
just to make sure that i didn't miss it

409
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,959
and i'm not like misinterpreting but

410
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,800
um in your explanation of um

411
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,600
the generative model like i just wonder

412
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,560
why you didn't choose to

413
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,120
go into the recognition model and i

414
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,199
think that like while you've discussed

415
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,320
at length like p's and q's

416
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,040
why did you leave that out or do you

417
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,360
think it's not significant or did i miss

418
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,410
it and did you talk about it

419
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,839
[Music]

420
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,880
so by the recognition model i understand

421
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,160
that to be a sort of alternative way of

422
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,120
doing inference that uh an agent could

423
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,399
employ

424
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,240
so i'm just i'm saying what i understand

425
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,920
by it so you can correct me before i try

426
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,199
and answer the question

427
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,959
uh i understand it to be

428
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,959
yeah an alternative to generative

429
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,480
inference is just to employ a kind of

430
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,639
recognition model which simply takes in

431
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,360
data and immediately produces some kind

432
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,000
of statistical result from that data

433
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,399
it doesn't need to uh simulate or

434
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,160
generate its own data and then compare

435
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,920
that to what it sees that'll be the

436
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,480
generative way instead it just

437
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,639
applies some kind of say mathematical

438
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,040
statistical function to the data and and

439
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,199
then gets a kind of result

440
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,040
which describes what it hasn't observed

441
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,399
is that what you meant by recognition

442
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,639
model

443
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,199
oh no so i'm referring to um the paper

444
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,639
the tale of two densities the 2019 paper

445
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,480
by brampton al and um you know in that

446
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,839
paper they they refer to um

447
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,480
the recognition model as the q right the

448
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,720
inverse of the likelihood model it's the

449
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,440
mapping from the consequences to

450
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,399
the hidden causes and so like you you

451
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,880
got really into the maths

452
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,920
but

453
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,320
and discussed the the um generative

454
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,480
model but just didn't um like

455
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,959
acknowledge this this recognition model

456
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,800
and i just was curious

457
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,799
as

458
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,480
okay so you just mean the the

459
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,919
distribution

460
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,319
queue

461
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,919
uh by by the recognition model

462
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,359
um

463
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,559
am i using a different queue i haven't

464
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,839
read a tale of two densities i should

465
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,959
say so

466
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,640
uh yeah

467
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,880
the recognition model is on the it's um

468
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,439
in the uh kind of namespace of

469
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,839
expectation maximization

470
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,480
modeling the recognition model is like

471
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,640
the sensory update

472
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,640
and then the generative part was like

473
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,360
emphasized i hope that's not

474
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,520
too simplified or what two densities

475
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,000
were and then that outbound was more

476
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,160
like associated with the generativity

477
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,799
and that's also um that's why it's

478
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,559
important to go from the frequentist to

479
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,000
the bayesian at all

480
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,679
because with

481
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,600
bayesian generative modeling like the

482
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,240
model can be run both ways

483
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,160
though it's used with different

484
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,600
adjectives

485
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,559
that's like variational autoencoder

486
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,240
that's um

487
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,000
all these methods where it's not just

488
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,640
descriptive modeling on a data set like

489
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,720
principal component analysis or multiple

490
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,799
regression it doesn't just describe then

491
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,640
it can be used although those can be

492
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,520
used

493
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,760
or be thought of as bayesian like can be

494
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,080
used in a generative way as well but

495
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,200
that's the part that people will have

496
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,120
less empirical experience

497
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,640
seeing but

498
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,440
let's

499
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,760
think about this and then return to it

500
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,039
next week

501
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:29,919
um

502
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,440
yeah okay so stephen s

503
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,559
just following on um from the bayesian

504
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,080
um

505
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,360
which

506
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,480
is often used in the embodied

507
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,640
context people think about embodying and

508
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,559
multi-sensory integration and that type

509
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,720
of work and that field

510
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,559
is a bit challenged by moving over to

511
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,280
this variational machine learning

512
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,840
paradigm because it's highly

513
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,880
mathematical but what's interesting with

514
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,480
active inference it sort of comes back

515
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,160
into

516
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,880
that being grounded in embodied action

517
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,960
because that gives the preferences

518
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,280
somewhere to be anchored so how do you

519
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,840
see

520
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,799
um this going back into

521
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,360
embodied cognition

522
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,679
as a way for those preferences to be

523
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,679
grounded

524
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,400
uh that's a difficult one

525
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,679
uh for me to answer in part because

526
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,240
i'm not really part of the

527
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,640
tradition that emphasizes

528
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,200
embodied and enactive

529
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,480
uh approaches to cognition

530
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,760
[Music]

531
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,799
the way

532
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,280
i was taught it they were sort of

533
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,200
alternatives to the representationalist

534
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,960
tradition and i was much more the

535
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,120
representationalist tradition

536
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,160
so

537
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,640
there has been some talk of whether and

538
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,160
how

539
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,360
free energy approaches support one or

540
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,600
the other of those two traditions

541
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,120
uh

542
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,679
and

543
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,600
to some extent because i'm already

544
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,120
sympathetic to the representation of

545
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,159
tradition

546
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,240
i'm already leaning towards the idea

547
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,919
that uh free energy approach will

548
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,080
support that you know as opposed to an

549
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,200
embodied or an active kind of approach

550
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,360
which is sort of a shame because

551
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,520
like all of those kinds of binaries it's

552
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,240
probably somewhat a false dichotomy

553
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,679
and it just means that you know my

554
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,440
direct my attention has been directed

555
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,919
elsewhere than your attention in looking

556
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,360
at these issues

557
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,320
um

558
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,440
and so yeah i don't

559
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,919
have enough value to add unfortunately

560
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,720
i think it yes stephen

561
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,480
but um

562
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,840
our previous paper 36 was like

563
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,720
a taxonomy of perspectives on the

564
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,120
representation question in fep so i

565
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,640
think we're all

566
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,919
very

567
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,080
primed to just take it totally open

568
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,000
stance and

569
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,640
is is every possible stance for every

570
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,480
person to focus on

571
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,159
it's just kind of

572
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,679
not within our

573
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,400
time and attention capacity so i think

574
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,559
it just speaks to um like a diverse

575
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,159
field where of course people are

576
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,360
focusing on

577
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,880
chemistry of

578
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,679
this element of that element it won't be

579
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,720
exactly that split but

580
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,120
in the broadening field of like active

581
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,960
inference and fep

582
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,320
there's gonna be people who are focused

583
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,080
more on one question or other so that's

584
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,640
kind of cool to like know where we um

585
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,320
have similar regimes of attention or not

586
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,840
stephen

587
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,559
yeah i'm agreeing with daniel and also

588
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,919
actually we found this really really

589
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,080
helpful from an embodied perspective

590
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,120
because

591
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,360
the way that you separated or you gave

592
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,039
the probabilities and preferences of

593
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,880
working together

594
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,240
was um

595
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,559
it was kind of like a deflated or a more

596
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,280
nascent form of representation and that

597
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,440
jives quite nicely

598
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,240
with

599
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,240
potential ways that

600
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,880
inactive approaches are also potentially

601
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,039
there because the nature of preferences

602
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,120
so you start to have a way where they

603
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,039
can both live together

604
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,480
because we i don't know we were talking

605
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,760
about this the other day won't be daniel

606
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,960
that that it wasn't so clear how these

607
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,080
two

608
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,480
can live together and often when people

609
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,880
who are from philosopher quote the free

610
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,480
energy principle they talk about early

611
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,120
papers like 2000 and

612
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,679
you know maybe 10 years ago even and

613
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,360
that

614
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,200
is often then a false argument gets

615
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,039
painted so now we've almost got a new

616
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,440
paper which can kind of

617
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,320
help

618
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,000
ground those philosophers so i wonder

619
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
what your thought is in terms of whether

620
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
you're trying to help people use the

621
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,679
most latest form of free energy

622
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,080
principle when they were talking about

623
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,880
philosophy and to stop some of the

624
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,840
conflation of just people criticizing

625
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,240
models which are now out of date

626
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,120
um

627
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,919
if that was part of your rationale for

628
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,120
the way this paper was created

629
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,080
yeah we absolutely wanted to direct

630
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,559
people's attention to what we thought of

631
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,720
as the

632
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,880
real issues in a way

633
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,200
the the appropriate issues

634
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,400
um

635
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,799
i mean we reckon that

636
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,200
a critical assessment that is not well

637
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,200
informed by the actual workings of the

638
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,280
theory is not going to be helpful

639
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,480
because

640
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,039
you might accidentally hit on a critique

641
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,280
that works but only accidentally if

642
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,600
you're going to criticize a framework

643
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,960
you better at least understand what's

644
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,159
going on

645
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,120
um

646
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,720
my worry is that

647
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,799
it will become out of date as things

648
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,960
change but there's not a lot you can do

649
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,279
about that i mean it took us quite a

650
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,880
long time to get this

651
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,960
first draft together to get this

652
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,159
pre-print together and i'm sort of

653
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,520
hoping that things haven't changed so

654
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,600
much that it's out of date by the time

655
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,919
it comes out uh i mean one way to foster

656
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,840
all that is to just be as basic as

657
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,279
possible so that you're really capturing

658
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,520
the core that can't possibly you know

659
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,559
change

660
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,440
um

661
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,919
but otherwise your best chance is just

662
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:10,640
to

663
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,000
publish what you've got at a particular

664
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,240
time and keep your eye on how things

665
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,240
change and update as you go

666
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,320
thanks yes dean

667
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,000
stephen if

668
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,799
i use a lot of metaphors so if you

669
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,360
walked into a singles bar and one of the

670
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,039
singles was a philosopher and the other

671
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,440
single was a mathematician

672
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,600
and you had to guess now going through

673
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,080
the process of building that guy right

674
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,640
like you're not match.com but right you

675
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,640
have to make a guess as to whether that

676
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,960
long-term relationship they walk out

677
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,120
hand-in-hand or they're completely

678
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,120
repulsed by one another

679
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,799
i know it always depends but you're

680
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,120
talking about updating the guide i'm

681
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,640
kind of want to go back

682
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,120
one previous step what keeps them

683
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,240
together

684
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,039
what pulls them apart

685
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,440
yeah so how do you

686
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,760
write what is essentially a philosophy

687
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,640
paper but include mathematics in a way

688
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,559
that does justice to both

689
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,400
is is roughly how i'm hearing that

690
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,840
question well a long-term relationship

691
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,120
right like they still got to have some

692
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,640
compatibility

693
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,400
and the feeling right until its point

694
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,000
was

695
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,159
up to now it's been i don't know if i

696
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,159
even want to go to the bar

697
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,120
so

698
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,679
that's that's what i'm asking you know

699
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,279
based on what you've

700
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,360
what you've journeyed into right because

701
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,120
not everybody i know i unders i

702
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,279
appreciate the idea of the guidebook

703
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,240
because

704
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,840
not everybody goes into situations

705
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,279
right sometimes you get dropped into

706
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,440
situations and it's a little bit more

707
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,919
intense but what causes people to go

708
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,559
freely into that kind of uh relationship

709
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,320
and sustain it over

710
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,400
a long enough period that it does make

711
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,600
sense

712
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,360
doesn't remain kind of a superficial

713
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,679
thing or just a concept but it actually

714
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,520
becomes realized i was curious what your

715
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,320
thoughts on that are

716
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,520
hmm

717
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,000
i think that

718
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,159
you know trying

719
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,279
hard not to repeat myself too much uh

720
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,799
the way i the way i try and think about

721
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,159
that question is to try and think about

722
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,200
what has prevented philosophers from

723
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,880
really accessing the

724
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,120
mathematical parts of active inference

725
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,200
so far and that's just from sort of

726
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,720
communicating with philosophers and

727
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,080
talking to them and hearing their

728
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,880
dissatisfaction with it and it was

729
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,279
always just that there was there was too

730
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,000
much of it too fast

731
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,240
and so the the sort of the only approach

732
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,360
we could see

733
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,440
that could remedy that

734
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,039
was to go

735
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,200
as slow as possible

736
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,640
in a way uh and so spend sort of

737
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,240
have a much

738
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,880
heavier ratio ratio of

739
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,000
word to equations in a way

740
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,520
and go into much much more depth in

741
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,760
explaining each equation as it comes

742
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,440
along

743
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,039
uh rather than

744
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,880
throwing all in at once and then

745
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,320
decomposing it

746
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,080
right i mean we

747
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,600
one of the earlier versions of the draft

748
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,679
we started with the main equations and

749
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,080
then decompose them in the current draft

750
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,200
that you've read

751
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,279
we start with the components

752
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,520
and then build up to the main equation

753
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,279
that was a little bit risky i thought

754
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,440
because i was worried that people would

755
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,000
feel we were holding the main event back

756
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,440
for too long

757
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,720
but

758
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,880
so far it seems to be working i'll say

759
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,240
i'd be interested to hear your thoughts

760
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,919
on on that approach

761
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,440
whether you think that meshes together

762
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,600
well enough yeah no that that's one of

763
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,039
the things

764
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,799
and again i don't think mathematicians

765
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,360
are trying to be pushy but if you don't

766
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,799
have that context it can feel pushy

767
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:55,919
and so

768
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,520
how how long you're willing to leave

769
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,480
something open before you

770
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,360
drop

771
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,679
drop the big questions is sometimes

772
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,240
easier for somebody then to size the

773
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,960
situation up and contextualize it so if

774
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,760
in this in this delivery i don't know

775
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,360
previous versions

776
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,279
right but in this delivery in in that

777
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,000
respect i actually think it makes it

778
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,480
less intimidating but that's just my

779
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,640
that's my personal opinion sorry stephen

780
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,640
i know you wanted to say something

781
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,919
steven yeah

782
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,320
stevens

783
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,399
yeah just carrying on from what dean was

784
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,919
saying as well is

785
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,480
um you you looked at the inference model

786
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,799
almost prior to having a markov blanket

787
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,000
you know and i thought that was quite

788
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,320
useful and one thing that that may made

789
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,159
me think as i was reading it and i'd be

790
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:45,919
interested in your thoughts is

791
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,679
it it helps with this idea of really

792
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,520
thinking about where how are we going to

793
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,679
create the blanket when does the blanket

794
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,360
come into play and what assumptions are

795
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,200
there about the blanket in some ways

796
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,320
it's easy to pick up a pre-built idea of

797
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,240
what blankets are and then model off

798
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,840
that was it's like okay well let's

799
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,919
question that and that actually could be

800
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,880
useful at your a more heuristic

801
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,960
level you know for other fields of

802
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,799
practice so i'd be interested in your

803
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,320
thoughts about

804
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,679
what you think

805
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,880
your motivation for that and also maybe

806
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,919
the sort of

807
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,399
surprising or unsurprising outcomes of

808
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:26,439
not going straight for the blanket

809
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,240
well one of the big revelations for me

810
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,760
in researching this paper was that

811
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,520
you can talk about variational inference

812
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,480
and you can talk about um minimizing

813
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,399
expected free energy

814
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,279
without talking about markup blankets i

815
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,279
had sort of come into this with

816
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,000
uh just sort of a huge deluge of

817
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,600
literature from the active inference

818
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,039
tradition

819
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,799
lots and lots of like key words

820
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,760
well what could more uh

821
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,640
uncharitably be called buzz words like

822
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,640
markov blanket and

823
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,480
non-equilibrium steady states and things

824
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,240
like this and

825
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,760
it was a concern that i would first have

826
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,440
to understand statistical physics and

827
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,200
fluid dynamics before i could understand

828
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,320
the claims that were being made about

829
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,320
inference but looking back into the

830
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,720
history and you realize that first of

831
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,960
all variational inference

832
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,799
is a precursor to active influence so

833
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,080
you can think about variational

834
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,480
inference in its own little bubble as we

835
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,559
have it in its own little section

836
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,640
and then the sort of next step which is

837
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,279
novel and is quite excitingly

838
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,480
novel

839
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,200
um which is minimizing expected free

840
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,840
energy can also be construed just in

841
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,840
terms of decision theory you don't as

842
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,440
far as i can see you don't have to think

843
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,520
or talk about markov blankets

844
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,679
at all to talk about

845
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,000
decision theory as

846
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,480
minimizing expected free energy

847
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,720
so the reason why we separated them was

848
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,480
because they're separable the reason why

849
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,039
we put those two first variational

850
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,880
inference and expected minimizing

851
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,559
expected free energy is because i think

852
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,559
they are simpler and easy to grasp and

853
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,559
we were trying to start from the simple

854
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,640
and build up to the more complex

855
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,080
it's i think it's definitely true that

856
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,440
the most sort of intriguing and

857
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,519
possibly the most sort of difficult part

858
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,480
of understanding this whole

859
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,320
system which fristen is building is

860
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,559
understanding the things to do with

861
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,559
markov blankets in real like physical

862
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,080
situations

863
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,240
um but

864
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,559
what i'm sort of interested in now to

865
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,760
give you a preview of what i'm like

866
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,320
thinking about next the more

867
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,840
the thing which i'm more optimistic

868
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,919
about being able to make headway on is

869
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,320
investigating minimizing expected free

870
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,720
energy as a decision theory that sort of

871
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,640
gets the middle ground between it's not

872
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,640
just something that prefigured active

873
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,120
inference as variational inference did

874
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,279
it's not something that seems to require

875
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,039
a very large amount of mathematical

876
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,960
understanding as the mark of blanket

877
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,120
stuff does seem to to me

878
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,880
it's something which is claimed to be a

879
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,039
certain way of approaching decision

880
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,720
theory decision theory sort of a

881
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,159
philosophic philosophical sort of

882
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,000
technical term or a statistical term so

883
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
it's that nice middle ground between

884
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,039
novel but understandable

885
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,120
um which is why the yeah the thing that

886
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,720
i'm sort of most

887
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,960
interested in investigating next is

888
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,480
the expected free energy approach and

889
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,720
again i don't think you need to talk

890
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,360
about markov blankets to talk about that

891
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,600
right

892
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,799
okay thanks for sharing that one thought

893
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,080
um on

894
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,559
where the markov blanket comes in

895
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,120
so you said that variational inference

896
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,799
and the minimization of expected free

897
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,200
energy

898
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,440
in the context of a paper that was

899
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,279
structurally laid out with first

900
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,399
perception

901
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,399
and then introducing action into the

902
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,039
loop so it kind of

903
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,080
fits

904
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,080
this perception of case as like action

905
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,159
affordances are not possible

906
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,320
and so that's the special case the more

907
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,880
general case is when action can come

908
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,960
into play

909
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,720
that whole

910
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,159
realm

911
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,279
of

912
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,559
action theory decision theory game

913
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,720
theory cybernetics

914
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,640
signal processing

915
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,720
none of that

916
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,200
it was said requires the markov blanket

917
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,799
formalism

918
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,279
i'd like to maybe add that there may be

919
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,440
a weak sense requirement like in the

920
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,760
sense that on a bayesian graph or using

921
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,279
bayesian methods

922
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,799
using pearl

923
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,399
1988

924
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,519
version of the markov blanket

925
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,919
there are markup blankets in the

926
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,200
machinery of these bayesian methods

927
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,519
because there are variables that are

928
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,360
isolated or conditioned on each other

929
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,440
so that's like the trivial markov

930
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,919
blanket the non-contentious one that

931
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,120
people are not spending a lot of time

932
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,440
and attention on

933
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,039
that

934
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,600
and then part of the unknown or at least

935
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,200
less clear

936
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,720
is the

937
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,279
action and perception

938
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,559
interpretation

939
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,040
or concordance that fristen has

940
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,560
introduced kind of taking the unitypel

941
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,119
markov blanket concept and splitting it

942
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,119
into like an incoming sense state

943
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,079
dependency and outgoing action state and

944
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,359
then

945
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,960
none of that gives a clear action

946
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,359
perception topology which is why we've

947
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,520
seen like around the clock and then

948
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,760
where the ones like action and sense are

949
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,079
connected and backwards arrows

950
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,359
so

951
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:34,879
there's the part about the partitioning

952
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,599
of the markov blanket and then

953
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:38,800
taking something that's kind of a

954
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,040
trivial consequence

955
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,359
of statistical models

956
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:47,119
and then tying it to potentially realism

957
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,879
in the strong cases

958
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,639
like people saying mark up blankets as

959
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,159
defining things

960
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,480
and then even just within the formalism

961
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,719
how do you go from how do you

962
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,040
ramp up the meaning

963
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,680
of this markov or does it need to even

964
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,399
be that way

965
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,240
which is kind of related to this

966
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,640
question which i'll ask and then anyone

967
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,560
can give a thought like you talked about

968
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,720
necessary and sufficient

969
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,079
so

970
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,040
is this

971
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,640
some of the necessary and sufficient

972
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,400
pieces of

973
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,880
fep what is what is necessary like

974
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,320
what's the kernel that everything else

975
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,280
can

976
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,040
continue to elaborate around

977
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,240
what section and page number please

978
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,680
well you'll notice that we were cheeky

979
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,680
in defining three distinct

980
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,240
free energy principles probably none of

981
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,720
which would be you know ascended to by

982
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,960
the actual proponents of the free energy

983
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,640
principle um

984
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,200
yeah exactly um

985
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,200
could you go through and just describe

986
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,839
in a few like sentences or just what is

987
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,000
each one of these the three free energy

988
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,680
principles inference action selection

989
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,320
what did they mean to you

990
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,079
first one free energy principle for

991
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,320
inference as you know as we've defined

992
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,480
it is

993
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,680
when

994
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,160
dating your sorry my cat is biting me

995
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,399
now

996
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,160
sorry i'll hold him up here so it

997
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,480
doesn't bite me arm

998
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,760
um well the short version is

999
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,480
choose q by minimizing f

1000
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,440
so

1001
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,160
choose your beliefs about hidden states

1002
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,680
by minimizing variational free energy

1003
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,280
so that's uh it's a principle in the

1004
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,280
sense that philosophers would call

1005
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,560
a normative principle it's a command

1006
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,960
for how to act in this case the specific

1007
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,720
kind of action that is how to choose

1008
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,839
your beliefs

1009
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,720
okay

1010
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,720
and uh free energy principle for action

1011
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,200
also a normative principle telling you

1012
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,400
how to act

1013
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,359
and this one is uh in our again in our

1014
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,000
terminology choose zed

1015
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,920
by minimizing g

1016
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,839
so choose your action

1017
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,839
by minimizing

1018
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:07,799
its expected free energy

1019
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,200
this is all for anybody who's watching

1020
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,320
this who hasn't looked at the paper

1021
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,119
we've

1022
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,079
tried to sort of describe um

1023
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,240
in very slow

1024
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,240
but understandable way what what these

1025
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,079
different sort of letters are standing

1026
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,839
for

1027
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,400
me give the definitions for a discrete

1028
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,640
case

1029
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,119
okay so

1030
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,240
we have perceptual inference

1031
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,680
bayesian expectation maximization like

1032
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,119
choose q the member of the variational

1033
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,000
family distribution by minimizing this

1034
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,520
snapshot f

1035
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,839
based upon your priors

1036
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:49,200
basically and new information coming in

1037
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,359
and then that takes on a normative

1038
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,960
interpretation it's kind of like saying

1039
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,040
if you were doing linear regression you

1040
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,480
would do the l2 norm least squares

1041
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,960
if you're doing this type of

1042
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,560
regression

1043
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,520
then

1044
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,359
do this kind of inference

1045
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,520
the second one is also normative but

1046
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,599
it's action theoretic because you

1047
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,160
introduced action and then that

1048
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,119
introduced the elaboration on f to the g

1049
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,320
function

1050
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,359
um

1051
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:20,160
maybe stephen s

1052
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,640
how would you say that this movement

1053
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,320
into the future

1054
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,280
first

1055
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,640
matters for maybe not necessarily how a

1056
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,200
philosopher but how um

1057
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,520
any other relevant area might see this

1058
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,520
in an applied context like what does the

1059
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,880
f to g

1060
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,560
movement have to do

1061
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,320
well i think it's i think what's useful

1062
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,640
is that it's like it's almost taking

1063
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,160
what's evolved out with the markov

1064
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,680
blanket with the

1065
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,119
expected free energy and bringing it

1066
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,400
back down

1067
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,560
into a more

1068
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,480
a form which isn't only a form which is

1069
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,000
involved in

1070
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,680
the modeling out

1071
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,480
of

1072
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,280
particular systems at low

1073
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,160
dimensionalities come in and say okay

1074
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,760
this is a broader principle that can be

1075
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,040
talked about

1076
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,960
and i think that then

1077
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,320
ties into some of the stuff the active

1078
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,680
inference lab is trying to look at is

1079
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,040
how can active inference itself be used

1080
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,079
as a way to think of organizing and

1081
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,839
structuring our lives like george perek

1082
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,000
might have thought about it and

1083
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,200
how

1084
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,040
can it be

1085
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,800
used as a heuristic

1086
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,320
in in areas like coaching psychology in

1087
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,640
areas where you're looking at action

1088
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,079
orientated

1089
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,920
decision support

1090
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,400
in complex evolving

1091
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,960
ways you know

1092
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,359
so you can't

1093
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,200
you can't model it in the in the

1094
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,280
traditional sense of a marker because

1095
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,920
there's nowhere near the dimensionality

1096
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,520
can be approached

1097
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,480
so

1098
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,000
what's useful is they say okay look

1099
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,839
we've got these general ideas we've got

1100
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:58,000
a route to it but that there's the

1101
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,960
general deflated forms of that

1102
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,400
actually

1103
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,119
then because they're not so high order

1104
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,200
and they're not so

1105
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,280
nailed down to one idea of a mark or

1106
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,520
blanket maybe has a more universal

1107
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,520
application when someone's trying to

1108
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,240
look at complex contexts and how to act

1109
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,960
in the in the world

1110
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,240
so i know what your thoughts on that but

1111
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,680
that that's that's what i'm very

1112
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,240
interested in is this idea between sort

1113
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,200
of

1114
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,680
diagnostic kind of syndrome-based

1115
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,280
psychology and

1116
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,280
how do we look at actually what's going

1117
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,520
on in a context look at the

1118
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,839
the symptoms look at the context

1119
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:39,520
unfolding and work on modeling using our

1120
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,960
own

1121
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,680
apparatus as dialogical

1122
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,359
sort of collaborative

1123
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,078
human beings

1124
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,200
stephen uh uh dean first and then

1125
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,400
stephen m if you want to give a thought

1126
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,839
on that and we're just gonna talk about

1127
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,839
this inference in action piece because i

1128
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,200
think there's a few more pieces to draw

1129
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,720
out and then we'll get to the third

1130
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,520
selection but dean go for it

1131
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,359
yeah so back to my strange twisted

1132
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,359
metaphor so now all of a sudden applause

1133
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,200
for walks into the bar

1134
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,560
and instead of one one map showing up

1135
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,960
we'll call it the geometry which is

1136
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,280
much more amenable to the model

1137
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,839
in terms of how a philosopher might walk

1138
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:21,200
into a space

1139
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,760
and see the geometry first

1140
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,200
uh all of a sudden there's two maths

1141
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,839
there's a statistical math that's that's

1142
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,640
showed up at the same time are they

1143
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,400
twins what's going on here and i think

1144
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,160
that's where the guide

1145
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,240
is kind of handy because if you first

1146
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,480
walk into the space i'm

1147
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,200
i'm not arguing that a markov blanket

1148
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,839
exists i think relationship matters but

1149
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,760
i think what most people that walk into

1150
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,200
that bar

1151
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,680
don't realize is that you're walking in

1152
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,880
on two

1153
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,400
different maths

1154
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,160
and they're both showing up at the same

1155
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,280
time when you were expecting one

1156
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,119
you were expecting to be able to work

1157
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,720
with a model

1158
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,920
which is

1159
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,760
as i said it's far more proximal to the

1160
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,040
geometry

1161
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,000
math than to the statistical one

1162
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,720
and so i think that again when we're

1163
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,640
talking about guides

1164
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,839
um

1165
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,839
i don't have to i can put my hand in the

1166
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,760
ocean and figure out what the current is

1167
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,200
and i can look up at the stars and

1168
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,359
figure out where i am in that invariant

1169
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:26,319
space

1170
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:28,240
i don't necessarily have to have a

1171
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,520
laptop

1172
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,920
with the statistical distribution i mean

1173
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,560
that might help but that's not a tool

1174
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,119
that i needed first hand

1175
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,800
whereas i think the modeling part which

1176
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,400
is what you were

1177
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,960
were trying to bring up with this guide

1178
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,400
is at hand

1179
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,319
and so it's the availability piece that

1180
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:47,280
i think

1181
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,000
philosophers are trying to are trying to

1182
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,200
what what

1183
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,119
what did i walk into here that's

1184
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:56,400
essentially what am i walking into and

1185
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,079
what is the betweenness of those two

1186
00:42:58,079 --> 00:42:59,440
types of math

1187
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,920
that they're probably if they're like me

1188
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,560
but i'm not a philosopher they're asking

1189
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,599
when they're when they're being

1190
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,560
introduced to this so i'm just curious

1191
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,560
again if i'm if i'm going way off on a

1192
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,800
tangent or if we're introducing

1193
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,640
something we actually know what we're

1194
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,480
being introduced to

1195
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,920
and that's the part we stephen used to

1196
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,240
talk about slowing down because i really

1197
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,720
agree it's not a breaking down it's an

1198
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,839
actual

1199
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,599
slow down

1200
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:28,800
nothing wrong with that whoa

1201
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,400
i mean i could try and approach an

1202
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,079
answer by sort of extending your

1203
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,319
metaphor if you'll give me license to do

1204
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,400
so

1205
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,359
imagine you're going to the bar

1206
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:45,200
and there's dozens or even hundreds

1207
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,319
of

1208
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,240
maths or different components of maths

1209
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,640
or different approaches to maths

1210
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,839
and

1211
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,359
what you'd really

1212
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:54,480
like

1213
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,960
is some way of paring that down

1214
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,359
to something that is approachable

1215
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,599
you you know that only a few of these

1216
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:03,119
will be approachable but you don't know

1217
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,280
which ahead of time

1218
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,119
i'd like to think that you could use

1219
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,520
what we've written as at least the first

1220
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,920
step to pairing some of that away so

1221
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,160
what we've left out essentially is the

1222
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,640
stuff that you could pair away and say i

1223
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,040
can't approach that yet

1224
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,359
what i know i can approach is these

1225
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,440
first few things

1226
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,640
and

1227
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,040
what i like to think is that we've

1228
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,079
done

1229
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,400
okay at getting at least some of those

1230
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,839
first few things

1231
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:32,960
in there

1232
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,720
you know not too much not too little

1233
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,000
just really trying to find that gold

1234
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,839
lock zone and those will be the ones

1235
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:39,680
that are approachable even you know

1236
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,480
approachable for a philosopher

1237
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,520
who's met very little mats before um

1238
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,839
i know i owe stephen s a response to

1239
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:49,440
your earlier question as well but if you

1240
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,640
want to go ahead

1241
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,119
first stephen or daniel you'd say well

1242
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,680
yes steven s go for it yeah i'll just

1243
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,160
say maybe bring up slide 13 if you're

1244
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,359
able to daniel because that might be a

1245
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:01,920
useful one

1246
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,839
just as it has

1247
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,680
i have it

1248
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,960
yeah

1249
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,160
cool

1250
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,000
because it's that's got a little bit

1251
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,839
there about the penalty for overfitting

1252
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:18,359
penalty for failing to explain the data

1253
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:23,119
um and that that has 13.

1254
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,359
oh is it oh i said maybe i'm looking at

1255
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,599
the numbers at the bottom okay but

1256
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,640
on um

1257
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,640
page 23

1258
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,720
or oh yeah

1259
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,560
35 here yeah yeah okay yeah slide 21

1260
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,000
yes

1261
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,040
yeah this definitely juxtaposes the the

1262
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,440
f and the g

1263
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,760
it's like a pokemon evolution

1264
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,079
but it includes those different pieces

1265
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,079
about bringing in action

1266
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:51,440
with uh

1267
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,160
the

1268
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,760
uncertainty on the consequences of

1269
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,880
action

1270
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,520
and the fundamental

1271
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,640
um

1272
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,400
and the ability to impact it

1273
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,520
but that was actually what i had um

1274
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,200
kind of written down so stephen made the

1275
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,480
point about how action is a lower

1276
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,240
dimensional space

1277
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,359
and

1278
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:10,960
that's like

1279
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,800
making it an algorithm tractable like

1280
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,200
conditioning inference on action which

1281
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,119
is something that's very different

1282
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:18,560
structurally than a lot of other control

1283
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,520
theory where the target of inference is

1284
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,599
a policy selection

1285
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:26,400
here the affordances play a little bit

1286
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,040
of an upstream roll and they make the

1287
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,280
downstream calculation conditioned on

1288
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,240
action

1289
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,599
so that speaks to a different

1290
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,760
embeddedness of action in active

1291
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,800
inference

1292
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,000
and then

1293
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:38,880
um

1294
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,319
there's a few other things but first

1295
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,880
stephen m what would you what was the

1296
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,560
answer that you owed at the other

1297
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,480
stephen

1298
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,839
yeah i mean i was really just picking up

1299
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:50,720
on the the point that stephen made about

1300
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,520
the difficulty of accurately

1301
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,560
modeling

1302
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,800
and we talk about this a lot in

1303
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,160
philosophy of science i mean the

1304
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,280
philosophy of any of the special

1305
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,200
sciences but in the sort of philosophy

1306
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,119
of science more broadly one of the

1307
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,040
biggest topics

1308
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,319
is modeling

1309
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:09,599
and one of the biggest questions is

1310
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:12,240
how do you trade off between getting a

1311
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,079
model which is a perfectly accurate

1312
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:15,920
representation of the thing that you are

1313
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,040
modeling

1314
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,040
versus something that is tractable and

1315
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,359
that you can handle and the analogy is

1316
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:22,880
always made with

1317
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,800
maps that's sort of the first analogy

1318
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,240
you can't have

1319
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,520
a map that is an exact replica

1320
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,240
replica excuse me of its territory

1321
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,520
because you wouldn't be able to use it

1322
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,040
to navigate it could not provide you

1323
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,880
with anything that was more helpful than

1324
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,640
the territory itself

1325
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,839
so

1326
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:44,319
we have some kind of

1327
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,160
practical knowledge of how to make maps

1328
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,160
we know what to leave out we know how to

1329
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,760
condense it we should at least you know

1330
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,599
shrink it usually

1331
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:52,960
if we're creating a map from from a

1332
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,200
territory what we don't really have

1333
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,520
in a very general sense across all of

1334
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,040
science is

1335
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,680
a set of principles for how

1336
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,520
given a specific situation that is too

1337
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,400
complex

1338
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,760
to produce a perfect representation of

1339
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,680
what all you leave out and what all you

1340
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,440
keep in and how should you transform

1341
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,359
that space into a representation of that

1342
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,280
space in order to produce a

1343
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,319
representation that is a useful uh

1344
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:22,160
approximation of it

1345
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,160
so the question coming you know back to

1346
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,599
the formalism would be

1347
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,559
how do you choose a kind of a q

1348
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,079
distribution your approximate

1349
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:31,119
distribution the thing that you're going

1350
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:32,960
to harbor in your brain and believe

1351
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,960
that throws out enough of the useless

1352
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,000
stuff

1353
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,400
of the real world but keeps in enough of

1354
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,920
the stuff that you really need to keep

1355
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,680
in in the world

1356
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,200
this is sort of the

1357
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,200
one of the big questions

1358
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,200
in philosophy of science and i guess

1359
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,160
science proper at like the early 21st

1360
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,558
century

1361
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,480
awesome answer thank you dean

1362
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,000
and then blue

1363
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,839
yep just real quick so

1364
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:02,480
daniel when when daniel talked in the

1365
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,000
point one about

1366
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,599
the third p

1367
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,280
but he called it the p h i t n e s s the

1368
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,440
the fitness that's what basically

1369
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,160
you're describing how do we take that

1370
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,359
that

1371
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:16,720
variance

1372
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,200
field and collapse it down to something

1373
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,000
more

1374
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,520
tractable as you

1375
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,680
said and so at some point later on

1376
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,920
either either later on today or in our

1377
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,040
next live stream i think that's

1378
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,839
what the active inference model

1379
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:34,240
which is not a map

1380
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,079
and it has probably two parts it has a

1381
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,400
frame but it also has a it also has a

1382
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,400
filtering effect maybe we can talk a

1383
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,960
little bit about that because that's

1384
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,800
that's what the fitness

1385
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,200
is really about so i'm looking forward

1386
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,359
to sort of diving a little bit deeper on

1387
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:50,960
that because it's not just

1388
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,280
a back and forth across

1389
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,359
and and reaching edges it's actually

1390
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:56,240
going

1391
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,480
deeper into it and then returning from

1392
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,440
so

1393
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,200
yeah i'm kind of looking looking forward

1394
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,200
to that from a mathematical standpoint

1395
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,598
as well

1396
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,880
thanks dean blue

1397
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,240
so that's the perfect like segue fitness

1398
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,040
um and into what i was going to bring up

1399
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,440
and so um steven something that you

1400
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,240
mentioned earlier is like your

1401
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,720
attempt to

1402
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,240
capture the essence of the fep and the

1403
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,079
things that will not change

1404
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:31,280
and kind of build slowly incrementally

1405
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,280
and and so

1406
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,800
if we have a theory that does not change

1407
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,839
essentially like does not

1408
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:41,920
evolve it will die like it will become

1409
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,240
extinct because we're constantly

1410
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,720
learning new things and so

1411
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,359
i mean i think um

1412
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:50,640
i i

1413
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,640
like from a counterpoint

1414
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,599
think that it's kind of critical to

1415
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:58,400
capture the evolution of the fep over

1416
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,760
time because

1417
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,960
it really um changes the the potential

1418
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,200
applications and um

1419
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,640
ways that that people interpret the the

1420
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,400
principle and the theory of active

1421
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,599
inference also

1422
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:14,640
and so what like if it doesn't change i

1423
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,599
mean

1424
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:17,920
will it not ever change or is it subject

1425
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,680
to change or just what are your thoughts

1426
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,200
on that like like is it totally

1427
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,200
inflexible these these points that

1428
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,319
you've attempted to lay out

1429
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,880
no i mean yeah that general point is

1430
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,079
very well taken indeed um

1431
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:35,040
i i guess i think that

1432
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,480
uh by

1433
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,760
trying to capture something that we

1434
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,280
thought wouldn't change i think we meant

1435
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,280
or i should have said

1436
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,000
we're trying to capture the parts of it

1437
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,119
that

1438
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:49,599
the rest of the framework

1439
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:52,319
will continue to depend on

1440
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:53,520
um

1441
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,599
for sort of as long as possible we tried

1442
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:58,559
to keep the most stable parts of it

1443
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:01,839
without necessarily implying that

1444
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:04,160
active inference could survive without

1445
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,559
these mathematical components but just

1446
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,240
that

1447
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,920
the change to the theory or the change

1448
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,400
to the approach would have to be so

1449
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,520
radical

1450
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:14,880
once you've got rid of these core

1451
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,359
mathematical components that someone

1452
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:19,920
could legitimately ask is it still the

1453
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,520
same theory

1454
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,119
so that's roughly what i would mean by

1455
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:24,880
essential such that

1456
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,800
if for example

1457
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,440
tomorrow fristen were to say we don't

1458
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,040
need to talk about variational inference

1459
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,480
anymore or we don't need to talk about

1460
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,880
minimizing expected free energy anymore

1461
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,040
someone could legitimately ask okay is

1462
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,720
he now talking about a new theory that's

1463
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,480
no longer active inference

1464
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,079
is it so different because he's thrown

1465
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:44,000
out that sort of fundamental part that

1466
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,280
he's now actually proposing something

1467
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,960
completely different

1468
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,640
um i think that someone could

1469
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,160
legitimately ask that question i think

1470
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,160
that a reasonable person could say that

1471
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,760
he's now talking about a different

1472
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,200
theory because i think that those

1473
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,040
mathematical parts are so

1474
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,119
uh crucial to it as opposed to some of

1475
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:01,599
the other parts which seem

1476
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:04,079
some of the more complex parts seem more

1477
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,240
dispensable you could throw out some of

1478
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,400
the more complex things keep these more

1479
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,319
basic things and

1480
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:12,000
you would still more likely be having

1481
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,960
the same theory

1482
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,720
yeah blue

1483
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,319
so just to respond quickly like so

1484
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:22,400
for me that's kind of an arbitrary line

1485
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,520
in the sand

1486
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,559
um

1487
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:25,680
and like one thing that we've talked

1488
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,520
about back and forth a lot is this

1489
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,760
concept of ergodicity and like an

1490
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,359
ergotic system versus like a

1491
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:33,040
non-equilibrium steady state density

1492
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,160
locally ergodic like what does it mean

1493
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,160
and is the if we throw out every density

1494
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,240
and eliminate this requirement like is

1495
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,319
the theory still the same theory and and

1496
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,480
so like that's one point but i mean

1497
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,800
there are many points um in like the

1498
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,119
minimization of free energy and and so

1499
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:50,880
on and so forth and so

1500
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,280
as we add on to

1501
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,880
the theory

1502
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,200
we are changing the theory all the time

1503
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,960
like as new papers come out like the

1504
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,040
recognition model versus the generative

1505
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,200
model and you know bayesian mechanics

1506
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,800
for stationary processes was kind of

1507
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,119
really highlighting a couple key uh

1508
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,960
points but as the theory goes and

1509
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,880
changes

1510
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,040
it's like at any point we could say well

1511
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,640
that's not the same theory and so if

1512
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,079
you're if you're

1513
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,079
so the theory is not allowed to evolve

1514
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:20,000
over time like it's just this arbitrary

1515
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,319
point in the sound that that you don't

1516
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:24,079
want to cross like the minimization of

1517
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:25,200
free energy what if we decide that the

1518
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,720
minimization of free energy means

1519
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,319
something totally different like even in

1520
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:29,440
this paper

1521
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,079
i mean you had in a footnote um about

1522
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,640
the complexity versus accuracy but but

1523
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,520
to refer to free energy as inaccuracy is

1524
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,839
like i've not heard of it described that

1525
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:42,480
way before and so for me i mean

1526
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,960
it is this complexity and accuracy and i

1527
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,760
understand like the um the way that you

1528
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,920
framed it but it's a completely like

1529
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,880
novel way to talk about free energy like

1530
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,040
i always hear about as here here it is

1531
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,440
framed in terms of like uncertainty or

1532
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,280
surprise but not inaccuracy like that

1533
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,440
was completely like cop took me off

1534
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,920
guard actually so i mean as the theory

1535
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,640
evolves like i don't know it's just

1536
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,000
what are the what's what's the

1537
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,640
irreducible component of the fvp like

1538
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,040
does such a thing exist or is it just

1539
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,079
turtles the whole way down

1540
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:17,520
yeah you're asking me the really hard

1541
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,359
questions i like this because it's tough

1542
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:20,960
it's really tough to think it's honestly

1543
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,880
yeah it's tough to think and answer that

1544
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,880
and to to ensure that i'm answering sort

1545
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,359
of honestly as to what i really believe

1546
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:28,799
as opposed to just trying to sort of

1547
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:30,960
dismiss what you say uh

1548
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,799
you know i i'm not

1549
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:34,960
trying to dismiss what you say i do

1550
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:35,920
think

1551
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,680
that the line is

1552
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,799
blurry so it's not clear and distinct i

1553
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,880
don't think that it's arbitrary i might

1554
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,720
be wrong in that but i don't believe

1555
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,200
that it's arbitrary um

1556
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,640
let me just leave to the side for a

1557
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,720
moment the the description of free

1558
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,079
energy as

1559
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,240
inaccuracy uh i'll come back to that

1560
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,359
because i'm interested in picking up

1561
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:56,720
what yeah what you think about the

1562
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,880
different interpretations of of the

1563
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,200
function f um but i'll try and go back

1564
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,960
to sort of the idea of

1565
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,720
herbicity

1566
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,240
uh

1567
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,160
yeah there's a sense in which

1568
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,079
things are still being worked out and

1569
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:12,400
one of the things we put in the paper um

1570
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,599
is something that we were urged to

1571
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:18,319
make clear which is that

1572
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:21,599
active inference is a work in progress

1573
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:23,440
even the sort of mathematical

1574
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,119
underpinnings are

1575
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:27,200
still being

1576
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,599
fleshed out in a sense or still being

1577
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:31,520
put together in a way that helps connect

1578
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,520
the different parts of the theory okay

1579
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,200
that's okay that that in fact was a

1580
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,040
little bit difficult for me to swallow

1581
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,880
at first because i felt that if that's

1582
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,960
true then it doesn't legitimate all of

1583
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,960
the strong claims that are being sort of

1584
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,119
made but all of our complaints about

1585
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:46,559
that are in that fourth section of the

1586
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:47,520
paper

1587
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,880
so we try to make clear what we think is

1588
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,319
sort of justified and not justified on

1589
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:52,240
that basis but it's still true to say

1590
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,520
that it's fair to have a framework and

1591
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,319
to you know to expend time trying to put

1592
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,920
together the mathematical underpinnings

1593
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,680
of this framework uh even though they

1594
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,040
don't yet exist you know we don't have

1595
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,319
to

1596
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:04,000
we shouldn't just throw out the theory

1597
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,680
or disparage it just because the full

1598
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,200
math hasn't been worked out yet i agree

1599
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,640
we should allow it to change we should

1600
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,799
allow it to evolve we should allow it to

1601
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:12,000
be

1602
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,760
applied to different things and see what

1603
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,599
works and what doesn't

1604
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,559
with all that being said i i don't think

1605
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:20,000
in this particular case maybe it's true

1606
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,599
of other theories but for active

1607
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:22,640
inference

1608
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,559
i don't think that it's true

1609
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:26,240
that there are things that you could

1610
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,839
remove

1611
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:30,640
and still reasonably say

1612
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,720
yeah this is still active inference i

1613
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,640
think i think

1614
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,400
a theory

1615
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,760
could not be that amorphous and still be

1616
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,119
sort of treated seriously as

1617
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:46,160
uh as a way of pursuing science

1618
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,400
i think that you would have to say

1619
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,880
if you threw out minimizing variational

1620
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,640
free energy or you threw out minimizing

1621
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,720
expected free energy or some other of

1622
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,400
the core components

1623
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,559
i think you would have to say if you're

1624
00:57:58,559 --> 00:57:59,920
being reasonable again the word

1625
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,760
reasonable is doing a lot of work in

1626
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,760
this paragraph that i'm building up to i

1627
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,040
think you would have to say okay it's a

1628
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,240
different theory i think you'd have to

1629
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,319
say okay we were wrong to pursue the

1630
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:09,839
minimization of variational free

1631
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:13,040
inference a variational free energy as a

1632
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,960
principle for understanding the behavior

1633
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,799
of biology and cognition we are wrong to

1634
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:18,160
pursue that we're going to pursue

1635
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,640
something else instead and so you

1636
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,720
couldn't just say oh it's still the same

1637
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,559
theory but we've changed this core

1638
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:26,400
component of it i don't think that line

1639
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,520
is arbitrary i think there are some

1640
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,200
things that if you change

1641
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,880
you have to sort of admit that you're

1642
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,160
wrong about that approach and go on to

1643
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,079
something else

1644
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,079
that's sort of my piece uh i've talked

1645
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,520
for a really long time i do want to pick

1646
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,240
up the idea of free energy as uh a

1647
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,559
function that measures inaccuracy but i

1648
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,480
don't want to talk for like a huge

1649
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,760
amount of time so maybe i should put a

1650
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:46,960
pin in that and we could potentially

1651
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,280
return to it later

1652
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,200
how about um first free energy selection

1653
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,480
stephen m

1654
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,839
finish that

1655
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:58,640
three then as in accuracy and then um

1656
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,200
then i have a point

1657
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,960
right great yeah i forgot we were only

1658
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,240
two thirds of the way through our

1659
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,280
descriptions of the different free

1660
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,359
energy principles i'm sorry uh so free

1661
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:09,839
energy principle for selection uh let me

1662
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:11,119
try and pull it up here so i can just

1663
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:12,880
read it directly off the

1664
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,200
page

1665
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:18,880
uh what we have it has is any system

1666
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:21,440
that survives long enough

1667
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,160
will act so as to appear to be

1668
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,319
minimizing f

1669
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:27,440
one of the issues here is that we've

1670
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,280
left out g but

1671
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,280
for the sake of sort of focusing our

1672
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,640
attention we can just talk about f

1673
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:38,720
okay

1674
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:41,839
and then how about the fep as uh or

1675
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:45,599
free energy as inaccuracy interpretation

1676
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:48,480
great yeah so this is um

1677
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,160
this is something that

1678
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,880
i was hoping would be again a way to

1679
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,640
present it to philosophers so that it

1680
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,559
would be easier for them to grasp what

1681
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,960
was going on i wanted them to understand

1682
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,359
why do we care about this function f why

1683
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:03,920
do we care about variational free energy

1684
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,480
well suppose that i tell you that in

1685
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,920
order to do inference what you ought to

1686
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,640
do is minimize variational free energy

1687
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,559
and then you could very well say why why

1688
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:13,680
should i care about minimizing these

1689
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,200
things and then if i tell you oh it's

1690
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,280
the measure of the cost of inaccuracy in

1691
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,520
belief then you immediately say okay i

1692
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,880
understand why i would want to minimize

1693
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,720
that because i want to maximize my

1694
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,640
accuracy

1695
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,680
so

1696
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,440
very simply put it's a way of explaining

1697
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,839
why we should care about f

1698
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:32,640
it's a measure of inaccuracy um i think

1699
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,880
that interpretation holds up just to the

1700
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,880
extent that if you look at the two

1701
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,480
components

1702
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,240
um which can be sort of thought of as

1703
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,079
you know a cost penalty for overfitting

1704
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:44,720
cost penalty for being inaccurate

1705
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,640
there's a part of that which is

1706
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,079
inaccuracy

1707
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:49,599
it's not the whole story of course

1708
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:51,520
because the other part is to do with

1709
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,760
complexity not just to do with accuracy

1710
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:54,880
so

1711
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,640
what i think we've done by describing

1712
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,079
free energy as a measure of an accuracy

1713
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:00,720
or the measure the cost of inaccuracy is

1714
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,200
trading off that sort of ability to

1715
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,440
enter into understanding the maths

1716
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,480
for

1717
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,160
you know a perfectly clear

1718
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,559
mathematically very precise way

1719
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:12,720
of describing it

1720
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,480
but i think i definitely think that it

1721
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,960
should be thought of as containing a

1722
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:21,040
term which is a cost of inaccuracy

1723
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:24,559
so we talked in the dot zero about it's

1724
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:26,079
kind of like finding the shape from the

1725
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:28,720
data and the fineness of the mesh

1726
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,520
and inaccuracy in the real world kind of

1727
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,599
has elements of both or at least we're

1728
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:36,079
used to thinking about complex decision

1729
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:38,880
trade-offs like you could make a bad

1730
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,880
decision because it took too long but

1731
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:43,040
then you came to the right outcome

1732
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,440
in the scheme of thinking bigger than

1733
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:49,359
just one p-value and so it's kind of

1734
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:51,359
opening up even this

1735
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:54,880
very kernel piece of the puzzle

1736
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:57,599
to the whole question of how specific

1737
01:01:57,599 --> 01:01:59,920
and how many subgroups

1738
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,599
and always leaving space for not

1739
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:03,359
overfitting given this whole map

1740
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:04,559
territory

1741
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:07,559
porges

1742
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,799
and would you say that the the

1743
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:15,039
overfitting inaccuracy

1744
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:15,920
um

1745
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:18,640
you know is more around when you talk

1746
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,640
about adaptive active inference where

1747
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,240
there's a way to

1748
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,760
adaptively

1749
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,160
look and have an idea of beliefs in some

1750
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,839
way

1751
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:28,720
and that

1752
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,640
underneath that there could be a kind of

1753
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,400
a

1754
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,520
more

1755
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,119
abductive

1756
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:37,119
swarming kind of

1757
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:39,200
entropic kind of process

1758
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,400
which

1759
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,240
is sit in the background but in terms of

1760
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,960
how we normally explicitly think about

1761
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,960
meaning we would think about it more in

1762
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,480
terms of what can be

1763
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:50,240
understood as beliefs so just be

1764
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,240
interested how that how you see that

1765
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:55,759
from a philosophical point of view

1766
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,680
well one of the things that's still

1767
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,400
unclear to me about the

1768
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,960
overfitting part of f is that

1769
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,119
it seems that it can only be interpreted

1770
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:12,160
as sort of a cost of complexity

1771
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:16,000
if what you already believe is simple

1772
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,520
because what it's really measuring is

1773
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:20,160
how far you are straying from

1774
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,079
what you already believe

1775
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:24,160
so that there's kind of an implication

1776
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,839
there that

1777
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:27,839
everybody always has

1778
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:30,240
simple beliefs in the first place and

1779
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,319
that therefore they ought not stray from

1780
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:34,079
those simple beliefs

1781
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:35,839
one of the things that i'm trying to

1782
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:37,920
think about now is

1783
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,000
what happens if

1784
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,240
you are starting with sort of more

1785
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,760
complex beliefs

1786
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,839
maybe that's not a sort of appropriate

1787
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:48,079
question to ask given the framework or

1788
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:49,119
the way we're supposed to interpret the

1789
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:51,760
maths but i can't help wondering it

1790
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,200
given that

1791
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,640
it strikes me that you know in order to

1792
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:57,119
interpret it as a penalty for complexity

1793
01:03:57,119 --> 01:03:58,799
you have to say

1794
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:00,400
you have to assume

1795
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:01,839
that what you're starting with is

1796
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:03,599
simplicity and i guess there would be

1797
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:05,280
real life situations in which you you

1798
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,799
don't start with

1799
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:08,160
simple beliefs

1800
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,240
and then presumably this would tell you

1801
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:11,520
well if your beliefs are complex then

1802
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,839
they ought to stay complex because that

1803
01:04:13,839 --> 01:04:15,920
penalty is a penalty for straying from

1804
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,839
that kind of complexity

1805
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:19,119
which seems

1806
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:20,079
you know

1807
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:22,319
different from how it's usually

1808
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:24,559
described

1809
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:27,039
yeah steven s um

1810
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:29,200
and would you say that that that falls

1811
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,079
into our more recent

1812
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:33,039
move

1813
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:35,280
from science as

1814
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,760
creating models and fitting things to

1815
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,119
those models

1816
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:41,520
like in the most simple way

1817
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,520
to be in modellers

1818
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:46,160
like with post-normal science and even

1819
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:48,319
pristine's work with the covid

1820
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:49,119
so

1821
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:52,000
there's a belief in engaging with a

1822
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,280
complex non-resolvable

1823
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,240
system

1824
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:59,359
question which is different to

1825
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:01,359
science's traditional role which is to

1826
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:05,920
have an answer and to fit things to it

1827
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,440
well one of the most exciting and sort

1828
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,079
of scary aspects

1829
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:13,920
of active inference

1830
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,960
is the idea that it's applied

1831
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,839
not just as a way of understanding what

1832
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:21,839
our target systems are doing so not just

1833
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:23,760
as a way of understanding what a

1834
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,680
biological system or a brain that i'm

1835
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,200
studying is doing

1836
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,520
but also as a way of understanding what

1837
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:32,079
i myself am doing when i

1838
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:33,680
represent that target system in order to

1839
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,880
try and understand it you get a kind of

1840
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:39,520
loop in a way

1841
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,839
in a sort of sense in which you you feel

1842
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:43,920
as though you could model your own

1843
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,240
activity by using

1844
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,839
these

1845
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:49,359
technical tools which active inference

1846
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:50,559
is giving you

1847
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:52,400
but then you feel like

1848
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,680
how could that be done in a way that

1849
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,119
doesn't invite any kind of infinite

1850
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:58,079
regress that's why it's scary as well as

1851
01:05:58,079 --> 01:05:59,839
exciting it's exciting because it seems

1852
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:01,440
to potentially provide some kind of

1853
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,359
extra power or insight into our own

1854
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:05,599
activities as scientists or as models of

1855
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:08,000
any kind but it's scary because it seems

1856
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,559
to then drop you into a kind of

1857
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:13,680
spiraling hole of the modeler who is

1858
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,839
modeling themselves modeling themself

1859
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:17,359
etc

1860
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:19,039
that's something which i can't think

1861
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:21,119
around even informally let alone try and

1862
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:23,760
get to the formalism of it

1863
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,480
that was the very structure of

1864
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,880
paper number 36 so even in its

1865
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,359
qualitative application

1866
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:33,920
just at the terms and concept level it

1867
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:34,720
does

1868
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,200
turn the mirror back and that is

1869
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,559
speaking to

1870
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:41,680
um the pre and post or pre post trans

1871
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:46,400
distributional aspects of active the um

1872
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,400
all the funny things that dean says as

1873
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,280
well

1874
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:51,119
and the strange loop there

1875
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:53,280
so what that made me think of is like

1876
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,200
the statistics

1877
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,039
and then the famous quote like the

1878
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:58,319
statistician can come in for the

1879
01:06:58,319 --> 01:07:00,799
post-mortem or something like that

1880
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:03,599
but a lot happens before the statistics

1881
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:04,559
happen

1882
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:06,480
like the design of the experiment and so

1883
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,640
the optimal experimentation

1884
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,720
and then the knowledge that it will be

1885
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:13,280
passed through a distributional filter

1886
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:14,400
in the big

1887
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,920
macro of the scientific method

1888
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:18,960
like

1889
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,200
planning months in advance for how many

1890
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,920
minutes and hours

1891
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,359
one is going to count insects or how

1892
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:26,960
many microliters of fluid they're going

1893
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,839
to move that is sort of the

1894
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:32,079
implementation phase and then there's a

1895
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:34,720
design time and so that's also what ties

1896
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,480
science to engineering in a way that

1897
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,480
hasn't been in design thinking in a lot

1898
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,839
of other areas too

1899
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:42,400
dean

1900
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,720
yeah this is awesome so

1901
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,160
i mean one of the things that we talk

1902
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,319
about is some of those density questions

1903
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:49,599
around what's

1904
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:51,440
what's the linear aspect of it and

1905
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:54,000
what's the solenoidal aspect of it and

1906
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,640
we also talk about walking into a

1907
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:59,359
room of mirrors with a mirror suit on

1908
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:00,799
i mean it all comes together in the

1909
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:02,880
sense that they're i think one of the

1910
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,520
things that steven mann pointed out is

1911
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,599
that there are i think they're

1912
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:09,680
one of the things i think we can say

1913
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:10,640
about

1914
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,480
active inference that's consistent is

1915
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,960
that it has at least a minimum of two in

1916
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,640
that back and forth

1917
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,640
up and down the density

1918
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:21,120
bump and around the density bump you can

1919
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,040
go either direction

1920
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,960
and

1921
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:26,080
so that

1922
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:28,158
that has me asking whether when every

1923
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:31,279
time we we say that this is a framework

1924
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:33,120
whether we're only giving it half it's

1925
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,158
due

1926
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:35,920
whether it's a framework and also a

1927
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:38,000
filtering exercise like does there have

1928
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,560
to be a minimum of two not just the

1929
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,279
boundary but then what is actually going

1930
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:46,799
on dynamically within that border

1931
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:48,799
so that we know when we're crossing when

1932
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:51,120
we know when we're within the boundary

1933
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,960
that we've maybe are looking at

1934
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,198
empirically right because we selected

1935
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:57,439
our unit of analysis but then when we

1936
01:08:57,439 --> 01:08:59,759
know when we've crossed outside that

1937
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:00,799
when we've

1938
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:03,198
when we've gotten to a place where the

1939
01:09:03,198 --> 01:09:04,799
mesh

1940
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:06,640
is holding certain things back while

1941
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,799
other things that are of a smaller

1942
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:10,719
circumference are still able to sort of

1943
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:12,080
pass through

1944
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,120
and so

1945
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:16,000
i think as a as a guide

1946
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,359
um that question of as we model

1947
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:23,198
as we model the model is the minimum

1948
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:25,920
i think if we just say the model

1949
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,920
we don't do it justice and if we just

1950
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,479
look at the as we model

1951
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:32,560
the act of doing that i think again

1952
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,799
we're looking at sort of

1953
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:36,640
a side of beef and expecting to be able

1954
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,238
to milk it and i don't think that that

1955
01:09:38,238 --> 01:09:40,158
works i think you have to have the whole

1956
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:40,960
thing

1957
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,880
or else you don't really have active

1958
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:43,960
inference so

1959
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:45,679
[Music]

1960
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:46,719
that's

1961
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:48,158
i think that's kind of where we're at

1962
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:49,679
when we're coming to the place where

1963
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:52,399
we're trying to decide what goes in

1964
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:55,520
and what doesn't go into a guide

1965
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,520
and it's a struggle right like there's

1966
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,440
no there's no question it's probably one

1967
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,040
of the hardest things that you can do

1968
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:02,880
because

1969
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,719
the majority of people that are guides

1970
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:06,400
are there because

1971
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,640
they've been there before versus the one

1972
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:11,199
who hasn't

1973
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:12,960
and that would require upending that

1974
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,120
that basic premise which is

1975
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,800
no everybody has to get into the boat

1976
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,440
and we're sailing off onto the onto the

1977
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,040
event horizon

1978
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,640
that would be the only way that we would

1979
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,880
change that so the actual nature of

1980
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:27,199
guides would only change if everybody

1981
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:29,440
had to get their skin in the game

1982
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:31,360
and start at that basic place of not

1983
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,560
knowing

1984
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,159
but that will leave that for another

1985
01:10:34,159 --> 01:10:35,760
another

1986
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,840
another live stream but at this point

1987
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,520
that's what's really interesting here

1988
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:41,920
one of the assumptions that we made is

1989
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:44,159
somebody has taken the time to go and

1990
01:10:44,159 --> 01:10:46,320
exert and explore and come back with

1991
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:49,199
information and the other people don't

1992
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:50,560
have it

1993
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,719
and the only way that changes is if

1994
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:54,880
everybody gets in the boat

1995
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,719
and sales often hopes that they don't

1996
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:59,040
come to the edge of the cliff and fall

1997
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,600
out so

1998
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,880
okay

1999
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,920
a lot there thank you dean just

2000
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:09,920
a few other points people have different

2001
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:12,320
perspectives on what is core or not some

2002
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,480
of the uncertainty

2003
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,400
let's get at it with the ontology

2004
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,840
development and

2005
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,600
making some definitions and translations

2006
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,600
and the formalisms clear in the history

2007
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,120
of science and all of that

2008
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,880
but even then it might be pretty

2009
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,080
fundamental like if it includes action

2010
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,920
and inference

2011
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:33,520
is variational methods necessary

2012
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:34,239
so

2013
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:35,679
who knows

2014
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:36,800
people will have different

2015
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,640
interpretations just about a lot of

2016
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,560
things and so that's

2017
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:45,040
again all part of the fun so stephen

2018
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,719
so one question i'd be interested is

2019
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:52,719
talking about guides in terms of that

2020
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:53,679
book

2021
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:56,239
life a user's guide um

2022
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:58,560
that's a very deep

2023
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,239
i read it for a long time and then i

2024
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:03,120
lost it but it's sort of like it takes

2025
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:04,960
you into all these aspects of people's

2026
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,199
lives in that parisian

2027
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:10,080
neighborhood and

2028
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,719
it never gives you an answer

2029
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:14,640
it doesn't but it in some ways it's

2030
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:16,000
leaving it to your intuition it's

2031
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,920
leaving to

2032
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,280
your

2033
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:21,760
integration and i'm wondering where you

2034
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,000
see that that integration that's

2035
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,440
happening at a non-perspectival level

2036
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:29,600
the integration the intuition the the

2037
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,320
affective consciousness

2038
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:34,640
that is part of our knowing

2039
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:35,440
and

2040
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:36,400
how that

2041
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,560
relates to this and maybe if it's even

2042
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,640
something that's not part of science but

2043
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:42,960
is part of this kind of

2044
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:45,280
work

2045
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:49,840
well i mean firstly you sort of crack

2046
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,920
the code in a way because the title of

2047
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:53,840
the paper was directly and explicitly

2048
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:56,800
stolen from the correct book

2049
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,000
um

2050
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,440
it wasn't

2051
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:02,480
necessarily a sort of uh

2052
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,280
the best like joke

2053
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:06,800
because it's not

2054
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,600
it's in a in the sense in which the book

2055
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,159
is about an incredibly hyper-specific

2056
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:15,120
and detailed description of

2057
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,440
a system you know an apartment block a

2058
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:20,880
specific time point on a specific day

2059
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,880
uh of the year

2060
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:27,360
gave me the idea about okay it's like it

2061
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:28,719
it's not true that we ever really

2062
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:30,800
represent things that way it's not true

2063
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,800
that science intends to represent things

2064
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,400
that way in the way that perek does and

2065
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:36,880
he's sort of making fun of but also he's

2066
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:39,520
he's incredibly constrained in the way

2067
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,360
that he wrote the book as i understand

2068
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:42,880
there's some

2069
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:45,280
there's some really crazy games that he

2070
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:48,400
plays with language in writing it and

2071
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,400
the course for example translates a huge

2072
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,080
amount of difficulty in translating it

2073
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,920
because how do you know how do you

2074
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:55,520
translate the game that he's played in

2075
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,199
french into a game you can play in

2076
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:58,960
english while writing the english

2077
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,400
version of the novel

2078
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,360
so

2079
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,440
definitely the idea of

2080
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,280
representation

2081
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,920
and sort of naturalism was on my mind

2082
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:10,000
but the sort of the short reason we

2083
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,040
called it that is because we wanted a

2084
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,880
punchy title we wanted something that

2085
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,880
people would think was accessible

2086
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:15,840
um

2087
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:17,199
but definitely when it came to casting

2088
01:14:17,199 --> 01:14:19,840
about for punchy and accessible titles

2089
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,920
that was the one that primarily came to

2090
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:22,960
mind

2091
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:23,840
um

2092
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:26,000
when it comes to sort of

2093
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,840
affective consciousness and sort of

2094
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:30,400
experience again it's

2095
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:33,040
it's a little outside my wheelhouse i i

2096
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,360
was very very

2097
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:36,960
impressed upon

2098
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,880
by the novel even just in english

2099
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,199
translation because i can't read french

2100
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:42,960
i was really

2101
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,960
really sort of moved by it in various

2102
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:46,560
different ways

2103
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,239
you know intellectually emotionally

2104
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:49,440
things like that

2105
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:50,640
there's a lot about sort of

2106
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,640
representation in there just the concept

2107
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,159
of representation

2108
01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:55,360
uh and that's something that i'm you

2109
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,960
know interested in but again that pulls

2110
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,440
sort of in the opposite direction from

2111
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,280
an activism or effective consciousness

2112
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:04,000
and things i'm very very much

2113
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,159
situated in that kind of formal dry

2114
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:08,239
approach to philosophy the kind of

2115
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:09,920
analytic tradition where we try and chop

2116
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:11,520
things down we think we're scientists

2117
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,360
you know inspecting the human condition

2118
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:15,040
under a microscope

2119
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,679
um and so but you know i can't

2120
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:20,080
deny that in reading a novel it flows

2121
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,320
over me in the same way you know i'll

2122
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:23,679
experience it in a similar way that you

2123
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:26,640
experience it i hope

2124
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:29,839
yes blue

2125
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,840
so totally funny um i was also had a

2126
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,159
question about a guide but like

2127
01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:38,159
on the opposite of like life a user's

2128
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:40,000
guide i was reminded of the movie

2129
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,719
beetlejuice um and they like the couple

2130
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:44,800
dies and they have this like handbook

2131
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,719
for the recently deceased right and like

2132
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:49,280
the the core of like the theme that they

2133
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:50,800
could well did you read the guy well did

2134
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,239
you read the guide and it's apparently

2135
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:54,640
like a very thick dense book like that

2136
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,239
no like you can't i mean we're dead you

2137
01:15:56,239 --> 01:15:57,440
don't know what to do we're freaking out

2138
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:58,640
we don't have time to sit down and read

2139
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:01,280
this book and so um i i was reminded of

2140
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:03,600
that just kind of totally juxtaposition

2141
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,920
but it's like when you are creating a

2142
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,280
guide

2143
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:10,480
it's very difficult to like make it

2144
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,880
usable right like the map versus the

2145
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:15,040
territory like what

2146
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,719
what will people read and be able to

2147
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:18,880
take away and walk away with some kind

2148
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,360
of general understanding versus like if

2149
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:23,280
you really want to know what to do when

2150
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:24,640
you're dead in this situation you've got

2151
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,880
to read the book um you know how to like

2152
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:28,640
haunt the house and all these things and

2153
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:29,520
so

2154
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:32,080
like do do we really need to like full

2155
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,800
grip of the fvp to really sit down with

2156
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,199
the guide you know whatever like

2157
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:39,199
3 000 page

2158
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:40,320
manual

2159
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,880
or like where how do you distill the

2160
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:44,880
essence of something that's so

2161
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,960
complicated like what is it to be dead

2162
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:51,440
or what is the fep right it's hard

2163
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:54,000
that's such a good example

2164
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,159
like it's a handbook for the

2165
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:58,400
handbook for the long-lived the i guess

2166
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,400
the free energy principle as opposed to

2167
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:03,440
handbook for the recently deceased

2168
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,520
uh yeah what what is the the line that

2169
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,199
they have in that it's something like

2170
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:10,000
some incredibly dry statement which is

2171
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,920
absolutely no help at all like

2172
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,679
operational parameters vary from

2173
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:15,440
manifestation to manifestation or

2174
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,760
something and yet i mean the idea behind

2175
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,120
it was that

2176
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:20,480
the philosophers that we talked to that

2177
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,239
urged us to try and research and write

2178
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:23,679
this

2179
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:25,040
we're pointing out that when they

2180
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,800
attempted to read

2181
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,320
those papers in the active inference

2182
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,719
tradition even those that were billed as

2183
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:33,440
tutorials it was like trying to read the

2184
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,040
handbook for the recently deceased it

2185
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:37,679
was if not too long then at least too

2186
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:38,719
dense

2187
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:40,880
and they couldn't pick apart

2188
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,320
those statements because they were too

2189
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:46,080
condensed and so yeah the difficulty

2190
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,520
was

2191
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:50,960
un condensing it pulling it apart

2192
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:52,800
selecting what was necessary and then

2193
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,400
presenting it in an accessible way i

2194
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:55,199
mean

2195
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:57,040
all says that it took sort of on the

2196
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,920
order of years to do it we we sort of

2197
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:02,000
got commissioned as it were in

2198
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,960
2019 i started researching it in earnest

2199
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,960
at the beginning of 2020

2200
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,199
and the first pre it went through a few

2201
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:11,040
you know drafts and people gave us a lot

2202
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:12,239
of comments behind the scenes but the

2203
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:14,800
first preprint came out in december 2021

2204
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:15,760
so

2205
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,199
yeah it's

2206
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:19,600
for me at least and for us the authors

2207
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,120
it was that

2208
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,719
difficult to

2209
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:24,400
troll through the literature find what

2210
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,400
was necessary and then present it in a

2211
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,719
presentable way

2212
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:30,400
but that's such a great example thanks

2213
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,239
so much that hadn't crossed my mind but

2214
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:34,719
i love that film and the concept of the

2215
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:37,280
handbook as well

2216
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:40,000
so just a few comments on that it's not

2217
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,040
called free energy principle a user's

2218
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:44,080
guide

2219
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:46,960
it's actually very specific it's about

2220
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:49,120
the variational free energy and the

2221
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,960
expected free energy f and g

2222
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,560
respectively

2223
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:55,520
what's the fep

2224
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:56,960
so that's sort of

2225
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:59,920
where it takes you and it's very subtle

2226
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:01,679
then um

2227
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:03,520
that was pretty interesting handbook for

2228
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:05,920
the long lived and

2229
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:08,400
it reminded me about metacognition in

2230
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,760
learning

2231
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:12,000
and about what we expect and prefer and

2232
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,360
think we can know

2233
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:15,440
and how like just being a

2234
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:16,239
um

2235
01:19:16,239 --> 01:19:18,960
learner and like a teacher's assistant

2236
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,880
seeing how there'd be lecturers

2237
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:24,080
that would give um

2238
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:25,440
maybe it could be thought of in sort of

2239
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,600
an effort g framework another day but

2240
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,360
they would simplify

2241
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,600
and learners would have high precision

2242
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,840
on a very simple model

2243
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,000
and then other times they would um

2244
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,560
convey too much of the complexity and so

2245
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:39,920
at the end of the quarter even if the

2246
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,920
students learned a ton and

2247
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:43,600
they would still feel like lost in a

2248
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:44,880
bigger space

2249
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:47,920
and there's like good and bad aspects of

2250
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:51,840
all of that so uh

2251
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,560
i think this is kind of like a snapshot

2252
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:57,679
it's kind of cool that it is so recent

2253
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:01,440
that was only a few months ago right

2254
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:03,280
now that it's february 22

2255
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:05,520
but this is very like recent in and

2256
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,120
still kind of ongoing that you're

2257
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:09,520
looking to update it too

2258
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,280
so it's sort of like a kind of window

2259
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,639
where there's interactions with the

2260
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:14,639
community and hopefully people

2261
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:16,480
really think about it and

2262
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:18,639
um the people for whom a section isn't

2263
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:20,960
clear have an opportunity through this

2264
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:22,960
affordance we have now as scientific

2265
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:26,080
publishing with preprints like to

2266
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:28,639
ask or correct or you missed a citation

2267
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:30,880
here

2268
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:33,520
that is awesome and it's a world apart

2269
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:34,960
from sort of

2270
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:37,040
three people with it on their desk who

2271
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,199
are delaying it in review

2272
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:40,719
and then maybe they have good comments

2273
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:42,159
maybe they don't

2274
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:44,159
but here there can be something that's

2275
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:46,639
so much beyond that as this is just like

2276
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:48,239
one thing that you're working on and

2277
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:49,840
you're developing

2278
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:51,840
and then one last comment on that is

2279
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:52,639
like

2280
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:55,600
spm the textbooks are still kind of

2281
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,960
classics cult classics we might even say

2282
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:01,280
and it's not that the notation

2283
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:03,040
hasn't changed a lot because it has in

2284
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:05,840
some cases it's a snapshot

2285
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:06,880
and

2286
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,880
there's some amount of linking back to

2287
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,320
the past

2288
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,159
that's clarifying

2289
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:13,280
and then

2290
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,800
there can be an understanding that

2291
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:17,199
there's drift and focus and evolution of

2292
01:21:17,199 --> 01:21:20,080
the techniques and the spm textbook it's

2293
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,120
going to have sentences that you

2294
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,320
wouldn't include if you're writing it

2295
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:23,199
today

2296
01:21:23,199 --> 01:21:24,480
great

2297
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,080
that's why it's different but also

2298
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,760
there's something about it that helps

2299
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:30,719
inform so every snapshot that's well

2300
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:34,880
intended always is good dean

2301
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,239
yeah i think one of the other things

2302
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:37,600
that's really interesting about this is

2303
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:38,880
this

2304
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,400
stephen m has

2305
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,639
kind of pointed to the the length of

2306
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:45,440
time when the question was posed

2307
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:47,040
can you

2308
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,840
can you summarize this for us can you

2309
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,320
synopsize this for us

2310
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,840
basically what the philosophy it sounds

2311
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,199
to me is what the philosophers were

2312
01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:58,400
asking was can you go and do

2313
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,960
the figuring out and then present that

2314
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:03,679
to us in a finding out way will you save

2315
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:04,639
us

2316
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:05,600
time

2317
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:06,880
and so i think what that's one of the

2318
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,800
things we have to keep front of mind

2319
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,639
when we look at this because those

2320
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:12,800
philosophers now didn't do the two years

2321
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:14,719
of heavy lifting and searching and

2322
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:15,840
foraging

2323
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,920
there's that's a whole different aspect

2324
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:19,840
that figuring out

2325
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:22,400
is a whole different processing method

2326
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:25,360
and mechanism than the finding out

2327
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:29,040
right and so again if you want people

2328
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:32,800
if you want people to come away

2329
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,560
from guide use

2330
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,159
with more than

2331
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:38,080
the finding out they're still going to

2332
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:39,520
have to get in the field and do the

2333
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,760
figuring out themselves and it's that

2334
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,840
interaction part which

2335
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,360
thank thank goodness for blue and

2336
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,120
beetlejuice because that was again that

2337
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:49,040
was just a wicked

2338
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:52,239
example right because it the timing of

2339
01:22:52,239 --> 01:22:55,520
this the windness of this

2340
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:57,280
really really matters

2341
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,960
and i know that in a lot of educational

2342
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:01,679
settings time is at the essence right 13

2343
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:04,800
weeks x number of hours blah blah blah

2344
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,960
we tend to get that we tend to that's

2345
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,199
the only part of the oneness that we

2346
01:23:09,199 --> 01:23:11,520
focus on not

2347
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,080
should the guide or the plan be the

2348
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:17,120
thing that initiates all the action or

2349
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,960
is that the thing that falls out

2350
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,760
afterwards if we're doing figuring out

2351
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,080
it has to fall out afterwards

2352
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:25,440
not before

2353
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:28,000
and we have a really hard time

2354
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,239
with that because traditionally it's

2355
01:23:30,239 --> 01:23:31,600
always been

2356
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,719
the legitimizing of guides because

2357
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:36,400
they've been there before

2358
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:39,360
and they'll help you find out but they

2359
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,199
don't necessarily

2360
01:23:41,199 --> 01:23:44,000
help you figure out

2361
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,120
just because the amount of time

2362
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,440
yes please stephen m

2363
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:53,679
i mean yeah so both of the things that

2364
01:23:53,679 --> 01:23:55,760
you both just said daniel and mendeen

2365
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:57,760
like they're both open up huge topics

2366
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:58,560
which

2367
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:00,800
uh have so many interesting questions

2368
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,280
and so many interesting ways of

2369
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:06,239
approaching them um

2370
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:07,040
dean

2371
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,840
i i think i agree 100 with what you just

2372
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:10,719
said

2373
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:12,320
uh

2374
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:15,280
they've done the

2375
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:18,159
they're going to have to use our guide

2376
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:20,639
as a kind of shortcut in a way to doing

2377
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:23,120
that initial stuff they're finding out

2378
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,480
but

2379
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:26,719
it behooves them in a way to do some

2380
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:29,120
extra work of figuring out afterwards

2381
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:31,600
the the thing that that most sort of

2382
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,120
resonates with me

2383
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:36,639
regarding is just the idea that

2384
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:39,199
our like mandate what we had to do in

2385
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:40,880
producing this

2386
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,080
was

2387
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:44,880
give them the ability to work through

2388
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:47,760
like the examples themselves because

2389
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,120
that's a part of

2390
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,239
i mean

2391
01:24:50,239 --> 01:24:51,199
you know i'm not sure how you're

2392
01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:52,480
distinguishing these two things but to

2393
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,320
me that's a part of figuring out as well

2394
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:55,920
as just finding out

2395
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:58,480
to me we're not just saying

2396
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:01,120
this is a measure of inaccuracy

2397
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:03,440
and this is the algorithm by which you

2398
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:05,920
minimize it we're saying look at this

2399
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:08,159
example with these numbers

2400
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:10,400
you know in the imaginary situation and

2401
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,239
if you work through it and if you you

2402
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:15,120
know print out the graph yourself

2403
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:17,600
you will find that this is where the

2404
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:19,600
minimum lies for example and you will

2405
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:21,520
compare that with this other thing so

2406
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,760
we're doing the sort of the the first

2407
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,639
tiny step in helping them figure out how

2408
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:28,080
they would figure it out in a way if you

2409
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,159
see what i mean giving them the the the

2410
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:32,320
means to go ahead and do it again

2411
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:33,760
themselves in a different kind of

2412
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:34,960
situation

2413
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,719
but the sort of the other thing that

2414
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:38,239
it brings up i mean

2415
01:25:38,239 --> 01:25:40,560
i shouldn't say that you know they they

2416
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,080
like michael weisberg didn't say you

2417
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:43,440
know go and do this for me go and be my

2418
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:44,800
like research assistant for two and a

2419
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,040
half years to print this thing

2420
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:49,520
uh he along with uh peter godfrey smith

2421
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:51,360
who is another person uh not connected

2422
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,760
with the journal in that capacity but

2423
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:56,320
very interested in having this framework

2424
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,560
explained for a wider audience

2425
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:01,040
pointed out that first and foremost

2426
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:03,360
we ourselves would get some kind of like

2427
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:05,360
plaudits for having done the work having

2428
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,440
helped people to understand it so you

2429
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,360
know there was the personal selfish

2430
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,199
incentive to do it

2431
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:14,239
um but also that it would be

2432
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:15,679
something that

2433
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:18,400
would benefit the community in a sort of

2434
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,080
in a positive way not something that we

2435
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:21,760
would be giving them

2436
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:24,320
for free as it were but something that

2437
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:26,639
we would be creating for everybody to

2438
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:29,520
draw and use and just improving how the

2439
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:32,080
community approaches this question

2440
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:34,320
so in the same sense in which you know

2441
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:36,719
in in the best case academia is a

2442
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:39,120
wonderful collection of people who are

2443
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:40,960
all helping each other

2444
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:41,760
to

2445
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,239
you know find those shortcuts

2446
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:46,560
do the finding out without going through

2447
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,880
however long it takes

2448
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:50,480
to sift out

2449
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,560
the the stuff that is not necessary

2450
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:53,920
we're all helping each other to do that

2451
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:55,040
you know i can read somebody else's

2452
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,400
paper who is working for two years or

2453
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,000
something completely different and

2454
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,280
having

2455
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:00,719
split up that

2456
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:01,600
labor

2457
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:03,360
divided that labor up we can both sort

2458
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,120
of benefit from it

2459
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:06,080
um

2460
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,159
sorry i'm going on far too long now no

2461
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:09,679
no no one i'm only answering one

2462
01:27:09,679 --> 01:27:11,280
question one last thing about the

2463
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:13,360
minimum of two things if we could get

2464
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:16,320
you you and connor heinz

2465
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,880
into a live stream i think my mind would

2466
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:22,159
be blown just because that math and this

2467
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:24,960
philosophy in one proximal

2468
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:26,719
location because that that to

2469
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:28,480
triangulate off that

2470
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,000
would be

2471
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,120
amazing

2472
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:32,800
because that's essentially what you have

2473
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,080
to do you have to put the finding out

2474
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:36,080
and figuring out together

2475
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,520
i don't think again i don't think it's

2476
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,760
one or the other i think it's our

2477
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:41,360
ability to sort of be able to hold up

2478
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:44,080
both at once and appreciate how each of

2479
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:47,840
those things fills in the picture

2480
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:50,159
yeah and i do want to thank you you

2481
01:27:50,159 --> 01:27:52,159
should tell me when i should uh stop or

2482
01:27:52,159 --> 01:27:53,120
you know please just jump in and

2483
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:55,440
interrupt me anytime but you know i just

2484
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,040
wanted to sort of respond to your points

2485
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:58,480
as well um

2486
01:27:58,480 --> 01:27:59,840
the other good thing since i'm in an

2487
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:02,639
optimistic mood about academia uh like

2488
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:04,719
you say the kind of pre-publication

2489
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:06,000
pre-print

2490
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,679
sending it out and enabling people to

2491
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:10,000
give us comments back on it

2492
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,600
if you think about it like is that

2493
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:13,920
metaphor with going into a classroom and

2494
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:15,920
teaching before you go in and teach you

2495
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:18,320
have to pair away all of the nonsense

2496
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:20,320
the stuff that's too complex get it down

2497
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:21,520
to the level that's simple enough so

2498
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:23,040
they can understand but has enough

2499
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:25,040
information so they can actually learn

2500
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:26,800
something

2501
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,400
in the really good case of getting a

2502
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,480
kind of course evaluation you do a whole

2503
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:32,480
course you get a bunch of students tell

2504
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:33,840
you what was right what was wrong with

2505
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:36,560
what went too fast what went too slow

2506
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:37,920
you know and hopefully there's a kind of

2507
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:39,600
average where it averages out and you

2508
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,719
improve it sort of next time you make it

2509
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:44,639
easier for the learners because the

2510
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:45,679
learners

2511
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:47,520
have told you what was right and what

2512
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:48,960
was wrong about it it's always that kind

2513
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:50,880
of feedback process obviously in real

2514
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:52,480
life situations

2515
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,000
it doesn't always work that well getting

2516
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,880
that kind of feedback um but if you're

2517
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:59,600
sort of lucky enough to start off from a

2518
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,600
decent point as i think we have at this

2519
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:02,800
paper

2520
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:05,440
you can

2521
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:09,679
you can get to a kind of point which

2522
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:11,840
once it is snapshotted because that's

2523
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:13,679
the other important thing i think that

2524
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:15,440
this kind of pre-publication peer review

2525
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:17,199
is really useful but the

2526
01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:18,719
there shouldn't be constantly evolving

2527
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:19,920
documents all the time there should be

2528
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:21,760
some kind of snapshots once it's

2529
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:24,639
snapshotted it's like it's as good as it

2530
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:26,159
can be at that time

2531
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:28,080
even if it becomes redundant eventually

2532
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:29,760
even if it uses language which won't be

2533
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,920
used in 10 20 years

2534
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:33,600
once it becomes something that people

2535
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,719
can refer to valuably for some kind of

2536
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:38,639
certain amount of time afterwards that's

2537
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:40,239
really the best that you can hope for so

2538
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:41,120
you know

2539
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,719
certainly for you know just a paper this

2540
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:45,199
is just a paper it's nothing

2541
01:29:45,199 --> 01:29:47,840
uh more than that really

2542
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:50,080
just one thought on that like on the

2543
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,760
finding out and figuring out connecting

2544
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:54,960
that to the peer review it's almost like

2545
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,719
we're all co-learners

2546
01:29:56,719 --> 01:30:00,400
in participatory engaging education

2547
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,000
so we want to make it easier for the

2548
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,920
learners which is us

2549
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:06,320
and we're all co-learners so sometimes

2550
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:07,679
we find out

2551
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:09,600
that would be somebody with more domain

2552
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,280
expertise

2553
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:13,360
giving us the feedback on the paper and

2554
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:14,960
then in the side channel maybe there's

2555
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:16,239
another time and place where it's a

2556
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:17,040
different

2557
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:18,960
roles not relationship but like and then

2558
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,560
there's the figuring out and then maybe

2559
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:22,239
there's other things here too that's

2560
01:30:22,239 --> 01:30:23,360
actually

2561
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:26,080
um not like feedback from the bottom up

2562
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:28,719
but beginners questions

2563
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:31,360
abductive logic applications adversarial

2564
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:34,719
or contrarian even questions that is

2565
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:37,679
always like what is active inference

2566
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:39,360
why does f matter

2567
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:40,719
um what

2568
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:42,159
does the fpp have to do with active

2569
01:30:42,159 --> 01:30:44,320
inference

2570
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:45,360
what does

2571
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:46,639
evolution have to do with natural

2572
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:48,000
selection what does natural selection

2573
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,520
have to do with drift

2574
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:52,159
if those were not resolved

2575
01:30:52,159 --> 01:30:53,120
then

2576
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:55,280
they're going to be some open ones in

2577
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:56,960
this area as well

2578
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:58,400
and i think there is also another

2579
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:01,280
analogy with sort of like

2580
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:04,719
uh in a um concordance with evolutionary

2581
01:31:04,719 --> 01:31:05,600
theory

2582
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:08,000
and like darwin's dangerous idea done it

2583
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,400
in 95 that type of book

2584
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:12,400
um perhaps has already or soon will be

2585
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,800
written for something like fvp because

2586
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,960
it has that same ability to like spawn

2587
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:18,320
an adjective

2588
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,800
and then re-integrate the adjective back

2589
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:22,880
into the corpus so it was like there was

2590
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,639
like evolution of this type and then

2591
01:31:24,639 --> 01:31:26,560
people add like a modality or a

2592
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:29,760
sub-domain or a new word and then it

2593
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:32,159
joins the main thread so we have like

2594
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:34,239
deep affective

2595
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:36,719
sophisticated contrastive dot dot but

2596
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:38,400
it's going to reintegrate

2597
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:39,760
because

2598
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:42,080
it will be versioning and that

2599
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:44,000
returns to like blue's point about what

2600
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,040
is core

2601
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:46,639
what isn't and how will that change and

2602
01:31:46,639 --> 01:31:48,800
so

2603
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:51,520
and then you just kind of close the loop

2604
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:52,719
with the snapshotting but the

2605
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:54,560
recognition of the process

2606
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:57,199
but we have to make the static

2607
01:31:57,199 --> 01:31:59,199
modification in the niche but of course

2608
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:01,280
it's a process so

2609
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:04,080
it's really um

2610
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:08,400
interesting where we've gone today

2611
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:12,920
yes stephen m and then s

2612
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:15,040
oh yeah just very quickly uh

2613
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:16,639
i think the point about contrarian

2614
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:18,239
questions is a very

2615
01:32:18,239 --> 01:32:21,920
good one um it's often

2616
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:24,480
philosopher's main method of figuring

2617
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:25,600
something out

2618
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,120
beginning with

2619
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:28,560
the contrarian question that is

2620
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:30,719
uppermost in their mind going out and

2621
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:32,480
trying to find the answer to it

2622
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:36,239
and certainly in this case um on my side

2623
01:32:36,239 --> 01:32:37,920
when i was doing my part

2624
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:41,360
of writing the paper um

2625
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:43,920
i was starting with

2626
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:46,480
what on earth is this maths

2627
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:48,480
and what is the interpretation of these

2628
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,480
different components of it

2629
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:51,600
um

2630
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,120
and that was just for the for the maths

2631
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,320
when you get on to the sort of

2632
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:55,920
philosophy side the interpretation the

2633
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:57,040
dialectic

2634
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:58,639
i mean one thing i haven't said is that

2635
01:32:58,639 --> 01:33:00,719
there are some quite skeptical portions

2636
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:01,600
of

2637
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:04,080
this paper you probably you know noticed

2638
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:05,600
when you read it and

2639
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,040
we tried to you know pull back a little

2640
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:09,120
bit but what we wanted to do was

2641
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:10,159
provide

2642
01:33:10,159 --> 01:33:12,880
fuel for figuring out

2643
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:14,639
and you always want to try and do that

2644
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:16,480
in good faith you know you always want

2645
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:18,560
to do it in a way that's not combative

2646
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:20,080
or dismissive

2647
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:22,639
you want to do it in a way that is

2648
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:24,880
uh

2649
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:27,679
designed to help you and the person that

2650
01:33:27,679 --> 01:33:29,040
you're asking

2651
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:32,639
come to a consensus about the answer

2652
01:33:33,199 --> 01:33:36,960
thanks steven okay steven s yeah i i

2653
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:39,360
really find this helpful this

2654
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:42,080
fortuitous use of the term guide because

2655
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:45,199
you chose that title which maybe

2656
01:33:45,199 --> 01:33:46,880
if you weren't doing a pre-print maybe

2657
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,159
pete i noticed people a bit more

2658
01:33:48,159 --> 01:33:51,360
creative with the titles which um

2659
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:53,760
then that's maybe also a nice benefit

2660
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:55,920
but by going there this discussion has

2661
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:58,320
been really helpful i'll be i often hear

2662
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:00,480
people when they talk about the findings

2663
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:01,840
from research that oh we're going to

2664
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:04,080
roll out a toolkit we'll do a tool kit

2665
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:05,520
and then when they talk about a guide

2666
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:08,239
it's really a sort of a guide a guide to

2667
01:34:08,239 --> 01:34:10,080
teach the tool kit

2668
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:12,560
and but here the the what in a way

2669
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:13,760
you're looking at especially if you're

2670
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:16,719
getting into the more

2671
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:19,600
deeper tacit knowledge is what's the

2672
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:22,639
guiding principles to being a modeler

2673
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:24,639
what's it about being a model and that's

2674
01:34:24,639 --> 01:34:26,960
where well these kind of conversations

2675
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:29,199
are useful but i think that

2676
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:31,199
the the type of

2677
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:33,280
stuff that's been brought up here are

2678
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:34,560
things where

2679
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:35,600
you know

2680
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:37,760
they're not resolved down to a toolkit

2681
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:38,800
level

2682
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:41,920
but it opens a question for someone to

2683
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,320
have a conversation about and so i just

2684
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:46,400
thought i'd mention that and

2685
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:47,760
what your thoughts are about that

2686
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:48,960
challenge of

2687
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:51,280
someone becoming

2688
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:53,040
a practitioner

2689
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:56,159
rather than necessarily an academic

2690
01:34:56,159 --> 01:34:59,159
disseminator

2691
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:07,040
yeah it's tough because i'm really not

2692
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:08,800
sure

2693
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:11,040
in part because

2694
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:13,600
all that i'm sort of

2695
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:16,719
trying to be right now is

2696
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:19,119
an academic disseminator

2697
01:35:19,119 --> 01:35:20,639
so i would have to shift into a sort of

2698
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:22,080
different gear to think about what it

2699
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:23,679
would mean to be a

2700
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:26,560
practitioner um

2701
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:29,920
i mean i i would start by asking

2702
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:31,920
you what you

2703
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:34,800
take being a practitioner to be and then

2704
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:36,159
see if i can you know

2705
01:35:36,159 --> 01:35:39,679
resonate with something in that

2706
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:42,639
well for me it's um

2707
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:46,320
it's more contextual and it's more about

2708
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:50,159
being able to adapt and

2709
01:35:50,159 --> 01:35:53,679
evolve based on a situation

2710
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:56,239
and often you find the practitioner work

2711
01:35:56,239 --> 01:35:59,040
is when you're in a face-to-face

2712
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:01,520
performative context in a way where you

2713
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:03,360
have to perform

2714
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:05,440
either the the dialogue i suppose in

2715
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:07,280
science when you're in the field of

2716
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:08,639
practice

2717
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:10,400
in other areas it could be

2718
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:13,040
the performance of giving a performance

2719
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:16,239
um be a performance as a as a teacher

2720
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:17,840
could be a performer being an actor

2721
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:18,800
being a

2722
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:19,760
um

2723
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:22,960
a workshop facilitator being a therapist

2724
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:26,800
being whatever that might be

2725
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,040
and i suppose that that that question

2726
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:30,000
about

2727
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:33,679
how something being a guide

2728
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:35,199
a toolkit

2729
01:36:35,199 --> 01:36:37,040
or some way

2730
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:38,639
to access

2731
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:40,080
um

2732
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:41,840
the sort of heuristics and ways of

2733
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:43,040
knowing which aren't even

2734
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:45,679
representational in the kind of

2735
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:48,000
the way that we can easily externalize

2736
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,040
so i suppose there's some of that

2737
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:50,480
there's stuff that we can't take a

2738
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:53,280
perspective on directly because we can't

2739
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:55,600
necessarily encode it into artifacts and

2740
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:58,239
place them in our environment in words

2741
01:36:58,239 --> 01:37:00,320
however

2742
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,000
that knowing

2743
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,760
is a skillful practice

2744
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:06,960
that has been sort of cultivated so i i

2745
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:08,960
kind of feel there's there's a need for

2746
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:10,320
that and there's a there's a big move

2747
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:12,080
towards that now with

2748
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:14,639
um the world trying to embrace

2749
01:37:14,639 --> 01:37:16,320
transdisciplinarity

2750
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:17,840
participation

2751
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,280
complexity

2752
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:22,080
where you have no way to make any sort

2753
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:24,239
of movement forward without the ability

2754
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:25,119
to

2755
01:37:25,119 --> 01:37:29,040
to find other ways to hold the meaning

2756
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:32,480
dean

2757
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,400
just to just to sort of piggyback on

2758
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:36,960
stephen i think i think

2759
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:39,679
if you want to try to draw a comparison

2760
01:37:39,679 --> 01:37:42,080
if you're a disseminator the result can

2761
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:45,040
often be something like a desire line

2762
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:47,040
a wearing in a following

2763
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:48,719
and if you're looking at the generative

2764
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:51,119
model you're looking at a densifying

2765
01:37:51,119 --> 01:37:52,719
at a foraging

2766
01:37:52,719 --> 01:37:55,280
and then a an accumulation

2767
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:57,840
and in that in that respect it's it's

2768
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:01,440
quite clear what from a practical

2769
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:03,360
one one's not better than the other but

2770
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:05,600
one results in quite a different

2771
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:07,920
result than the other as something to

2772
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:10,080
think about

2773
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:10,960
and then

2774
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:13,360
one other thought on this um

2775
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:15,280
practitioner and scientist

2776
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:17,199
though i hope we see

2777
01:38:17,199 --> 01:38:19,440
a hundred times more and more different

2778
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:21,440
ways to learn and apply active inference

2779
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:24,800
just total first thought would be like

2780
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:26,080
when stephen was describing a

2781
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:27,600
practitioner

2782
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:31,040
contextual and adapting on situations

2783
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:34,000
with really lower levels of control

2784
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,480
it's on a continuum but like a crisis or

2785
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:38,239
a transition moment or adversarial

2786
01:38:38,239 --> 01:38:39,600
scenario

2787
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:41,600
has a lot of an implicit factor and it's

2788
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:43,920
not always as focused on like the

2789
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:46,800
coolest calmest most collected

2790
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:50,080
stigmargic artifact modification it's

2791
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:51,440
more like

2792
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:53,760
the firefighting was done appropriately

2793
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:57,280
in that scenario given what it was

2794
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:59,440
and then the scientist generates niches

2795
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:01,760
like epistemic niche laboratory niche

2796
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,040
computer niche

2797
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:05,840
that allows them to generate scenarios

2798
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:07,280
where they can

2799
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:09,280
apply distributions and then when they

2800
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:10,880
apply the distributional methods where

2801
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:12,159
there shouldn't be a distributional

2802
01:39:12,159 --> 01:39:13,679
method

2803
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:15,119
it's going to be

2804
01:39:15,119 --> 01:39:17,440
unfortunately a silent error most the

2805
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:18,639
time

2806
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:20,940
because of how

2807
01:39:20,940 --> 01:39:23,040
[Music]

2808
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:25,280
little paid attention to

2809
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:27,679
all these differences are

2810
01:39:27,679 --> 01:39:30,480
so stephen m

2811
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,719
yeah this is

2812
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:35,920
really

2813
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:38,880
tricky to think about i mean i

2814
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:41,840
i think i agree that knowing

2815
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:43,760
ought to be considered a kind of

2816
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:45,600
skillful practice

2817
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:47,440
that was one thing that you said uh

2818
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:48,800
stephen that i

2819
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:51,040
really sort of jumped out at me

2820
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:53,920
uh in part as being not sufficiently

2821
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:55,760
emphasized elsewhere certainly not

2822
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:57,600
sufficiently emphasized in the tradition

2823
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:00,480
of philosophy that i come from there

2824
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:02,800
there tends to be a fairly clear

2825
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:04,560
distinction between

2826
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:06,159
knowing in terms of representational

2827
01:40:06,159 --> 01:40:07,760
knowledge and

2828
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:11,280
knowing how in terms of skill and

2829
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:13,360
there's not that often

2830
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:16,480
the consideration of

2831
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:17,679
the kinds of things we would usually

2832
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:19,840
consider representational knowledge as

2833
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:22,320
underpinning a kind of skillful practice

2834
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:23,280
but

2835
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:26,000
when i think about the way that

2836
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,280
i'm thinking about

2837
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:29,679
philosophy conferences and the kinds of

2838
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:32,080
conversations that go on it's pretty

2839
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:33,840
clear to me that having a conversation

2840
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:35,199
with somebody else

2841
01:40:35,199 --> 01:40:37,440
about a topic that is so sort of steeped

2842
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:38,480
in

2843
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:40,400
law and

2844
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:42,239
intellectual

2845
01:40:42,239 --> 01:40:44,719
recognition and texts as having a

2846
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:46,719
philosophy conversation is what it

2847
01:40:46,719 --> 01:40:49,520
requires is a kind of skill a kind of a

2848
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:52,000
smooth a kind of automatically picking

2849
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,080
out the topics as you go along

2850
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:56,719
not sort of sitting back and thinking

2851
01:40:56,719 --> 01:40:58,639
very hard on your own before coming back

2852
01:40:58,639 --> 01:41:00,080
30 minutes later and responding to the

2853
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:01,440
things that your interlocutor has just

2854
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:02,400
said

2855
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:04,719
it's it has all the hallmarks of a skill

2856
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:06,880
as far as i can see

2857
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:09,360
and what happens is

2858
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:11,600
well the the way that

2859
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:13,600
i have been brought up to view it is you

2860
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,280
do all your thinking at home you do all

2861
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:16,800
your thinking in the armchair and then

2862
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:17,760
when you come out to have the

2863
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:19,520
conversation you're ready with that

2864
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:20,639
skill

2865
01:41:20,639 --> 01:41:22,960
because you've done all of that

2866
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:24,000
slow

2867
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,239
solitary work first the kind of

2868
01:41:26,239 --> 01:41:28,320
propositional or representational kind

2869
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:30,480
of work then when you're ready you come

2870
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:34,879
out and you practice discussing it

2871
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:40,159
thanks great point it's a lot like the

2872
01:41:40,159 --> 01:41:41,679
representational

2873
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:44,800
dimension is kind of the non-linear

2874
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:47,360
knowledge model which is cannot be

2875
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:50,480
conveyed in a linear sequence linear

2876
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:54,400
presentation in video and in writing is

2877
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:55,840
rhetoric

2878
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:56,880
and

2879
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:58,960
that was one of the most interesting

2880
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:00,400
areas

2881
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:01,920
in the paper was like the claims

2882
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:04,320
justification the whole second part

2883
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:06,880
and i'm happy that we spent

2884
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:08,560
almost all the dot zero and our

2885
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:10,080
conversation

2886
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:11,520
leading up to it

2887
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:13,360
because there's a whole paper and it

2888
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:15,199
sounds like it there's so much more to

2889
01:42:15,199 --> 01:42:17,119
explore

2890
01:42:17,119 --> 01:42:18,400
but like

2891
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:21,199
the part about the rhetoric

2892
01:42:21,199 --> 01:42:22,800
and the way that people

2893
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:25,199
not just have an edge in their knowledge

2894
01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:26,960
graph their armchair knowledge graph or

2895
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:29,679
their relational database not just an

2896
01:42:29,679 --> 01:42:32,560
edge between concepts but actually

2897
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:35,280
when a question is raised to move to

2898
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:38,400
that answer first or the first topic

2899
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:39,920
that's mentioned

2900
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:41,600
like if somebody asks what is a markov

2901
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:42,560
blanket

2902
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:44,400
the first

2903
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:45,520
noun

2904
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:47,360
what is it going to be

2905
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:48,960
well for a cell

2906
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:50,239
or is it

2907
01:42:50,239 --> 01:42:52,239
because of bayesian

2908
01:42:52,239 --> 01:42:55,440
or what is the actual first rhetorical

2909
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:57,280
node that somebody gives

2910
01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:00,000
and those kinds of knowledge

2911
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,440
like representations are really

2912
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:03,199
interesting too

2913
01:43:03,199 --> 01:43:04,480
it's not even just that it's the most

2914
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:05,920
important thing because that's not how

2915
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:08,400
people always structure their speech

2916
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:12,000
so like there's both sides we need the

2917
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:15,520
non-linear part so that we can actually

2918
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:18,400
build a bigger structure than just an

2919
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:19,360
oral

2920
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:21,040
script

2921
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:22,480
but then

2922
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:24,960
it has to be in that like run time that

2923
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:27,040
you kind of described at the philosophy

2924
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:29,360
conference

2925
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:31,600
it has to be presented in a linear way

2926
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:34,159
and if there weren't disagreements or um

2927
01:43:34,159 --> 01:43:35,840
like contrast in people's perspective

2928
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:36,719
then

2929
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:38,159
they would just be reading off the same

2930
01:43:38,159 --> 01:43:40,400
book

2931
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,600
so maybe

2932
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:45,600
we'd love to hear your thoughts on

2933
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:47,360
any of these

2934
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:49,760
latter sections in four

2935
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:53,040
like which one of these areas of claims

2936
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:54,320
we won't

2937
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:56,880
stay long but just

2938
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:59,280
what of the areas of claims

2939
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:00,960
or the relationships between areas was

2940
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:02,800
interesting to you or like

2941
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:05,600
you learned while reading about it

2942
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:07,199
because you had the justifica

2943
01:44:07,199 --> 01:44:09,520
justificatory links between dialectical

2944
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:11,920
categories with mathematical empirical

2945
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:13,440
in general

2946
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:15,679
so maybe just one edge or one section of

2947
01:44:15,679 --> 01:44:19,480
those what did you find interesting

2948
01:44:26,239 --> 01:44:27,600
oh was that an open question or you're

2949
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:31,679
asking me i wasn't sure i guess to you

2950
01:44:33,119 --> 01:44:35,119
uh i mean i can definitely start with

2951
01:44:35,119 --> 01:44:38,159
the first section which was the

2952
01:44:38,159 --> 01:44:41,440
mathematical to empirical direction

2953
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:43,920
uh and as you said we

2954
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:45,440
for each edge of the triangle we were

2955
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:47,280
only sort of considering one direction

2956
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:51,520
mainly for considerations of space

2957
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:53,360
what's most interesting to me about this

2958
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:54,960
is just that it is an established

2959
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:56,960
research field

2960
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:59,679
called computational cognitive science

2961
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:01,840
when when the specific math that is

2962
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:03,840
being looked at is certain kinds of

2963
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:05,040
neural networks or other kinds of

2964
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:06,880
computational systems and the specific

2965
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:08,480
empirical system that is being looked at

2966
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:11,360
is the brain especially the human brain

2967
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:13,360
and what we really wanted to emphasize

2968
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:15,840
in this section was that the kinds of

2969
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:17,520
tools that have already been developed

2970
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:19,679
by computational cognitive science so

2971
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:21,440
that includes the models and the

2972
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:24,480
explanatory tools and the justificatory

2973
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:26,239
or inferential tools

2974
01:45:26,239 --> 01:45:29,040
could be applied to active inference

2975
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:31,199
models as well so this was our attempt

2976
01:45:31,199 --> 01:45:33,040
to say

2977
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:35,679
to the philosophers we already have

2978
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:36,960
some

2979
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:38,320
equipment

2980
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:39,679
we can use

2981
01:45:39,679 --> 01:45:42,400
when what we're trying to do is evaluate

2982
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:45,719
active inference

2983
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:51,119
so whether we call it deflationary or

2984
01:45:51,119 --> 01:45:53,040
not there's a lot of

2985
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:54,320
relevance in

2986
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:57,040
emphasizing which parts are specific to

2987
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:59,280
active inference and which ones aren't

2988
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:02,159
like bringing action into the loop

2989
01:46:02,159 --> 01:46:03,199
is not

2990
01:46:03,199 --> 01:46:05,760
a novelty in the last 15 years

2991
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:07,360
doing bayesian statistics doing

2992
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:09,920
variational inference and so that work

2993
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:12,480
helps us really highlight

2994
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:14,239
the parts that do have unique and

2995
01:46:14,239 --> 01:46:15,920
different interpretations

2996
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:18,880
like this is definitely one of um

2997
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:20,480
my favorite paragraphs i think that

2998
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:21,760
we've come across and gotten the

2999
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:24,960
highlight on the discussions like

3000
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:27,520
and then you even brought it up that

3001
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:30,639
it's actually in the distillation

3002
01:46:30,639 --> 01:46:33,040
there is a novel

3003
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:33,920
um

3004
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:35,920
not just implicit knowledge or

3005
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:39,199
notational connection but a rhetorical

3006
01:46:39,199 --> 01:46:42,159
element that arises and then also one

3007
01:46:42,159 --> 01:46:43,840
with like educational and didactic

3008
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:44,960
implications so that's really

3009
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:47,600
interesting dean

3010
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:49,119
yeah and i think when i was reading a

3011
01:46:49,119 --> 01:46:50,880
paper stephen i noticed the number of

3012
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:52,960
times you had the word evaluate evaluate

3013
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:55,199
evaluate which again is another one of

3014
01:46:55,199 --> 01:46:56,159
those

3015
01:46:56,159 --> 01:46:59,440
do you get does this pass past muster

3016
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:00,320
pass

3017
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:03,760
a standard pass what goes what goes on

3018
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:05,520
and what gets held back

3019
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:07,679
what gets continued

3020
01:47:07,679 --> 01:47:10,320
attention and what do we now ignore and

3021
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:11,760
that's why i like when you were talking

3022
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:12,880
earlier about

3023
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:14,320
well when we put a guide together we

3024
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:16,159
just want to basically walk into the bar

3025
01:47:16,159 --> 01:47:19,040
and make sure that the 98

3026
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:20,480
things that we

3027
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:23,440
really can't pay attention to first that

3028
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:25,119
that doesn't pass

3029
01:47:25,119 --> 01:47:28,080
what does pass are maybe these two

3030
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:30,239
these two first nascent

3031
01:47:30,239 --> 01:47:31,600
ideas

3032
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:34,239
and so again i

3033
01:47:34,239 --> 01:47:36,159
you don't need to even hear this but if

3034
01:47:36,159 --> 01:47:38,719
you want a just a factory link

3035
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:42,239
that is one right there in real time in

3036
01:47:42,239 --> 01:47:45,280
terms of what what what carries on what

3037
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:46,880
can we build off of

3038
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:48,960
and what falls away

3039
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:51,199
because it doesn't it doesn't seem to

3040
01:47:51,199 --> 01:47:54,080
pass whatever evaluate evaluative

3041
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:55,119
methods

3042
01:47:55,119 --> 01:47:57,760
we've implied but then again that goes

3043
01:47:57,760 --> 01:47:58,639
to

3044
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:00,800
when do we start evaluating from the

3045
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:02,639
from the moment we started do we want it

3046
01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:04,320
to be something a little bit more

3047
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:06,480
creative and hold that thing open a

3048
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:10,799
little long before we jump to assessment

3049
01:48:13,119 --> 01:48:14,400
okay so

3050
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:17,520
in the last just few minutes yeah

3051
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:19,440
stephen do you want to give a response

3052
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:20,960
there or would you like to have a little

3053
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:23,920
bit of a closing statement

3054
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:25,199
uh

3055
01:48:25,199 --> 01:48:26,560
let me give a quick response which is

3056
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:28,480
just that i agree exactly with what you

3057
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:32,480
said dean and um

3058
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:34,080
yeah we wanted to show that some things

3059
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:36,639
could be evaluated very directly

3060
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:38,960
just by working through the numbers

3061
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:40,800
and that gives some directions for how

3062
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:42,480
other things could be evaluated and

3063
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:43,840
you're right it's like passing it's sort

3064
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:44,480
of

3065
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:46,320
how a philosopher evaluates a scientific

3066
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:48,800
theory as being sort of in a sense

3067
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:49,600
uh

3068
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:51,520
first level plausibility or first level

3069
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:53,520
acceptability how it passes that it's

3070
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:54,880
it's kind of a philosopher's technical

3071
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:58,000
term um but i can sort of give

3072
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,880
a kind of closing statement uh that uh

3073
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:02,159
calls back to what you just mentioned

3074
01:49:02,159 --> 01:49:04,800
daniel that paragraph which is just that

3075
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:08,000
the the thing that i'm thinking about

3076
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,480
uh most often when i think about active

3077
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:12,400
inference right now is the

3078
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:15,280
interpretation of p in

3079
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:16,239
the

3080
01:49:16,239 --> 01:49:18,239
expected free energy function

3081
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:20,800
and the sense in which it can have

3082
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:22,800
a probabilistic interpretation as well

3083
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:24,800
as an interpretation of a kind of

3084
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:26,800
preference that is the thing which i

3085
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:28,800
really want to try and get to the bottom

3086
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:31,440
of again just by working with very very

3087
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:33,679
simple models try and throw some numbers

3088
01:49:33,679 --> 01:49:34,800
around

3089
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:36,719
try and intuitively grasp what that

3090
01:49:36,719 --> 01:49:40,239
model can represent we have one in there

3091
01:49:40,239 --> 01:49:42,320
with the example of the cap but i want

3092
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:44,639
to try and expand it a little bit

3093
01:49:44,639 --> 01:49:45,030
um

3094
01:49:45,030 --> 01:49:46,080
[Music]

3095
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:47,199
yeah i'm glad that you like that

3096
01:49:47,199 --> 01:49:48,480
paragraph

3097
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:50,480
because it's the thing that is causing

3098
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:52,080
me the most uh

3099
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:53,440
it's the thing that's itching the most

3100
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:57,760
that i'm attempting to scratch right now

3101
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:00,560
all right so we'll each give a closing

3102
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:02,320
thought so just

3103
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:04,080
what did people enjoy

3104
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:05,679
what would they look forward to talking

3105
01:50:05,679 --> 01:50:06,960
about next week

3106
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:09,599
so stephen select first

3107
01:50:09,599 --> 01:50:11,520
well just thank you a lot for a really

3108
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:14,880
great engaging conversation and uh

3109
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:18,000
lots of insights i i'm really interested

3110
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,679
in that idea of

3111
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:22,320
the ps

3112
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:23,599
so

3113
01:50:23,599 --> 01:50:26,080
i think that's very interesting and i'd

3114
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:27,840
be interested in how that maybe applies

3115
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:30,719
both on the um

3116
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:33,599
on the sensory side and the action side

3117
01:50:33,599 --> 01:50:36,400
so how much is the probabilities

3118
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:39,280
and preferences for sensing

3119
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:43,040
as much as or is it that one is more for

3120
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:45,760
sensing ones more for action but uh very

3121
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:48,320
interested in all of that so thank you

3122
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:50,159
very much and

3123
01:50:50,159 --> 01:50:54,159
look forward to more conversations

3124
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:58,159
okay dean or blue

3125
01:50:58,480 --> 01:50:59,760
i'll go ahead

3126
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:00,719
um

3127
01:51:00,719 --> 01:51:02,560
so thanks for entertaining all my

3128
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:05,040
interrogations i appreciate it um if

3129
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:06,639
you're going to come back next week i

3130
01:51:06,639 --> 01:51:09,199
would encourage you to check out um a

3131
01:51:09,199 --> 01:51:11,040
tale of two densities because like on

3132
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:12,639
the tail of steven with the p's and the

3133
01:51:12,639 --> 01:51:15,199
q's i'd be curious to to

3134
01:51:15,199 --> 01:51:16,960
think about or hear what your

3135
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:19,199
interpretation of that is and if you

3136
01:51:19,199 --> 01:51:20,560
would um

3137
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:22,239
maybe change or maybe you will i mean

3138
01:51:22,239 --> 01:51:23,599
it's just a pre-print so maybe you have

3139
01:51:23,599 --> 01:51:26,239
a versioning affordance to kind of

3140
01:51:26,239 --> 01:51:29,280
consider that in your explanation in the

3141
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:30,880
beginning i'm curious

3142
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:32,840
or if you think it's one of these

3143
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:36,560
superfluous extra components that is

3144
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:37,920
um for

3145
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:40,159
the handbook for the recently deceased

3146
01:51:40,159 --> 01:51:43,040
not necessarily you know like the 13

3147
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:44,639
steps of dying

3148
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:46,800
or whatever

3149
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:48,639
so i'd be curious to hear to hear what

3150
01:51:48,639 --> 01:51:51,440
you have to say about that

3151
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:54,960
dean anything

3152
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:57,119
yeah it's just that i don't i don't want

3153
01:51:57,119 --> 01:51:59,040
this to drop down to the sort of quantum

3154
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:01,280
level but i think that when you're doing

3155
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:04,880
a guide it's hard not to

3156
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:07,920
sort of try and juggle both the dynamic

3157
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:09,280
aspects

3158
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:11,440
of what you're trying to share and the

3159
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:13,360
stable aspects of what you're trying to

3160
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:14,800
share you want the

3161
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:16,560
you want the screwdriver to remain

3162
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:18,800
robust and constant and then you want it

3163
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:20,880
to also be able to

3164
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:22,639
be manipulated in such a way that it

3165
01:52:22,639 --> 01:52:24,639
drives the screw and there's a dynamic

3166
01:52:24,639 --> 01:52:26,960
and a stability piece to this this

3167
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:29,119
guiding that's really really hard as you

3168
01:52:29,119 --> 01:52:31,679
say square i don't know that it can be

3169
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:33,199
squared i think it i think they both

3170
01:52:33,199 --> 01:52:35,360
have to be maintained and so

3171
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:37,599
my sense is is that i

3172
01:52:37,599 --> 01:52:39,119
i didn't know

3173
01:52:39,119 --> 01:52:40,639
what you were going to do in terms of

3174
01:52:40,639 --> 01:52:42,480
the guiding but i think the way that you

3175
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:46,080
laid it out did slow things down

3176
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:47,920
did allow the the teeth of the

3177
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:50,320
screwdriver to get set

3178
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:52,080
and then you could actually do something

3179
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:53,840
dynamic with it

3180
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:56,400
so really appreciate that and maybe

3181
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:59,119
maybe next week we can talk about

3182
01:52:59,119 --> 01:53:00,480
when the screwdriver is used for

3183
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:02,080
creative purposes other than driving

3184
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:05,440
screws because i think what the math

3185
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:06,960
if we use the

3186
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:08,639
geometry and the statistics and the

3187
01:53:08,639 --> 01:53:11,280
philosophy all in one

3188
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:13,679
concoction i think that's the basis or

3189
01:53:13,679 --> 01:53:15,440
the minimum that we have then to be able

3190
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:17,840
to be do creative things and not just

3191
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:20,000
recombinatorial things so maybe we can

3192
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
touch on that i would be really curious

3193
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
to hear how you see this going off in

3194
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:27,119
creative ways without going and because

3195
01:53:27,119 --> 01:53:29,280
the big fear people have is that just

3196
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:31,280
means destabilization

3197
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:34,320
where i'm saying it has to start from

3198
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:38,719
both stable and the potential to move

3199
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:43,519
thanks dean stephen any last thoughts

3200
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:47,520
just to thank you all very much for

3201
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:49,440
engaging with our paper for inviting me

3202
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:52,000
on the stream for asking me really great

3203
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,760
questions and raising great points that

3204
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:55,520
just had never crossed my mind this is

3205
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:57,040
exactly the reason why i was hoping to

3206
01:53:57,040 --> 01:54:00,000
do this um i am going to try and come

3207
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,520
back next week i can't make any promises

3208
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:03,040
right now because next week is a bit of

3209
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:04,480
a heavy week for us but

3210
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:06,159
just yeah the

3211
01:54:06,159 --> 01:54:07,520
the prospect of going and reading that

3212
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:09,119
paper and then just being able to

3213
01:54:09,119 --> 01:54:11,119
respond in a more intelligent way to

3214
01:54:11,119 --> 01:54:12,960
please question is making me really want

3215
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:15,199
to do it not to mention all of the other

3216

3217
