00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,960
welcome to the active inference lab

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,439
we are a participatory online lab that

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,840
is communicating learning and practicing

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,440
applied active inference

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,280
you can find us at the links here on

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,800
this slide

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,719
this is a recorded and an archived live

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,480
stream so please provide us with

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,360
feedback so that we can improve our work

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,520
all backgrounds and perspectives are

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,239
welcome here and we'll be following good

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,800
video etiquette for live streams feel

to see our past and upcoming streams

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,400
we're here today in

31
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,680
stream number 37.2 it's our

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,840
third stream after the dot zero

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,720
background video and the dot one

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,200
group discussion we had on the paper

35
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,720
free energy a user's guide by man payne

36
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,439
and kirchoff from 2021

37
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,479
and

38
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,640
today we have a few things written

39
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,320
there's a couple sections of the paper

40
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,119
that we didn't get to last time

41
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,320
and

42
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,079
i'm sure everyone has

43
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,520
brought some interesting thoughts and of

44
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,680
course if you're watching live please

45
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,439
feel free to add any questions or

46
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,119
comments into the live chat because

47
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,680
we'll definitely have time to address

48
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,840
anything there

49
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,000
we'll start with a introduction and warm

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,280
up so

51
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,880
we'll say hi

52
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,320
mention anything that we're excited to

53
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,680
talk about today

54
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,000
something that we liked or remembered or

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,199
reviewed about the paper this past week

56
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,360
anything that we're wondering about and

57
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,640
as we just

58
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,200
mentioned before we began like

59
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,440
what does a dot two for

60
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,599
a guide look like

61
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,120
so um

62
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,959
i'm daniel i'm a researcher in

63
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,239
california

64
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,520
and i'm gonna

65
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,280
think while others are speaking and then

66
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,000
return to what the dot two can be and

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,840
i'll pass it to

68
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,920
stephen

69
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,400
hello i'm stephen i'm in toronto

70
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,720
um stephen sillett i uh

71
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,040
i'm doing a practice-based phd

72
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,440
around social topographies and how they

73
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,760
can be used in community development and

74
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,239
theater for development and uh

75
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,319
yeah i'm looking forward to looking at

76
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,840
some of the implications of how this

77
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,239
might be rolled out in

78
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,480
different types of context

79
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,238
i'll pass this over today

80
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,000
uh i'm dean i'm in british columbia at

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,879
the moment and

82
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,599
as with all things uh guide related i'm

83
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,680
always interested in how we

84
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,599
translate from the word

85
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,000
to the deed getting getting from a place

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,120
of

87
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,040
of information

88
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,120
that's curated to

89
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,440
actions that are also maybe curated

90
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,879
based on that

91
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,720
a bit of information and i'll pass it to

92
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,720
blue

93
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,519
sorry i lost my mute button i'm blue i'm

94
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,239
a research assistant or

95
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,720
research consultant in new mexico

96
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,319
transported back to my grad school days

97
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,920
i had like a mute button loss a time

98
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,640
warp all at the same time um

99
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,959
i'm excited to get into the sections of

100
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,519
the paper that we um didn't really

101
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,640
discuss like in particular like using

102
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,360
mathematics to validate empirical claims

103
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,480
or justify empirical claims and um

104
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,200
also kind of zooming out and evaluating

105
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,799
this work from

106
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,519
the perspective of a guide um and like i

107
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,120
think about the hitchhiker's guide and

108
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,959
like don't panic and like what are the

109
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,200
things that we really like need what are

110
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,399
the essential components of the fep

111
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,160
um and active inference that that we

112
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,399
need to communicate to others uh and

113
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,680
i'll pass it back to daniel who's going

114
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,440
to tell us what adoption really is

115
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,880
well

116
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,759
what it really has been

117
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,320
is the

118
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,440
far side of the bathtub

119
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,680
the dot zero we're kind of dropping into

120
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,360
the skating rink

121
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,560
and then

122
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,080
in the dot one there's an opening and we

123
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,919
explore and last week was an awesome

124
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,600
discussion we got to speak with the

125
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,280
first author

126
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,360
and now we

127
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,280
continue

128
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,520
but also

129
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,040
recollect some of the threads that we

130
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,960
opened and build inertia towards where

131
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,680
we

132
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,759
take it next and i think

133
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,280
there's almost

134
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,880
no genre

135
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,280
more appropriate for a dot 2 than the

136
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,039
guidebook like you put down in dean's

137
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,280
car manual metaphor like

138
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,400
you don't hold that up when you're

139
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,320
driving and so

140
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,039
papers similarly they engage our regime

141
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,320
of attention

142
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,600
transiently

143
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,000
you're not supposed to only be looking

144
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,880
at the paper so we're going to put this

145
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,800
paper down

146
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
we're going to end this video eventually

147
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,360
and then what will be left with us how

148
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,120
will our generative model

149
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,199
have been updated

150
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,840
so that our policy selections are

151
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,400
different whether they're mental action

152
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,520
policies

153
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,280
related to attention

154
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,039
or metacognition or whether they're

155
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,240
physical

156
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,919
action policies

157
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:50,720
so

158
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,479
i guess it relates to that

159
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,840
quintessential

160
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,840
dot two question

161
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,000
of moving from the word of the paper

162
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,039
that we're

163
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,560
engaging in

164
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,400
in our discussions

165
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,199
to the deeds and what are those

166
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,720
deeds

167
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,840
and then

168
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,600
it's almost like this is an

169
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,639
action-oriented framing

170
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,680
of

171
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,319
a dot two or of just what we're up to

172
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,759
today

173
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,840
and then there's

174
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,479
this

175
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,479
asynchronous or not temporally binding

176
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,000
element of

177
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,680
which is raised by the paper though of

178
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,680
what are the essential components

179
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,080
of fep and active and also the

180
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,720
differentiation perhaps between the

181
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,520
conceptual and the pedagogical

182
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,960
like

183
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,720
are the pieces

184
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,400
that are the minimal

185
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,880
kernel of fep and active

186
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,080
is that where we is that page one

187
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,840
on the guide

188
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,919
how does education

189
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,759
which is going to be the trajectory of a

190
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,280
learner

191
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,880
relate to

192
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,919
the theoretical apparatus which is kind

193
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,160
of like a a building or some sort of

194
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,759
structure that doesn't necessarily have

195
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,160
a trajectory like format

196
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,120
so maybe just to return to this question

197
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,800
though of the word and the deed

198
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,160
in the dot one

199
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,919
we heard about

200
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,560
what the target audience was from the

201
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,400
author's perspective

202
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,639
for this paper

203
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,080
which was um it's a special issue um

204
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,840
it's a topical collection

205
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,840
called the free energy principle

206
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,800
from

207
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,960
biology to cognition

208
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,800
and we heard a little bit about how the

209
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,000
editor

210
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,599
made a request

211
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,080
of the authors to

212
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,919
write this

213
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,919
special piece

214
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,479
and they also summarized it in their

215
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,840
last aim

216
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,680
we aim to increase

217
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,080
philosophical understanding

218
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,680
of active inference

219
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,879
so that it may be more readily evaluated

220
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,319
so within the philosophical domain

221
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,800
so that it can be evaluated

222
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,759
but

223
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,840
what other domains

224
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,599
or

225
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,599
ideas are important here then what are

226
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,400
these

227
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,080
actions so philosophers might be

228
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,840
interested in reading this so that they

229
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,879
can better

230
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,120
philosophically evaluate but

231
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,479
what are the

232
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,440
idea to deed

233
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,080
pipelines that we're interested in or

234
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,319
opening up here steven and then anyone

235
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,399
else

236
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,880
one of the aspects that

237
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,440
this this paper talks about is

238
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,399
how much things can be screened off how

239
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,760
much

240
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,279
it gives us latitude to separate out

241
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,120
realistic empirical interpretations from

242
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,720
um the modeling

243
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,480
of

244
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,440
and

245
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,279
i think that's a feature they also talk

246
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,360
about and i'll be interested in what

247
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,800
others think about this but they talk

248
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,279
about the markov blanket is giving this

249
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,959
opportunity to screen

250
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,600
or screen out what's inside and outside

251
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,040
and

252
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,120
i wonder how

253
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,959
this idea of screening because screens

254
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,440
are not the same as a wall it's not it's

255
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,440
not walling off

256
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,080
but as come up on the twitter

257
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,880
conversation with casper hesp this week

258
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,360
this idea of leakage like if i have a

259
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,880
screen

260
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,800
i've got a blind here as i described

261
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,279
earlier and there's some leakage through

262
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,040
the blind right

263
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,440
um but is even that idea of screening

264
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,560
off

265
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,640
a little bit passive

266
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,440
i'm curious about that a little bit dead

267
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,839
anyway

268
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,760
yeah if there weren't

269
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,760
statistical dependencies between

270
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,720
internal and external states

271
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,880
like if there were two states that

272
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,440
were just not even there was no path

273
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,040
from here to there

274
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,120
there wouldn't even be able to be

275
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,320
blanket states partitioned out

276
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,480
so internal and external states are

277
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,320
conditionally independent

278
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,399
upon the blanket states

279
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,839
using the narrow pearl 1988 sense of

280
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,720
markov blanket

281
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,680
but

282
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,640
there is a channel there is a path

283
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,160
from the internal to the external state

284
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,839
again otherwise they wouldn't even be

285
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,240
part of the same click in that part of

286
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,640
the bayesian graph

287
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,839
um

288
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,560
and then also yes stephen

289
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,000
yeah so that this this this click this

290
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,519
question of how much

291
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,560
we

292
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,120
need to

293
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,440
find purchase through

294
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,040
that blanket

295
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,880
and the screening off and how much we

296
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,800
can get away with

297
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,320
more broadly thinking about the free

298
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,040
energy principle and inference and

299
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,200
how that can be stepped up and down

300
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,440
depending on

301
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,399
where we are in terms of empiricism and

302
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,399
trying to make claims

303
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,360
um themes to feature a lot in this paper

304
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,200
um and i'm i'm i'm sensing that

305
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,279
because they're they're sort of arguing

306
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,560
in a way that as long as you can get

307
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,880
functional

308
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,079
functional correlations

309
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,279
then

310
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,079
how you get at them

311
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,000
be that approximate

312
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,320
isn't necessarily

313
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,279
about it being the real world that gives

314
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,160
you it

315
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,040
there may be different ways to arrive at

316
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,560
something

317
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,040
that's approximately

318
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,880
youthful and i think that speaks the

319
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,720
dynamical systems over traditional

320
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,560
systems in the sense that

321
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,079
i can have

322
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,079
a system which isn't the real system but

323
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,720
if my system flips or the regime shifts

324
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,399
in similar ways to the target

325
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,200
as opposed to it actually being it and

326
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,279
and and having the right types of values

327
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,079
in it

328
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,800
in itself it's more about what's the

329
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,440
what's the way that i start to see

330
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,480
my uncertainties flip from one belief to

331
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,000
another

332
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,720
if the if the way the belief updating

333
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,680
happens

334
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,279
is still approximately useful enough

335
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,200
for something to happen

336
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,200
that's viable

337
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,800
then that is

338
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,240
still okay

339
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,240
and i'm wondering if that isn't possible

340
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,399
in normal systems work which isn't

341
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,760
dynamical systems work

342
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,680
let's

343
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,600
look at the

344
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,079
order and kind of trace the trails of

345
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,200
the authors so in the early example

346
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,600
we had just the case of perceptual

347
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,399
inference which was first introduced in

348
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,519
the exact base context and then we moved

349
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,600
into the variational base

350
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,800
caprents

351
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,160
and we had w

352
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,680
world states

353
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,440
unobserved

354
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,120
that's the actual temperature in the

355
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,000
room

356
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,399
x observed data that's the reading on

357
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,760
the thermometer

358
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,200
so this is the

359
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,320
um simplest

360
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,440
bayesian latent or hidden state model

361
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,240
so

362
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,600
is there a markov blanket here

363
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,220
asking for a friend

364
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,000
[Laughter]

365
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,720
no because there's only two notes so

366
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,079
there cannot be

367
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,160
a partitioning between internal and

368
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,480
external states conditioned on a third

369
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
note they're sort of um it's kind of

370
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,399
like the minimum two but now we're

371
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,560
taking to like minimum three you can't

372
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,959
have a blanket an intervening or an

373
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,839
intermediating or a state which makes

374
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,959
two others conditionally independent

375
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,120
unless you have three three's a crowd

376
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,800
three's a party

377
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,600
now

378
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,360
in figure three

379
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,000
there's the basic model of action so we

380
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,600
still have the same definitions and

381
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,199
meanings of w

382
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,120
unobserved world states

383
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,959
and x observations those observations

384
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,279
are now being passed to the agent

385
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,160
and indeed they were implicitly being

386
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,240
passed to the agent above

387
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,920
if there would have been a third node

388
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,199
agent there

389
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,279
it could have been said that the x was a

390
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,519
markov blanket but as it's exactly

391
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,240
written there isn't

392
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,279
now

393
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,720
here

394
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,560
what are the blanketing states

395
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,880
x and z

396
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,079
if you

397
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,600
are conditioning upon x and z it makes w

398
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,160
and the agents conditionally independent

399
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,680
and this is sort of presaging the

400
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,399
fristen partition on the markov blanket

401
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,440
which is to split up the notion of the

402
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,639
total set

403
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,120
of intermediating or

404
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,120
conditionally independent ising states

405
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,000
no

406
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,959
markov to pearl epoch

407
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,560
and showing them in a way that's

408
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,360
partitioned into incoming from the

409
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,720
asians perspective

410
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,399
statistical dependencies which can be

411
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,959
interpreted as sensory states or the

412
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,519
observation of model data

413
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,120
and then outgoing statistical

414
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,440
dependencies z

415
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,199
z action you select

416
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,079
and then those can have some influence

417
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:24,880
on

418
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,800
world states

419
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,639
yes stephen

420
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,720
you know you say outgoing statistical

421
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,480
dependencies and that's also interesting

422
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,320
because it's is it at some point the

423
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,880
outgoing

424
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,920
cannot

425
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,199
be statistical alone because you you

426
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,120
don't have the same kind of

427
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,480
information

428
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,600
availability so it tends to be more

429
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,800
using energy and

430
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,600
sort of least action type approaches so

431
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,440
that would be

432
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,880
i'm sort of preempting that but that's

433
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,880
where it starts to split out later but

434
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,800
they they don't get bogged down in that

435
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,120
at this stage they they

436
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,920
keep it all in the sort of bayesian

437
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,920
environment

438
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,360
not exactly sure what you mean since

439
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,160
these arrows represent not mechanistic

440
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,959
or

441
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,959
causal influence but just statistical

442
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,839
dependencies in the

443
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:22,480
graph

444
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,920
yeah i was thinking more when that

445
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,360
becomes action

446
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,120
uh when it's then translated to be

447
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,600
action so then

448
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,399
um

449
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,680
rather than sensory which has much more

450
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,440
sort of informational

451
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,839
content

452
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,040
action can be seen as being more

453
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,720
about

454
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,920
what is more energy efficient

455
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,399
or starts to look at more

456
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,959
the shape of

457
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,719
the way that action happens

458
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,000
i'm wondering whether that is

459
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,360
uh

460
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,280
needed to be concerned about

461
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,599
if it were a software agent

462
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,400
then

463
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,880
these are both informational

464
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,319
really

465
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,319
and no matter what type of agent we're

466
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,439
modeling

467
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,679
it's still just a statistical dependence

468
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:18,400
okay

469
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,439
then

470
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,359
you brought up questions about energy

471
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,799
expenditure

472
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,039
during action and that's one of the

473
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,720
pieces that

474
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,160
is sometimes

475
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,919
challenging to parse out

476
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,600
which is like

477
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,640
um

478
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,840
first looking at variational free energy

479
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,120
minimization

480
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,000
so this is on the perceptual side we're

481
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,080
looking at the instantaneous fitting of

482
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,000
a variational model

483
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,640
of ongoing sensory information

484
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,880
given the priors

485
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,480
that doesn't mean that

486
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,600
for for example an organism it's the

487
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,640
lowest energy possible interpretation

488
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,480
of the sensory data

489
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,679
and then when we

490
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,280
bring action into the picture and look

491
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,600
at expected free energy

492
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,280
neither does this mean

493
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,679
that the z that is selected is the

494
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,520
laziest

495
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,520
it just means that this g is being

496
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,840
minimized

497
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,799
and

498
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,720
so it's not the gibbs free energy or the

499
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,280
calories that are being minimized it's

500
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,280
something informational that has to do

501
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,320
with model fitting

502
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,360
yes go for it yeah now that that that

503
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,000
definitely makes sense um and one thing

504
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,919
carl fristan mentioned in um the

505
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,160
symposium we did is there's there's kind

506
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,240
of two boundaries there's kind of two

507
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,080
boundaries happening in terms of

508
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,400
markovian boundaries there's one coming

509
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,320
in and there's one going out

510
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,919
and the blankets kind of got both of

511
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:46,799
those

512
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,000
boundaries

513
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
happening so like you said yeah it's

514
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,799
it's

515
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,679
the way that then the inference happens

516
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,720
to know what actions to take

517
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,720
is different but the way that

518
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,240
information

519
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,000
is

520
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,760
established

521
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,600
is for sure different

522
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
going through each of those as i mean as

523
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,440
it is with every mode

524
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,000
of sensory data that comes in because it

525
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,520
could be vision it could be here and it

526
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,720
could be

527
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,320
a kinesthetic

528
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,960
so you've got different types of input

529
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,960
and you've got different types of output

530
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,080
but there

531
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,440
and in this diagram at the moment it's

532
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,200
keeping both of those there's no idea of

533
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,520
leakage or

534
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,360
of those questions about how things leak

535
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,080
across between it's like there's there's

536
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,600
two distinct

537
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,360
blows going on

538
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,840
but that and it simplifies in that sense

539
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:44,960
yes

540
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,240
um

541
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,039
[Music]

542
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,480
we've seen other

543
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,039
topologies of perception cognition in

544
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,320
action like an edge connecting sense and

545
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,679
action states

546
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:56,480
or

547
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,080
an arrow that's

548
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,760
having a statistical dependency the

549
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,880
other way okay but just to return here

550
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,280
yes dean go for it

551
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,480
this is a question for everybody here so

552
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,120
stephen the first author

553
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,120
talked about the fact that sort of the

554
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,440
back story of this whole guide thing was

555
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,400
to

556
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,240
and i'm putting words into it but i want

557
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,159
to keep it reasonably short i talked too

558
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,840
much last week

559
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,159
he basically wanted to be able to remove

560
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,960
some of the impediments and he pointed

561
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,520
directly at some of the math

562
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,799
that acted as a maybe a kind of a

563
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,720
a bridge too far

564
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,840
and so he wanted to make that a simpler

565
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,840
um

566
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,880
maybe something that's more

567
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,559
user-friendly

568
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,640
and therefore something that people will

569
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,039
take up or adopt and when you're putting

570
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,400
on this um

571
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,600
when you're putting up this slide here

572
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,200
now daniel

573
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,640
i don't know

574
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,080
whether i know it eventually will be

575
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,000
translated into the math formalisms you

576
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,640
just point you had them up a minute ago

577
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,240
but i'm not really sure whether the

578
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,559
evaluation aspect that philosophers

579
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,919
are going to

580
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,760
then decide whether something is worthy

581
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,880
of their

582
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,039
their continued attention or not i'm not

583
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,880
sure if that i don't

584
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,919
how does this critical path critical and

585
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,280
evaluation being related in this context

586
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,360
how does this

587
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,360
minimize or reduce

588
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,240
the impediment nature of what the math

589
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,320
is like if we're gonna we're gonna guide

590
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,760
somebody through this and their and

591
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,559
their one of their hopes is to be able

592
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,880
to say okay well i'm not just

593
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,640
making this stuff up there's actually

594
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,760
some

595
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,320
some way of being able to formalize this

596
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,600
how does that

597
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,360
through this kind of

598
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,280
first step

599
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,600
become

600
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,840
become easier i guess in terms of what

601
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,919
the actual formula says because i know

602
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,400
that when i first actually touched on

603
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,120
the formulas myself

604
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,919
it didn't go back to a critical path

605
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,720
like there was no real physical example

606
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,720
i could find in the world and i think

607
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,320
maybe that's what helped me understand

608
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,840
that maybe

609
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,400
this this thinking or this ability to

610
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,600
think statistically sorry

611
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,320
to think statistically maybe that

612
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,679
requires as carl also said

613
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,840
our ability to

614
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,240
do the math we have to be able to do the

615
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,400
math and the math doesn't get simple so

616
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,679
i'm wondering what people think about

617
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,840
that

618
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,919
okay stephen if you have a direct

619
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,480
response yeah yeah well i think that um

620
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,400
in some ways this goes back to a little

621
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,640
bit before where the math was it helps

622
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,799
us see why the math was put in at

623
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,240
certain points

624
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,400
by going to even a stage earlier so i

625
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,240
think there is some use in that because

626
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,400
i think like you say

627
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,080
um

628
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,159
there is a slight inflation in the way

629
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,000
that the process theory then gets

630
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,600
interpreted and if it's already locked

631
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,919
in too much in what's given to us with

632
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,679
all the math it's like well where did

633
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,919
that math come from and and then that

634
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,840
starts to get us involved in some of

635
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,240
these earlier questions because what's

636
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,240
interesting here is

637
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,400
see the blanket

638
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,880
i think of the blanket often as

639
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,159
as a method for transfer

640
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,799
it's a mode for transfer just a bit like

641
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,520
lithographic blankets transfer from an

642
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,960
analog roller to a blanket roller um to

643
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,159
a printed image and to the paper it's

644
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,280
transferring now it's it also does mean

645
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,320
that

646
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,280
there's no direct contact between paper

647
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,640
and

648
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,880
um

649
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,520
paper and printing plate right

650
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,760
so it's screened off as well but it

651
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,400
depends which way it's gone at you know

652
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,279
um

653
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,720
and

654
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,039
in this case here with these red circles

655
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,159
it's useful to think about okay well

656
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,799
there's there's something that's been

657
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,400
inferred

658
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,320
from the world

659
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,279
um

660
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,679
but that influence isn't directly

661
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,360
accessible it's

662
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,880
it's not

663
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,520
that observed data

664
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,080
isn't coming in as

665
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,270
data it's coming in as um

666
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,520
[Music]

667
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,039
what's inferred to be

668
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,480
about what's out there

669
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,039
which isn't the same as a signal

670
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,880
so it's like how much is the agent

671
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,000
able to have the environment transfer

672
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,640
something onto them and transfer

673
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,480
something onto the environment and how

674
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,080
much are they screened off from

675
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,600
the environment how much is the

676
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,279
environment screened off from them i

677
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,880
suppose that's

678
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,400
that's something that relates to that

679
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,960
hey thanks

680
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,679
so

681
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:54,640
dean

682
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,960
you asked how does the yes you wanna go

683
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,480
for it first

684
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,159
no go ahead and then i'll just follow up

685
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,640
both you and stephen okay so you asked

686
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,880
how does the critical path the linear

687
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,720
pedagogical path that is traced by this

688
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,320
version of this guide

689
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,080
reduce the actual or perceived

690
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,159
impediments

691
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,159
in an audience specific or in a general

692
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,520
sense

693
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,640
so it definitely helps us see where math

694
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,720
could or should or does or will enter

695
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,080
the picture

696
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,320
i think it sets up an aboutness of the

697
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,600
math like

698
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,640
what is perception about

699
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,360
this is a graphical interpretation

700
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,919
graphical meaning visual but also

701
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,279
like a network

702
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,039
bayesian graph

703
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:39,919
and so

704
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,039
if you're concerned with a different

705
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,320
connectedness

706
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,760
of terms

707
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,559
this is not the math you're looking for

708
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,559
but on the perception side if this is

709
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,400
kind of how you're setting up

710
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,159
the template for what you're wondering

711
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,640
about like what's out there that's what

712
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,440
this first image shows with wnx

713
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,600
what's out there

714
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,919
and how do i act or how does an agent

715
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,400
act that's the aboutness

716
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,080
which is not unique to active inference

717
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,480
that's control theory cybernetics etc

718
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,440
the stepwise guide element

719
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,000
it reminds me i hope it's not unrelated

720
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,320
in high school cross country

721
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,159
the coach would say something like well

722
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,840
the race is going to start and you gotta

723
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,120
get out there fast and then it's the

724
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,240
middle is the part where you need to be

725
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,919
running and going hard then at the end

726
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,279
you gotta push it and finish and run

727
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,720
hard and everything

728
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,000
and i was like

729
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,360
you could have just said run the whole

730
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,679
time was it not the same thing as saying

731
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,400
run at the beginning middle and end and

732
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,919
so

733
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:40,960
but

734
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,200
run really hard during the whole race

735
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,120
i don't know coach

736
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,320
a whole race is a long time to run

737
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,120
here by breaking it into really

738
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,400
specific

739
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,559
stepwise changes to the math like a

740
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,960
piecewise defined function

741
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,960
there's an opportunity to pace and lead

742
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,480
a learner

743
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,919
and then

744
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,200
to

745
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,360
accumulate or pause

746
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,120
for

747
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,120
divergence or prediction error that

748
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,960
they're experiencing

749
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,159
like maybe before this first train stop

750
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,159
someone has a question about that or

751
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,279
maybe

752
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,440
just graphically when action enters the

753
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,880
picture somebody has a question about

754
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,919
that

755
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,840
now we could be talking about

756
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,000
equations symbolic equations that

757
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,720
describe the w to x relationship

758
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,240
or the agent to z to w relationship and

759
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,640
then this paper is going to propose just

760
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,360
one symbolic expression or several

761
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,000
symbolic expressions

762
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,640
that today we call octave inference

763
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,399
approach to

764
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,080
addressing that question but it builds

765
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,279
up the aboutness in a stepwise way

766
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,200
that even though

767
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,279
it is conceptually no different than

768
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,279
just saying here's the action perception

769
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,720
loop and the equations which is pretty

770
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,880
much what every fap paper does but by

771
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,919
starting somewhere a lot more atomic it

772
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,320
allows the stepwise addition of the math

773
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,399
in a way that's incremental rather than

774
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,960
like here's the apparatus

775
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,559
and that leaves much of it implied dean

776
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,640
yeah and i wouldn't disagree with

777
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,000
anything you're saying there because i

778
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,399
but i do think that there's a not too

779
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,200
subtle difference between step wise

780
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,679
and then the kind of step function the

781
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,760
leaving of the critical path

782
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,120
and now

783
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,000
seeing

784
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,399
seeing a set of mathematical formalisms

785
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,960
around a statistical distribution and

786
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,799
i'm just wondering

787
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,880
how that transition occurs because it

788
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,919
doesn't seem like there's a natural ramp

789
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,840
from following

790
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,399
something clockwise or counterclockwise

791
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,679
to being able to change things into

792
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,440
um

793
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,039
alphanumeric

794
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,039
um

795
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,279
ratios

796
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,360
which is essentially what the statistic

797
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,880
when the when it's written out

798
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,880
statistically what that does right the

799
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,720
sum and the and the and the ratio so

800
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,520
if if if the impediment was

801
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,080
some of the um

802
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,399
non-frequent math

803
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,240
and i'm not i'm not critiquing in any

804
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,159
way what steven's

805
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,880
written out here in his guide but

806
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,840
it seems like there's

807
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,919
still some assumption on the author's

808
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,240
author's plural part

809
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,919
that

810
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,440
you will be able to take enough from

811
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,559
this critical path representation to see

812
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,559
what it looks like when you're

813
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,320
over fitting like i like that there was

814
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,720
a lot of explanation of what overfitting

815
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,440
is and then there was plunk and here's

816
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,679
the formula that that

817
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,520
that that um

818
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,200
that overfitting

819
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,960
um

820
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,360
looks like in in mathematical form so

821
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,600
it's kind of a big assumption that the

822
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,000
the person who's reading this is going

823
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,320
to be able to make that leap go from

824
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,039
this level of walking clockwise or

825
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,279
counterclockwise to now suddenly being

826
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,640
able to

827
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,799
understand what all of those different

828
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,799
symbols in that formula means

829
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,799
i'm not i'm not saying it can't be done

830
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,360
but i'm just wondering how

831
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,080
how as people who are trying to lay out

832
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,720
something in a kind of step step

833
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,159
progression

834
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,200
how they

835
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,039
assume that they can just sort of put

836
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,840
holds into that big wall and people

837
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,320
still don't have a fear of heights

838
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,760
right like it's still it's still better

839
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,600
than not having a ladder

840
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,480
but

841
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,200
but it doesn't mean i want to go up 40

842
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,320
feet without safety right just because

843
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,320
it's there and i kind of see that in

844
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,480
terms of how the transition works

845
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,520
between

846
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,880
this kind of sim this this

847
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,279
um this form of representation and then

848
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,200
what the representation looks like in

849
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,519
the math that's a big leap i think for a

850
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,080
lot of people

851
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,200
thanks dean stephen

852
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,480
yeah and one i suppose one danger that's

853
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,480
always present when

854
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,200
naming things is

855
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,360
and they then move into this with with

856
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,679
the predictive processing

857
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:16,640
um

858
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,840
discussion you know how much can you

859
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,320
name things as being data

860
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,399
in these contexts so it becomes

861
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,760
statistical but like you say um

862
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,559
the

863
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,360
there is effectively

864
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,919
information coming in

865
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,440
but

866
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,519
data in some ways

867
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,679
may be a bit of a tricky word to use

868
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,640
because data kind of

869
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,159
implies an in

870
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,840
inherent um

871
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,039
representational nature and they talk

872
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,240
about this in the paper a little bit of

873
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,480
that tension between something that's in

874
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,000
is coherent enough and can be

875
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,159
represented and something where you

876
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,159
can't ever quite get at that the

877
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,640
inference the predictive processing

878
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,720
has to then

879
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,039
leverage something like generative

880
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,760
models using the body etcetera to even

881
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,919
get at the uh

882
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,559
that that that that um

883
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,200
to allow that arrow to be

884
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,080
something in a much more fuzzy way you

885
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,880
know

886
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,840
um and uh so there was always that risk

887
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,039
of

888
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,120
leading people astray even at this early

889
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,120
stage

890
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,279
so a few

891
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,519
comments there

892
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,200
gene you asked like how do we get from

893
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,360
this graphical layout so we've taken the

894
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,480
first

895
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,360
bite

896
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,440
which is this is

897
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,159
roughly the correct topology for

898
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,240
thinking about problems of perceptual

899
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,440
inference and action inference

900
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,240
that

901
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,440
is

902
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,799
if someone re

903
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,840
imagines this

904
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,760
amazing but this is just

905
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,000
the approach to perception cognition and

906
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,919
action and impact

907
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,360
that is a common kernel of a phrasing

908
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,120
now

909
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,080
let's just

910
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,000
think about it as an example rather than

911
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,559
just the um abstraction let's just say

912
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,679
that we're interested in

913
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,159
listening to a cat

914
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,200
and then inferring what its location is

915
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,519
so we're only talking about this simpler

916
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,000
w and x connection

917
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,279
first

918
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,240
so

919
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,720
here's what the empirical data are

920
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,080
four two one and three

921
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,000
you could have a model of decision

922
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,640
making on x that just says the cat is

923
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,240
always in the kitchen

924
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,080
just i don't care i'm okay with being

925
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,080
wrong the cat's in the kitchen

926
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,519
um or someone could say the cat's always

927
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,399
in the bedroom or i flip a coin

928
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,240
or i go with what

929
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,480
some other person told me like there's

930
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,640
many ways to make a decision

931
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,519
about world states conditioned on data

932
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:58,320
one

933
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,000
principled approach

934
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,760
which they right here

935
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,279
one famous method for solving this

936
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:06,080
problem bayesian conditionalization

937
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,760
so that's the question which is framed

938
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,239
normatively here about one what one

939
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,679
ought to do

940
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,280
is

941
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,440
integrate their beliefs

942
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,040
which can be empirically grounded that's

943
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,839
parametric empirical base

944
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:22,399
upon incoming data

945
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:23,918
so first

946
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,320
in this case the next little tiny step

947
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,280
is

948
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,679
we can use bayes theorem

949
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,399
to look at inference on external states

950
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,399
given incoming data

951
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,159
again if someone disagrees with using a

952
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,760
bayesian approach an exact basing

953
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,359
approach

954
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:43,040
that's the time to speak their piece

955
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,719
this is a very

956
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,000
simple

957
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,239
example with like kind of the minimum

958
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,520
two by two matrix if it was any

959
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,918
thinner of a model on any dimension like

960
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:55,839
if there was only a kitchen

961
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,599
then the question of location inference

962
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,400
would be trivial it's in the kitchen

963
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,400
if there was only one sound

964
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,200
equally it would be um a trivial problem

965
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,800
because the sound would then be

966
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,960
uninformative from an information theory

967
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,240
perspective which they're not bringing

968
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,160
up here yet

969
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,839
about location

970
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,320
then the next tiny step and then dean is

971
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,160
to go from the exact bayesian approach

972
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,640
the parametric bayesian approach

973
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,520
to

974
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,560
variational caprents which is

975
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,560
imagine that this was not just two by

976
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,359
two table but there was

977
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,599
a higher dimensional state space of

978
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,119
observations

979
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,720
and so it's not going to be possible to

980
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,720
just look at this in a spreadsheet or on

981
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,160
a piece of paper

982
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,720
but it's actually

983
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,640
a large model

984
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,079
and so we need

985
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,480
tractable heuristics

986
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,880
and so that is the next tiny step from

987
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,800
now we're going to take not just a

988
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,880
principled approach to treating the w to

989
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,160
x relationship

990
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,960
bayesian perceptual inference but we're

991
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,680
gonna go beyond that and ask what's a

992
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,160
tractable and reasonable approximation

993
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,760
variational inference

994
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,359
there's other

995
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,599
situations where maybe there's another

996
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,720
tractable approach like mcmc

997
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,119
markov chain monte carlo that's another

998
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,000
approach

999
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
which we've talked about in other cases

1000
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,599
that's the pointillism sampling based

1001
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,040
approach it works really well for

1002
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,960
certain problems it doesn't work as well

1003
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,800
for other problems and so that's the

1004
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,480
next little tiny step we're going to go

1005
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,000
from this setup of perception to using

1006
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,720
bayes theorem you could do otherwise and

1007
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,480
then from using exact or parametric

1008
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,480
empirical base to using variational

1009
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,480
bayesian approaches and again you could

1010
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,760
do otherwise dean and then steven

1011
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,400
yeah and again all i all i'm i think i'm

1012
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,000
pointing out is that i

1013
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,920
for some it isn't a tiny little step

1014
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,480
but i don't think it's a ramp going from

1015
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,560
one version of representation

1016
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,760
to foursquare version of representation

1017
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,599
to formulaic

1018
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,000
version of representation i think for

1019
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,079
people who see the math maybe as an

1020
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,280
impediment

1021
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,440
to their further continuation

1022
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,440
of using the

1023
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,040
the potential of the

1024
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,880
the free energy

1025
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,680
principle maybe they aren't such small

1026
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,160
steps they certainly aren't ramps

1027
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,119
in terms of how we interpret each of

1028
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,359
those three particular ways of

1029
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:26,320
representing information there's no ramp

1030
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,119
there's actually an actual transition

1031
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,800
moving from from

1032
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,880
what you've got on the screen now to the

1033
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,359
60 40 50 50

1034
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,280
way of being able to interpret that way

1035
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,599
of representing the information

1036
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,960
to the one that has an equal sign

1037
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,839
they're very very different right like i

1038
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:49,040
mean i understand the relativity piece

1039
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,200
and all the and i i see that carrying

1040
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,359
throughout this is what relatively

1041
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,839
relativity looks like this way and then

1042
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,880
this way and then this way but i think

1043
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,560
i think the struggle for people who are

1044
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,640
putting guides together is the

1045
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,359
assumption that what's little for you

1046
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:06,720
is little for me

1047
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,640
it isn't always that way now i'm not i

1048
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,800
don't know if we can fix in that here in

1049
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,320
these labs but

1050
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,599
i don't think it's something that we

1051
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,960
should assume

1052
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,359
is necessarily once one small step for

1053
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:20,880
humankind

1054
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,400
because i think the reason why the

1055
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,079
authors were asked to

1056
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,079
put two years worth of work in this in

1057
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,520
the first place

1058
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,079
was because the math is acting as an

1059
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,400
impediment now do you start with the

1060
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,880
math because i agreed with stephen last

1061
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,880
week when he said this is the direction

1062
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,440
we took we decided to slow

1063
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,079
things down not simplify

1064
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,000
but slow things down so i really

1065
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,920
appreciate why they've done what they've

1066
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,359
done but if they

1067
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,200
knew going in that they're going to have

1068
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,720
to go slow

1069
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,079
then they're probably going to see

1070
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,400
whether or not that bump

1071
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,040
as we change representations

1072
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,560
is actually

1073
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,200
relatable to the previous

1074
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,920
version or form that the relationship

1075
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,720
was

1076
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,240
was presented as

1077
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,320
and i don't know that people necessarily

1078
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,599
do like

1079
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,359
blue is going to have to have say on

1080
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,880
this too but she mentioned the

1081
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,400
arbitrariness

1082
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,359
of something that doesn't update

1083
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:20,160
right and so it doesn't retain its form

1084
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,200
and should we just assume that we all

1085
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,240
saw

1086
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,240
the the morphology in the same way it's

1087
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,040
it's

1088
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,359
it's tricky uh i'm just gonna leave that

1089
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,520
that tricky because i'm not sure

1090
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,520
anybody that's putting a guy together

1091
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,920
necessarily has the

1092
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,760
the perfect way of being able to deliver

1093
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,240
it

1094
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,399
okay thanks blue and then see

1095
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,400
so something that that i think is

1096
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,400
interesting is the mathematical

1097
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,520
um

1098
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,640
interpretations have like philosophical

1099
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,320
underpinnings almost or maybe it's the

1100
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,720
other way around so

1101
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,800
when you're looking at like for example

1102
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,599
this

1103
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,440
difference between a probability

1104
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,760
distribution and a preference

1105
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,640
distribution like if the cat

1106
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,640
is in the kitchen 75 of the time you can

1107
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,880
just assume there's like the underlying

1108
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,440
assumption that it prefers to be in the

1109
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,640
kitchen

1110
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,119
most of the time right like so

1111
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,880
because that's where the food is or or

1112
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,520
whatever so

1113
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,480
and similarly like in homeostasis if i'm

1114
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,400
at 37 degrees celsius that's my

1115
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,839
temperature

1116
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:39,119
if i'm there 95 of the time

1117
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,119
you can assume that i have a preference

1118
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,119
to have a body temperature of 37 degrees

1119
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,800
celsius i think that there's that

1120
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,119
underlying connection but but it gets

1121
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,640
really complicated when you try to

1122
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,040
extrapolate to something like cognition

1123
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,560
there's like i prefer to

1124
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,280
be rich i prefer to have 90 of the money

1125
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,640
in the world for example like you can

1126
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,720
say like i want all the money like you

1127
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,480
think about something like that but then

1128
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,880
there are so many complicated like do i

1129
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,160
really want all the money no because

1130
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,160
then everyone else would be homeless and

1131
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,440
impoverished should be horrible right

1132
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,960
like so you don't really want all the

1133
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,920
money like there's

1134
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,160
and and then if i say if i prefer to be

1135
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,240
rich but i'm stuck in an impoverished

1136
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,920
situation you can assume that there's

1137
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,160
like a learning gap between how do i

1138
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,359
earn money

1139
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:24,400
and

1140
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,000
being in the face where i don't have any

1141
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,680
money like i don't know how to have

1142
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,440
money like there's a knowledge level so

1143
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,680
when you when you bring cognition into

1144
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,599
it and like you ask people like what

1145
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,599
their preferences are like i prefer to

1146
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:36,960
live by the beach but i live in new

1147
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,480
mexico i mean we have lots of beach but

1148
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,480
no water so so there's like you know

1149
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,839
there's there's

1150
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,599
i i don't know there there's the

1151
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,680
preferences and then the probability but

1152
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,880
but

1153
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,960
is there some kind of like cognitive

1154
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,720
dissonance like you think we think what

1155
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,480
our preferences are

1156
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,319
are maybe not where our probability

1157
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:56,800
distributions are like i prefer to be by

1158
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,400
the beach but ninety percent of the time

1159
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,000
i prefer to be by the ocean but ninety

1160
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,119
percent of the time you find me in the

1161
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,119
desert that's that there's

1162
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,800
like there's some cognitive dissonance

1163
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,200
going on there and so i think that the

1164
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,359
mathematical

1165
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:10,800
interpretations have a lot of

1166
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,040
philosophical

1167
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,720
implications

1168
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,319
that maybe you know we need to think

1169
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:20,319
about more like when is a preference

1170
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:21,760
distribution and a probability

1171
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,960
difference

1172
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,960
distribution different and why are they

1173
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,880
different like what is going on when the

1174
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,079
preferences are not the probabilities

1175
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,839
thanks blue

1176
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:37,839
yes this will take us soon to the tale

1177
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:41,279
of three piece stephen first

1178
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,640
yeah very good points there um

1179
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,640
when you said daniel there about the

1180
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,240
exact base on the world um

1181
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,920
it goes into the so

1182
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,400
it goes into the variational base which

1183
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,000
in some ways as it starts to hit the

1184
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,400
markov blanket and start to give

1185
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,640
time steps as it starts to go through

1186
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,800
into the generative model

1187
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,000
you then got and as was useful from our

1188
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,119
um

1189
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,920
again the symposium with carl pristin he

1190
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,520
talked about you know the starting point

1191
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,800
often for active infrastructure is the

1192
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,480
generative model you know how do you get

1193
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,560
at the generative model so the general

1194
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,760
rule is

1195
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,319
that in some ways this exact base is

1196
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:23,040
almost needed in the modeling sense to

1197
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,520
give you what we think we know the world

1198
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,680
is when we're setting up our

1199
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,560
model or our experiment of people

1200
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,520
doing

1201
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,200
something where we're going to see what

1202
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,359
the results are so it's like

1203
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,359
the agent can't know

1204
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:39,520
what w is they can't know what the exact

1205
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,800
base is but like with the cat experiment

1206
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,760
sorry the cat matrix there okay we we

1207
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,160
could arbitrary put one in

1208
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,720
that we kind of can say we know as

1209
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,520
objective observers it's going through

1210
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,400
goes the agent and then the agent does

1211
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,160
something okay

1212
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:02,000
and and as blue said sometimes that

1213
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,079
that what they do

1214
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,839
isn't only in response to what's coming

1215
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:09,280
in which is quite often not it's not

1216
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,200
just can i i've seen food can i eat food

1217
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,200
as much food as possible does this well

1218
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,960
what's the consequence of my actions

1219
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,200
going forward maybe a lot of times we

1220
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,040
then start to get into this higher

1221
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,280
dimensional stuff

1222
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,160
where

1223
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,240
the circle that you put in there going

1224
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,640
into w there's that red circle on the

1225
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,599
left

1226
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:32,480
which so it goes into the w

1227
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,640
is what

1228
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,839
is really of concern

1229
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:39,520
you know the humanities around what's

1230
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,040
what's that about

1231
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,000
right

1232
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,040
and

1233
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,359
a lot normally the generative model work

1234
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:47,760
that is done in active inferences is the

1235
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,400
circle on the right hand side i how do

1236
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,480
we predict the way beliefs are being

1237
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,119
updated and what's the way the beliefs

1238
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:56,560
because it's normally coming in that

1239
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,319
direction

1240
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,640
because you can sort of control

1241
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,560
you can do an exact base there's the one

1242
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,000
place you can theoretically set your

1243
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,960
experiment with an exact base is w

1244
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,960
it's kind of hard to put exact base on

1245
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,040
an agent unless of course it's a robot

1246
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,400
potentially

1247
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,359
um

1248
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:14,480
so i think there's something quite

1249
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,920
interesting there

1250
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,880
about um

1251
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,680
how much is this

1252
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,960
um and it's a practical instrumental

1253
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,760
tool right how much is this about

1254
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,560
the way that modeling happens

1255
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,119
and how much and and the math to make

1256
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,040
that happen and the philosophies to make

1257
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,000
that and how much then is this broader

1258
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,079
and it may be that it gets recapitulated

1259
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,480
depending on which

1260
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,800
parts we simplify or allow to be more

1261
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,160
complex or want to get a purchase on

1262
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,440
out of those

1263
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,960
circles and maybe you just explain why

1264
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,240
you put the circles where you put them

1265
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,839
just to see if i'm

1266
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:55,599
getting your um

1267
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,200
your rationale but i think that was kind

1268
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,520
of useful to put them in

1269
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,839
i'm just highlighting the directedness

1270
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:05,759
of the statistical dependence

1271
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,400
this circle

1272
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,280
of action policy influencing unobserved

1273
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,560
states

1274
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,800
we've seen it in a partially observable

1275
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,200
markov decision process as where

1276
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,359
that's

1277
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:22,400
b

1278
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,160
w changing through time is b

1279
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,160
that's how hidden states change through

1280
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,280
time

1281
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,920
state one state at time one state at

1282
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,359
time two

1283
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:34,160
then

1284
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,440
z

1285
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,520
influences

1286
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,640
here

1287
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,599
in this

1288
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,359
simple only four nodes so if you only

1289
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:42,480
get four nodes

1290
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,520
you draw the dependency that way

1291
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,800
like my action to change the thermostat

1292
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,480
in the future will change the

1293
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,160
temperature

1294
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,040
when we can unpack it a little bit more

1295
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,040
and move it from this sort of minimal

1296
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,440
cybernetics or control framing

1297
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,119
into

1298
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,040
some of the little bit more built out

1299
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,280
models we've looked at that is where

1300
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,760
policy selection

1301
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,440
influences b and so yes there's enormous

1302
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,400
concern over how our actions influence

1303
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,720
things that we can't directly observe

1304
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,920
save for

1305
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,319
by proxied information incoming back to

1306
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,520
us

1307
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,760
and that is not a unique problem to

1308
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,400
active inference dean and then it's even

1309
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,880
i think i'm going to circle back to what

1310
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,319
blue is saying because i think she's hit

1311
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:37,520
on something really critical

1312
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,280
the oneness of this i think is what

1313
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,920
i won't say was the was the thing that

1314
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,000
carl started on when he

1315
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,920
took his first knees and steps into

1316
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,240
trying to

1317
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,559
put something that we can we can hold on

1318
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:53,920
to something

1319
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,000
that we can look at philosophically and

1320
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,319
mathematically i don't know if he was

1321
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:00,079
thinking about oneness

1322
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:02,480
at that point when he started down that

1323
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,480
path but i think

1324
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,119
the more we talk about it the more we we

1325
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,839
realize that

1326
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:13,359
as a for example in in a guide use

1327
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:15,599
i think a person who reads

1328
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,720
stephen and the other author's work

1329
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,160
have two questions the first one is

1330
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,880
my use of time the number of minutes i

1331
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:25,920
have to

1332
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,520
commit to reading the guide

1333
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,920
before i can then say whether or not

1334
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,839
certain impediments have been removed

1335
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,079
well at the same time and this is what i

1336
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:39,839
think active inference does

1337
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,880
it also allows us to invert that first

1338
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,680
accounting of what we are doing with our

1339
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,720
time

1340
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,200
invert it from use of time

1341
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:49,920
to

1342
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,520
time of use like

1343
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,280
so if i do commit

1344
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,200
to reading this guide

1345
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,040
what's the shelf life of that like how

1346
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,680
long am i going to be able to take the

1347
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,760
my takeaways and actually be able to

1348
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,160
apply them to different concepts

1349
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,559
and then there's a fleshing it out part

1350
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,160
which i think steven's kind of talking

1351
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,520
to which is

1352
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,800
so

1353
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,720
when we take all of this information and

1354
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,440
we embody it what does that feel like

1355
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,839
what is that what does that read out in

1356
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:20,000
terms of our behaviors

1357
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,960
etc our reactions our responses

1358
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,440
so i think ultimately if we're looking

1359
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,000
at the oneness of this we have to start

1360
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,319
talking about heuristics and steven

1361
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:32,319
specifically spoke about that he said i

1362
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:34,319
wasn't i think i'm paraphrasing him but

1363
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,720
i think he said

1364
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,960
we were concerned about whether starting

1365
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,359
with simple

1366
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:43,599
doesn't also have a cost we know that it

1367
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,680
has a benefit because it doesn't

1368
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,359
overwhelm people

1369
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,839
but if if we are going to look at simple

1370
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:52,480
rules like heuristics does that all also

1371
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,000
have a cost now he didn't answer that i

1372
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,440
was just re-watching the 37-1 before we

1373
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,599
came on today but i think that's

1374
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,440
something here that blue has now touched

1375
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,240
on

1376
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,920
and i think stephen is touching on as

1377
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,599
well if we're going to put a guide

1378
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:07,040
together

1379
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,680
when did the when did the rules fall out

1380
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,160
do we assume that they fall out just by

1381
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,760
picking the guide up

1382
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,079
or do they are they something that that

1383
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,800
the breeder or the user manufactures

1384
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,040
after having the experience

1385
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,599
that oneness i think is what this act of

1386
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:24,839
inference stuff

1387
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:27,920
is touching on and and

1388
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,920
and it's in some cases it feels pretty

1389
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,280
ready arbitrary it's hard to tell

1390
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,960
the when of

1391
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,960
the heuristic do i start with the rule

1392
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,559
is my prior my priority or am i really

1393
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,960
trying to update and i'm trying to come

1394
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,520
up with something that really applies

1395
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,200
at some point in the future that i

1396
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,280
haven't arrived at yet

1397
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,359
and i know that sounds

1398
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,599
kind of not answering anything

1399
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:54,400
but

1400
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,000
even even with the statistics it's hard

1401
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,760
to figure out what each agent is going

1402
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,359
to do

1403
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:03,839
depending upon what their bias is so

1404
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:05,440
they want to start with the rule or they

1405
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:09,119
want to develop one as they go along

1406
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:10,160
and as

1407
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,480
the bacillus axilis

1408
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,960
in 34 axos bacterium

1409
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,359
showed exact base doesn't mean you get

1410
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:18,880
it exactly right

1411
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,119
it means you're following a process and

1412
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,520
with maladaptive priors

1413
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,520
even accurate information coming in can

1414
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,240
result in a maladaptive decision making

1415
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,400
so this is not

1416
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,640
panglossian or polyanish

1417
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,800
just because there's an approach

1418
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,040
doesn't mean that it succeeds

1419
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,760
perfect right yeah um so steven then

1420
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,000
blue

1421
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,119
yeah so two points that sort of speak to

1422
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:47,200
that

1423
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,119
well i'll say the second one first

1424
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,839
because it was in mind is

1425
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:53,440
when we are when we see the modeling we

1426
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,920
often see say we talk about the bacillus

1427
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,400
or we see the way that modelling happens

1428
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,280
high order agents such as humans

1429
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,200
tend to find that the

1430
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,640
the w is fixed as a like the the cat is

1431
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,240
either purring

1432
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,760
or it's it's meowing it's in the kitchen

1433
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,240
this is an exact always in the bedroom

1434
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,119
right

1435
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:18,880
so it's it's a kind of defined

1436
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,839
exact base kind of context and then that

1437
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:23,440
allows the

1438
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,280
the other parts to kind of

1439
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,280
still find some very interesting and

1440
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,200
tractable useful

1441
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,440
trends right so

1442
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,520
as it goes through

1443
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,240
now when it goes then the other way is

1444
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,319
okay how do you get into something which

1445
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:40,240
is an exact base and you tend to see it

1446
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,319
turn into the swarming of

1447
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:44,240
of voxels

1448
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,520
those small

1449
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,040
you know um

1450
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,400
lorenz attractors or bacillus so very

1451
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,400
very very simple

1452
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,319
a gentle

1453
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:54,840
um

1454
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,160
[Music]

1455
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,559
scenarios with very little

1456
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:01,119
degrees of freedom because

1457
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:03,200
and this is in a way trying to address

1458
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,160
that challenge of well you know what if

1459
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,440
you don't know if it's in the kitchen of

1460
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,680
the bedroom it's in the doorway

1461
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,000
and it's it's wandering around and

1462
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,680
there's the time

1463
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,760
the time in between

1464
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,640
getting sensory information

1465
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,839
and

1466
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:22,559
my the action

1467
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,440
is um you know isn't in step there's a

1468
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,559
lot more bleed out you know

1469
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,800
and that becomes this kind of how much

1470
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,760
is the temporal i saw this word from

1471
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,319
from casper has leakage

1472
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:38,960
um because there's a leakage out of that

1473
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,480
sensory

1474
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,559
um in sensory i don't want to use the

1475
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,640
word input but the statistical

1476
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,880
dependencies coming in and the

1477
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,319
statistical dependency is going out

1478
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:50,559
there's a leakage going on

1479
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:51,520
um

1480
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,359
uh which makes the modeling kind of

1481
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:54,720
challenging though at some point it

1482
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,599
becomes okay well it's overwhelming

1483
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:59,839
right the the um we might

1484
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:02,079
philosophically say

1485
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:03,520
somehow we were able to do something

1486
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,920
like that and and our biology has

1487
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,400
enabled us to overcome that challenge

1488
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,720
but to actually put it into a

1489
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,800
model like the one on the right top

1490
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,440
right there it starts to become and in a

1491
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,839
way maybe that's where effect comes in

1492
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:19,680
as maybe okay that

1493
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,839
that may be also true for us that's why

1494
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:24,559
we need something like affect

1495
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:27,680
to hold together this sort of fuzzier

1496
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,800
kind of

1497
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,119
knowing which can't be resolved in that

1498
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:33,359
such a solid way so that's the first

1499
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:36,000
piece the second piece very quickly is

1500
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,640
you put the you know the the these um

1501
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,440
the the red circle that you put next the

1502
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,680
x there um

1503
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,240
so in some ways

1504
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,319
that that is what's

1505
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,319
like while it's sort of we're inferring

1506
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:51,920
what we're really doing is we're

1507
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:52,760
inferring

1508
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:53,920
[Music]

1509
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,400
we're either inferring the circle there

1510
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,680
that comes in to the x or maybe

1511
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,079
and that's assuming what the arrow

1512
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:04,000
that's going into the agent is is what's

1513
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,440
coming out of x

1514
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,520
or is coming from the x

1515
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,400
so that's in a way

1516
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,000
the edge isn't it that's the kind of

1517
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,440
boundary

1518
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,359
that's being the beliefs when you say b

1519
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:17,680
the b is about that

1520
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,280
not strictly about w

1521
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,400
there's a belief distribution on w and x

1522
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,160
w is latent modeled unobserved states

1523
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:33,200
and x is modeled empirical observed

1524
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:34,200
all states

1525
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,118
okay blue

1526
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,160
so just to kind of riff off of what both

1527
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,920
of you guys were saying maybe this is

1528
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,079
tangential but but when you talked about

1529
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:47,839
leakage

1530
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:50,720
um it reminds me of like the information

1531
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,880
partitioning that we discussed with

1532
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,119
majeed benny and how there kind of

1533
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:58,079
always has to be some kind of leakage

1534
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:00,160
like if you have a complete information

1535
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,599
partitioning

1536
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:02,640
um

1537
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,160
you're actually like

1538
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,480
in a in a vacuum or a bubble like you're

1539
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,720
you're existing there has to be some

1540
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,359
kind of leakage across the partition all

1541
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:12,880
the time um

1542
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,880
like and i've i've come to realize this

1543
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,880
like we have to be sharing information

1544
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,200
with people that are you know how do we

1545
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,200
form a markup blanket how do the four of

1546
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,960
us come together and form this live

1547
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,440
stream today right like we're sharing

1548
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,040
information even though there's a markup

1549
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,280
blanket that exists between us and for

1550
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,440
some of us it's thicker and thinner like

1551
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,880
daniel and i will be often like doing

1552
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,720
the same thing at the same time like

1553
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,280
like even like you know separately um

1554
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,040
just because we we work together so much

1555
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,200
but um

1556
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,040
this leakage is there and then it also

1557
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:46,000
made me think about the maladaptive um

1558
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,319
behavior that daniel was mentioning and

1559
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:49,920
so when you have this

1560
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,920
like we always wonder what is the cause

1561
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,680
of this maladaptive behavior and this is

1562
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,680
something that we were discussing maybe

1563
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,760
a couple weeks ago with jason you know

1564
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,119
that what is the explanation for

1565
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:01,119
maladaptive behavior and it always makes

1566
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:04,000
me think about the scale right like in

1567
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,720
the situations that are utilitarian

1568
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,960
like you know maybe someone sacrifices

1569
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,160
themself

1570
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,760
for you know they jump in front of a

1571
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,839
train to stop the train to save the 300

1572
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:15,440
people that are on the train and so

1573
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,559
there's the maladaptive um decisions do

1574
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:20,960
occur but but perhaps it's at like a

1575
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:24,319
societal scale or you know like

1576
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:27,200
in a body you know one piece will die

1577
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,119
off to save another piece like even in

1578
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:30,160
the brain

1579
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,160
um like the formation of like the glial

1580
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,319
scar i think of that like which it's

1581
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:36,240
like essentially like an it puts a hole

1582
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,319
in your brain but it's to protect the

1583
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:40,480
rest of the brain from the cell death

1584
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,400
that's happening in that in that center

1585
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,280
hole

1586
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,839
and so you know it's it's there there is

1587
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:48,960
this information leakage and and even

1588
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,640
maladaptive behavior

1589
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,440
um that i think are are scale

1590
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,880
dependent skill friendly

1591
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,839
thanks blue um dean and then we'll move

1592
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:01,440
to another section

1593
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,680
cool

1594
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,520
yeah

1595
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,119
i i don't know if we're at an inflection

1596
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:09,040
point with this but i i do want to bring

1597
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,440
this up again i i think that

1598
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,680
the leakage speaks to another metaphor

1599
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,359
that i've brought up way too many times

1600
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:17,520
last week which is a and the in the

1601
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,200
point zero which i think there is a

1602
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,040
filtering piece to this

1603
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,480
i mean this morning i put the

1604
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,640
raspberries in the sieve and i assumed

1605
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,799
the raspberries would stay and the water

1606
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:28,160
would pass through

1607
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,760
and there were parts that i didn't need

1608
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,839
like i wasn't trying to make raspberry

1609
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:33,040
water i just wanted to eat the

1610
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:36,079
raspberries and i think that if we

1611
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,920
understand that there's two a minimum of

1612
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,839
two aspects to when we're talking about

1613
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:41,599
active inference i think we do ourselves

1614
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:42,799
a favor

1615
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:44,480
and i think we do ourselves a favor for

1616
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,480
writing guidebooks about active

1617
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,359
inference and free energy so i think i

1618
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,920
think the guidebook for the guidebook

1619
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,599
if there was if there were if there were

1620
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:55,440
some pillars that we could put a

1621
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,480
guidebook on he would be my suggestions

1622
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,319
first of all there is going to be

1623
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:02,000
because we have a markup blanket we have

1624
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,359
a separation

1625
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:04,880
that differentiation and that

1626
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,160
integration

1627
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,400
are going to be inherent and however we

1628
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,559
observe something and then respond to it

1629
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:14,720
second thing that i would suggest is

1630
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,640
there's a certain blind spot removal

1631
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,640
piece to this

1632
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:21,200
and i mean that in the in the context of

1633
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,599
say something like change blindness

1634
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:25,680
because of over attending or under

1635
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,200
attending where he talked about

1636
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,480
overfitting or failing to explain

1637
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,480
that change blindness

1638
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,280
now becoming a greater awareness

1639
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,720
availability

1640
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,640
because we don't necessarily have to

1641
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:42,319
lock in prematurely or wait too long

1642
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:44,720
there's kind of a sweet spot that active

1643
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,520
inference is is trying to say exists

1644
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,920
it's not perfect

1645
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,000
but it's it's better than not having a

1646
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,880
sweet spot third thing i would say is

1647
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,040
if we're ignoring the foraging aspect of

1648
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,000
this

1649
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,079
if we expect that the framework is going

1650
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:01,040
to be

1651
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,119
another frozen meal then you're going to

1652
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:05,520
get the quality of a frozen meal if

1653
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,799
you're willing to forage around the

1654
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:08,559
perimeter of the store

1655
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:09,839
you're going to come away with a whole

1656
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:11,839
different experience it's more time

1657
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:14,079
consuming but in the end it's like

1658
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:15,760
learning to fish

1659
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,000
it's it's it's a whole different way of

1660
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,920
trying to process

1661
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,599
those uncertainties

1662
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:22,559
right

1663
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:23,920
so

1664
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,920
i think at the end of the day what pops

1665
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,599
out or when

1666
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:30,720
when we decide that we can actually say

1667
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,400
somebody's using active inference

1668
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,440
whereas before they weren't

1669
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,960
i think what they do is they come up

1670
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:41,520
with a a new sense of what rules

1671
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,359
which are being updated which are being

1672
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:45,119
modified which are being iterated and

1673
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:49,119
sometimes even being extrapolated

1674
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:51,599
we have to really focus on what that

1675
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:54,400
means under particular circumstances

1676
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,839
as we move from place to place

1677
01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:01,119
so again i'm not sure

1678
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:03,599
maybe that's maybe that's not being fair

1679
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:07,680
to the people who wrote a 60-page guide

1680
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:10,000
for philosophers but i think if we're

1681
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,079
going to look at the the foundational

1682
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:13,119
things

1683
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:14,559
they're going to be able to tell whether

1684
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:16,000
or not we're actually

1685
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,480
doing and using active inference

1686
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,880
i would think that at minimum those four

1687
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,280
things are going to be present

1688
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,640
starting with the filtering thing

1689
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,960
because again if it's not a minimum of

1690
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,000
two

1691
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,920
i think we over reduce

1692
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,000
we put a frame around it but we don't

1693
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,400
actually know what's actually a gradient

1694
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,400
descent and dynamically stable within

1695
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,359
that

1696
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:38,400
so

1697
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,319
just something to think about if we're

1698
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:43,599
going to write guides

1699
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:45,599
thanks dean okay steven specifically on

1700
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,960
that and then we'll go on

1701
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,400
yeah um

1702
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,119
just referring to this idea of screens

1703
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:52,400
and it comes back to the idea of

1704
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,119
screening off or filtering or i think

1705
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:56,000
that

1706
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,720
the x and the z here

1707
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,720
there's a question we often in this

1708
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,000
particular

1709
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,280
context

1710
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,760
they are talking a lot about screening

1711
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,839
it off and it seems to be

1712
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:09,680
whereas in other contexts say actual

1713
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,839
constants work i feel like it's trying

1714
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:14,620
to extract as much as possible from

1715
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:15,680
[Music]

1716
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,720
the the informational potential in an

1717
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,720
environment and i think that's important

1718
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:21,839
there's

1719
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:24,079
is there's a very different i've i've

1720
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:26,079
worked i actually used to work

1721
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:27,359
as a print

1722
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:28,079
uh

1723
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:31,039
broker so i actually fire up these

1724
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:33,039
big presses and it takes a hund a

1725
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:35,520
thousand copies to get the magazine

1726
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,280
actually starting to print properly like

1727
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,760
the rollers and the blanket has to get

1728
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,039
inked up and everything you've got all

1729
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:42,480
this waste eventually you actually get

1730
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:43,680
something that looks good and now it's

1731
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,000
running so you've got a thousand wasted

1732
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,200
copies basically you're trying to

1733
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,440
extract as much as possible

1734
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,960
from the inked up

1735
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,119
prince print head print cylinder right

1736
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:54,640
this is on a big press

1737
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,480
now in that case then you're trying to

1738
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,319
get as much information

1739
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:01,039
basically across into the paper

1740
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:02,720
now there's other cases though you can

1741
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,160
imagine where

1742
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,680
it's i don't know someone's taking a

1743
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,920
video in a and there's bright lights

1744
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,680
going on and there's you know you're

1745
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:12,160
trying to filter out like we say you've

1746
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,680
got bright light you know you're looking

1747
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,200
at the sun you've got to filter out to

1748
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,400
see anything

1749
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,480
in that case you're still trying to get

1750
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,000
your sensory data in you're still trying

1751
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,160
to work on the action policies

1752
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,640
but both x and z

1753
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:27,280
in a traditional blanket

1754
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,280
is a dead thing you know but how much is

1755
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,200
x and z

1756
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,720
um

1757
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,240
you know

1758
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,319
how much is that a living

1759
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:38,799
kind of process at certain times that is

1760
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:40,400
moving i mean you could say it's doing a

1761
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,760
bit of everything but how much is it

1762
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,280
trying to to to screen out noise

1763
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,160
and

1764
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,000
bring in and how much is it trying to

1765
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,520
extract

1766
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,280
you know from shannon entropy and stuff

1767
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,559
like that so you know i thought i'd

1768
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:54,319
mention that

1769
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:56,079
yeah it makes me think of like being on

1770
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:57,599
the phone with somebody

1771
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,039
and it's like

1772
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:01,039
you're both trying to pull as much

1773
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:03,839
information out of that limited channel

1774
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,920
and put as much into a limited channel

1775
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:06,880
and so

1776
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,559
um

1777
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:11,240
let's go on to

1778
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,440
justificatory links

1779
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,359
between or among

1780
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:18,480
dialectical categories so we'll do some

1781
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,000
slide play

1782
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,079
we have three

1783
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:25,520
types of claims

1784
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,960
dave i hope i'm using the word

1785
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,960
appropriately that there are domains of

1786
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,319
claims

1787
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:33,119
mathematical

1788
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,960
red

1789
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,720
empirical

1790
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,240
blue

1791
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,440
general

1792
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,760
green

1793
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:42,720
okay

1794
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:43,760
so

1795
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:44,960
no um

1796
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,319
commitments

1797
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:50,240
but can somebody just like give a

1798
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:51,520
specific

1799
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,440
concise example

1800
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,119
of where we see

1801
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:58,559
one of these cross category

1802
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:00,240
statements

1803
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,480
it can be in any direction amongst the

1804
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,640
three where is a case where somebody

1805
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:06,799
uses a mathematical the first part of

1806
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:08,880
their sentence is mathematical and then

1807
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,880
the second part is empirical or vice

1808
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,880
versa where's the situation where the

1809
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,799
first part of someone's sentence is

1810
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:16,480
mathematical and the second part is

1811
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:17,599
general

1812
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:18,640
so

1813
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,880
i'm sure that many have been said even

1814
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:24,240
today but let's try to get a few really

1815
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,839
specific examples so that people can

1816
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:27,839
just learn to identify these kinds of

1817
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:29,920
sentences and then we'll be evaluating

1818
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:33,359
what they mean so blue go for it

1819
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:35,440
so nothing that's been mentioned today

1820
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,280
but um you know the

1821
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:40,799
the p-value of 0.05

1822
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:43,119
you know demonstrates that that

1823
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:45,480
whatever my claim is in my experiment is

1824
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:48,000
significantly so that's something that's

1825
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,440
all the time um you see the statistical

1826
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:52,880
um

1827
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,400
you know

1828
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,880
justifying the empirical and less so i

1829
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,079
think we're coming away from the

1830
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:01,280
significance of the p-value um in

1831
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:02,880
scientific literature but you see that a

1832
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:06,240
lot so where would we put that kind of

1833
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,240
where would we put statistics what

1834
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,640
domains does statistics

1835
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:11,599
jump

1836
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:12,880
among

1837
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,119
so statistics to me is math like

1838
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:18,079
statistics is the sentence that bridges

1839
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:19,680
that's the field that bridges

1840
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,920
mathematics and empirical claims like so

1841
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:25,039
when you make the sentence my p-value of

1842
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:28,000
0.05 p less than 0.05 demonstrates that

1843
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,920
whatever my claim is my empirical claim

1844
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,920
is significant so for me statistics is

1845
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,240
that bridge between math and empirical

1846
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,319
claims awesome

1847
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:38,720
yes totally agreed

1848
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,160
we

1849
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:43,440
looked at these two categories of ant

1850
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,440
and we saw this one doing it six times

1851
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,200
this one did it two times

1852
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,920
we did some math on the numbers six and

1853
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,480
two you can't do math on the ant

1854
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:55,520
you do math on the numbers six and two

1855
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:58,960
and from that mathematical claim

1856
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,960
we're going to say something about those

1857
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,680
two categories of ants so yes

1858
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:06,400
mathematics going to empirical

1859
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,119
is a lot like statistics

1860
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:10,400
okay

1861
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,200
um

1862
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,839
what about

1863
01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:16,400
empirical going back to mathematics

1864
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,280
what is a specific

1865
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,520
natural language expression

1866
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:22,400
where

1867
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,400
somebody begins

1868
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,960
where the warrant of the rhetoric

1869
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,200
is empirically driven

1870
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,599
meaning based upon observation

1871
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:32,720
and then

1872
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:34,720
the consequence

1873
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:38,839
of the argument is mathematical

1874
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,559
how about

1875
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:50,000
because

1876
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,240
the organism is maintaining body

1877
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,839
temperature homeostasis

1878
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:56,559
empirical

1879
01:07:56,559 --> 01:07:58,240
it is the case

1880
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,839
that it is doing

1881
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:01,599
predictive processing

1882
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:04,640
or active inference

1883
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:07,599
so here

1884
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:11,359
um it's

1885
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:12,720
now

1886
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,960
there's there's so many ways to even

1887
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,920
enter here but this would be like from

1888
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,439
results

1889
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:21,679
that's the hallmark of starting in

1890
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:22,880
empirical

1891
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,880
is you're starting with something

1892
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:27,600
that is almost either trivial or just

1893
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,600
simply a fact or observation about the

1894
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,640
world

1895
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,560
so from results

1896
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:33,600
to

1897
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:34,960
what

1898
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:35,920
um

1899
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:38,960
some sort of

1900
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:40,960
statement about

1901
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,719
now what's interesting about the way

1902
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:45,040
that the authors did it here

1903
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:47,359
is they have no

1904
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:49,439
none of the three cases

1905
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:52,678
have mathematics

1906
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:55,279
in the second position

1907
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:57,759
and that's kind of like the xkcd comic

1908
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:59,520
where mathematics is like oh i'm way

1909
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,279
over here i can't hear you the field's

1910
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:04,000
arranged by purity meme

1911
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,640
because mathematics is almost

1912
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:09,679
framed as like internally coherent

1913
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:11,600
and then information comes out of

1914
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,279
mathematics

1915
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:16,238
but because it's theoretical or abstract

1916
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:18,399
there is an internal logic in

1917
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:21,439
mathematics called proof

1918
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:24,000
and then there's very little need to

1919
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,198
have something enter mathematics

1920
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:29,040
which is why it's a

1921
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,960
we'll see as we start to flesh out this

1922
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,640
um

1923
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:33,439
shape

1924
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:35,839
stephen

1925
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,600
yeah as you're doing that i'm curious

1926
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,359
what you think about something like

1927
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:42,238
gambling so someone is

1928
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:44,640
you know betting on horses it's the

1929
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,479
statistics of the horse

1930
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:48,158
gambling

1931
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:50,560
and then there's their motivation for

1932
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:53,279
gambling so in terms of the empirical

1933
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:55,840
you can see okay the behavior

1934
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:58,239
is fairly consistent certainly over

1935
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:01,920
a type of gambler at horse race the math

1936
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,080
can be established but then there's i

1937
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:05,360
don't know whether it goes into the

1938
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,760
general well what's people's motivation

1939
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,040
for

1940
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,800
the teleology but maybe i'm jumping the

1941
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,560
gun there but am i on the right lines

1942
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:13,520
there

1943
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,199
in terms of how would you put that into

1944
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:17,280
this um

1945
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:18,880
scenario

1946
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,640
can you restate it with an antecedent

1947
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,800
and a postseason just a specific

1948
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,640
rhetorical nucleus

1949
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,880
okay so there's um

1950
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:30,719
because x then why oh because

1951
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:32,080
because

1952
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,239
there is a

1953
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,840
group of people

1954
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:36,719
at

1955
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:38,719
a horse

1956
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:41,600
racing track

1957
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,280
and

1958
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:46,080
because we know that these horses

1959
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,960
have performed

1960
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:52,640
in a certain way over previous races

1961
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:55,679
we can predict the probability

1962
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:57,440
that the horse will

1963
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:58,640
win

1964
01:10:58,640 --> 01:10:59,840
or be

1965
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,239
told to people to win as being x

1966
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:06,719
the motivation for people to make that

1967
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:08,560
influence about

1968
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,560
and the behavioral choices

1969
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,640
is maybe more general

1970
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:15,199
but that seems to yes

1971
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,800
we'll get to the general edge because

1972
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,640
it's very connected to math okay dean

1973
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,880
no i'm just going to say i i like the

1974
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,640
word results there but i

1975
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:25,760
i think what

1976
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,440
what it's implied is is that there were

1977
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,880
a certain number of observations taken

1978
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,840
that then moved the formalism

1979
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,760
to something specific

1980
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,280
is that

1981
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,679
am i just confirming something or am i

1982
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:41,120
putting more in there that needs than

1983
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,600
needs to be

1984
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:46,960
i had a really similar question um

1985
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:49,120
so um when you're talking about going

1986
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,960
from empirical to math

1987
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,679
to me like you brought up um

1988
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:55,840
the the idea of like a probability

1989
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,080
density or like a non-equilibrium steady

1990
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,920
state and like that's immediately what

1991
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:02,400
came to my mind so i don't know if if

1992
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,880
that's echoes what dean just said it

1993
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:07,880
does

1994
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,960
let's get at the distinction between

1995
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,400
general claims and mathematical claims

1996
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,199
so

1997
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:17,440
math is sometimes seen as general

1998
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:20,880
and when ideas are framed mathematically

1999
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,360
indeed there's a lot of overlap but the

2000
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:25,360
authors do separate it out it's in

2001
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,440
section 4.2.2

2002
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:28,239
so

2003
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:30,560
what would be like an example

2004
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:33,440
of going from a mathematical

2005
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,600
to a general because math

2006
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,840
then general or

2007
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:42,480
because general claim then mathematics

2008
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:46,960
well you can you can talk about the rate

2009
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,199
of the rate of the rate of acceleration

2010
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:50,880
due to gravity

2011
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,120
and then then make the general claim

2012
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,400
that

2013
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,000
that uh

2014
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,920
if i if i go from

2015
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,239
from this height to this height

2016
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:01,679
um

2017
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:04,640
i can i can expect to

2018
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,080
hit the ground at a certain rate of

2019
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:09,519
speed or something i would imagine

2020
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,120
okay

2021
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,360
great i'm going to also pull out just

2022
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:15,520
two examples from

2023
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,080
yeah from the paper so here we go so

2024
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:20,400
we're in 4.2.2 so there's gonna be two

2025
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,560
examples given

2026
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,040
so again we're looking here at math

2027
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:26,640
going to general

2028
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,320
and then we'll see if we can run it back

2029
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,159
so how can mathematical claims justify

2030
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:33,120
general claims

2031
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:36,480
ramstead at all 2018 assert

2032
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,400
the fep is a mathematical formulation

2033
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,719
that explains from first principles the

2034
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:42,640
characteristics of biological systems

2035
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:44,400
that are able to resist

2036
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:47,440
decay and persist over time

2037
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:50,239
first part of the sentence mathematical

2038
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:53,280
second part general

2039
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:55,199
it rests on the idea that all biological

2040
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:57,280
systems instantiate

2041
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:59,040
a hierarchy

2042
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:00,719
a hierarchical generative model of the

2043
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:02,800
world that implicitly minimizes its

2044
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:06,480
entropy by minimizing free energy

2045
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:09,280
i almost see the reflection in that

2046
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:11,120
sentence

2047
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,400
um

2048
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:15,280
that because of the hierarchical

2049
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:16,640
generative model

2050
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,640
which is a general claim

2051
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,719
though a formal one

2052
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:21,600
then

2053
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,719
there is a mathematical implication

2054
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:28,239
so maybe we can put this ramstead 2018

2055
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:29,199
here

2056
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:30,960
okay and then here's the second or a

2057
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,640
second example that the author is raised

2058
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:35,120
in the paper

2059
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:37,440
axel constance contribution to this

2060
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,120
topical collection

2061
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,120
uses a mathematical claim to make a

2062
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,800
general claim

2063
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,280
on the basis of a numerical example

2064
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,880
he argues against the claim that

2065
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,760
minimizing free energy entails life

2066
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:51,920
rather he believes the converse is true

2067
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,880
life entails minimizing free energy

2068
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:58,000
we read and loved that paper and that's

2069
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:02,159
very much related to the um

2070
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,880
quote like one

2071
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,960
ugly fact destroys a beautiful theory or

2072
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,320
something like that

2073
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:09,280
um

2074
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:12,320
now is an example

2075
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:16,159
mathematical or empirical

2076
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,280
mat if it were just on the basis of a

2077
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,600
family of equations

2078
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,760
he argues against the general claim

2079
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:28,239
but then again isn't even the family of

2080
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:29,920
an equations

2081
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,800
an empirical

2082
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:36,000
observation from the domain of math but

2083
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,520
we'll put it in the section that they

2084
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:38,400
had it

2085
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,679
so in these cases we're using specific

2086
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:44,560
math examples and that was sort of the

2087
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,159
provocation of

2088
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:47,440
34

2089
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,520
and axel's paper

2090
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:52,239
which was like i did a math example so

2091
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:53,520
that's kind of resting on both the

2092
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:55,600
empirical and the mathematical i did a

2093
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,520
math example

2094
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:58,719
and now i'm going to make a claim about

2095
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:00,000
a general

2096
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,760
topic which is the relationship between

2097
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:04,880
free energy minimization and life

2098
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:07,280
so that is certainly

2099
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:10,320
moving in this direction

2100
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:13,440
whereas um so

2101
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,840
because math can be abstracted and

2102
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,440
generalized

2103
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:21,199
there's often similarity here

2104
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:23,120
because

2105
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,159
math

2106
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:26,960
rests upon specific examples

2107
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,040
even if the examples are

2108
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,719
some examples are more general than

2109
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:32,320
other examples

2110
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:33,600
it still can be said that they're

2111
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,360
empirical

2112
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,280
not exactly in the way that cat location

2113
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:39,600
measurement is but still

2114
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,679
it is the case that

2115
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:43,440
math produces results there can be a

2116
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:46,879
result section in a math paper

2117
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:49,360
what about this third edge

2118
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,199
what's the relationship between general

2119
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:52,640
and empirical

2120
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:56,320
and let's leave math out of it

2121
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,679
blue

2122
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:04,480
so this is something like um

2123
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,239
i i think about like what dean was

2124
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:07,199
saying

2125
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:08,320
because

2126
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,880
acceleration to due to gravity is you

2127
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,640
know negative 9.8 meters per second

2128
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:13,600
squared

2129
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,520
uh when i drop this apple it will fall

2130
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:16,640
to the ground

2131
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,719
like that goes maybe empirical to

2132
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:21,120
general

2133
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:28,080
when i when i drop the apple

2134
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,560
um because when i drop the apple it

2135
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:32,480
falls to the ground

2136
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:33,760
comma

2137
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:38,480
gravity exists in the whole universe

2138
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,040
that was

2139
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:43,199
quite a jump

2140
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:45,760
well because apples

2141
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,920
fell in not down

2142
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:49,280
that's flat earth

2143
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,440
because apples fell in

2144
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:52,960
gravity

2145
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,600
is everywhere

2146
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:00,320
okay that's one example

2147
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:02,080
so then i was thinking of like a sort of

2148
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:04,159
ant evolution example so the general to

2149
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:07,199
empirical would be like because of the

2150
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:09,120
way that evolution by natural selection

2151
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:10,800
is

2152
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:11,600
um

2153
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:12,880
ants

2154
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,640
optimize

2155
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:17,600
task efficiency

2156
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:19,920
and then

2157
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:21,360
the other direction

2158
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:22,800
would be like

2159
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,520
because in my experiment 30 percent of

2160
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:26,560
the time

2161
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:29,199
ants were observed to be doing this

2162
01:18:29,199 --> 01:18:32,960
selection has been acting on ants

2163
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,920
so

2164
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,760
these are very interesting because are

2165
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,719
there some edges that we rest upon more

2166
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:42,159
like what if we could just number these

2167
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:44,719
edges one two three four five six

2168
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:46,480
and then annotate

2169
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:47,600
and people could have different

2170
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,920
perspectives on it but we could annotate

2171
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:51,679
papers

2172
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:55,840
in different areas and okay

2173
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,920
if you're just doing one one one one one

2174
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,360
one one one

2175
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,600
it's like a one note paper from a

2176
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:05,360
structural rhetorical perspective

2177
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:08,480
under what situations is that

2178
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:11,280
preferable not preferable

2179
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:14,080
are there certain edges that are weak

2180
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:16,320
are there pairs of edges like a cord

2181
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:18,320
that we want to play together

2182
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,239
just like the ramstead it was like sort

2183
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:22,560
of forwards and backwards

2184
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:25,199
law of the jungle law of the pack

2185
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:27,520
from the mathematics to the general

2186
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:30,400
and then instantly

2187
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:33,040
a grammatical reflection

2188
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:34,719
from the empirical

2189
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:37,040
into the mathematical

2190
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:41,040
um okay uh stephen then dean

2191
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:42,719
um

2192
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:46,400
one question first just ask empirical

2193
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:49,920
could be seen as is that exact base

2194
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,840
empirical means observed

2195
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,840
observed so the exact base if you're

2196
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:56,640
just taking however you lay that out

2197
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:59,120
it hasn't been computed

2198
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,800
beyond

2199
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:03,679
observed okay so effectively that's true

2200
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:06,080
okay that's the first thing and then

2201
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:07,920
general

2202
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,920
in most senses is what we might call

2203
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,480
inflated or higher dimensional

2204
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,719
so we would go generally speaking the

2205
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:17,520
models are empirical

2206
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:20,560
from observe observations into math into

2207
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:23,280
generative model into some general

2208
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,360
pattern of action selection

2209
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:26,800
however

2210
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,480
it could be possible

2211
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:29,280
but

2212
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,280
generally it's intractable

2213
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:33,920
for complex situations to go from

2214
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:36,320
general

2215
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:37,920
to empirical

2216
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:40,960
and then try and get the math out

2217
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,520
which is kind of what alex is saying is

2218
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,560
like

2219
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,880
there's a general principle

2220
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,040
that empirically plays out

2221
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:51,120
but good luck finding the map to show it

2222
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:54,480
outside of a bacteria

2223
01:20:56,639 --> 01:20:59,520
okay dean

2224
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,280
so i find it an interesting daniel that

2225
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:03,199
you

2226
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:05,600
just just to keep the conversation

2227
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,520
sort of alive as you talked about the

2228
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:10,159
edges of those three circles

2229
01:21:10,159 --> 01:21:12,320
and i think

2230
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,880
i think the the task of being able to

2231
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:16,480
find examples

2232
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:19,120
of those bi-directionalities

2233
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:22,159
again goes back to that question of so

2234
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:24,000
so what are the rules

2235
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
and how fluid are they and as we're

2236
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,960
moving from one node

2237
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,760
so there's a change the moving from node

2238
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:34,960
to node we're building that relationship

2239
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:37,199
we're building out these rules

2240
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:38,400
is that

2241
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:41,600
is that one of the great byproducts

2242
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,560
of being able to

2243
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:46,800
maneuver and manipulate not getting

2244
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,280
stuck with only

2245
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:52,159
a sense of unidirectionality

2246
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:55,360
or oneness is if does this reinforce the

2247
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:57,040
idea that if we're going to actually

2248
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,840
really be able to demonstrate the use of

2249
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:02,400
active inference for example as a

2250
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:06,880
instrument or a tool to be able to gain

2251
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,800
a greater awareness

2252
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,400
are we really then

2253
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,719
talking about how we

2254
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:15,120
not just find examples of rules but

2255
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:18,080
actually form them

2256
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,280
because that's what you did that was the

2257
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,960
exercise that you just went you just

2258
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:27,040
built a whole bunch of rules i know you

2259
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:29,280
i know we've laid them down on the slide

2260
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,120
as examples but

2261
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,040
that those relationships

2262
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:36,960
now are they're not even bridged right

2263
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:38,000
there

2264
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,719
they've now got some sort of a a pairing

2265
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:43,120
effect

2266
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,280
so is that was that is that is that it

2267
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:48,960
i'm looking today

2268
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,480
back to the and then what happens what

2269
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:52,800
i'm looking today for is so we got our

2270
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:56,000
way we got our way to what is there is

2271
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,360
there now an awareness a sense

2272
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:01,840
that we didn't have before

2273
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:05,040
we went through that that effort

2274
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:07,040
and these and it's the thing that kicks

2275
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:08,080
out

2276
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:10,239
rules or is it just examples what do you

2277
01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:12,000
think

2278
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,920
i'm asking you daniel because you you

2279
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:15,679
did the most of this

2280
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:18,480
work do you see the rules or do we just

2281
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:21,839
see the examples

2282
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:26,400
i just think about how in a nested

2283
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,560
cognitive model

2284
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:30,960
the outcome of one layer is like the

2285
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:34,320
inflow of another layer so even a rule

2286
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:36,800
can be a rule in one

2287
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,960
layer or application but yet it's also

2288
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:40,400
an example

2289
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:43,120
of a rule

2290
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:47,600
mathematics and general claims

2291
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,440
tend to be more

2292
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:51,040
rule-like

2293
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:53,760
but again even rules are examples

2294
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:57,120
whereas empirical

2295
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:58,639
it's always the exception that proves

2296
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:00,560
the rule like it's the exception is the

2297
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:03,840
observation which transcends rules

2298
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,840
because if it happened it had to have

2299
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,280
occurred

2300
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:09,199
and so the empirical

2301
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:12,080
to me is like examples

2302
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,639
when you're in this domain

2303
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:16,560
and then

2304
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:17,600
movement

2305
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:20,080
away from the examples

2306
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:23,440
in the scientific empirical sense

2307
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:25,840
pushes us into the rule

2308
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:26,719
world

2309
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:28,719
so here

2310
01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:31,520
this red line

2311
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:32,800
is going to be

2312
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:36,159
more example like

2313
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,960
and so in that sense like

2314
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,159
in pure

2315
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:42,800
with the caveat again that even rules

2316
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:46,400
and generalizations are examples of

2317
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:47,679
but in the

2318
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:50,880
scientific empirical sense this is more

2319
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:54,080
like an example

2320
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:56,320
can you hear can you hear in your own

2321
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:59,199
explanation the sort of justifactory

2322
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:00,320
link

2323
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:02,639
between example and rule

2324
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,960
do you hear yourself justifying the

2325
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:07,520
difference between how we might

2326
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:10,320
look at math in general as being

2327
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:12,800
different than the empirical that's all

2328
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,880
i'm trying to bring out and and again

2329
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,560
it's it's a not

2330
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:18,880
it's not it's not it's there's nothing

2331
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,360
it mean it makes perfect sense

2332
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:23,760
but i think if we're going to find

2333
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,679
if we're going to find

2334
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:27,840
that somebody used a guide

2335
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:30,719
and what is the what is the

2336
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:32,880
what is the result of that it's going to

2337
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,199
be that people have a better

2338
01:25:35,199 --> 01:25:36,880
sense of

2339
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:38,320
what the rules are

2340
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:40,159
and what the examples are and what the

2341
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:43,360
relationship is between those two things

2342
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:44,719
that would be

2343
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:46,560
goodness gracious i mean if i'm talking

2344
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,960
to anybody between the ages of

2345
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:52,560
22 and 62 if we could get there holy

2346
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:55,560
mackerel

2347
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,679
thanks steven in terms of in terms of

2348
01:25:57,679 --> 01:25:59,440
opening up our understanding of things

2349
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:01,678
right

2350
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:03,760
one thing i think with what you're

2351
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:06,960
saying there dean is um

2352
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:08,080
which is because it does become

2353
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,159
interesting and

2354
01:26:10,159 --> 01:26:12,639
something daniel mentioned

2355
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:15,120
when we have multi-scale

2356
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:17,679
the actual nature

2357
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:21,600
of the rule example

2358
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:23,840
actually can shift

2359
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:26,080
and there's teleology shift that that i

2360
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:29,040
think is kind of revolutionary in a way

2361
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:32,080
when we start to think about

2362
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:34,480
there's a variation

2363
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:37,760
in the nature of what rules are present

2364
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:38,800
you know

2365
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:41,360
so you know the sort of rules around

2366
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:42,880
what it means for me to do something in

2367
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:44,800
my environment

2368
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:45,840
um

2369
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:48,080
myself individually i can't play that

2370
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:49,280
game

2371
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:50,800
my organs can't play that game

2372
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,880
individually right so

2373
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,400
um there's these

2374
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:58,080
there's there's there is um

2375
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:00,880
this this challenge right of integration

2376
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:03,199
or maybe this is ideal okay well

2377
01:27:03,199 --> 01:27:06,320
as well as saying

2378
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,719
what's happening

2379
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:09,920
um

2380
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:13,120
what where is something or what temple

2381
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:16,880
an imperial a temple and um

2382
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:20,560
temple and spatial scale

2383
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:22,560
does it hold

2384
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:24,400
and i think that maybe

2385
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:25,840
something that's kind of interesting is

2386
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:26,639
where

2387
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:29,520
so generally speaking people go to the

2388
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:31,199
racetrack

2389
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:33,520
and you know they behave in certain

2390
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:36,639
behaviors at the scale of

2391
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:40,000
um their their their part in society

2392
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,920
but they um

2393
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:43,920
and we have empirical data to support

2394
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:44,880
that

2395
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,560
however

2396
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:49,440
um at the biological level

2397
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:52,400
um it may be something to do with um

2398
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,239
adrenaline rush you could talk about or

2399
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:56,159
you could talk about

2400
01:27:56,159 --> 01:27:57,360
the fact that they just happen to have

2401
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:59,840
nice sandwich bar and someone enjoys

2402
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:01,440
getting the food right they don't even

2403
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:04,400
like gambling that much um whatever it

2404
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:06,800
is or wearing a funny hat to ascot so

2405
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:09,120
there's there's there's something

2406
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:10,639
there that could

2407
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:13,040
how do we i wonder that

2408
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:15,360
that that multi-scale question

2409
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,520
because i'm very caught with the idea

2410
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:20,239
that you've got axel constant taking

2411
01:28:20,239 --> 01:28:21,760
very very

2412
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,800
small

2413
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,360
you have this incredibly small

2414
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:26,880
world being addressed with active

2415
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:31,280
inference and then we have quite

2416
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:32,880
sort of

2417
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,800
you could say gross

2418
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:37,199
examples at scale which

2419
01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:39,440
ends up revealing a lot

2420
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:43,360
you know at larger scale um

2421
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,600
but uh

2422
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:47,520
i wonder what you think daniel about how

2423
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:48,560
what what

2424
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,159
happens and that that reflects what

2425
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:51,840
daniel i think was saying about nested

2426
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:53,520
systems and

2427
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:55,440
they're sort of informing each other in

2428
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:56,800
a way like

2429
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,880
if i if i think i'm gonna

2430
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:01,360
win some money on the races and i better

2431
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:04,159
get myself sorted i might sustain my

2432
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:06,800
stomach a bit more so i've got a better

2433
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:09,199
glucose level to make a good choice

2434
01:29:09,199 --> 01:29:11,199
right so suddenly

2435
01:29:11,199 --> 01:29:13,040
there's two different levels coming into

2436
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:15,600
play or just different scales so

2437
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:16,880
i don't know if that's i don't think

2438
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:18,880
that confusing things but i think it

2439
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:21,840
does make the modeling question

2440
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:23,679
because active influence is ultimately a

2441
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:25,760
modeling process

2442
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,159
um

2443
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:29,840
which

2444
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:33,199
is trying to get at

2445
01:29:33,199 --> 01:29:35,360
i would say it's trying to either get at

2446
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:37,040
the general

2447
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:38,639
or to

2448
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:39,679
to

2449
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:42,320
predict an empirical

2450
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:44,719
if i if i'm looking at this diagram but

2451
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:47,679
maybe i'm i'm mistaken there

2452
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:50,719
right where is active inference

2453
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:52,880
in this is this the trace of active

2454
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:54,320
inference

2455
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:56,960
is this the map and then we play on this

2456
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:59,199
territory

2457
01:29:59,199 --> 01:30:01,679
what is the adjacent possible and

2458
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:03,120
so we can ask first where's active

2459
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:04,639
inference here

2460
01:30:04,639 --> 01:30:06,560
and when is it here and then

2461
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,239
what next dean

2462
01:30:08,239 --> 01:30:10,239
yeah this is where i think it's it's

2463
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:12,719
about it's in the relationships

2464
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:14,400
and how we decide to parse those

2465
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,320
relationships and it seems rather

2466
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,239
arbitrary and i think it's one of the

2467
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:19,760
reasons why we're

2468
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:21,840
we can always disagree on when the rules

2469
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,840
are in effect and when they're not in

2470
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:25,679
effect i mean it's happening up here in

2471
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:27,600
canada we've got all these rules in

2472
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:28,719
place and then

2473
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:29,679
people just

2474
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:31,920
decide to pull up big trucks to the

2475
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:35,840
border and go no we don't like your rule

2476
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:38,239
right and so now there's

2477
01:30:38,239 --> 01:30:39,760
being canadian now we have to figure out

2478
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:40,880
how we're going to deal with that

2479
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:41,679
because

2480
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:43,360
we don't have any guns so i guess we're

2481
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:44,480
going to have to

2482
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:46,080
disassemble all the trucks or something

2483
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:49,440
by hand but the thing is is that

2484
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:51,600
if if you actually look at this active

2485
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,679
inferences in the relationship

2486
01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:55,840
and i think it's and then and i think

2487
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,080
to steven's point

2488
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:01,280
if if we if we think that a rule applies

2489
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:02,880
without limits

2490
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:05,120
that's the scale free part of it there

2491
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:07,600
from a mathematical standpoint we can we

2492
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,920
can find cases where that's true but

2493
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:11,520
then there's a very scale friendly part

2494
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:13,920
of it which says i don't like this rule

2495
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:15,520
doesn't seem to make sense in this

2496
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:18,080
specific situation and that's where axel

2497
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:20,719
came forward

2498
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:23,520
he essentially said i'm sorry but

2499
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:27,600
and and so did um i'm sorry the uh

2500
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,600
there was another author we had very

2501
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:31,199
recently who

2502
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:34,080
who agreed and said there's it was majid

2503
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:36,960
rajid said look there's there's a piece

2504
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:39,040
to this that says

2505
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:40,320
there's something that's local and

2506
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,400
proximal and specific and

2507
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:45,199
why are we pretending like that that

2508
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:46,719
fits the same

2509
01:31:46,719 --> 01:31:49,520
context as scale free so

2510
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:51,040
again i think

2511
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:53,280
i don't see that means that active

2512
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:55,679
inference is useless i think what it

2513
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:57,920
means is it can tell us when we can

2514
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:00,320
differentiate and when we can integrate

2515
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:03,280
that's relational

2516
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:07,360
so one thing this made me think of is

2517
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,360
that

2518
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:11,679
reading a paper on

2519
01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:13,760
free energy free energy principle active

2520
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:15,760
inference

2521
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:17,360
look at the road map

2522
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:18,480
there's no

2523
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,320
dialectic

2524
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:21,520
within

2525
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:22,960
a domain

2526
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:25,040
the claims are listed but it goes

2527
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:26,800
immediately to the relationship so it's

2528
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:29,679
like minimum two domains okay

2529
01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:30,480
now

2530
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:32,159
it makes me think about the structure of

2531
01:32:32,159 --> 01:32:34,239
scientific communication so in the

2532
01:32:34,239 --> 01:32:36,880
results section of the paper well so the

2533
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:38,080
introduction

2534
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:39,600
might have a lot of general and

2535
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:41,679
empirical claims

2536
01:32:41,679 --> 01:32:43,840
selection acts on ants and look at their

2537
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:46,239
mandibles and we know this about niche

2538
01:32:46,239 --> 01:32:48,480
construction and look at how they do it

2539
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,960
so that is like a very introductory

2540
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:53,360
piece there's not often formalisms in

2541
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:54,880
the introduction of the paper so that

2542
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:57,040
sort of blue arrow general and empirical

2543
01:32:57,040 --> 01:33:00,080
is very introductory in its scope

2544
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:02,880
then the results section of the paper

2545
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:05,120
is like blue mentioned it's about like

2546
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:07,520
empirical and math we saw it do it 11

2547
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:09,280
times and here's the p value and then we

2548
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:11,040
did this and we calculated the model and

2549
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,840
so it's like it shouldn't generalize in

2550
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:15,120
some senses

2551
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:17,520
and then in the discussion

2552
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:20,239
there's probably all edges in play

2553
01:33:20,239 --> 01:33:23,199
but especially math to general

2554
01:33:23,199 --> 01:33:25,840
because it's now been generalized beyond

2555
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:28,480
the mere empirical because we saw a

2556
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:30,560
p-value in the difference between the

2557
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:33,120
nest mates of this type and that type it

2558
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:35,360
does say something about evolution or

2559
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:37,120
because there's something happening at

2560
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:38,880
an evolutionary time scale it's

2561
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:41,280
consistent or inconsistent with our

2562
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:44,719
mathematical summary statistics yes that

2563
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:47,040
came from empirical but that edge is

2564
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:49,520
more in play dean

2565
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:51,199
and then

2566
01:33:51,199 --> 01:33:53,840
in simple simple terms that's how and

2567
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:58,480
when we fit phit the rule

2568
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:00,400
and that almost

2569
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:03,440
it does return us to the third p

2570
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:04,480
um

2571
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:06,320
but i think it's um so we'll kind of

2572
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:07,840
close this

2573
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:09,239
section on the

2574
01:34:09,239 --> 01:34:12,880
2.4 whatever it was with the uh links

2575
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:16,480
amongst the dialectical categories

2576
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:20,560
active inference as a trans discipline

2577
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,880
all of these are often in play and it's

2578
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:24,159
almost like

2579
01:34:24,159 --> 01:34:24,880
if

2580
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:26,800
the paper would have just been

2581
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:30,000
lists of empirical observations there'd

2582
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,679
be nothing contentious because it

2583
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:33,600
wouldn't make any general claims that

2584
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:36,080
would just be called a data set

2585
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:37,520
if it were just

2586
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:39,840
general claims

2587
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,159
it would be just philosophy

2588
01:34:42,159 --> 01:34:43,760
and

2589
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:45,520
that's not to say philosophy is easier

2590
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:47,520
or simpler it's like it doesn't trigger

2591
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:49,040
anyone's

2592
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:52,000
domain crossing alarm

2593
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,080
but like mathematical biology that does

2594
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:58,800
raise people's alarms or generalizing

2595
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:01,040
from math you're saying that because of

2596
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:02,480
the free energy minimizing that there's

2597
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:04,480
a general imperative for information

2598
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:05,600
foraging

2599
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:06,639
or

2600
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:08,000
relationship between the general and the

2601
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,239
empirical of course always fraught in

2602
01:35:10,239 --> 01:35:13,280
empirical science okay you measured in

2603
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,440
that laboratory study with those

2604
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:18,080
undergrads and that stimuli and you're

2605
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:21,040
going to say something about aggression

2606
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:22,080
so

2607
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:24,400
it's just very interesting because

2608
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:26,840
active inference does lay

2609
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:29,199
claim or at least

2610
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:30,560
lay play

2611
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:33,280
to all these areas

2612
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:34,639
that

2613
01:35:34,639 --> 01:35:36,880
it raises alarms

2614
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:38,719
on all sides

2615
01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:41,600
but how do we take that alarm pheromone

2616
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:43,280
and attention

2617
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:45,119
and then

2618
01:35:45,119 --> 01:35:46,560
just

2619
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:48,560
align it with something that's going to

2620
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:50,560
be a public good

2621
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:53,440
rather than just

2622
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:58,239
let it fizzle stephen

2623
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:01,040
that's very helpful and the nature of

2624
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:02,080
action

2625
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:05,280
and the idea of a tediology

2626
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:06,960
as soon as that comes in i don't know if

2627
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:09,040
you can avoid being in in the general

2628
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:11,600
now maybe active vision that's just

2629
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:12,480
doing

2630
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:15,199
a thousand dimensional interpretation of

2631
01:36:15,199 --> 01:36:17,280
a data set you know

2632
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:20,000
can stick with empirical math you know

2633
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,560
it's either recognizing a photo it's not

2634
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:26,480
recognizing a photo doing some deep

2635
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:29,600
deep computational processes but

2636
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:30,800
action

2637
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:32,880
and particularly then action policy and

2638
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:35,119
then tediology

2639
01:36:35,119 --> 01:36:36,400
um

2640
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:38,320
and would you say that would you say

2641
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:41,600
does does general claims or is where

2642
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:46,199
would teleology fit in here

2643
01:36:48,210 --> 01:36:51,369
[Music]

2644
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:57,520
teleology is never directly measured

2645
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:00,159
is that fair to say

2646
01:37:00,159 --> 01:37:01,360
so it can

2647
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:04,000
it can alway it can be it can be in

2648
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,360
green

2649
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:07,840
but it cannot be blue one can say i

2650
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:10,159
observed sorry blue

2651
01:37:10,159 --> 01:37:12,800
but i chose the colors for a reason too

2652
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:14,560
one could observe

2653
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:17,119
the animal trying to swim to the surface

2654
01:37:17,119 --> 01:37:18,560
and you can say well the teleology is

2655
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:20,239
obviously not to drown or something like

2656
01:37:20,239 --> 01:37:22,639
that but that's actually structured as

2657
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:24,560
because i empirically observed the

2658
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:26,000
swimming behavior

2659
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,679
i am going to make a claim about the

2660
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:29,119
teleology

2661
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:30,239
so

2662
01:37:30,239 --> 01:37:31,520
um

2663
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:34,560
i would say teleology is in a general

2664
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:36,480
case

2665
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:38,080
even another

2666
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:40,000
spin on this one

2667
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,040
would be

2668
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:43,600
empirical is like x

2669
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:45,679
this is the data that we're actually

2670
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:47,119
observing

2671
01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:48,719
in general

2672
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:52,000
is unobserved you can't observe

2673
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,080
things that are general you're only

2674
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:56,239
observing what blake calls the minute

2675
01:37:56,239 --> 01:37:57,840
particulars

2676
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:00,159
w

2677
01:38:00,239 --> 01:38:03,638
what is math

2678
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:07,199
math is

2679
01:38:07,199 --> 01:38:09,679
in the examples that we looked at

2680
01:38:09,679 --> 01:38:12,080
it's like the process

2681
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:14,000
oh wait active inference it's a

2682
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,760
mathematical process theory

2683
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:21,600
so math is a process or of inference

2684
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:23,360
that yes

2685
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:26,480
connects to generalities

2686
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:28,480
and this is not hard and fast i hope is

2687
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:29,840
not being interpreted in the most

2688
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:31,199
rigorous way

2689
01:38:31,199 --> 01:38:31,920
but

2690
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:34,560
it does generalize

2691
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:36,800
because it has to be

2692
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:39,679
like the intermediating blanket so let's

2693
01:38:39,679 --> 01:38:40,639
pull

2694
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:42,960
this w and x back in here

2695
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:45,440
all right so

2696
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:49,679
here we have the empirical states here

2697
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:53,440
being observed that's our data

2698
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:54,960
okay

2699
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:56,239
then here's the things that we would

2700
01:38:56,239 --> 01:38:59,839
like to generalize on

2701
01:39:00,239 --> 01:39:01,520
and then

2702
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:03,280
this gets to dean's question about how

2703
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:07,119
do you go from this to equations

2704
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:09,840
and here's math as our sort of blanket

2705
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:12,480
in the middle

2706
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:15,119
that's when we actually do whether it's

2707
01:39:15,119 --> 01:39:16,880
variational

2708
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:18,719
uh

2709
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:19,840
base

2710
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:22,400
or whether it's exact or whether there's

2711
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:25,119
some other mathematical approach

2712
01:39:25,119 --> 01:39:27,679
it's how we're gonna go from

2713
01:39:27,679 --> 01:39:29,760
these generalized or hypothesized things

2714
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:31,760
that we didn't observe

2715
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:34,639
how are we going to connect that domain

2716
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:36,239
and so it's almost like a little

2717
01:39:36,239 --> 01:39:37,920
boomerang

2718
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:39,520
so

2719
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:40,800
there's probably a lot more to explore

2720
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,719
here too dean

2721
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:44,800
i just like how i like how this has come

2722
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:46,080
together because

2723
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:48,159
math as we said well as i mentioned

2724
01:39:48,159 --> 01:39:50,400
before i think in the authors in the

2725
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,960
author's mind the motivation moving

2726
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,960
forward on the paper was math could be a

2727
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:56,159
vehicle

2728
01:39:56,159 --> 01:39:58,400
and it can move the process along

2729
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:00,480
because it is a process or it can be an

2730
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:02,320
impediment the other thing that's really

2731
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:03,760
interesting here is because it's in the

2732
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:05,280
middle

2733
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:07,360
isn't math got a lot of rules in it i

2734
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:09,760
mean come on

2735
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:11,280
right so

2736
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:13,119
again i don't think i don't think we're

2737
01:40:13,119 --> 01:40:15,040
contradicting ourselves i just think

2738
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:17,040
we're asking so again what do we allow

2739
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:18,960
to pass through the sieve

2740
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:20,719
and what do we hold back

2741
01:40:20,719 --> 01:40:22,320
and then what assumptions do we make

2742
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:24,719
about the sophistication

2743
01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:26,080
what what's the minimum amount of

2744
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:28,719
sophistication around the math process

2745
01:40:28,719 --> 01:40:32,400
that one must have dr carl fristen said

2746
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:35,360
you must have you must have a good

2747
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:38,080
grounded sense of what the math is if

2748
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:39,600
you're going to go forward like he

2749
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:42,560
didn't couch his words

2750
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:44,080
he said if you want this to become a

2751
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:46,000
vehicle and not an impediment you're

2752
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,360
gonna have to get familiar with the mat

2753
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:51,280
so

2754
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:52,880
and sometimes oh the math is not the

2755
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:54,960
territory you know important

2756
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:57,920
contribution and memes for sure

2757
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:00,080
if the debate were about

2758
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:02,480
whether territories were maps it would

2759
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:04,320
be the silver bullet to simply claim

2760
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:06,159
that the math is not the territory but

2761
01:41:06,159 --> 01:41:09,760
it's like right and we want the map

2762
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:12,400
so that we can take action and be on our

2763
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:14,239
road trip or whatever

2764
01:41:14,239 --> 01:41:14,960
so

2765
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:16,239
it's

2766
01:41:16,239 --> 01:41:18,639
the math is not the territory while it's

2767
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:20,480
the conclusion

2768
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:21,520
or the

2769
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:22,400
um

2770
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:25,600
second part of the rhetoric

2771
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:26,639
for some

2772
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:28,400
especially philosophers who might be

2773
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:32,400
interested in what is really out there

2774
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:34,639
because the math is not the territory

2775
01:41:34,639 --> 01:41:36,639
comma then what

2776
01:41:36,639 --> 01:41:37,760
that's like

2777
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:40,320
the dot two of active

2778
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:41,360
which is

2779
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:43,600
instead of just debating well yeah well

2780
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:45,280
because of homeostasis what can you

2781
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:47,679
really say about teleology and because

2782
01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:50,080
of allostasis does that contribute to a

2783
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:52,320
new understanding of niche construction

2784
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:55,759
they're all important questions

2785
01:41:56,239 --> 01:41:57,280
but then

2786
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:59,440
where do we go

2787
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:01,440
when we put the math is not the

2788
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:04,239
territory as our antecedent rather than

2789
01:42:04,239 --> 01:42:08,400
our conclusion rhetorically stephen

2790
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:11,440
yeah and like when you put here so

2791
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:13,199
first the math i totally agree i was

2792
01:42:13,199 --> 01:42:15,040
thinking that vehicle was thinking it

2793
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:15,920
also

2794
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:17,520
takes a different so for instance say i

2795
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:19,760
have a million dollars

2796
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:22,080
it gets picked up it's counted it's

2797
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:23,679
picked up in a car taken somewhere and

2798
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:25,520
then it's counted as a million dollars

2799
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:27,440
the bit in between it's not math it's

2800
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:29,280
just stuff right

2801
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:32,000
but in this process theory

2802
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,760
it's the in a way in the mod it's the

2803
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:36,159
math it's enabling and it could be an

2804
01:42:36,159 --> 01:42:37,440
entropic

2805
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:38,880
process you know it could be math in

2806
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:39,760
these

2807
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:42,159
maybe some sort of virtual numbers way

2808
01:42:42,159 --> 01:42:45,040
or noise way but the math is the vehicle

2809
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:46,719
for the data

2810
01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:48,400
right there is no data there is no

2811
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:51,600
banknote right there is only a process

2812
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:53,440
which enables

2813
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:55,840
the general to the empirical and the

2814
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:58,159
empirical in this context is a

2815
01:42:58,159 --> 01:43:00,639
is a modeled empirical

2816
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:01,920
in a way what we're saying is we're

2817
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:03,840
going to take most of the models that we

2818
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:07,119
see there's a very simple general idea

2819
01:43:07,119 --> 01:43:10,000
about behavior say ryan smith's idea

2820
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,719
about how the heart behaves how the gut

2821
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:13,760
behaves

2822
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:15,840
something about how

2823
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:18,159
access consciousness or actually access

2824
01:43:18,159 --> 01:43:20,639
awareness is achieved

2825
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:22,000
some general

2826
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,080
thing and then we basically do what we

2827
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:26,159
might call it a modeled empirical but

2828
01:43:26,159 --> 01:43:27,920
you could flip it around the other way

2829
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:29,920
and you could have

2830
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:33,280
um okay well the real world

2831
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:34,560
we could have

2832
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:37,920
a high dimensional empirical outside

2833
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:39,119
there

2834
01:43:39,119 --> 01:43:41,679
what's the general w what's the general

2835
01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:42,800
x

2836
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:45,440
internally what's the general

2837
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:48,880
which is what we use as our heuristics

2838
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:49,760
you know

2839
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:51,760
um which could be kind of interesting as

2840
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:53,920
well which is maybe more

2841
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:55,920
in the action because this is coming in

2842
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:57,280
on the um

2843
01:43:57,280 --> 01:44:00,639
century right but uh i think this is

2844
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:02,080
quite helpful would you say that's true

2845
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:04,840
it's a modeled empirical what we get on

2846
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:06,719
the

2847
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:08,639
in terms of how we work with it in the

2848
01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:11,440
active inference

2849
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:15,040
i mean looking back

2850
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:17,920
on it is there anyone who disagrees that

2851
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:21,040
empirical is always as modeled

2852
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:22,880
like

2853
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:24,639
it's kind of funny like

2854
01:44:24,639 --> 01:44:27,119
now i want to put a little red guy

2855
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:29,040
always intervening

2856
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:31,760
on this edge

2857
01:44:33,199 --> 01:44:34,639
little blue guy

2858
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:37,360
always talking about specific examples

2859
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:39,679
of math and generality

2860
01:44:39,679 --> 01:44:41,040
and then

2861
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:43,280
you know the generalization is we use

2862
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:45,760
the the um you know in equal variance

2863
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:47,119
t-test

2864
01:44:47,119 --> 01:44:49,360
so we generalized

2865
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:52,800
to connect the empirical and the math

2866
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:54,639
dean

2867
01:44:54,639 --> 01:44:57,440
i i really didn't want to go there here

2868
01:44:57,440 --> 01:45:00,000
but i have to i was way too excited last

2869
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,840
week when i had a little thought bubble

2870
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:03,600
and said wouldn't it be cool if

2871
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:06,400
my if michael

2872
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:09,040
or sorry if stephen mann and connor

2873
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:11,920
hines if we could get them in a room and

2874
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:14,560
instead of them talking about what they

2875
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:15,360
know

2876
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:18,320
get them to go through this process

2877
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:20,080
because that's essentially what we want

2878
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:22,480
to do is is we want to have that little

2879
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:23,679
guy

2880
01:45:23,679 --> 01:45:26,480
pop out as opposed to the one who knows

2881
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:28,400
so much in a dense way about their math

2882
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:30,639
or so much in a dense way about their

2883
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:32,320
philosophical guide

2884
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:34,880
because that's when that's when the true

2885
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:37,679
grasp of what the potential is and it's

2886
01:45:37,679 --> 01:45:40,159
not it's not about always having the

2887
01:45:40,159 --> 01:45:42,320
right answer it's coming up with the

2888
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:44,480
with the best answer in that moment

2889
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:47,040
right and if we could get more of those

2890
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:48,800
kind of situations

2891
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:51,199
i think people would actually

2892
01:45:51,199 --> 01:45:53,040
i think people actually come away

2893
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:55,119
feeling even more confident because

2894
01:45:55,119 --> 01:45:56,560
that's what this is about

2895
01:45:56,560 --> 01:46:00,320
it's about confidence developing i think

2896
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:03,199
one thought on that is like

2897
01:46:03,199 --> 01:46:06,239
it's possible to stay purely

2898
01:46:06,239 --> 01:46:08,480
internal to math and that's the internal

2899
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:10,480
logic of proofs

2900
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:12,960
it's also possible to stay internal to

2901
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:16,239
general claims

2902
01:46:16,639 --> 01:46:19,600
and do philosophy

2903
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:24,080
is it possible to stay purely

2904
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:27,840
within the realm of empiricism

2905
01:46:29,119 --> 01:46:31,119
in the trivial case yes if you're just

2906
01:46:31,119 --> 01:46:32,880
aggregating data sets and never

2907
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:34,560
interpreting them

2908
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:35,600
yes

2909
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:37,520
but empirical

2910
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:38,840
in

2911
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:42,159
application must either connect to a

2912
01:46:42,159 --> 01:46:43,520
general question like you know again we

2913
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:44,719
observe the ants and now we're going to

2914
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:46,159
talk about evolution so that's still

2915
01:46:46,159 --> 01:46:47,840
qualitative

2916
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:50,639
but it's it's an edge and then

2917
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:52,480
it rests on math when it's more

2918
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:54,880
statistical and on generalities when

2919
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:55,860
it's more um

2920
01:46:55,860 --> 01:46:57,280
[Music]

2921
01:46:57,280 --> 01:46:58,719
conceptual

2922
01:46:58,719 --> 01:47:00,639
but it's just sort of interesting that

2923
01:47:00,639 --> 01:47:03,119
the the internal logic of empiricism is

2924
01:47:03,119 --> 01:47:05,600
basically just data integrity

2925
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:06,840
but it's like

2926
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:08,960
pre-interpretation which is perfect for

2927
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:11,520
it being x

2928
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:14,400
whereas there's a whole

2929
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:17,440
guild structure and discipline

2930
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:20,320
around internal mathematics and internal

2931
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:23,679
generalizations and philosophy

2932
01:47:23,679 --> 01:47:26,000
and so it's like

2933
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,600
i and i also really agree with that

2934
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:28,880
having them i thought you're gonna say

2935
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:32,320
just get in the same room and then just

2936
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:34,560
talk about food or music or something

2937
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:36,719
like that no but i i know what you mean

2938
01:47:36,719 --> 01:47:38,719
have them and just like

2939
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:40,960
we're all learning by doing in this

2940
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:42,239
space

2941
01:47:42,239 --> 01:47:44,400
and to say that this is a lifelong

2942
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:45,840
journey would just be a total

2943
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:47,920
understatement it's

2944
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:50,480
it's broader and deeper than that

2945
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:51,280
so

2946
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:54,159
how do we recognize the complexity of

2947
01:47:54,159 --> 01:47:55,440
this

2948
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:57,040
arrangement as well as the adjacent

2949
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:58,320
possibles are the ways that it could

2950
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:00,719
have been made other end states that we

2951
01:48:00,719 --> 01:48:03,119
could have reached

2952
01:48:03,119 --> 01:48:05,040
bringing in any number of fourth points

2953
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:06,719
to make a tetrahedra

2954
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:09,119
any other number of orders of paths that

2955
01:48:09,119 --> 01:48:10,639
we could have done to reach this point

2956
01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:12,719
like if we had started with these little

2957
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:13,679
dots

2958
01:48:13,679 --> 01:48:15,840
and then later added the arrows

2959
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:16,719
and

2960
01:48:16,719 --> 01:48:18,800
how did we start this whole thing with

2961
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:21,360
examples of each edge

2962
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:22,719
so

2963
01:48:22,719 --> 01:48:25,360
getting to the super like fractal

2964
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:27,840
multi-scale level where

2965
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:29,679
and we didn't even add any formalisms or

2966
01:48:29,679 --> 01:48:31,280
mathematics here

2967
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:33,760
but we could have done some pseudo code

2968
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:35,840
or some pseudo equations

2969
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:38,639
to really start to link this and to lean

2970
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:41,040
more on our mathematical leg and that's

2971
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:42,480
the whole thing that you just said about

2972
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:44,480
confidence dean which is like

2973
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:45,920
this is the space that we're going to be

2974
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:48,159
bouncing around and you can ignore

2975
01:48:48,159 --> 01:48:50,000
statistics and you can just

2976
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,600
have an emotional response to p-values

2977
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:53,440
and stuff like that but

2978
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:56,080
you will need that as part of the

2979
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:57,600
journey

2980
01:48:57,600 --> 01:48:58,560
um

2981
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:00,159
we can't just be like the post office

2982
01:49:00,159 --> 01:49:02,239
vehicles that don't make left turns

2983
01:49:02,239 --> 01:49:04,719
we have to make all of our tools

2984
01:49:04,719 --> 01:49:06,000
available

2985
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:07,600
at the team level

2986
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:08,719
and then trust that with like

2987
01:49:08,719 --> 01:49:11,280
distributed cognition and with

2988
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:12,840
guides and

2989
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:15,679
wayfinders and peer facilitation

2990
01:49:15,679 --> 01:49:16,800
that like

2991
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,480
we can

2992
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:19,679
make it work

2993
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:20,800
despite

2994
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:22,880
how vast this area is

2995
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:24,000
so

2996
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:24,880
yes

2997
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:28,400
steven as we go for our final commentary

2998
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:29,840
yeah i think you made a good point there

2999
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:32,159
um with that green arrow just one last

3000
01:49:32,159 --> 01:49:34,000
thing with the green arrow you put there

3001
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:37,280
could that be um more implemented

3002
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:39,440
implementable

3003
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:40,960
um

3004
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:42,960
like it's becomes more implementable as

3005
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:45,520
you go that direction um away from the

3006
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:46,480
math

3007
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:48,239
uh with a mixture of general and

3008
01:49:48,239 --> 01:49:51,119
empirical uh just curious

3009
01:49:51,119 --> 01:49:52,560
so the arrows

3010
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:54,719
yeah the arrows i mean again they're

3011
01:49:54,719 --> 01:49:56,159
open to interpretation in other ways it

3012
01:49:56,159 --> 01:49:58,159
could have been done i was thinking what

3013
01:49:58,159 --> 01:50:00,239
links up math and empirical they're both

3014
01:50:00,239 --> 01:50:01,920
more numerical

3015
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:05,599
that's the bottom edge okay then then um

3016
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:06,960
what

3017
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:09,520
then what makes math in general similar

3018
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:12,480
they're less example-like

3019
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:14,560
and then what is the similarity between

3020
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:17,440
empirical and general so what is not

3021
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:18,639
just pointing what's the arrow that

3022
01:50:18,639 --> 01:50:20,560
doesn't point too general

3023
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:22,880
what's the arrow that points between

3024
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:24,800
general and empirical

3025
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:27,520
and what distinguishes mathematics

3026
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:29,760
from general empirical it might be its

3027
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:32,159
formalism but

3028
01:50:32,159 --> 01:50:33,199
general

3029
01:50:33,199 --> 01:50:34,639
is it

3030
01:50:34,639 --> 01:50:36,320
well i'm thinking implementation or

3031
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:38,320
maybe this does get into teleology like

3032
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:40,560
it shows you more like the empiricals

3033
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:42,639
what's actually happened so like like i

3034
01:50:42,639 --> 01:50:45,280
always this is an example is the um the

3035
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:47,280
accountant said to us once it always

3036
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:49,040
stuck in my mind is you know i've said

3037
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:50,159
this before

3038
01:50:50,159 --> 01:50:53,679
what is an organization doing what's

3039
01:50:53,679 --> 01:50:55,360
there about he said don't tell me your

3040
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:57,119
mission don't tell me your vision show

3041
01:50:57,119 --> 01:50:58,480
me your budget

3042
01:50:58,480 --> 01:51:00,080
show me what you're doing or show me

3043
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:02,000
where you spend your time

3044
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,119
so

3045
01:51:03,119 --> 01:51:04,840
in a way it's like that what's the

3046
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:07,360
empirical as well as the

3047
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:09,199
uh that goes to the general to show me

3048
01:51:09,199 --> 01:51:12,080
well that's that gives an idea then

3049
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:14,639
of something that can be done

3050
01:51:14,639 --> 01:51:16,960
as opposed to

3051
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:19,360
words or even a mathematical well words

3052
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:22,080
can be like a mathematical formula

3053
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:24,560
in many ways that help

3054
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:26,239
tell people what you want them to think

3055
01:51:26,239 --> 01:51:28,560
but maybe not what is going on so anyway

3056
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:30,000
i like those three arrows i think it's

3057
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,560
pretty useful

3058
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:35,520
any final comments in the last one

3059
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:36,400
minute

3060
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:39,360
dean and then blue

3061
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:40,880
so real quickly i think that a lot of

3062
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:42,719
times conferences people go and they

3063
01:51:42,719 --> 01:51:44,719
want to talk about what they know

3064
01:51:44,719 --> 01:51:47,119
but i think that this example today

3065
01:51:47,119 --> 01:51:49,440
was an example of where you come in not

3066
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:52,159
necessarily knowing but discovering

3067
01:51:52,159 --> 01:51:54,000
i think it's another fine example of

3068
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:55,119
what we're talking about when we're

3069
01:51:55,119 --> 01:51:57,920
talking about active inference

3070
01:51:57,920 --> 01:51:59,679
if i caught

3071
01:51:59,679 --> 01:52:02,080
stephen mann and conor in the same room

3072
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:03,599
the place that i would want to begin is

3073
01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:05,599
what what don't you know how would you

3074
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:09,599
guys attack this from not your strength

3075
01:52:09,599 --> 01:52:12,560
preferences probabilities and fit but

3076
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:15,840
from what you what you don't know but is

3077
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:17,520
still in the room

3078
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:19,440
and i think that's very complementary to

3079
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:21,679
the to the more traditional conference

3080
01:52:21,679 --> 01:52:24,159
way of disseminating information there's

3081
01:52:24,159 --> 01:52:26,400
my word for today

3082
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:28,400
and then even socially at the conference

3083
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:29,679
people connect with the people who they

3084
01:52:29,679 --> 01:52:30,960
do know

3085
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:33,360
and that's the little click network

3086
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:35,440
instead of connecting with people who we

3087
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:38,800
don't know and so it also ties

3088
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:41,520
to hopefully some of our values too so

3089
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:44,320
blue any last thoughts

3090
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:45,360
just

3091
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:47,840
i'm just thought of complexity science

3092
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:50,560
and the interdisciplinarity and um the

3093
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:53,679
real value that goes into co-learning or

3094
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:54,719
working

3095
01:52:54,719 --> 01:52:56,480
outside of your comfort zone because

3096
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:58,080
really like that's where where the

3097
01:52:58,080 --> 01:52:59,440
growth happens

3098
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:02,639
so i like those ideas a lot

3099
01:53:02,639 --> 01:53:05,119
yep working with people you know

3100
01:53:05,119 --> 01:53:07,840
can have amazing pragmatic utility

3101
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:09,840
and it must be balanced with the

3102
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:11,599
epistemic and with expanding our

3103
01:53:11,599 --> 01:53:13,360
horizons and perspectives as well so

3104
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:15,440
yeah totally agreed

3105
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:16,960
well

3106
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:18,800
another fun one

3107
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:20,560
can't say we prepared too much but i

3108
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:23,280
think in the end it went just fine

3109
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:24,000
so

3110
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,080
thank you all for joining and for

3111
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:29,119
participating and we'll
