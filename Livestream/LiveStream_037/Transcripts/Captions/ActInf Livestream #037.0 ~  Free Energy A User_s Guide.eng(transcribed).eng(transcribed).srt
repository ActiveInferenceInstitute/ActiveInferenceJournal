00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,440
communicating learning and practicing

10
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,280
applied active inference you can find us

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,039
at the links here

12
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,879
this is recorded in an archived live

stream so please provide us with

14
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,879
feedback so we can improve our work

all backgrounds and perspectives are

16
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,480

flap

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,080
all right so today in 37.0

23
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,600
we are going to

24
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,520
learn and discuss and introduce and

25
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,840
provide some background for this paper

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,040
free energy a user's guide by stephen

27
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,400
francis mann

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,360
ross payne and michael kirchoff and just

29
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,200
like all the dot zeros and discussions

30
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,600
we're just gonna introduce some ideas

31
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,360
give a little tip of the iceberg and

32
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,000
kind of warm up to talk about this paper

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,799
in the coming two weeks and so today

34
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,000
we'll be going through a lot of the

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,079
background and some of the key

36
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,159
formalisms in the paper

37
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,840
and the coming two weeks we'll be

38
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,840
discussing the paper so let us know if

39
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,520
you want to join

40
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,320
so first there's this comment in red is

41
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,600
this yours dean

42
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,719
yeah

43
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,880
do you wanna yeah

44
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,320
part of me do you wanna describe it here

45
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,079
or in your intro

46
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,719
yeah in the intro great all right well

47
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,640
um we'll each just go around and say

48
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,840
hello and then

49
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,160
i think we can uh just say one reason

50
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,160
why we're excited to discuss it i'm

51
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,360
daniel i'm in california and was just

52
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,080
enticed by the title short and direct

53
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,080
and i think it has some great

54
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,520
solidifications

55
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,000
and perspectives and implications on

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,840
multiple levels so

57
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,640
how about stephen

58
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,360
hello i'm stephen i'm based in toronto

59
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,480
um yeah i was interested by

60
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,760
another sort of way to surmise

61
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,280
the free energy principle and active

62
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,080
inference type approaches in relation to

63
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,000
the philosophy of biology

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,200
and cognitive science i thought that was

65
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,200
interesting to see how that pitch was

66
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,280
being made

67
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,760
open

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,120
hi i'm dean i'm in calgary and

69
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,599
anytime i see the word

70
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,400
guide i'm always curious because of my

71
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,599
background in

72
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,360
setting up programming where people were

73
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,159
going into novel situations so

74
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:10,959
uh

75
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,879
the authors kind of had me at that word

76
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,480
and then i wanted to sort of learn more

77
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,000
about what they had to say

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,200
are some key features of guides or

79
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,360
things that guides should keep in mind

80
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,760
before we head off on this journey

81
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,920
yeah well for me

82
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,599
i've sort of adopted the term wayfinding

83
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,000
kind of as a blanket not just a markup

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,319
like but it's a way of maybe describing

85
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,159
what that path could turn out to be

86
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,200
without

87
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,840
necessarily constraining people so

88
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,080
and there i'm sure there are other

89
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,080
descriptions and definitions of the word

90
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,640
guide but that's the one i tend to

91
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,959
to gravitate towards

92
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,080
all right

93
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,519
stephen

94
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,920
yeah and there's also what kind of guide

95
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,799
we end up inhabiting so you know

96
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,120
this biological

97
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,680
grounding it feels like uh

98
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,680
there's a desire to get into our feet

99
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,319
and into the soil somehow

100
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,720
uh as well as the cognitive science so i

101
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,480
feel it's a little bit like i've been

102
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,400
stretched up and

103
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,560
pushed down into the ground so there's

104
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,199
something there

105
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,959
okay

106
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,360
so one big question probably not the

107
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,040
only big question that could be raised

108
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,440
but just the question that approached us

109
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,240
to this paper in some way is how can we

110
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,560
learn and apply active inference

111
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,680
and then dean do you want to talk about

112
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,199
what you wrote here

113
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,440
well i just like to kind of read it out

114
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,800
i don't yes

115
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,840
okay so assuming that making moves

116
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,280
which would we could describe its

117
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,840
behavior now has effects on what happens

118
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,840
next and that those moves are at least

119
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,160
loosely based or inferred on evident

120
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,560
they and the authors use the terms

121
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,479
probabilities predictions

122
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,160
and fitness

123
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,400
so that's in the paper then how might we

124
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,280
begin to look at energy applied

125
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,680
okay and in calculating out our best

126
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,800
guess is measure measurable as or of

127
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,320
what we think or believe will happen

128
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,720
next step on that road to prediction

129
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,400
matter expertise now

130
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,720
prediction matter expertise is a

131
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,199
term i coined and brought up with dr

132
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,199
fristen um

133
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,880
but i think it might

134
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,520
if we're guiding we might

135
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,360
think about that in the background the

136
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,520
other part was they talk about models

137
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,479
and last in our last live stream set

138
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,680
that's all we were doing was talk about

139
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,240
modeling ourselves so it seems like a

140
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,840
natural extension now to talk about

141
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,000
models models as inference and action

142
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,840
models as selection models like as

143
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,880
extenders i.e tools and then how does a

144
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,680
model

145
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,880
curate curated run down help us get

146
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,880
outside the guide

147
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,800
when using energy in ways beyond god

148
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,360
explication and interpretation do we

149
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,680
need a user's guide for the user's guide

150
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,919
which was something i used to ask all

151
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,039
the time

152
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,639
uh the kids that were participating in

153
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,360
the program and that i was setting up

154
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,160
because they were going out with

155
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,000
their background and they had sponsors

156
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,919
who had a different background and we

157
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,000
often wondered whether or not they would

158
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,600
have to give a user's guide to somebody

159
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,479
who was

160
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:17,919
necessarily more experienced with the

161
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,600
field but not necessarily experienced

162
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,160
with bringing the young person along

163
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,680
so that's why

164
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,120
i think that when we're talking about

165
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,120
how can we learn and apply difference in

166
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,280
this guide theme

167
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,960
those are things we might want to keep

168
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,120
sort of at least partially

169
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,080
in our in our thinking

170
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,319
thanks a lot for sharing that dean a lot

171
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,560
to say but that's what the dot one and

172
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,120
the dot two and beyond are for

173
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,600
so the paper is free energy a user's

174
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,479
guide by steven francis man ross payne

175
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,120
and michael kirkoff it's from the last

176
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,360
days of 21 i believe

177
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,840
and uh it is

178
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,720
on the full-size philsay archive okay so

179
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,199
here are some of the aims and the claims

180
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,280
of the paper

181
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,199
over the past 15 years a novel

182
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,960
explanatory framework spearheaded by

183
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,639
carl firsten has inspired both

184
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,160
excitement and confusion of philosophy

185
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,560
of biology and cognitive science

186
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,319
active inference whose most famous

187
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,240
tenant is the free energy principle

188
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,400
purports to unify explanations in

189
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,720
biology and cognitive science under a

190
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,960
single class of mathematical models

191
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,840
so not math under biology

192
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,120
but

193
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,639
biology under math

194
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,560
there are broadly three reasons why the

195
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,160
active inference framework is difficult

196
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,919
to understand

197
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,319
in the author's words first the

198
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,560
mathematics are are unfamiliar to many

199
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,639
philosophers and even to biologists and

200
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,879
cognitive scientists and

201
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,360
mathematicians and all other kinds of

202
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,720
peoples

203
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,879
second the framework was developed

204
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,720
rapidly by a small but dedicated

205
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,720
dedicated group of researchers limiting

206
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,840
its accessibility while expanding its

207
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,560
scope

208
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,000
recent history

209
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,720
third the framework makes claims across

210
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,960
both mathematical and empirical domains

211
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,039
and the dialectical relationships

212
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,840
between these are unclear

213
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,039
so what is the math bio dialectic who's

214
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,680
nested within who

215
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,000
yes stephen

216
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,440
yeah i think this

217
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,080
the way these three kind of points are

218
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,639
made is is useful for seeing the

219
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,840
rationale for this paper i think there's

220
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,800
seen as a desire to come at

221
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,799
these questions

222
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,519
as if it was coming from

223
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,839
um

224
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,958
people less steeped in all the math

225
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,559
because previous papers might have come

226
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,760
out which had an awful lot of particular

227
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,880
you know particular information that

228
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,800
comes from this dedicated group of

229
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,440
researchers i think by

230
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,839
trying to speak about it

231
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,240
from the perspective of people arriving

232
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,279
it gives those core researchers which i

233
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,839
i know for sure michael kirchoff is you

234
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:04,720
know

235
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,959
been part of a chance to clarify the

236
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,399
sort of

237
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,560
framings or misconceptions that might

238
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,920
end up

239
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,240
being placed in other papers by

240
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,519
philosophic philosopher philosophers

241
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,600
and i think has become a little bit of a

242
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,440
vicious cycle of

243
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,680
uh and distraction at times and i think

244
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,279
they're maybe trying to reclaim that

245
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,560
ground so that's just my own strategic

246
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,320
guess but it looks like that might be

247
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,080
why this paper's

248
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,800
been been put together well great and

249
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,720
helpful feedback thank you

250
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,720
then the last parts are here we attempt

251
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,279
to redress this situation by targeting

252
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,680
each source of potential confusion so

253
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,440
they're going to identify three

254
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,360
frequently asked questions frequently

255
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,200
raise concerns

256
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,959
underpinning um

257
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,360
frictions and then redress them

258
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,680
and their aim is overall we aim to

259
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,519
increase philosophical understanding of

260
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,680
active inference so that it may be more

261
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,519
readily evaluated

262
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,000
and maybe we could even add um applied

263
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and developed

264
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
okay so would either of you like to just

265
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,680
read the abstract

266
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,399
i'll go for it okay over the past 15

267
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,320
years an ambitious explanatory framework

268
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,680
has been proposed to unify the

269
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,920
explanations across biology and

270
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,440
cognitive science

271
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,240
active inference whose most whose most

272
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,000
famous tenant is the free energy

273
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,120
principle

274
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,720
has inspired excitement and confusion

275
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,800
and equal measure

276
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,200
yes it has here we lay the groundwork

277
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,360
for proper critical analysis

278
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,760
of active inference in three ways first

279
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,519
we give simplified versions of its core

280
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,279
mathematical models

281
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,720
second we outline the historical

282
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,399
development of active inference and its

283
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,480
relationship to other theoretical

284
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,399
approaches and third we describe

285
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,880
three different kinds of claim labeled

286
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,560
mathematical empirical in general

287
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,240
routinely made

288
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,640
by proponents of the framework

289
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,800
and suggest dialectical links between

290
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,399
them overall we need to increase

291
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,880
philosophical understanding of active

292
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,800
inferences so that it may be more

293
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,839
readily evaluated

294
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:08,959
all right

295
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,839
cool so nice and funny abstract we all

296
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,959
laughed

297
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:13,760
so

298
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,920
the roadmap how do they

299
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,480
structure this guide is it meant to be

300
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,160
read linearly or do you flip to a

301
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,839
different page i don't know but we have

302
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,560
added the page numbers on um on this

303
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,000
slide it's on the bottom right but it'll

304
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,760
be on the bottom left and that's what

305
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,920
page we are in the guide

306
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,200
if as if it were in paper in our hands

307
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,000
and

308
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,760
it starts with an overview

309
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,000
and then there's a discussion on first

310
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,480
the inference of perception or

311
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,800
observations and hidden states and then

312
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,440
action comes into the loop

313
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,680
section 3 gives a brief history of the

314
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,240
free energy principle and section 4

315
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,959
discusses the aforementioned dialectic

316
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,360
of free energy and its rhetorical

317
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,200
ecosystem we could say

318
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,800
that's the part we're not going to focus

319
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,040
on in this dot zero but hopefully we're

320
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,440
gonna be able to go into each of these

321
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,880
really important troikas in the dot one

322
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,079
and two

323
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,079
then there are some concluding remarks

324
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:12,959
okay

325
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,000
so first how is the word model being

326
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,920
used here it's really good that the

327
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,079
authors included this warning because we

328
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,480
hear about modeling all the time not

329
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,320
just the photography kind the

330
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,120
mathematical kind so they write let us

331
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,040
begin with a warning

332
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,120
the word model takes on two distinct

333
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,600
senses throughout our discussion

334
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,519
the sense more familiar to philosophers

335
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,320
is what we call a scientific model a

336
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,079
representation of some possible or

337
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,720
actual system which a scientist uses to

338
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,720
reason about or discovers features of

339
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,320
that system and related systems

340
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,399
by contrast in the active inference

341
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,639
literature a narrower sense is typically

342
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,040
meant what we will call a generative

343
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,399
model

344
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,600
that's what we're going to be

345
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,680
specifically talking about

346
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,279
this is a mathematical object with

347
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,279
applications in statistics and various

348
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,600
sciences our simplified models of the

349
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,200
free energy principle are scientific

350
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,880
models

351
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,920
so

352
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,240
models is a big category but we're going

353
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,399
to be talking about kind of a narrow

354
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,519
sense of statistical models like linear

355
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,200
regression models but instead of a

356
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,880
linear regression it's a different kind

357
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,920
of model not at the exact same uh

358
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,079
elevation of the linear model or

359
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,880
taxonomy but like in that

360
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,079
category

361
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,120
and then

362
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,120
note further that some scholars opt for

363
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,680
deflationary stance on generative models

364
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,839
using them only to describe the dynamics

365
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,040
of agents so descriptive modeling

366
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,959
it is an open question whether this kind

367
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,120
of model building precludes any form of

368
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,199
scientific realism about the relation

369
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,680
between the model and the target system

370
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,199
these issues are discussed in section

371
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,320
four and also have come up several times

372
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,800
including with most recently majeed beni

373
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,600
but

374
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,240
model-based science and um what does it

375
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,800
mean to use and make models and maps and

376
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,160
territories and all of that so

377
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,800
any thoughts on models because that's

378
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,880
going to be one of the key terms going

379
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,040
forward

380
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,639
what would either of you

381
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,360
say would be the the best way in

382
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,720
layman's terms

383
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,880
to show the difference between what they

384
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,040
mean when they talk about an empirical

385
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,680
model and what they talk about in terms

386
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,600
of a generative model what what sort of

387
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,320
real physical material things could we

388
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,880
use to make clear the difference because

389
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,639
in the last live stream we did a good

390
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,279
job of taking columns

391
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,880
and showing how they were discrete how

392
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,360
would you guys describe this

393
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,720
yes stephen

394
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,440
i think one of the ways this distinction

395
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,440
comes about is is the difference between

396
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,560
most systems type approaches and

397
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,279
non-linear dynamical systems

398
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,160
um generative models are tending to be

399
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,920
coming from

400
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,240
a sort of a swarming it's like a swarm

401
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,079
of bees

402
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,480
creating and evolving

403
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,839
as compared to something which has been

404
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,000
given a perspective

405
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,519
and drawn out somehow in our environment

406
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,399
as in a scientific model

407
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,120
now

408
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,720
the fact that generative models are

409
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,560
being applied in the kind of scientific

410
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,120
way

411
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,959
inverted commas

412
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,720
or are they or they've been

413
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,079
are they being used in a more

414
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,639
instrumental stroke philosophical way

415
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,040
and they can never be fully science

416
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,959
is another question but i think that the

417
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,040
difference there between this kind of

418
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,120
biological

419
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,440
um generative

420
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,399
sort of

421
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,839
process

422
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,040
and something which can be

423
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,600
given a perspective on

424
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,759
and drawn out as a

425
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,560
defined type of model

426
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,959
in a is is where there's a kind of a

427
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,800
clear difference i don't know how others

428
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
see that but um

429
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,600
i think that that that also might be

430
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,920
useful

431
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,920
all right dean here be my

432
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,880
answer would be uh two that are on the

433
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,800
extreme end of the yellow type

434
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,480
scientific model would be like the

435
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,959
standard model in physics or

436
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,440
a working model of renal function like

437
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,800
kidney function

438
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,399
so it's like very transdisciplinary and

439
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,800
includes a huge number of domains and

440
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,079
kind of like

441
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,480
logical motifs and has axioms and a

442
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,040
specific history and software toolkits

443
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,199
um and all of that and then

444
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,959
we're going to be talking about like a

445
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,560
kind of model that's basically a

446
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,120
parametric statistical model so like a

447
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,600
gaussian model takes two parameters the

448
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,759
mean and the variance and that can be

449
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,920
written analytically like with equations

450
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,639
or can be done computationally but it's

451
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,240
only ever going to take those two

452
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,880
parameters and it only ever outputs a

453
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,680
certain family of distributions and so

454
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,880
it's like

455
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,039
parameters in distributions out and the

456
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,319
parameters can reflect like the

457
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,640
connectedness of a graphical model too

458
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,119
but you get parameters in

459
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,359
which can include model structure and

460
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,240
then

461
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,640
some type of output but it's

462
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,880
it's close-ended within that paradigm

463
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,959
versus the model of renal function is

464
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,359
like this open-ended question

465
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,039
and i think you hit on something really

466
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,200
really critical there it's distributions

467
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,320
out right so something falls out when

468
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,240
we're talking about a generative model

469
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,440
whereas when we're talking about

470
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,440
something empirical we tend to keep the

471
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,880
focus

472
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,240
stabilized

473
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,720
right like this so the process is is

474
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,440
fundamentally different and so

475
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,200
again when we're talking about in in

476
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,280
sort of layman's terms what the

477
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,720
difference would be

478
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,120
i think you i think you hit the the key

479
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,200
word of that which is something that's

480
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,679
in and stays in versus something that

481
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,559
may start in one place and fall out in a

482
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,559
completely different place with is that

483
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,720
an expectation we should have as a

484
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,960
difference between these two

485
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,799
yeah just one thought then stephen would

486
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,000
be um

487
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,559
both modes are so important it's like

488
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,480
yin yang or left and right hand or

489
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,039
convex and concave um yeah and our

490
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,480
discussions do

491
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,480
move regime of attention from like the

492
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,919
generative model to the bigger question

493
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,200
and in some ways it maps on to

494
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,919
instrumentalism and realism too

495
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,760
but we really need to know when the

496
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,240
pendulum is swung one way and when it's

497
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,480
swung the other way and so we can keep

498
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,559
an open mind and they're all happening

499
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,240
all the time that's both eyes open like

500
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,840
you're always saying dean

501
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,640
but we also um can't

502
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,520
um

503
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,919
go too hard on just one side

504
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,480
so stephen

505
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,480
yeah i think i love what you said though

506
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,080
daniel about the the axioms i think in

507
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,160
generally in science you you try and

508
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,840
have

509
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,080
reproducibility and you have tolerances

510
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,760
and you say how much accuracy and what

511
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,440
says tolerance is on

512
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,200
something but there's a general

513
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,960
recapitulation of similar types of

514
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,640
results again and again and again and

515
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,200
the same sort of thing comes up it has

516
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,760
been there in psychiatry and psychology

517
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,679
you know with with and that's where the

518
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,120
the idea of syndromes being classified

519
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,480
as opposed to symptoms which must be

520
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,640
much more fluctuating more variable so

521
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,799
you could run a generative model

522
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,919
and it can come up with different

523
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,760
results

524
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,280
even with the same input and that

525
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,919
now there will be some kind of

526
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,320
characteristic patterns that generative

527
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,799
models do reveal but that

528
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,000
there is a point where it's quite

529
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,559
different and i suppose when when that

530
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,080
difference i think that's almost

531
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,799
paradigm based difference but maybe

532
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,640
there is some point where they blur i

533
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,679
don't know

534
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,120
yes dean and then we'll go on to the

535
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,360
paper yeah

536
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,880
so at the end of the last live stream

537
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,240
one of the thing comments that one of

538
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,799
our colleagues blew me was that we have

539
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,120
to be able to hold two things up at once

540
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,440
which sang to me because i think that's

541
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,799
what you're saying both of you are

542
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,600
saying right now i think if we look at

543
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,960
if we whether we're looking at a

544
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,400
starling or a

545
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
and or murmuration whether we're looking

546
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,280
at an ant or a colony we can keep

547
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,280
something in

548
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,320
inbound or we can have something fall

549
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,919
out from that because it's basic

550
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,919
research like we weren't expecting

551
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,159
something repeatable

552
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,559
that's that's how i would distinguish it

553
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,880
but again i just let's get on to the

554
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,480
paper but i think that's important that

555
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,799
we get that established first if we're

556
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,480
talking about guides

557
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,880
that was the big epistemic disclaimer

558
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,400
and that's what they put in their paper

559
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,559
so we allocate our attention as well

560
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,799
okay so on to the details of the paper

561
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,559
so in two two they introduce this

562
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,360
um

563
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,039
simple model of inference with w and x

564
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,840
so this is figure one there's w for

565
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,799
world

566
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,720
that's the hidden world state and then

567
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,960
there's x the observed data like x marks

568
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,080
the data

569
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,200
and

570
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,960
you can think about like where do you

571
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,799
estimate where the sun is in the sky

572
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,320
that's actually unobserved but then

573
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,440
there's going to be all kinds of

574
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,559
observed data coming in or

575
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,240
we'll talk more about the coming in

576
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,760
versus the generative model later but

577
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,200
the observed data are what are being

578
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,280
modeled as being observed in that sort

579
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,159
of um sensory way

580
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,840
so figure one is the basic model of

581
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,000
inference

582
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,480
the inference problem addressed by the

583
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,799
active inference framework

584
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,320
what other kinds of inference problems

585
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,320
exist what problems do or don't have

586
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,159
this form

587
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,159
what happens if there's no line with w

588
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,080
and x so of course it can get more

589
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,000
elaborate but within this exact format

590
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,559
like w my output x and y

591
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,320
and that'd be like getting two numbers

592
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,400
back in the computer program instead of

593
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,080
or generating two numbers in the

594
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,919
computer program rather than just

595
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,760
returning one

596
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,159
or you can imagine x is like a vector

597
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,919
but we're within

598
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,960
that specific model framework we're not

599
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,440
in the realism of agent environment

600
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,280
we're just in the statistical framework

601
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,000
of a hidden latent variable observable

602
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,360
variable x

603
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,840
the unobservable state is assumed to

604
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,520
cause unobser

605
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,760
assumed to cause observable data

606
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,039
and so this is a little bit of a

607
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,360
connection with dynamic causal modeling

608
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,520
because statistically we call that

609
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,919
causing just like the proportion of

610
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,320
variance explained by a pca

611
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,880
it's like given very active

612
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,120
um terms it's

613
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,960
but it's actually

614
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,039
not causal in the mechanistic sense and

615
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,679
that of course has been to no end of

616
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,840
confusion with how statistical

617
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,200
conclusions are interpreted as

618
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,520
mechanistic

619
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,200
conclusions about the world

620
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,120
and so is it cause

621
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,720
in the sense that we mean it

622
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,120
in one sense or is it associated in a

623
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,720
causal model

624
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,080
and that's kind of the causal and

625
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,640
dynamic causal modeling

626
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,520
that's functional connectivity so that's

627
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,039
the realm that we're talking about not

628
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,200
within the world environment

629
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,320
interaction stephen

630
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,840
yeah this is this is actually

631
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,200
interesting they've gone back to a

632
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,039
pre-markov blanket kind of formulism and

633
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,360
it raises that question then of

634
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,159
what does it mean to infer and it can be

635
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,480
that we infer things because that's what

636
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,559
we get data on so it talks about well

637
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,799
what is it that we can even use to

638
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,480
understand

639
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,720
and what are the assumptions about

640
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,000
what's actually

641
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,200
important

642
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,600
to read and those two things i think

643
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,559
um

644
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,440
this leaves both those things open um

645
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,440
and that that that that actually is a

646
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,200
bit of a bridge between the scientific

647
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,080
and the

648
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,840
uh generative

649
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,039
processes

650
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,480
cool so if we're modeling like height is

651
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,159
not measured but we observed weight and

652
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,000
we're going to do some regression of

653
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,880
like the unobserved and the observed

654
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,480
that is the type of model that we're

655
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,960
going to be talking about loosely and

656
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,240
someone could say oh but this other

657
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,000
factor influences too

658
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,080
yes that's the realism claim this

659
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,840
actually matters in the real world and

660
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,080
it very well may but we're talking about

661
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,120
measured

662
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,159
modeled

663
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,640
relationships stephen

664
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,120
yeah i think this is also really helpful

665
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,279
to be able to look at paradigms because

666
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,720
there's a difference between say the

667
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,400
paradigm of

668
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,760
psychology

669
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,760
from the perspective of looking at

670
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,279
classification

671
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,559
and problem identification and treatment

672
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,880
and coaching psychology

673
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,480
which is about

674
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,240
not so much trying to diagnose what's

675
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,480
there but what sort of actions someone's

676
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,720
trying to take and how you might help

677
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,799
them with those actions to reach

678
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,200
outcomes which may vary

679
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,080
moment to moment and i think

680
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,000
you know in some ways that

681
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,919
that that's this is maybe the level you

682
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,679
have to go back to

683
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,679
because otherwise the noise just swamps

684
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,240
the discussion

685
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,520
it goes deep on both ends that action

686
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,360
orientation the pragmatic turn

687
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,120
ecological psychology is going to

688
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,559
connect deep

689
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:09,440
and

690
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,000
this is going to be deep but in a sense

691
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,520
narrow because we're just talking about

692
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,520
statistics here so

693
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,600
take statistics courses and learn it

694
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,640
because this is kind of where it comes

695
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,919
from here

696
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,320
okay on to the example of active

697
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,240
caprents that's that's not actually what

698
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,360
they called it but that's the cat

699
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,480
example that we're going to be

700
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,640
discussing

701
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,480
we're going to imagine that you have a

702
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,240
cat animal

703
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,840
that spends its time in either the

704
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,000
kitchen or the bedroom when it's in the

705
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,960
kitchen it often meows for food

706
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,039
when it's in the bedroom it often purrs

707
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,480
loudly suppose you tally the proportions

708
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,559
of the times your cat is in each place

709
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,960
and making each noise the results might

710
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,480
look something like

711
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,440
okay

712
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,960
but the cat also goes somewhere else

713
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,600
okay not in the model or this other

714
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,840
factor or this other sound okay

715
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,679
change the model add another column it's

716
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,640
totally fine it's a fork on the github

717
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,880
or the discussion but

718
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,720
that's the difference between kind of

719
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,960
modifying the model structurally and

720
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,039
using it parametrically within the

721
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,279
narrowest sense of model and then

722
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,360
keeping the discussion alive

723
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,520
about that broader sense like what

724
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,279
stephen is talking about like a model of

725
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,520
psychology or a model of complex

726
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,440
adaptive systems

727
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,080
so one thing to note is that this idea

728
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,279
of setting the prior in a bayesian sense

729
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,039
from observed data

730
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,840
is called parametric empirical base so

731
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,760
parameter parametric we're setting

732
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,880
parameters

733
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,480
like frequencies of things happening and

734
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,159
it's empirical which means observed it

735
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,240
doesn't mean like the only truth it just

736
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,000
means the measured values and then it's

737
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,720
bayesian as we'll talk about

738
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,120
so let's just say 10 or 100 or 10 000

739
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,960
measurements were made and they come out

740
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,320
to these numbers sixty percent um of the

741
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,200
time

742
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,360
they're in the kitchen and forty percent

743
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,440
the cat is in the bedroom and so that's

744
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,840
like summing across that's called the

745
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,760
marginal probability because it was in

746
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,880
the margins of papers and

747
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,760
they

748
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,640
marginals have to sum to 100

749
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,960
because something has to happen in the

750
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,360
model oh but the cat can be in the roots

751
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,240
yes

752
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,399
but within the model it has to be this

753
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:19,200
way

754
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,760
then that's what makes a probability

755
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,880
then

756
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,799
50 of the time there's meowing and

757
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,760
purring but as the numbers show

758
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,799
the

759
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,240
location

760
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,880
and the sounds

761
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,919
they have a statistical association

762
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,600
there's some divergence that could be

763
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,360
tested for statistical significance

764
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,000
depending on the number of observations

765
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,240
but that is what the numbers in this

766
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,159
table are reflecting

767
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,279
and um

768
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,799
both

769
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,120
uh columns and rows sum up to a

770
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,039
probability so they're all like proper

771
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,640
probabilities

772
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:56,880
um

773
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,320
[Music]

774
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,799
then how how do you infer about this

775
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,600
like if you were to observe the room how

776
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,360
could you reduce your uncertainty about

777
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,039
what sounds you'd hear

778
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,960
and then if you'd hear sounds how could

779
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,960
you reduce your uncertainty about the

780
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,080
room

781
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,840
many philosophers will be familiar with

782
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,440
one famous method for solving this

783
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,480
problem

784
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,799
bayesian conditionalization

785
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,640
this method can be stated as a principle

786
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,679
saying how an agent using a model p of w

787
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,440
and x w world state hidden x observed

788
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,159
data ought to choose their beliefs q of

789
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,600
w q that's the one we control upon

790
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,880
observing data x what to believe now

791
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,039
conditioned on incoming data

792
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,559
okay any points on that

793
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,159
just they did a really good job of

794
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:45,840
explaining it

795
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,919
yeah i'm waiting next slide

796
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,360
okay please continue here

797
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,200
so

798
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,200
from the from the actual paper the table

799
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,799
describes a joint probability

800
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,679
distribution which we just explained

801
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,919
uh where w ranges over possible cat

802
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,080
locations either the kitchen bedroom and

803
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,640
x ranges over the possible cat sounds

804
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,440
again very clear straightforward from

805
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,039
the next side usually the science

806
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,159
scientist not the person who

807
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,919
is trying to build a generative model

808
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,919
aims to improve the accuracy of a

809
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,159
generative model of some real-world

810
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,840
world phenomenon which would mean

811
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,440
improving the accuracy of pwx this

812
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,320
learning task is relatively difficult

813
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,600
so i

814
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,840
wanted to kind of parse what relatively

815
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,200
difficult meant and i'm not going to

816
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,159
read all of that stuff there in red

817
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:37,919
but essentially

818
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,640
what i want to kind of state is

819
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,679
the the authors here said this is simple

820
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:44,880
don't

821
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,520
don't go to that place of high

822
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,960
complexity quite yet let's just see this

823
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,919
for what it is so that what daniel said

824
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,000
90 seconds ago which was go take a bunch

825
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,840
of statistics courses doesn't have a

826
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,039
bunch of people running off and

827
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,799
screaming into the night

828
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,200
there is there is a complexity to this

829
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,640
but it's not

830
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,720
the kind that will swamp you

831
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,240
but they're basically trying to say is

832
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,520
let's just slowly work our way into this

833
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,039
without every

834
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,600
hit all your historical grievances

835
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,840
around statistics trapping you before

836
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,080
you even really set out set sail

837
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,559
i'll add one note on that this is like

838
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,440
learning how the horse moves in chess or

839
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,080
learning how the castle moves in chess

840
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,640
and so it's possible to get super

841
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,799
connected to your internal life

842
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,960
narrative in the game of chess and

843
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,640
people who would have no problem losing

844
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,720
and connect four or checkers will feel

845
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,520
very engaged emotionally affectively by

846
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,000
chess it just something i've observed

847
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,520
empirically somebody else might have

848
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,000
different priors on that and so this is

849
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,200
a way of just starting with how the

850
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,919
pieces move and then as we're finding

851
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:54,720
out

852
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,120
playing in a fun we hope

853
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,799
ecosystem and playground and sandbox so

854
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,159
we can figure out how the pieces move

855
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,080
and then we're going to connect them and

856
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,600
do all kinds of fun stuff steven

857
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,519
yeah i think like you say having the

858
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,840
ability to stay with the pieces do lots

859
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,559
of fun stuff look at the the way things

860
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,120
are generating with that data

861
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,760
is different for instance to saying oh

862
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,880
the meowing cat is an assertive cat and

863
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,799
the purring cat is a docile cat which

864
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,960
could be this kind of imposed high order

865
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,960
model and then everything's trying to

866
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,840
fit

867
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,840
to is it a docile cat or is it an

868
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,360
assertive cat

869
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,000
but it's it's flattened out all of this

870
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,039
you know you you loses this ability to

871
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,760
to generate

872
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,039
professor helen longnow has a book

873
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,559
called studying human behavior and

874
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,360
aggression in 2010 that's like once you

875
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,399
define

876
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,399
oh there's a significance difference

877
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,080
between these two groups

878
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,679
or in the count of this behavior per

879
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,159
minute and they've been pre-labeled

880
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,760
it passes the modeling

881
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,440
in the broad sense

882
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,919
into modeling into the narrow sense

883
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,760
we found a difference between the groups

884
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,640
so this is reifying our understanding of

885
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,000
those categories so it's really

886
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,200
important

887
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,480
so this is going to be where the base

888
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,279
enters the picture

889
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,279
the posterior

890
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,440
which means afterwards

891
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,360
is calculated

892
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,960
about how should the distribution p

893
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,200
be updated as new information comes in

894
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,640
so just like the last sentence in red

895
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,080
what's a belief now conditioned on

896
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,159
incoming data so now that is going to be

897
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,840
symbolically or graphically described so

898
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,320
probability the p distribution of world

899
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,039
states conditioned on vertical line new

900
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,399
data coming in

901
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,440
and there's

902
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,320
bayes

903
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,600
theorem

904
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,240
other videos and other

905
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,039
channels and groups will cover bays

906
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,519
better and more comprehensively

907
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,279
but here we can suffice to say that

908
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,279
first we can write it in words

909
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,360
like what's the distribution q that we

910
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,720
control

911
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,240
the probability distribution of us

912
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,360
thinking that it's in the kitchen

913
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,399
that is

914
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,039
the prior probability of it being in the

915
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,760
kitchen condition on it or it's time

916
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,320
conditioned on it meowing so how likely

917
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,559
is it to be given that it me out and

918
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,799
then the numbers that we just looked at

919
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,480
can be plugged in to that verbal

920
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,919
equation and a number is going to come

921
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:31,440
out

922
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,679
and so we heard meowing and if we just

923
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,000
looked at meowing like four times in the

924
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,240
kitchen one time in the bedroom so four

925
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,159
to five times it was in the kitchen

926
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,399
not the bedroom and then

927
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,640
here's an equation that does literally

928
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,519
that

929
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,519
it just looks at the column and it does

930
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,840
the conditional

931
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,080
likelihood or the posterior of the world

932
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,640
state after the data come in

933
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,080
um

934
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,399
and then there's i think did anyone want

935
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,518
to say anything here there's this

936
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,240
learning task is difficult i think we

937
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,519
already kind of mentioned that so yeah

938
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,520
we yeah yeah and and the whole thing is

939
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,639
is that most people i i think

940
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,040
i'm not gonna say philosophers most

941
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,440
people don't automatically go

942
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,800
to being able to figure out what the

943
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,800
probability is but i think what these

944
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,560
authors are pointing out is there's a

945
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,159
way of being able to show that there is

946
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,719
a probability in play if you are not

947
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,679
certain and this is how you might split

948
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,440
those probabilities out that's all

949
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,040
they're trying to do

950
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,520
okay so now we're going to go from as

951
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,239
we've seen in other papers the sort of

952
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,199
exact bayesian approach most similar

953
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,520
paper to this in this sense is probably

954
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,119
axel constance number 34 with a

955
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,239
bacterium we first looked at the

956
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,000
bayesian bacterium and then we looked at

957
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,399
the variational bayesian bacterium and

958
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,960
then in both cases we looked at how

959
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,800
basically um

960
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,960
[Music]

961
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,400
sometimes new data could come in you

962
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,240
could still make wrong decisions whether

963
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,359
you're doing

964
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,680
exact base or variational inference you

965
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,920
can still make bad decisions as data

966
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,320
come in so this isn't a pangolossian

967
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,040
paradigm this is like a statistical tool

968
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,640
that's already been detached from the

969
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,680
philosophy or at least sort of docked at

970
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,640
shore

971
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,880
and then now also we're

972
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,440
breaking the assumption that it must go

973
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,760
the right way or that it will model real

974
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,760
world systems especially

975
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,320
so again back within the narrow sense

976
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,800
sometimes the specific distribution of

977
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,480
the world states conditioned on data

978
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,680
coming in

979
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,000
is intractable so that distribution

980
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,240
cannot be calculated

981
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,680
this usually happens when the state

982
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,000
space is continuous rather than discrete

983
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,960
which came up on model stream number 5.1

984
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,400
if there's only two decisions left and

985
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,520
right

986
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,200
all you have to do is do two

987
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,720
calculations and then compare which one

988
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,960
is preferable whereas if there's a

989
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,119
steering wheel or a trim tab

990
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,280
then there's an open-ended number

991
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,040
because 87.1 degrees and 87.11 degrees

992
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,560
might be very different in their

993
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,240
long-term consequences so continuous

994
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,640
state spaces are very challenging from a

995
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,400
sensory as well as from an action

996
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,680
perspective

997
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,839
in these cases what is needed is a way

998
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,000
to choose q of w the distribution we

999
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,680
control on the world states to make it

1000
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,720
close to

1001
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,119
p of w conditioned on x

1002
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:21,920
so

1003
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,000
p of world state's condition on data is

1004
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,680
the hard one

1005
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,760
to compute exactly and this is going to

1006
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,240
be choosing a distribution that gets

1007
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,520
close to

1008
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,320
that other one

1009
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,640
when the problem is formulated by

1010
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,800
statisticians we usually begin with a

1011
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,200
family of possible distributions q and

1012
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,359
search for the member of that family

1013
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,920
which lies as close to p w condition on

1014
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,920
x as possible so just like a linear

1015
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,280
model it's like condition on this being

1016
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,640
a linear model we're going to find the

1017
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,400
best linear model or condition on the

1018
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,079
quadratic form we're going to find the

1019
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,760
best quadratic form

1020
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,599
this is like a little bit more general

1021
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,119
conditioned on the family that q is

1022
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,359
we're going to do

1023
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,400
basically linear regression fitting but

1024
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,400
not exactly linear regression

1025
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,520
um

1026
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,200
how do you make those distributions

1027
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,520
converge or align

1028
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,400
as best as possible we can do this

1029
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,480
also given that a structure has been

1030
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,800
chosen this is the fitting part this is

1031
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,079
not the structure learning unless the

1032
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,760
parameters about structure we can do

1033
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,440
this indirectly by using a measure of

1034
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,960
inaccuracy

1035
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,119
active inference employs a measure of

1036
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,880
inaccuracy called variational free

1037
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,800
energy labeled f

1038
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,640
because it is a measure of inaccuracies

1039
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,640
smaller values are better than larger

1040
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,280
values so it's like frisbee golf

1041
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,599
and the lower the value is the lower the

1042
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,800
difference is between the actual p that

1043
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,200
you would have calculated perfectly and

1044
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:47,920
q

1045
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,480
the way simpler lower dimensional model

1046
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,599
that you can control and can save in ram

1047
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,599
so that's described here

1048
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,520
variational free energy

1049
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,079
captures two sources of inaccuracy

1050
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,839
that we're going to go into in the next

1051
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:02,960
slides

1052
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,640
in belief and dictates how they ought to

1053
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,880
be traded off against one another the

1054
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,800
two sources which we're going to explore

1055
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,640
are overfitting and failing to explain

1056
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,640
the data so those will be introduced and

1057
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,319
discussed soon stephen

1058
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,440
yeah i think this also if we just uh

1059
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,079
connect it to that scientific standard

1060
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,400
models and this type of work is

1061
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,079
this is looking at

1062
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,280
contextuality it's like it's like what's

1063
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,560
based on where the starting point is

1064
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,880
that the probabilities are being

1065
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,079
picked up on you start to roll out

1066
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:39,280
the

1067
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,880
statistical

1068
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,200
results i what sort of meowing is

1069
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,720
actually happening

1070
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,320
and as opposed to a model where

1071
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,400
you're modeling a car engine and you

1072
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,599
want to know what energy it's going to

1073
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:52,880
give out this particular moment it's

1074
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,960
going to do that whether i'm

1075
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,119
watching it or not it's just the same

1076
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,680
basic model applies independent of the

1077
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,240
observer so i think that's uh

1078
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,400
also useful here

1079
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,560
yes like getting the model to this stage

1080
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,560
like depersonalizes it

1081
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,680
in a sense

1082
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,880
because that model can be just

1083
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,520
transferred and used in a like another

1084
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,960
instrument

1085
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,440
okay so here's those two sources of

1086
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,920
inaccuracy that they described the first

1087
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,119
that we're going to discuss is

1088
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,640
overfitting

1089
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,560
the cost of overfitting they write can

1090
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,400
therefore be measured by checking how

1091
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,280
far

1092
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,680
q the one we control on world states

1093
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,839
diverges from p

1094
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,560
the first term of f free energy is a

1095
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,720
measure of that kind

1096
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,680
this

1097
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,200
expression two

1098
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,280
is also called the relative entry

1099
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,560
entropy or holdback library or the kl

1100
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,160
divergence

1101
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:46,880
so

1102
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,960
this is like the first half of the

1103
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,880
two-part equation that will constitute f

1104
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,760
and

1105
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,200
it looks like this graphically

1106
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,480
symbolically but here's a kind of

1107
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,079
cool way to think about it

1108
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,079
if you were trying to fit a single hump

1109
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,240
into this two-hump model in the

1110
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,640
empirical distribution

1111
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,240
so

1112
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,160
you're fitting a family that is going to

1113
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,920
get sort of coerced into one of two

1114
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,119
extremes

1115
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,200
either it's going to end up

1116
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,319
fitting one very closely like the higher

1117
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,960
one if it's like mode seeking and it

1118
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,720
will have no probability density the

1119
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,839
blue line

1120
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,839
onto the other hump

1121
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:26,720
or

1122
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,000
it'll conflate them in a sense into

1123
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,280
two

1124
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,079
um

1125
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,000
uh kind of sub populations blurred

1126
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,160
together and have a solution basically

1127
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,839
that kind of goes between them

1128
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,240
kale divergence

1129
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,160
is a way to

1130
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,119
fit distributions optimally given this

1131
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,480
kind of challenge

1132
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,640
which exists for the one hump fitting 2

1133
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,280
hump it exists for the 2 hump fitting 3

1134
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,000
it exists for the 1 fitting 50. it's a

1135
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,800
general statistical problem and kl is a

1136
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,240
method that helps bring that blue line

1137
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,160
as well as it can on a trade-off

1138
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,480
frontier into alignment with the black

1139
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,720
one

1140
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,119
okay stephen

1141
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,800
yeah i suppose this also

1142
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,040
gets into the reason when this is useful

1143
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,760
is when you're in complex

1144
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,920
non-equilibrium situations where things

1145
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,440
are fluid

1146
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,960
then you're going to hit these

1147
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,040
situations and overfitting is quite

1148
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,200
common social sciences being one of the

1149
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,760
areas where we see these problems

1150
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,079
where it's equilibrium based and it's

1151
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:33,119
fairly

1152
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,640
clear

1153
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,680
then

1154
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,440
you don't really have it's not really as

1155
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,000
applicable so it sort of speaks to where

1156
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,160
this type of approach is applicable i

1157
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,200
where there's

1158
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,119
this kind of fluid

1159
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,880
ambiguity in in this situation

1160
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,119
okay thank you

1161
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,880
how about the second source of

1162
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,920
inaccuracy that is failing to explain

1163
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,119
the data

1164
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,280
mathematically they write explaining the

1165
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,319
data

1166
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,319
means assigning high probability to

1167
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:03,839
events w

1168
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:07,119
that make the probability of x high

1169
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,200
the penalty for failing to explain data

1170
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,040
is captured by the second term of f

1171
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,359
which looks like this

1172
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:14,160
um

1173
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,680
higher terms of

1174
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,680
the actual value

1175
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,319
are matched with high value um with high

1176
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,480
values on the distribution we control q

1177
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,640
to keep this term low so this is kind of

1178
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,359
like if it were a linear regression and

1179
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,040
all the data points were lined up and

1180
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,119
the line just went right through them

1181
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,280
then it would be doing really well on

1182
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,720
explaining the data

1183
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,079
and that would be given a low score here

1184
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,319
whereas if that weren't the case it'd be

1185
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,880
flipped dean

1186
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,520
so when i was doing my work i didn't

1187
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,319
have

1188
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,079
access or maybe i wasn't looking hard

1189
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,640
enough for the kl divergence so i can

1190
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,560
remember even on here and some of these

1191
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,400
live streams saying i have no idea what

1192
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,880
that even means i have a better idea now

1193
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,560
but is

1194
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,599
one of the metaphors that i tried to use

1195
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,880
was in terms of avoiding overfitting or

1196
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,800
failing to be able to explain the data

1197
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,760
was so all those horizontal and vertical

1198
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,599
lines creating a mesh

1199
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,359
acting as a filter

1200
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:15,680
how far apart do we set those what gauge

1201
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,319
do we set our mesh for in terms of what

1202
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:21,839
we want to have stay above the mesh and

1203
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,280
what's passing

1204
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,640
passing through now again maybe that's

1205
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,240
not sophisticated enough for a lot of

1206
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,720
philosophers but to get the basic point

1207
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,599
down

1208
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:33,599
that's the kind of example i had to

1209
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:34,640
provide

1210
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,560
to be able to give people some sense not

1211
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,400
just that these lines are now

1212
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,440
rigid

1213
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,920
and the 20s on this percent and the 40

1214
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,599
is on this percent and

1215
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:46,560
never tell shall the two pass again but

1216
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,000
the lines actually move

1217
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:52,960
thanks a lot so you're so

1218
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,119
right about that the example with the

1219
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:56,640
active cat friends and the variational

1220
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,920
cat friends is like discrete by discrete

1221
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,760
is four quadrants

1222
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,599
so in some ways that's like the simplest

1223
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,560
model

1224
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,560
right it could be two continuous

1225
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,400
variables it could be like the volume

1226
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,160
and then the cat's position on the

1227
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,640
x-axis in a room now imagine if it was

1228
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,920
the x and the y i was continuous or

1229
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,599
something like that but just even two

1230
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,319
continuous variables and you're totally

1231
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,079
pointing out where it's like you're

1232
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:20,880
gonna

1233
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,960
put the points around whether you put

1234
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,920
them right in the middle of the four

1235
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,280
quadrants

1236
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,119
or whether it's more scatter shot or

1237
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:28,640
something in between

1238
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,359
and then there's two parameters there's

1239
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,880
like a linear regression through the

1240
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,839
points

1241
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:37,280
and then there's how fine the mesh is

1242
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,880
and you're observing like pixel

1243
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,480
densities and doing a regression through

1244
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,400
the pixel densities and so you could

1245
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,800
have a super continuous situation it is

1246
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,960
a continuous variable inside the bedroom

1247
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,200
but then in the model we just looked at

1248
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,800
it's in one quadrant

1249
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,800
and we talked about that when we talked

1250
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,839
about um serval's paper and how it was

1251
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:58,079
just the park and the cafe and yes

1252
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,599
there's locations within the park but

1253
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,119
they weren't within our model

1254
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,599
so we didn't deny the reality of that

1255
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,760
physically we just we're modeling

1256
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,920
statistically something specific

1257
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,400
okay stephen

1258
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,960
i mean this the filtering could also be

1259
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,480
relating to

1260
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,560
the sort of temporal sampling rate

1261
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,560
because if you're measuring every

1262
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,760
millisecond

1263
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,440
if it's meowing or not it becomes

1264
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,119
pointless there's a kind of a

1265
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:24,720
making sense

1266
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,920
rate at which the um

1267
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,359
the entropy is being converged at and

1268
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:32,960
and as we know in the brain we seem to

1269
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,640
have multiple

1270
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,000
levels of that

1271
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,200
okay awesome

1272
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,720
next few ones we're going to go through

1273
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,280
just kind of quickly and specifically

1274
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,319
so let's put those two terms together

1275
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,200
this

1276
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,960
is the overfitting and the over

1277
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,280
and the failing to explain the data

1278
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,680
variational free energy f

1279
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,000
the non-metaphysical version

1280
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,520
is the sum of the penalties for

1281
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,960
overfitting and failing to explain the

1282
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,280
data it's those two terms that we just

1283
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,560
described

1284
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,000
added together

1285
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,960
so that the best explanation

1286
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,240
in a sense

1287
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,440
is the lowest on both of them

1288
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,599
it's not over fit

1289
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:14,400
it fits it well and it doesn't do it any

1290
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,839
more than that so you know simple as

1291
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,440
possible but no simpler or any other

1292
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,920
number of quotes that's kind of this

1293
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,160
equations it's not the only way it could

1294
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,160
be written it's not the only thing that

1295
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,200
fulfills that process but it's something

1296
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,480
that can be used and it's very tractable

1297
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,000
as it turns out

1298
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,119
um

1299
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,160
this

1300
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,800
free energy has tractable

1301
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,960
computation

1302
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,200
13.

1303
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,280
page 14. so

1304
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,640
now it's possible to actually use that

1305
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,599
tractable approximation

1306
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,640
and

1307
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,200
do decision making

1308
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,280
and here is where they have the decision

1309
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,839
making

1310
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,079
here argman means choose the

1311
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,079
distribution q that makes the following

1312
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:04,160
term as small as possible

1313
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,079
so this is where

1314
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:07,119
f

1315
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,319
goes from kind of being like a um a set

1316
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:12,079
of pipes with nothing really running

1317
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,760
through it

1318
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,119
to

1319
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:18,079
a specific finite set of tested

1320
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,480
alternatives those are affordances in

1321
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,400
the case of action selection

1322
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,160
they're discrete in the case of a

1323
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,599
discrete inference like is it in the

1324
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:27,760
bedroom or is it in the kitchen it's

1325
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,599
continuous in the case of a continuous

1326
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,359
inference problem like how bright is it

1327
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,599
outside on a continuous scale

1328
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:36,000
but even for continuous things sometimes

1329
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,680
we just do one through ten or one

1330
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,559
through 100 or one through 1024

1331
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,400
so discrete state spaces are really

1332
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,800
important even if there is a continuity

1333
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,880
to the world so those are the kinds of

1334
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,880
computations that variational inference

1335
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,640
helps perform

1336
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,880
it takes something that's descriptive

1337
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,119
and moves it into a decision-making

1338
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,760
imperative just like the l2 norm or

1339
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,000
least-squares is like a decision-making

1340
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,040
imperative for linear regression

1341
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,839
this is like an imperative for model

1342
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:06,800
fitting

1343
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,079
in

1344
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:09,920
this framework

1345
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,359
um

1346
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,680
the free energy principle the form here

1347
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,599
inference is the same as that of

1348
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,240
bayesian principle discussed earlier

1349
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,480
in both cases you perform a calculation

1350
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,559
and set q of w equal to the resulting

1351
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:23,520
value

1352
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,800
the difference is that bayesian

1353
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,119
principle cancels a direct calculation

1354
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,440
via bayes theorem in contrast free

1355
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,520
energy principle cancels what might be

1356
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,000
called an indirect calculation

1357
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,160
happily in practice this can be done by

1358
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,079
trial and improvement rather than trial

1359
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:39,280
and error

1360
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,640
so that's

1361
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,800
axl constants bacteria the bayesian and

1362
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,640
the variational bacterium

1363
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,559
combined with

1364
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,240
going to the bottom of the bowl on the

1365
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,160
smooth gradient descent landscape with a

1366
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,680
straight arrow utility and the

1367
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,880
solenoidal epistemic component

1368
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,960
various algorithms for finding q the

1369
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,040
distribution we control are available

1370
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,400
depending on the details of the

1371
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,880
generative model classic citation that

1372
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:05,760
gets

1373
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,520
referred to a lot

1374
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,200
one of the developments that prefigured

1375
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,440
active inference

1376
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,960
was the implementation of such an

1377
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,880
algorithm in a neural network first in

1378
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,720
2005.

1379
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,200
old citation classic

1380
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,800
we're seeing that again

1381
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,880
in model stream 5 in

1382
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,440
alex chance's work and of many others

1383
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,760
that this format

1384
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,920
even long before active inference

1385
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,319
brought it onto the scene in our

1386
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:34,880
little side stage

1387
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,200
using neural networks to fit variational

1388
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,040
bayesian methods

1389
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,800
was a common technique in machine

1390
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,359
learning stephen

1391
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:45,760
so when we say trial and improvement

1392
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,040
rather than trial and error it's

1393
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,480
basically saying

1394
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,359
that the error can be used and utilized

1395
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,800
in an ongoing way it's not like you have

1396
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,480
to start from scratch and come up with

1397
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,760
another

1398
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,400
attempt from scratch you're

1399
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,160
you know you're using

1400
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,480
what it the same basic architecture and

1401
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,160
just keep running

1402
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,079
it's so true i never really thought how

1403
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,720
demoralizing trial and error was

1404
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,040
like how should we get stronger oh well

1405
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,079
you're going to try and then you're

1406
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:13,520
going to fail

1407
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,680
when error is perceived as a failure

1408
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,599
naively but trial improvement would be

1409
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:18,640
like we're going to try and we're going

1410
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,680
to improve

1411
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,559
so

1412
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,480
yes of course error is implicit in that

1413
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,240
dean

1414
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,599
yeah and i'm glad you used the bowl

1415
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:28,000
analogy because one of the things that i

1416
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,520
read and i was actually on the

1417
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,440
highlighted trial and improvement thing

1418
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,480
because

1419
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,079
for example if you had the bowl filled

1420
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:35,680
with water and a ping-pong ball floating

1421
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,720
on top

1422
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,440
and you had to drill a hole because you

1423
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,599
wanted the ping pong ball to settle at

1424
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,240
the bottom of the bowl at a certain time

1425
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,160
you could you could continuously improve

1426
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,160
by adding more holes of a certain

1427
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,640
diameter until you were able to get that

1428
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,280
flow rate and have that ping pong ball

1429
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,000
arrive at the bottom of that bowl at the

1430
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,559
particular time at the discrete time

1431
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,720
that you were looking for that's not an

1432
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,280
error thing that's just a we'll continue

1433
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,280
to get a little bit closer and closer

1434
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,440
we'll we'll figure out what the dosage

1435
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,920
is and i agree with you a lot of people

1436
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,160
think it that the basic research part of

1437
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:15,280
it is oh i failed no a lot of this stuff

1438
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,319
is

1439
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,480
i test it and then i test it again and

1440
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,119
then i oh i came really really close so

1441
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,119
now the difference is really low which

1442
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,599
is what these authors are talking about

1443
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:26,880
all right i'm just going to continue on

1444
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,720
because we do have a ton more to do so

1445
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,880
that's still on the perception side

1446
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,319
we're not talking about where we're

1447
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:34,079
going to go walking we're talking about

1448
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:35,760
the sound of the cat and where the cat

1449
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,240
is located in the infants and so we're

1450
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,119
still within this empirical variational

1451
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:43,839
catfence area

1452
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:45,359
this is the bull

1453
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:46,640
this is

1454
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,960
fitting that distribution the conjoint

1455
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,880
distribution that's the free energy

1456
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,160
distribution

1457
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,440
and that is the one that's bowl like

1458
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,599
so here is the variational free energy

1459
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:00,160
of the black line and it's basically

1460
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:04,160
the com composition of two factors

1461
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,160
penalty for overfitting and the penalty

1462
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,079
for failing to explain the data and each

1463
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:10,160
of those have a certain distribution

1464
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,040
underneath them in this setting

1465
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:13,839
so

1466
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:17,760
their combination is like f plus g of x

1467
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,240
it's like h of x it's just adding

1468
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,480
functions together so it's just another

1469
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,400
cost fitting function

1470
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,319
for the really specific kinds of models

1471
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:29,040
that we're talking about here

1472
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,280
let's bring in action

1473
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,160
so now it's still the same case of w and

1474
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,559
x going to the agent now notice that the

1475
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:38,960
agent wasn't drawn in the previous model

1476
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,040
it was just w to x

1477
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,440
so that was um probably graphical as

1478
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,280
well as somewhat of a conceptual

1479
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,640
simplification like i mean these

1480
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,920
measurements it shouldn't matter who's

1481
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,240
observing them right oh wait

1482
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,880
quantum it does

1483
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,240
but now the agent can also take action z

1484
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,480
so z is going to be the whole question

1485
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,800
of control theory and cybernetics and

1486
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,319
action

1487
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:03,520
the previous section dealt with

1488
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,200
inference rule how to choose q of world

1489
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,520
states beliefs on world states this

1490
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,760
section is about acting

1491
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,400
now suppose you can perform an action z

1492
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,160
that will place the cat in one of two

1493
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,040
rooms by changing the hidden state w

1494
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,960
you can indirectly change future values

1495
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,640
of x or at least change their

1496
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,040
proportions or their likelihood

1497
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,839
so decision rules stem from measures of

1498
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:27,839
preference because if you don't know

1499
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:29,280
where you're going you're lost or if you

1500
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,960
don't care about the two things then it

1501
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,040
doesn't really matter

1502
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,119
one of the confusing aspects of active

1503
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:36,319
inference is that it treats the

1504
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:39,200
statistical model p

1505
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,599
the one that is the actual distribution

1506
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:43,599
we're trying to get close to and this is

1507
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:45,440
like the key point that we'll be

1508
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,000
returning to for our whole life

1509
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,280
that model p

1510
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,359
is a measure of both probabilities and

1511
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:53,440
preferences at the same time

1512
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,119
and that's going to be what we continue

1513
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:56,559
to talk about because it's one of the

1514
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:59,520
most important points that this paper

1515
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,920
makes clear in a way that other papers

1516
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:02,640
um

1517
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,920
haven't really

1518
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,920
perhaps harped on in exactly the same

1519
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,440
way

1520
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,960
let's look at figure 3 again

1521
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,960
look at the yellow part octave inference

1522
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,800
employs a controversial dual

1523
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,559
interpretation

1524
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,720
of p of w probability of world states

1525
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,559
and probability of

1526
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:22,079
observations as probability

1527
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:24,559
distributions and preference

1528
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:27,440
distributions over hidden states and

1529
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,559
sensory states specifically

1530
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,559
dean with the red text

1531
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:34,319
again i don't want to take up a bunch of

1532
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:35,920
time because we're having one of the

1533
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,160
authors or a few of the authors on we

1534
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,000
can probably pull this out a little bit

1535
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,760
but for now

1536
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,359
that when we when we introduce

1537
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:44,720
preferences

1538
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,640
and probabilities

1539
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,799
it isn't just a second

1540
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:51,280
it isn't just a second consideration it

1541
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,280
can almost run away from us really

1542
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,200
really quickly if we're not really

1543
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,599
careful in terms of

1544
00:54:57,599 --> 00:54:59,280
pulling back on the reins a little bit

1545
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,200
and really thinking about what does that

1546
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,040
imply so i'll just leave that for there

1547
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,400
for now

1548
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,880
great point thanks for sharing it

1549
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,520
succinctly

1550
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,960
they write recall that free energy

1551
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,359
principle inference counsels choosing

1552
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:16,960
beliefs by minimizing a function that

1553
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,040
measures the cost of inaccuracy and

1554
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,280
that's because the free energy

1555
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,920
calculation includes both of those

1556
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,760
variable uh features the overfitting

1557
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,040
penalty and the failure to explain

1558
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,480
penalty

1559
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,960
action selection is governed in the same

1560
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,559
way as inference remember we were

1561
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,000
talking only about inference when we

1562
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,680
were talking about the variational

1563
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,599
methods

1564
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:40,000
now there's going to be a twist

1565
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,599
a slightly different cost function

1566
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:44,000
called the expected free energy so

1567
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,359
that's why we were previously just

1568
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:49,520
talking about the f variational free

1569
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,119
energy now we're going to be talking

1570
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:53,599
about g expected free energy

1571
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,799
labeled g

1572
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:56,799
the definition of g is closely related

1573
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:58,799
to that of f

1574
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:00,400
the interpretation of the two penalty

1575
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,640
terms changes

1576
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,799
as the formalism is updated to reflect

1577
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:05,839
the fact

1578
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:07,520
we are now making measurements over

1579
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,599
expected future states

1580
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,839
so this is not just measurement error

1581
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:14,480
there's the fundamental unknowingness of

1582
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,720
the future since teacher states have yet

1583
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,040
to be observed the agent must average

1584
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,559
over them to obtain

1585
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:22,079
expected values

1586
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,799
the penalties are associated with

1587
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:27,119
failing to satisfy preferences

1588
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:30,720
and failing to minimize future surprise

1589
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,000
overfitting

1590
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,280
preferences

1591
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,799
failure to explain

1592
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:36,079
surprise

1593
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:37,680
expectation

1594
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:42,079
preferences preferences when now or then

1595
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:44,640
let's look at how those play out in this

1596
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,079
sort of

1597
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:49,119
action selection through variational

1598
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:50,319
free energy

1599
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:52,079
through time aka the expected free

1600
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:53,760
energy formulation

1601
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,160
and how those two pieces

1602
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,079
satisfying preference failure and

1603
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:00,160
failure to minimize future surprise look

1604
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,720
now but this is sort of the

1605
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,839
elaboration or the cousin of this one

1606
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,160
this is like snapshot inference

1607
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,359
and now we're going to be looking at

1608
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:13,359
expectations through time

1609
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:14,160
um

1610
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,400
okay so first filling to satisfy

1611
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,119
preferences so again keep that simpler

1612
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:21,280
version in mind this is going to be a

1613
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,040
slightly different one in six they even

1614
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,079
right

1615
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:26,880
compare equation two

1616
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:27,680
um

1617
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:28,559
this is

1618
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:31,040
make uh i hope failure uh failing to

1619
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,760
satisfy preferences given a clear enough

1620
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,000
term but it totally brings in something

1621
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,440
different which is

1622
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,760
something about the agent as dean wrote

1623
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,839
so there's big implications of course

1624
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:44,559
because there can't be a non-preference

1625
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:46,559
driven action selection

1626
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:48,799
in any useful sense

1627
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,640
whereas the variational one was just

1628
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,559
like given the scatter i want the best

1629
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:54,559
mesh and regression

1630
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:57,280
that one it does embody implicit

1631
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,119
assumptions about the world and so on

1632
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:00,960
but this takes it to a whole another

1633
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,880
level

1634
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,400
and here's where that controversial dual

1635
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,319
interpretation comes into play

1636
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:08,160
not only is it unusual to treat p as a

1637
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,920
preference distribution

1638
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,359
it is unusual to treat the goal of

1639
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:12,640
decision making to produce a

1640
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,400
distribution that matches that

1641
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,480
distribution rather than maximizing

1642
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,400
expected utility

1643
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,440
so you don't need a preference

1644
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,760
distribution other than more

1645
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,200
for reward learning

1646
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,839
whereas here we're trying to realize our

1647
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:27,280
preferences

1648
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,960
and match distributions rather than

1649
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,280
maximize for minimizing the divergence

1650
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,079
from

1651
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:32,960
these

1652
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,400
realistic but

1653
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,839
optimistic

1654
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:38,160
expectations so perhaps it is best to

1655
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,440
keep in mind that preference in this

1656
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,200
sense might mean something different

1657
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:45,680
than utility in the traditional sense

1658
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:48,480
stephen

1659
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,040
yeah without going back into that but

1660
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,000
the

1661
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,599
whole point of

1662
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:56,880
having this matching um distributions

1663
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,079
rather than

1664
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:00,720
um expected utility which effectively

1665
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,720
again becomes kind of like

1666
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,040
equilibrium states places where things

1667
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,720
settle and can be measured and they're

1668
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,640
kind of stable

1669
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,720
you're in this kind of realm of

1670
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,839
a more fluid flux type process so i

1671
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:15,200
think that's that's one thing and i

1672
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,960
think the other one is

1673
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,119
um this

1674
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:21,119
focus on the future the focus on

1675
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:22,720
predicting and things

1676
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,640
going into the future and how to make

1677
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,599
sense of that rather than looking back

1678
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:29,839
and trying to which is often what

1679
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:32,119
science is doing is and explain

1680
00:59:32,119 --> 00:59:33,920
retrospectively

1681
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,920
in the same way psychology

1682
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,400
is often trying to explain what it sees

1683
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,960
before it and coaching psychology is

1684
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,000
trying to

1685
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,920
see what can be done

1686
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,520
to get closer to something that's more

1687
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,880
suited

1688
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,760
great point thank you it really embodies

1689
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,319
the forward-lookingness rather than the

1690
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:54,880
optimal reward or prediction on previous

1691
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,920
observations all right so failure to

1692
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,520
minimize future surprise this is the

1693
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,520
other term failure to satisfy

1694
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,799
preferences

1695
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:05,359
now failure to minimize future surprise

1696
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:07,760
formalism seven

1697
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,440
one of the tenets of active inference is

1698
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,440
that asians should act this is in a

1699
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,359
normative

1700
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,920
stance to ensure that future data are

1701
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,920
not too surprising

1702
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:22,480
and so here is the formalism as written

1703
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:26,720
this is the failure to minimize surprise

1704
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,599
in addition to conditionalizing on z

1705
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:30,960
z is action

1706
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,160
so

1707
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,280
we know that the vertical line is

1708
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,680
conditioning on and then z are the

1709
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:38,079
affordances like the action states in

1710
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:39,520
this simple example we're not going to

1711
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,440
go into the markov to the policy into

1712
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,200
the action state yet this is from the

1713
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:46,480
simpler cybernetic or sort of

1714
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,319
agent environment framing that doesn't

1715
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:50,720
distinguish that as clearly but z is

1716
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,160
just an action

1717
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:55,119
that the agent engages in

1718
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:56,880
the failure to minimize future surprise

1719
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,040
is conditioned on z

1720
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,559
so it's not that there's some sort of

1721
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:02,720
world that we're not altering and then

1722
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:05,119
we're doing some strategy in that in

1723
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:06,559
alterable world

1724
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:09,520
leading to this total ad hoc way of

1725
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:12,319
integrating the outcomes of action into

1726
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,839
the niche

1727
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:16,160
the world states in the future have

1728
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:19,200
expectations that must be calculated as

1729
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,240
expecting on policy selection

1730
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,160
so it's not just that some policies have

1731
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,920
effect and some don't it's that the

1732
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,839
inference of

1733
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:30,480
the future failure to minimize surprise

1734
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,640
is conditioned statistically in the

1735
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,960
algorithm on the choices

1736
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,480
now when that includes choices about

1737
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,760
beliefs

1738
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,640
doesn't it get so interesting

1739
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,879
so

1740
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,760
that is one of the cool parts about this

1741
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,119
calculation

1742
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:48,720
um and then

1743
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,799
this expected free energy oh okay steven

1744
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:52,640
yes scott

1745
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,400
that also brings in an element of this

1746
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,039
contextuality it's it's it's what sort

1747
01:01:57,039 --> 01:01:58,720
of choices

1748
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,480
were made then

1749
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,640
in context

1750
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,559
x or well let's not use

1751
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:07,839
that context right it's important and

1752
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:10,160
it changes things and you can't do that

1753
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,480
if you're taking averages

1754
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,440
um

1755
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:17,200
and sort of pre-built models

1756
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,359
okay so now just like we kind of looked

1757
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:21,039
at the two parts separately and then

1758
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:22,640
summated into

1759
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,280
f the variational free energy and then

1760
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,680
looked at those two parts here

1761
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,839
we've gotten to equation eight in the

1762
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:30,880
paper

1763
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,400
which is g

1764
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,359
which is

1765
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:36,079
a function of those two distributions p

1766
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:37,920
and q as well as action and here are

1767
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,400
those two pieces that we just discussed

1768
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,720
and then they write the third input to g

1769
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,000
g

1770
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,240
is z rather than x

1771
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,119
so not observations but action

1772
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:50,799
as mentioned above this is because we

1773
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:53,200
are calculating the expected value over

1774
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:56,079
possible future sensory states

1775
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:58,240
rather than inferring on the basis of a

1776
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,200
sensory state that has just occurred

1777
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,160
okay so that's exactly what steven said

1778
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,960
f is really good for sensory inference

1779
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,280
it's about giving the just observed

1780
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,839
sensory data what the estimate of the

1781
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:13,599
world should snap to

1782
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:14,880
but action

1783
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,640
is totally different not just because it

1784
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,640
entails preferences like dean raised but

1785
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,480
also because the consequences of action

1786
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,400
in the future are unknown

1787
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,280
so

1788
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,599
the distribution for

1789
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:28,160
planning as inference for action as

1790
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:30,480
inference rather than for perception as

1791
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:31,839
inference

1792
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:35,280
needs to require conditionalizing on

1793
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,680
action not on sense

1794
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,319
even though sense does come into play

1795
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:42,799
it's a little bit like hidden away

1796
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:44,240
here's the what we're getting at which

1797
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,559
is the sensory distribution noticeably

1798
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:50,079
not here but on the right side only

1799
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:51,119
and then

1800
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:53,760
the function that we're minimizing on is

1801
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:57,200
action inference active inference

1802
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,520
as with f the measure g suggests the

1803
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,599
principle free energy principle in terms

1804
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:04,240
of action not as inference

1805
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,119
is minimizing the free energy on action

1806
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:08,480
selection

1807
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,240
that can be read as an approximation of

1808
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:13,039
not optimal bayesian sensing

1809
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:14,640
but optimal bayesian design of

1810
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,039
experiments and optimal bayesian

1811
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:19,760
decision theory

1812
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,520
dean

1813
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,920
and i think right here is i'm just

1814
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,680
pausing for one second

1815
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,280
i think that we're going to get into

1816
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,200
some more

1817
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,119
evidence of this but i think this is the

1818
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:33,440
first moment when we can say

1819
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,359
active inference and free energy well

1820
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:38,000
not free energy active inference

1821
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,200
does not necessarily constrain itself to

1822
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,920
being just a framework it's actually a

1823
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,680
filter as well

1824
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,160
because of the active part

1825
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:51,680
it's not stable it's constantly

1826
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:53,119
being updated

1827
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:54,799
because of that active piece and the

1828
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:57,039
preference piece so we could call it a

1829
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:58,720
framework but i don't think we're doing

1830
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,880
it justice there's a framework aspect to

1831
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,200
it and there's a filtering piece to it

1832
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,960
and so that's why i talk about search

1833
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,640
fields all the time so i just want to

1834
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,400
drop that seed now so that when the

1835
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,160
authors come on we can talk about that a

1836
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,240
little bit more in terms of the context

1837
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,200
that stephen mentioned about guiding

1838
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,440
awesome thank you

1839
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,599
so now we're going to return to the

1840
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:21,280
active cat friends

1841
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,359
so let us present a solution to the cat

1842
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:24,640
example

1843
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,000
for the problem to have a determinate

1844
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,839
solution we need the conditional

1845
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:29,839
distribution world state's condition on

1846
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:31,839
action z

1847
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:33,839
that means that the consequences of

1848
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:36,640
action have to be estimated if we put

1849
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,319
the cat in the kitchen it usually stays

1850
01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:40,079
there so this is again the two pieces

1851
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:42,079
that action introduces into the puzzle

1852
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:44,480
is the question of preference otherwise

1853
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:45,839
why bother

1854
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:47,760
and the question of the consequences of

1855
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:50,079
action so the red is a statement that's

1856
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,760
empirically observed

1857
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:54,799
from observed data about what happens

1858
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:57,200
what happens when you are estimating

1859
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,920
location conditioned on action this is

1860
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,400
that q of w conditioned on z

1861
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,559
and so you can see when it goes into the

1862
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:06,079
kitchen it stays in the kitchen nine out

1863
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:08,480
of ten times whereas if it puts in the

1864
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,319
bedroom after some period of time like

1865
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:12,400
steven brought up not one millisecond

1866
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,119
later but one hour later one minute

1867
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:17,280
later it's model specific

1868
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,000
it's time scale friendly it's not time

1869
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,520
scale free

1870
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,559
and then you can compute

1871
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:26,240
numbers

1872
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:28,079
having to do with action selection

1873
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:30,480
within this model

1874
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:33,200
it is worth restating how unusual it is

1875
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,359
to interpret p as a measure of both

1876
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:37,520
probabilities and preferences but i mean

1877
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,599
it's the letter p

1878
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:40,880
there's nothing wrong with treating a

1879
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,799
distribution as a measure of preferences

1880
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:44,240
distributions don't demand to be

1881
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,720
interpreted as probabilities after all

1882
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,640
but what is unorthodox

1883
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,480
in what church and in need of

1884
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,960
justification is giving the very same

1885
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,559
mathematical term two different

1886
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:57,039
interpretations within the same equation

1887
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:59,839
so that's the two eyes at once kind of

1888
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:01,520
looking back

1889
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,119
and then they go into a little bit more

1890
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:06,160
detail about what that actually means

1891
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,920
we are not aware of proponents of active

1892
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,440
inference taking this interpretive line

1893
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,680
but it appears to be a viable option so

1894
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,440
just awesome

1895
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:14,400
and clear

1896
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,400
writing and drawing something out

1897
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,280
through

1898
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,480
the re-understanding and the

1899
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:19,760
communication

1900
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,359
which happens synchronously and

1901
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:23,520
asynchronously

1902
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:24,720
one of the ways proponents of the

1903
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,079
framework turn to this unusual

1904
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,839
interpretation to their advantage is by

1905
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:30,000
casting action as a form of inference so

1906
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,640
here's from a buckley citation

1907
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,720
and that's why it's called active

1908
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:35,760
inference

1909
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,280
and we just kind of talked about it a

1910
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,440
little earlier so the mechanism

1911
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,280
underlying minimizing expected free

1912
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,200
energy is formally symmetric to

1913
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:46,240
perceptual inference

1914
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,000
formally symmetric

1915
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,839
overfitting failing to satisfy

1916
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:52,319
preferences failure to explain the data

1917
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:54,079
failure to minimize expected surprise on

1918
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:55,599
future data that's why it's the only one

1919
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:58,640
that has the x in there

1920
01:07:58,720 --> 01:07:59,920
rather than inferring the cause of

1921
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,680
sensory data an organism must infer

1922
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,280
actions that best make sensory data

1923
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,880
accord with an internal representation

1924
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,880
of the environment

1925
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,960
statistical representation not the

1926
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,480
debate on whether organisms have

1927
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,079
representations

1928
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:14,720
2.4 simple model of selection

1929
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,158
this is where the markov blanket is

1930
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:18,399
going to enter in our model x and z are

1931
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:20,479
the inputs and outputs of the agents x

1932
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:22,640
observations z actions

1933
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,759
the set x and z is the agent's markov

1934
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:26,719
blanket

1935
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:28,479
the term is derived from judea pearl's

1936
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,319
work on inference using bayesian

1937
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:33,759
networks pearl 1988 classic citation

1938
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:35,600
other live streams

1939
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,920
we talk more about marco blankets so

1940
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,520
we're not going to go into it too much

1941
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,600
more here but it's definitely the tip of

1942
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,080
an iceberg if you want to check out more

1943
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:45,679
but here

1944
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:47,359
in the sense required here

1945
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:48,960
a mark out blanket can be understood as

1946
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,479
the set of nodes that screen off the

1947
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:52,479
agent from nodes considered external to

1948
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:53,359
it

1949
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:55,279
screen off the agent or screen off the

1950
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:58,560
internal states of the statistical model

1951
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,719
another toy model will help illustrate

1952
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:02,640
consider an agent whose surface

1953
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:03,759
temperature

1954
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:06,158
x can safely lie between negative four

1955
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:08,479
and four units

1956
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,799
temperature's continuous okay

1957
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:12,399
but it's a discrete model

1958
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:14,238
and so here death is coming into the

1959
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:16,238
picture on either end too hot and too

1960
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:17,040
cold

1961
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:18,479
so this is going to be like variational

1962
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:20,640
cap friends but now it's a freezing and

1963
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,520
a burning end of the room and the cat

1964
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,238
or the robot cat is going to be making

1965
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:28,158
decisions about what to do so the

1966
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:30,399
external world state is w the

1967
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:31,359
temperature

1968
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:34,640
and then the perception is going to be x

1969
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,799
the observation

1970
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:38,799
notice that the value of w does not

1971
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:40,960
affect the agent's preferences so the

1972
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,319
preferences for living or for

1973
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:44,719
homeostasis or whatever regardless of

1974
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:47,839
the observations in that snapshot moment

1975
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:49,359
but not precluded over longer time

1976
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:51,439
skills all the agent directly cares

1977
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:53,359
about is its surface temperature denoted

1978
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:55,280
by x that's why the two rows are

1979
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,400
identical

1980
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,800
so these are sort of the observations

1981
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,000
and

1982
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,960
the different um actions that can be

1983
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:05,760
taken to move between

1984
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,320
um one end and the other perceiving only

1985
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,880
the temperature

1986
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:16,080
the agent tries to guess how to act how

1987
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:20,159
to stay within its expected range

1988
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:22,239
and then this is sort of the intuitive

1989
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:24,080
pseudo code when the temperature is high

1990
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,239
you want to go towards the lower end

1991
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:28,159
when the temperature is low you want to

1992
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:30,560
act to go towards the higher end

1993
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,560
and so here is like the simple example

1994
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,400
this is kind of like the bacteria that

1995
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:35,920
has the right priors versus the one

1996
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,640
that's just deciding randomly or without

1997
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:39,760
any

1998
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,840
resemblance of relationship to the other

1999
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:47,360
observations and so here is the smart

2000
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:48,480
agent

2001
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,560
that's just keeping its free energy

2002
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:53,199
every time it gets up as it moves away

2003
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:55,360
it acts to bring it back down into

2004
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,960
alignment

2005
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:59,600
and then here's um the agent's control

2006
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,760
over its external state is 95 percent

2007
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,600
accurate so five percent of the time it

2008
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,679
slips and then that's what they say it's

2009
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:08,880
grasp slips the optimal control the

2010
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:09,920
handle

2011
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:13,120
has been lost because of a motor

2012
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,760
ineffectuality but that can be recovered

2013
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:18,159
whereas the randomly acting or just sort

2014
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:20,400
of like the sort of brownian

2015
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,280
walk

2016
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:25,360
diffusion process ends up um dying

2017
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,520
okay dean

2018
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,760
uh all i was gonna say here is is

2019
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,159
did it create did a great explanation

2020
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:34,080
and if this was your first encounter

2021
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,440
with the w

2022
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,040
and the zed

2023
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,480
and the x

2024
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,480
you'd have to really really slow this

2025
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:41,360
down

2026
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:44,159
because the first time you encounter it

2027
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:46,400
it's it it takes more than one pass you

2028
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,400
might have to go over it a third and a

2029
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,000
fifth and a seventh time for it to

2030
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,800
actually make sense because there is we

2031
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,600
all have a certain capacity in terms of

2032
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,440
the amount of variables we can juggle at

2033
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:58,320
once

2034
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,640
and i was when i first looked at this it

2035
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:03,199
it made sense to me but i could sense

2036
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:05,120
from somebody who's maybe coming from a

2037
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,199
philosophical background

2038
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:09,120
and not necessarily having the same

2039
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:12,080
degree of statistical

2040
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,679
um

2041
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:15,760
hands-on experience as maybe the three

2042
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,760
of us do this would be a moment where

2043
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,360
you really want somebody to hold your

2044
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:22,360
hand

2045
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:23,840
that's what

2046
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:27,440
community and active lab is for

2047
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:28,560
because then it can be like an

2048
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,400
interaction and every question is

2049
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,640
welcome so as long as there's attention

2050
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,080
in the game

2051
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:37,920
everybody's gonna make it stephen yeah

2052
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,360
so this also does give an indication

2053
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:42,159
that

2054
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:42,960
with

2055
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,960
variational free energy

2056
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,120
having some sort of perturbations can be

2057
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,239
useful

2058
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:50,800
particularly if you had multiple

2059
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,120
um parallel kind of sources of

2060
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,320
information

2061
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:56,719
being integrated

2062
01:12:56,719 --> 01:12:59,600
it so having some noise is a good thing

2063
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,520
right it's not it's actually gives you a

2064
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:04,080
way to start to make inferences one

2065
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,080
question is there

2066
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,840
that on the left there's no real

2067
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:10,159
learning happening

2068
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:12,080
but it still makes it even without the

2069
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:15,600
learning component still is more stable

2070
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,040
um yes it's not doing parameter updating

2071
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:20,800
it's just like

2072
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,600
um a previously learned association

2073
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,040
between the temperature and the

2074
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:26,560
direction to move

2075
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,640
and also notice like the observation of

2076
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:30,880
sensory is assumed to be perfect here so

2077
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,560
there's many layers which can be brought

2078
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,719
in but this is kind of like the kernel

2079
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:36,000
motif

2080
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,520
okay

2081
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:40,000
the correspondence between

2082
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,239
high values of f

2083
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:43,920
and life-threatening states lead to a

2084
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,000
third form of the free energy principle

2085
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
so we had inference and action

2086
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,640
perceptual inference then we had action

2087
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:53,199
selection and here is free energy

2088
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:55,199
principle selection

2089
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:57,840
any system that survives long enough

2090
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:00,560
will act so as to appear to be

2091
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:02,560
minimizing f

2092
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,159
that's the first time we got any

2093
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:07,040
discussion of far from equilibrium

2094
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,000
thermo

2095
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,719
thermodynamics of anti-dissipative

2096
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:13,120
systems resilient systems anticipatory

2097
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,400
systems

2098
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:17,040
except indirectly through action but

2099
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,280
this is the sort of selective

2100
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:20,560
darwinian

2101
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:23,520
side of fep

2102
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,679
okay of course there's a ton that could

2103
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:27,120
be said here

2104
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,040
this is not a normative principle not a

2105
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,880
suggestion to agents regarding how they

2106
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,400
should perform inference but a means of

2107
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:35,199
describing how agents behave

2108
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:37,920
axl's paper

2109
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:40,400
minimizing free energy is not living

2110
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,480
alone but living systems will be those

2111
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,000
that appear as if they've minimized free

2112
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,040
energy

2113
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:47,440
and then here i think someone wrote i

2114
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:48,960
just wrote that in there because yeah

2115
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,000
that's going to tell you what your

2116
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,400
autobiography is going to sound like

2117
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,000
given that you're still alive and can

2118
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,120
write one

2119
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:59,040
yep um my last words are

2120
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,960
in recent work firstin gives a

2121
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,880
deflationary interpretation on which

2122
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:05,600
agents do not in fact minimize anything

2123
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,199
but perform acts which can be

2124
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:09,440
interpreted as minimizing f

2125
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,440
so c

2126
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:15,520
live stream number 34 0 1 2 3.

2127
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,440
that is the reason for the emphasize

2128
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:20,560
phrase so as to appear to be minimizing

2129
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:21,679
f

2130
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:23,360
that's

2131
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:25,920
deflationary instrumentalism

2132
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,679
highlight

2133
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:29,360
despite this deflationary approach there

2134
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,880
is a link between this and the earlier

2135
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:31,840
principle

2136
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,440
agents subject to the free energy

2137
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,199
principle of inference perceptual

2138
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:37,600
inference ought to minimize f

2139
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,679
so if this is ought is tied to their

2140
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:41,760
survival then the normative principle

2141
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,600
has the same underlying justification as

2142
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,199
the descriptive principle

2143
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:46,719
so this is sort of i don't know if it's

2144
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:48,800
been noted before but basically it's

2145
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,800
equivalent to saying the evolutionary

2146
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,640
ought is an is

2147
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:55,280
so it's kind of like not from

2148
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:58,239
the fitness side the malthusian

2149
01:15:58,239 --> 01:16:00,080
darwinian side

2150
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:03,840
but from the anti-dissipative side

2151
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,840
this is how things have looked it's like

2152
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:08,560
saying fitness isn't necessarily

2153
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:11,280
being projected into the future but if

2154
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,760
you do do the computations fitness can

2155
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,600
be assigned to like different single

2156
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,840
nucleotide polymorphisms that have had

2157
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,320
different success and you will only see

2158
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:22,239
successful ones but it's a bit more

2159
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:24,159
complex than that in the moment

2160
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:26,880
so here are the three piece the tale of

2161
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:28,640
three piece we have the tale of two

2162
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,400
densities what other what other jokes

2163
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,159
have we had

2164
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:34,000
in each of the three examples discussed

2165
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
in a section there's been a distinct

2166
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,600
role for the distribution p and a

2167
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,000
distinct interpretation of each model

2168
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,280
narrow sense

2169
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,280
in our first model p was a generative

2170
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:45,120
model employed by an agent it was

2171
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,960
therefore interpreted as representing

2172
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,800
probabilities

2173
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,719
like where the cat is

2174
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:52,719
but now in order to introduce action in

2175
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:54,560
a meaningful way we had to have

2176
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,320
preference like i want the cat to be in

2177
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,360
the kitchen

2178
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,600
so when we brought action into the game

2179
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,040
we had to

2180
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,560
introduce preference

2181
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:04,320
what makes active inference

2182
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,400
similar but also different from other

2183
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:07,520
frameworks

2184
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:08,960
probabilities and preferences are

2185
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,400
represented by p

2186
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:11,520
in addition to representing

2187
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,199
probabilities in the second model p

2188
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:14,880
measured the desirability of certain

2189
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,880
future states over others

2190
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:19,120
i expect you to go to school every day

2191
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:20,400
that's something having to do with

2192
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:21,440
action

2193
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,040
if it's serious

2194
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,480
it was therefore interpreted as

2195
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,480
representing preferences

2196
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,239
in our third model p tallied the

2197
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:30,159
historical frequencies of a set of

2198
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:32,239
hypothetical ancestors

2199
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:34,400
fitness it was therefore interpreted as

2200
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,159
representing the fitness of different

2201
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:38,320
states

2202
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,320
so supporters of the framework often

2203
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:41,920
point to the third role

2204
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,520
fitness

2205
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,199
ph

2206
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:48,000
to explain how p can simultaneously

2207
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
fulfill the first two

2208
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,199
it's like if that thermal bacteria

2209
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:54,640
is

2210
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:56,159
rocking its niche

2211
01:17:56,159 --> 01:17:59,360
it will have high fitness

2212
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:00,239
okay

2213
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:01,040
so

2214
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:02,080
that is

2215
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:04,800
where the three p's get us

2216
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,560
here's just a brief look forward so for

2217
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,320
any of these next slides we're not going

2218
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,239
to go into the actual

2219
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:12,000
very nicely fleshed out arguments

2220
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,520
themselves but stephen or dean just

2221
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:14,640
raise your hand if either of you have

2222
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,640
anything to add on like each of these

2223
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,320
section headers so

2224
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,360
um

2225
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,920
section 2.5 is extensions to the model

2226
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,800
more things to learn more ways to act

2227
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,440
we've seen adjectives added to active

2228
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:28,480
inference

2229
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:29,679
deep

2230
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:31,760
sophisticated

2231
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,600
contrastive

2232
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,120
affective

2233
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:37,199
what other adjectives have we seen

2234
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:38,960
that's sort of this section of the

2235
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:41,360
guidebook it's like there's your um usb

2236
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:42,560
port

2237
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:45,120
what can you have added into it or how

2238
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,719
can it be developed

2239
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:48,400
and so that's where we see sort of the

2240
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,159
adjectival

2241
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:52,560
family of something active inference

2242
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,960
maybe even n active inference

2243
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,040
coming more into the philosophy side but

2244
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:58,880
also there's all the elaborations that

2245
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:00,960
we've seen of the actual parametric

2246
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,199
model in the narrow sense

2247
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:05,040
sometimes it's in both camps like

2248
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:06,800
affective inference

2249
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,120
has to do with

2250
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:12,640
a model derivation or metacognition

2251
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:15,280
as well as something about like the

2252
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:17,360
model in a bigger sense

2253
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:18,080
but

2254
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:20,800
we can recognize both those lanes at

2255
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:23,440
once stephen

2256
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:26,159
yeah i mean one other one's inactive

2257
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:29,280
inference uh reciprocal active influence

2258
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,719
there's a couple more like that that's

2259
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:31,920
definitely uh

2260
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:33,360
definitely true just one thing i was

2261
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,120
gonna throw in i noticed they talked

2262
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:36,800
about this and it's i know it's in the

2263
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,760
quote but they talk about any system

2264
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,440
i always wonder whether that's a bit of

2265
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:42,640
a

2266
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:44,640
that a little bit of a

2267
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,560
piece of paving stone waiting to be

2268
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,320
tripped over um

2269
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,640
because i kind of feel like you know i

2270
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:52,480
if you're going to say it maybe any

2271
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,960
nonlinear dynamical system

2272
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:59,040
or nested systems of systems or things

2273
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,199
uh i just always think that

2274
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:04,000
that that can be a little bit of a a

2275
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,080
hazard yeah it inherits a lot of the

2276
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:08,560
legacy ambiguity around system like

2277
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,000
you've brought up a bunch of times so

2278
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,840
it's really helpful so

2279
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,679
in section three

2280
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:15,679
notice how the history brief history of

2281
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:18,159
the free energy principle comes after

2282
01:20:18,159 --> 01:20:20,159
what we just spent the last

2283
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:22,320
hours and pages on

2284
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,320
so it isn't a history of science

2285
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,159
perspective but it is being recognized

2286
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:28,000
as important and so the free energy

2287
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,920
principle is a modern incarnation of

2288
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:32,320
ideas that have been raised sporadically

2289
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:36,080
over at least the five decades

2290
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:37,600
it combines traditions from physics

2291
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:38,960
biology neuroscience and machine

2292
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:42,400
learning and other areas especially

2293
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:45,199
the modifications and increasingly the

2294
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:48,159
applications and it's a bi-directional

2295
01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:50,719
freeway it's not just two lanes in both

2296
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:51,840
direction

2297
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,840
it's going both ways

2298
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,520
so this is sort of the history which is

2299
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:57,120
fun because it's a

2300
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,120
recent history in some

2301
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,280
parts

2302
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:02,560
okay

2303
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,080
section four

2304
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,679
moves from the historical to the

2305
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:08,000
philosophical so section four dialectic

2306
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,520
the free energy principle and related

2307
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:10,880
claims

2308
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:12,480
mathematical empirical and general

2309
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,719
claims section 4.1

2310
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:17,040
this is where all that mathematics

2311
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,560
groundwork

2312
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:21,360
pays off because in the author's words

2313
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:22,960
we think a great deal of confusion can

2314
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:24,800
be overcome by considering three kinds

2315
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:25,920
of claims

2316
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:28,480
first there are mathematical claims

2317
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:30,400
those were the ones that were just

2318
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:33,120
brought up in earlier sections

2319
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,840
so that's the theorems the scientific

2320
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:38,159
models and the statistical techniques in

2321
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:40,239
the more narrow sense

2322
01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:42,159
and by doing good scholarship we show

2323
01:21:42,159 --> 01:21:43,920
that the core features absolutely

2324
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,159
predate active inference and there's

2325
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:48,159
less controversial than some might

2326
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:50,080
suspect

2327
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,000
however christian colleagues have since

2328
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,520
introduced many novel mathematical

2329
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:54,560
elements

2330
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,639
like the perception and action

2331
01:21:56,639 --> 01:21:59,280
interpretation on the markov blanket

2332
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,520
importantly claims in this category do

2333
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,880
not need to be interpreted as statements

2334
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,159
about real systems in order to be

2335
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:06,719
evaluated so part one is its

2336
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:09,199
instrumentalism part two is separate the

2337
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:10,960
parts that predate active inference from

2338
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:13,360
some of these more recent derivations

2339
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:16,800
even within the only technical area

2340
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,040
second area of confusion

2341
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,719
or the second way that confusion can be

2342
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:22,800
overcome by considering another kind of

2343
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:23,679
claim

2344
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:24,400
is

2345
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,239
partitioning off you know we're going to

2346
01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:27,679
add like a line here from that

2347
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:29,280
mathematical everything that was in the

2348
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,199
section that we just discussed plus

2349
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:34,560
stuff that was more recent like 32

2350
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,080
there are empirical claims about

2351
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:38,000
cognitive and biological systems how

2352
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,159
brains and bodies actually work

2353
01:22:40,159 --> 01:22:41,600
these are the remit of cognitive

2354
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,520
neuroscience and biology

2355
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:46,400
so those are empirical biological claims

2356
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,639
third are general claims that typically

2357
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:51,040
abstract across a wide range or by class

2358
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:53,199
of empirical claims so that's like the

2359
01:22:53,199 --> 01:22:54,320
sort of

2360
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,639
everything nested systems collective

2361
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:58,480
behavior angle so

2362
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,400
separating those and maybe there's more

2363
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,000
is really helpful because sometimes

2364
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,679
people say well this general claim is

2365
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:06,239
true because look at how this in the

2366
01:23:06,239 --> 01:23:08,239
skin works well what about the skin well

2367
01:23:08,239 --> 01:23:10,000
that look at how the math works and why

2368
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,280
does the math work that way because of

2369
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:15,199
the general claim is that an argument

2370
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:17,120
what is the justification

2371
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,360
and the links among these dialectical

2372
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:20,800
categories

2373
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,560
well if there's three kinds of claims

2374
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:25,520
mathematical empirical in general then

2375
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:28,000
there are all the edges of that triangle

2376
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,600
if you had a fourth one you'd have all

2377
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,199
the edges of a tetrahedra and then you'd

2378
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:33,120
almost have a model

2379
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:35,600
the mathematical to empirical direction

2380
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:38,080
invites philosophical analysis due to

2381
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:40,000
novel interpretations of scientific

2382
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,440
model terms

2383
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,440
so how can math be used to justify

2384
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:44,880
empirical claims

2385
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,199
why does equations have anything to do

2386
01:23:47,199 --> 01:23:49,040
with what people say about the brain and

2387
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:50,800
the body in the niche

2388
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:53,360
why is that justified at all

2389
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:55,040
other than just other people in their

2390
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,880
epistemic authority have done it or it's

2391
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:00,159
how it has been done stephen

2392
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:02,480
instrumentalism also it gives a kind of

2393
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:04,239
a bridge between

2394
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:07,280
realist science and applied science

2395
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:10,239
um and it's kind of sitting somewhere

2396
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:11,760
between the two

2397
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:12,719
um

2398
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:14,560
so i think that's uh

2399
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:16,719
that's quite a useful piece that this

2400
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:19,199
adds to this it's an equation

2401
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:20,159
nice

2402
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:22,320
and then the last two edges of that

2403
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:23,440
triangle

2404
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:26,560
are how can mathematical not both

2405
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:28,639
directions on each edge

2406
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:30,719
you could add but how can mathematical

2407
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:32,719
claims justify general claims

2408
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:35,440
well how could you say that about nested

2409
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:38,159
systems about nested markov blankets

2410
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:40,239
the math

2411
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:41,120
okay

2412
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:43,040
that's important to investigate

2413
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:44,960
and how can general claims justify

2414
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:47,040
empirical claims how could you say that

2415
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:49,520
about the ants well

2416
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:52,719
fitness or dissipative systems so how

2417
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:54,960
can general systems claims

2418
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:58,400
justify anything about empirics so those

2419
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:00,080
are some of the edges

2420
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:01,520
of these three kinds of claims and

2421
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,440
there's also claims and subclaims which

2422
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:05,760
is why it's really important to have

2423
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:08,000
rhetorical ecosystem mapping

2424
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,080
and an ontology for active inference so

2425
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:11,600
that we can actually

2426
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:14,239
learn and apply across languages and

2427
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:16,480
through time stephen

2428
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:18,159
yeah and i think also we can think of

2429
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:19,120
this as

2430
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:21,440
structural and functional

2431
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:23,280
insights being gained rather than

2432
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:25,840
necessarily repeatable

2433
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:26,960
measured

2434
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:29,520
outcomes every time being gained so

2435
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,679
there's an idea that these insights

2436
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:32,880
might reveal something about the

2437
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,760
structure or the functionality of the

2438
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,120
dynamics

2439
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:40,560
knowing that no one simulation

2440
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:43,040
may ever be repeated quite the same way

2441
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,239
particularly if it's got a fair few

2442
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:45,600
variables

2443
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,639
yes

2444
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:49,600
so the concluding remarks

2445
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:51,040
the active inference framework is

2446
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:52,560
incredibly ambitious

2447
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,960
is it the framework or the people in its

2448
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:56,560
explanatory scope

2449
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:58,560
from humble beginnings as a theory of

2450
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:01,040
brain function it is now positioned as a

2451
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:03,600
framework for understanding life itself

2452
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,199
there is a critical tradition in the

2453
01:26:05,199 --> 01:26:07,120
philosophy of biology inspired by

2454
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,400
richard levins

2455
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,719
with regard to such ambitions

2456
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:12,320
many

2457
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:13,920
then

2458
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:15,679
will approach active inference with

2459
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:18,400
skepticism healthy skepticism is a good

2460
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,719
thing but healthy skepticism is informed

2461
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:23,360
skepticism unfortunately getting one's

2462
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:25,040
head around the details of active

2463
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:27,199
inference is no small task

2464
01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:28,800
our goal in this introduction has been

2465
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:31,120
to clarify the basic mathematics

2466
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:33,199
history and internal dialectics of

2467
01:26:33,199 --> 01:26:34,639
active inference

2468
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:37,280
in that order those were the sections

2469
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:41,760
and draw attention to some key concerns

2470
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,360
with these details on the table

2471
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:46,080
philosophers of biology are in a better

2472
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:47,760
position to critically evaluate the

2473
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:50,239
framework we look forward with interest

2474
01:26:50,239 --> 01:26:52,000
to seeing the results

2475
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,040
classic future looking last sentence

2476
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:55,840
so

2477
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:58,239
that's the final lines

2478
01:26:58,239 --> 01:27:01,320
we have a ton of things to discuss in

2479
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:04,960
37.1 and 2. it'd be awesome to have any

2480
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:07,360
of the authors as well as any other

2481
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:09,440
people who just want to jump on for a

2482
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:12,000
returning or a first time discussion

2483
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,600
but we'll close

2484
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,840
under the buzzer in the third period i

2485
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,679
know that's how they count up there dean

2486
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:18,639
so

2487
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:22,159
any final comments on uh just

2488
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:23,199
what you're looking forward to

2489
01:27:23,199 --> 01:27:24,960
discussing

2490
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:26,719
dean first because you never get the

2491
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:28,560
last word and then stephen

2492
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:31,280
yeah i don't want the last three so

2493
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:33,040
one of the things i want to talk about

2494
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:35,280
in that point one is that the general

2495
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:37,920
claims because i get to trot out one of

2496
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,000
my favorite parables that i made up

2497
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,800
which is three functions walk into a bar

2498
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,239
and i want to be able to because i get

2499
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:45,840
lots of mileage out of that and whether

2500
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:48,239
it's three functions or it's probability

2501
01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:49,840
preference and fit

2502
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:51,840
the same holds true it can be great

2503
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:54,320
taste and less filling so i want to have

2504
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:55,760
a look at that because i think that

2505
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:58,480
really tags on to the idea that what

2506
01:27:58,480 --> 01:27:59,679
they're talking about here in terms of a

2507
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:02,080
guide could also set us up really well

2508
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:04,159
for creativity and then i also want to

2509
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:06,000
be able to say that that creativity

2510
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,840
isn't because we're framed in but

2511
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:10,800
because we can filter as well

2512
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:13,440
three interpretations of a function walk

2513
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:14,480
into a bar

2514
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,639
stephen

2515
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:20,480
yeah i'm really curious about how

2516
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:23,120
especially if we speak to the authors

2517
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:25,920
these first principles of hidden states

2518
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:28,320
and inferences and which ones are

2519
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:30,960
selected and which data is available to

2520
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:33,840
actually make inferences on can be used

2521
