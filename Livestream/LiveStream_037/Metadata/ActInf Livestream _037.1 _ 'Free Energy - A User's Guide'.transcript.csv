"Speaker 1","00;00;23;25","00;00;57;24","All right. Hello and welcome to Active Flab Live Stream Number 37.13 Energy A User's Guide. It's February 2nd. 2022 to two 2220 days till the big one. Of course welcome to Active Inference Lab. We are a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference you can find us at links here on this slide this is a recorded in an archived livestream, so please provide us with feedback so we can improve our work."
"Speaker 1","00;00;58;17","00;01;50;10","All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome and we'll be following good video etiquette for Livestream. Maybe people can raise their hand visually so there's not a little gypsy blip until we figure it out. Or by the way, go to active inference dot org if you want to learn more about participating or check the code link here. OK, today in 37.1, the goal is to learn and discuss and also appreciate having Steven Man the first author here with us this paper Free Energy A User's Guide and for this 37.1 we'll start with an introduction and then we'll just fire up some slides and here perhaps an opening in the contextualizing statement from Steven to be introduced last"
"Speaker 1","00;01;50;21","00;02;01;06","and then go into whatever questions that everyone else has brought and anyone watching love so I'm Daniel I'm a researcher in California and I will pass on to Steven."
"Speaker 2","00;02;02;25","00;02;12;15","Hello, Steven. I'm a practice based Ph.D. researcher based in Toronto, and I'll pass it over to Dean."
"Speaker 3","00;02;14;19","00;02;34;10","Morning, everybody. I'm Dean. I'm up here in Calgary. I'm I'm somebody who just did some programing, went from being an educator to a way finder. And I find guides really an interesting topic to have conversations around. I'll pass it down to blue Hi."
"Speaker 4","00;02;34;10","00;02;41;12","I'm Blue. I'm a research consultant based out of New Mexico, and I will pass it to the first author, Stephen."
"Speaker 3","00;02;44;04","00;03;02;27","Hi, everyone. And Stephen, I am a philosophy Ph.D., currently a postdoc at the in the linguistics department at the University of Surrey and a guest at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, where I live all right."
"Speaker 1","00;03;03;20","00;03;21;01","Maybe, Stephen, would you or Stephen M, would you like to just give a little context on the paper? Like how did this fit into your PhD or research interests? How did this specific collaboration come to be in the format of the paper and the way it is."
"Speaker 3","00;03;23;09","00;04;12;27","So first, thanks for having me and thanks very much for the last week session with Zero. I think you did a really excellent job at Overview and I'm really looking forward to talking about it today. This paper came about because we, myself and Ross and Michael, the other authors had been in discussions with a few of authors around a symposium discussing adaptive inference and the free energy principle and also predictive processing at the Australian Society for Philosophy and Psychology Conference in 2018 we put together a small symposium it went relatively well, and after a few more months of sort of then pursing ideas back and forth we approached Michael Weisberg, the editor of Biology and"
"Speaker 3","00;04;12;27","00;04;53;28","philosophy, about putting together a topical collection, sort of like a special issue, but sort of collected digitally and eventually sort of after sort of pitching it to him and managing to get to talk to him in person, he said that he and the other editors were quite excited, but what they wanted was an introduction from us that would explain the mathematics and the philosophical dialectics behind sort of at the core of active inference and the free energy principle in a way that was accessible for philosophers and so we said, Sure, we can do that."
"Speaker 3","00;04;54;07","00;05;31;20","And that was a little while ago. We started soliciting other papers. We've now published most of the papers in that topical collection, and since then at the same time sort of finalizing, finishing off my Ph.D. and then moving to Europe from Australia with my Ph.D. was we were getting to grips with the real mathematical core of active inference and trying to figure out what was the necessary mathematics to explain the basics of the framework and then how to present that mathematics to a philosopher legal audience who has sort of some mathematical competence."
"Speaker 3","00;05;32;12","00;06;08;19","And the result is the current preprint. So we think we're probably about one more set of provisions away from submitted for publication, and it will eventually come out as the introduction to that topical collection. So what I'm really interested in hearing from everyone else today the same thing, we're interested preparing for the wider community, which is the reason we released the preprint, which is just comments and suggestions and any kind of corrections that can help improve the paper so that its final form is sort of even better as good as we can make it OK."
"Speaker 1","00;06;08;29","00;06;11;17","Thanks for the awesome context. Steven s."
"Speaker 2","00;06;13;00","00;06;36;23","Thank you. Yeah, we really enjoy in this paper and one thing will be interesting to, to think about, even though you sort of I think maybe a philosophy audience is some of the aspects of it this nascent kind of foundational level could help in an applied context that may be beyond the modeling so we're kind of interested in some of that."
"Speaker 2","00;06;36;23","00;06;54;00","So that might be something we might tap into, even if it's not in the remit of this paper's direct publication. I think it would be really helpful in the broader sort of journey of using active influence in the world awesome."
"Speaker 1","00;06;55;13","00;07;04;11","OK, Blue or Dean, would you like to start with a question? Or we can return to one of the points that we're already kind of brought up."
"Speaker 3","00;07;07;08","00;07;07;28","I'm good for now."
"Speaker 1","00;07;09;14","00;07;40;18","OK, so maybe just one starting point was just what backgrounds like how did you go from thinking about who you wanted to make the paper accessible to, to writing in a certain way? And then you mentioned it was for philosophers. So what is the impact in this community that you'd like to how would you like to update their generative models nicely put."
"Speaker 3","00;07;42;28","00;08;31;06","First and foremost, we would like to fix in their mind the relationship between variational inference and Bayesian inference. So I know that's something you've talked about before. It's something that predates the free energy principle and active inference as an explanatory framework for cognitive science and biology. And it's something which, as far as I can tell, is sort of the first step in understanding what's going on with that mathematics so that's the sort of the key thing we want philosophers to sort of have in their minds also because almost all philosophers, especially philosophers, have cognitive science but but also philosophers of biology will be familiar with Bayesian inference, at least to some extent."
"Speaker 3","00;08;31;22","00;09;04;08","So by pointing out that what active inference is, is something sort of a step to the right of Bayesian, something that they can start to understand by analogy with that, we hope it will stop them from sort of getting scared of all the complicated mathematics that you can read in order papers so that's on the math side. On the philosophy side, a lot of the stuff in section four of the paper was our attempt to really strip back a lot of the claims that were being made, but also sort of categorize the claims being made."
"Speaker 3","00;09;04;24","00;09;31;14","One thing that I noticed in reading the literature and attempting to understand it was that different kinds of claims were being conflated and that was jumping around from claims in different domains, mathematical claims that suddenly leverage to justify an empirical claim and then suddenly move to an extremely general claim about all of cognitive science or all of biology in general."
"Speaker 3","00;09;32;00","00;09;48;28","So that's the second thing we want the philosophers to get that it is possible to disentangle these claims despite the fact that they are habitually sort of conflated or not made distinct enough in the rest of the literature All right."
"Speaker 1","00;09;49;07","00;10;12;22","One follow up and then I see Stephen and Dean, you mentioned that Bayesian inference, maybe more familiar, especially because it's used in all kinds of modern statistical descriptive approaches as well as generative. Just to hear it in your own words, where do you think variation or inference is more familiar? So who does it represent? Who's more familiar with variational methods or who would be familiar?"
"Speaker 1","00;10;13;01","00;10;17;20","And then what are the key differences sure."
"Speaker 3","00;10;17;20","00;11;15;14","So my understanding is that physicists, statisticians and machine learning practitioners may well have come across variation inference. Certainly will have had a much better chance of having come across variation inference than philosophers, at least as of 20, 22. What I understand variation inference to be is a certain kind of technique for choosing a probability distribution over unobserved states that started in physics, as I understand it, with Feynman, although I put a little footnote in the pre-print pointing out that I haven't been able to translate the stuff in that Feynman book to the latest stuff, especially stuff that David Mackay talks about in his textbook on information theory, which includes some issues in variation inference, but"
"Speaker 3","00;11;15;14","00;11;38;18","as I understand it started in physics, then was adopted into sort of statistics more broadly as a means of approximating Bayesian inference in cases where exact Bayesian inference is too difficult to carry out, too computationally difficult, and then moved from statistics into machine learning where it's possible to actually build machine learning algorithms or systems that can perform variation inference."
"Speaker 3","00;11;39;01","00;11;41;26","And then from there and then in the active inference framework."
"Speaker 1","00;11;45;03","00;11;47;21","All right. Thank you. So, Dean, first."
"Speaker 3","00;11;50;00","00;12;13;07","Steven, thanks for joining us. Really appreciate it. Is a question for you now that now that an examination of the situation and situation, as you stated, was kind of math and philosophy. Now I've got a relationship and we're going to open up a guidebook or a primer."
"Speaker 1","00;12;13;29","00;12;14;27","When the when the."
"Speaker 3","00;12;15;04","00;12;48;01","Pump is primed. What do you see as being the effect of that that relationship between the sort of philosophical audience and the and the math that was used to get us to this place the relationship between the philosophical audience and the math that was used to get us to this place. I mean, first and foremost, I want the philosophical audience to gain a certain kind of facility with the math."
"Speaker 3","00;12;49;09","00;13;25;11","I think one of you I'm not sure who of you was that in the point zero put it extremely well by saying it's like learning how the horse moves in chess. I think it might have been Daniel, but I don't want to miss attribute it to you. Giving the philosophical audience the basic understanding of the most basic math will give them that first kind of tool, which they can then go on if they so wish to build up and learn more of the moves, learn more of the complex math if they want to, then go on and interrogate the rest of that literature, which is more complex we've tried to sort of forego too much"
"Speaker 3","00;13;25;18","00;13;37;10","critical analysis in the paper. There is some in there. We've tried to forego that a little bit just in order to get the understanding of that math across. OK."
"Speaker 1","00;13;40;16","00;14;13;21","Again, follow up there. What does it matter for the philosophers? So what are they in your sense or their sense? What will, knowing the difference between Bayesian and Variational, help them evaluate or what will seeing it structured this way help them evaluate I think there's a few. So I hope other people also can think of philosophical questions that knowing the difference between the two would help you change your mind on yeah."
"Speaker 3","00;14;13;21","00;14;36;09","I mean, the simple answer is just it will help them understand what forest them is claiming. And by forest, then of course, I'm using him as just an umbrella for anybody who's writing positively in the active interest tradition, attempting to demonstrate that the active inference framework can provide or inform certain process theories that explain cognitive or biological systems."
"Speaker 3","00;14;37;18","00;14;48;02","Philosophers need to know the difference between Bayesian inference or variational inference because they need to know what it is that Frishman is claiming can be attributed to systems like this."
"Speaker 1","00;14;53;22","00;14;55;01","OK, blue on that."
"Speaker 4","00;14;58;10","00;15;32;12","So I have a question and like maybe I missed it and I was looking, I just said like a click control on a paper just to make sure that I didn't miss it. And I'm not misinterpreting. But in your explanation of the generative model, like I just wonder why you didn't choose to go into the recognition model. And I think that why you discuss at length like PS and Qs why did you leave that out or do you think it's not significant or did I miss it and did you talk about it."
"Speaker 3","00;15;35;25","00;16;03;19","So by the recognition model, I understand that to be a sort of alternative way of doing inference that an agent could employ. So I'm just I'm saying what I understand by so you can correct me before I try to answer the question, I understand it to be. Yeah. And an alternative to generative inference is just to employ a kind of recognition model which simply takes in data and immediately produces some kind of statistical result from that data."
"Speaker 3","00;16;04;01","00;16;26;15","It doesn't need to simulate or generate its own data and then compare that to what it sees. That would be the generative way. Instead, it just applies some kind of, say, mathematical statistical function to the data and then gets a kind of result which describes what it hasn't observed. Is that what you mean by recognition model so no."
"Speaker 4","00;16;26;24","00;17;02;12","I'm referring to the paper, the tale of two densities, the 2019 paper by grams to that out. And in that paper they, they refer to the recognition model as the Q right the inverse of the likelihood model. It's the mapping from the consequences to the hidden causes. And so like you got really into the math but and discuss the, the generative model but just didn't it's like acknowledge that the recognition model, I just was curious."
"Speaker 3","00;17;03;04","00;17;19;21","So OK, so you just mean the, the distribution. Q By, by the recognition model I mean using a different. Q I haven't read a tale of two densities, I should say so. Yeah."
"Speaker 1","00;17;20;07","00;18;11;13","And the recognition model is on the, it's in the kind of namespace of expectation maximization modeling. The recognition model is like the sensory update and then the generative part was like emphasized. I hope that's not to simplify to what two densities were. And then the outbound was more like associated with the generativity and that's also that's why it's important to go from the Frequentist to the Bayesian at all, because with Bayesian generative modeling like the model can be run both ways, though it's used with different adjectives, that's like Variational Auto Encoder, that's all these methods where it's not just descriptive modeling on a data set like principle component analysis or multiple regression."
"Speaker 1","00;18;11;22","00;18;31;21","It doesn't just describe that it can be used, although those can be used or be thought of as Bayesian like maybe used in a shattered of way as well. But that's the part that people will have less empirical experience seeing. But let's think about this and then return to it next week. Yeah, OK, so Steven s."
"Speaker 2","00;18;33;16","00;19;06;07","Just following on from the Bayesian, which is often used in the embodied context, people think about embodying multi-sensory integration and that type of work, and that field is a bit challenged by moving over to this variational machine learning paradigm because it's highly mathematical. But what's interesting with active inference is sort of comes back into that being grounded in embodied action because that gives the preferences somewhere to be anchored."
"Speaker 2","00;19;06;07","00;19;18;11","So how do you see an this going back into embodied cognition as a way for those preferences to be grounded."
"Speaker 3","00;19;26;15","00;20;02;29","That's a difficult one for me to answer, in part because I'm not really part of the tradition that emphasizes embodied and inactive approaches to cognition the way I was taught it, they were sort of alternatives to the representation list tradition, and I was much more in the representation list tradition so there has been some talk of whether and how free energy approaches support one or the other of those two traditions."
"Speaker 3","00;20;05;02","00;20;34;22","And to some extent, because I'm already sympathetic to the representation of tradition, I'm already leaning towards the idea that free energy approach will support that as opposed to an embodied or inactive kind of approach, which is sort of a shame because like all of those kinds of binaries, it's probably somewhat a false dichotomy and it just means that, you know, my direct my attention has been directed elsewhere than your attention in looking at these issues."
"Speaker 3","00;20;36;09","00;20;42;03","And so, yeah, I don't have enough of value to add, unfortunately."
"Speaker 1","00;20;44;25","00;21;22;28","Think it yes, Steven was saying, but our previous paper, 36 was like a taxonomy of prospec tives on the representation question. And so I think we're all very primed to just take it totally open stance and is, is every possible stance for every person to focus on. It's just kind of not within our time and attention capacity so I think it just speaks to like a diverse field where of course people are focusing on chemistry of this element, of that element."
"Speaker 1","00;21;23;08","00;21;38;07","It won't be exactly that split, but in the broadening field of like active inference in FFP, there's going to be people who are focused more on one question rather so that's kind of cool. So like no where we have similar regimes of attention or not."
"Speaker 2","00;21;38;11","00;22;10;21","Stephen Yeah, I'm agreeing with Daniel. And also actually we found this really, really helpful from an embodied perspective because the way that you separated or you gave the probabilities and preferences of working together was it was kind of like a deflated or a more nascent form of representation. And that jives quite nicely with potential ways that an active approaches are also potentially there because of the nature of preferences."
"Speaker 2","00;22;11;03","00;22;37;21","So you start to have a way where they can both live together because they know we were talking about this the other day, weren't we, Daniel, that that wasn't so clear how these two can live together. And often when people who are from philosopher quote the free energy principle, they talk about early papers like 2000, you know, maybe ten years ago even and that is often then a false argument gets painted."
"Speaker 2","00;22;37;21","00;22;59;20","So now we've almost got a new paper which can kind of help ground those philosophers. So I wonder what your thought is in terms of whether you are trying to help people use the most latest form of free energy principle. When they were talking about philosophy and to stop some of the conflation of just people criticizing models which are now out of date."
"Speaker 2","00;23;00;07","00;23;05;25","Um, if that was part of your rationale for the way this paper was created."
"Speaker 3","00;23;08;12","00;23;39;14","Yeah, we absolutely wanted to direct people's attention to what we thought of as the real issues. In a way, the appropriate issues. I mean we reckon that the critical assessment that is not well informed by the actual workings of the theory is not going to be helpful because you might accidentally hit on a critique that works, but only accidentally if you're going to criticize the framework, you better at least understand what's going on."
"Speaker 3","00;23;41;03","00;23;58;07","My worry is that it will become out of date as things change, but there's not a lot you can do about that. I mean, it took us quite a long time to get this first draft together to get this pre-print together. And I'm sort of hoping that things haven't changed so much that it's out of date by the time it comes out."
"Speaker 3","00;23;59;02","00;24;16;20","I mean, one way to post all that is to just be as basic as possible so that you're really capturing the core that can't possibly change but otherwise your best chance is just to publish what you've got to the particular time and keep your eye on how things change and update as you go."
"Speaker 1","00;24;18;10","00;24;19;08","Thanks, Justin."
"Speaker 3","00;24;20;13","00;24;46;18","Steven, if I use a lot of metaphors, so if you walked into a singles bar and one of the singles was a philosopher and the other single was a mathematician, and you had to guess now going through the process of building that guy right? Like you're not Match.com, but. Right. You have to make a guess as to whether that long term relationship, they walk out hand in hand or they're completely repulsed by one another."
"Speaker 3","00;24;47;06","00;24;57;17","I know it always depends, but you're talking about updating the guide. I'm kind of want to go back one previous step. What keeps them together? What pulls them apart?"
"Speaker 3","00;25;02;12","00;25;25;17","Yeah. So how do you write what is essentially a philosophy paper but include mathematics in a way that does justice to both is roughly how I'm hearing that question. Well, the long term relationship, right? Like they still get to have some compatibility and that fidelity. Right? And so it's point was up to now, it's been I don't know if I even want to go to the bar."
"Speaker 3","00;25;26;02","00;25;54;25","So that's that's what I'm asking, you know, based on what you've what you've journeyed into. Right. Because not everybody I know I appreciate the idea of the guidebook because not everybody goes into situations freely, right? Sometimes you get dropped into situations and it's a little bit more intense. But what causes people to go really into that kind of relationship and sustain it over a long enough period that it does make sense?"
"Speaker 3","00;25;55;20","00;26;08;04","Does it remain kind of a superficial thing or just a concept, but it actually becomes realized? It was curious what your thoughts on that are mm."
"Speaker 3","00;26;11;16","00;26;35;28","I think that you know, trying hard not to repeat myself too much. The way the way I try to think about the question is to try and think about what has prevented philosophers from really accessing the mathematical parts of active inference so far. And that's just from sort of communicating with philosophers and talking to them and hearing that dissatisfaction with it."
"Speaker 3","00;26;36;12","00;27;13;26","And it was always just that there was, there was too much of it too fast. And so the sort of the only approach we could see that could remedy that was to go as slow as possible in a way. And so spend sort of have a much heavier ratio ratio of words to equations in a way, and go into much much more depth in explaining each equation as it comes along rather than throwing all in at once and then decomposing it."
"Speaker 3","00;27;14;12","00;27;38;26","Right. I mean, we one of the earlier versions of the draft, we started with the main equations and then decomposed them in the current draft that you read, we start with the components and then build up to the main equation. That was a little bit risky, I thought, because I was worried that people would feel we were holding the main event back for too long, but so far it seems to be working, I'll say."
"Speaker 3","00;27;39;02","00;28;01;24","I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on that approach. What whether you think that meshes together well enough. Yeah, no, that's one of the things and and again, I don't think mathematicians are trying to be pushy, but if you don't have that context, it can feel pushy. And so how long you're willing to leave something open before you drop dropped?"
"Speaker 3","00;28;01;24","00;28;25;11","The big questions is sometimes easier for somebody then to size the situation up and contextualize it. So in this in this delivery, I don't know, previous versions right. But in this delivery, in that respect, I actually think it makes it less intimidating. But that's just my that's my personal opinion. Sorry, Steven. I know you wanted to say something severe."
"Speaker 1","00;28;26;01","00;28;27;13","Steven is. Oh."
"Speaker 2","00;28;28;11","00;28;50;18","Yeah. Just carried on from what Dean was saying as well is you you looked at the inference model almost prior to having a mark of blanket, you know, and I thought that was quite useful. And one thing that that may made me think as I was reading it and I'd be interested in your thoughts, is it helps with this idea of really thinking about, well, how are we going to create the blanket?"
"Speaker 2","00;28;51;00","00;29;11;19","When does a blanket come into play? And what assumptions are there about the blanket? In some ways, it's easy to pick up a pre built idea of what blankets are and then model off that was it's like, OK, well it's question there. And that actually could be useful at a more heuristic level, you know, for other fields of practice."
"Speaker 2","00;29;12;00","00;29;24;01","So I'd be interested in your thoughts about what do you think your motivation for that and also maybe the sort of surprising or unsurprising outcomes of not going straight for the blanket."
"Speaker 3","00;29;26;28","00;29;51;17","Well, one of the big revelations for me in researching this paper was that you can talk about variation inference and you can talk about minimizing expected free energy without talking about mark of blankets. I had sort of come into this with just sort of a huge deluge of literature from the active inference tradition. Lots and lots of like keywords."
"Speaker 3","00;29;52;16","00;30;23;24","Well, what could more uncharitably be called? Buzz words like mark of blanket and non equilibrium, steady states and things like this. And it was a concern that I would first have to understand statistical physics and fluid dynamics before I could understand the claims that are being made about inference. But looking back into the history, then you realize that first of all, variation inference is a precursor to that, even from so you can think about variation inference in its own little bubble as we have it in its own little section."
"Speaker 3","00;30;24;16","00;30;47;22","And then the sort of next step, which is novel and is quite excitingly novel, which is minimizing expected free energy, can also be construed just in terms of decision theory. You don't as far as I can see, you don't have to think or talk about mark of blankets at all to talk about decision theory. As minimizing expected free energy."
"Speaker 3","00;30;48;17","00;31;21;16","So the reason why we separated them was because they're separable. The reason why we put those two first variational inference and expected minimizing spectra for energy is because I think they are simpler and easy to grasp. And we were trying to start from the simple and build up to the more complex. It's I think it's definitely true that the most sort of intriguing and possibly the most difficult part of understanding this whole system which first in this building is understanding the things to do with Markov blankets in real, like physical situations."
"Speaker 3","00;31;22;22","00;31;44;20","But what I'm sort of interested in now, to give you a preview of what I'm like thinking about next, the more the thing which I'm more optimistic about being able to make headway on is investigating minimizing expected free energy as a decision theory that sort of gets the middle ground between it's not just something that prefigured active inference as variational inference did."
"Speaker 3","00;31;45;04","00;32;06;00","It's not something that seems to require a very large amount of mathematical understanding as the Mark of Blunkett stuff just seemed to. To me, it's something which is claimed to be a certain way of approaching decision theory, decision theory, sort of a philosophy, philosophical sort of technical term or statistical term. So it's that nice middle ground between novel, but understandable."
"Speaker 3","00;32;07;16","00;32;25;22","Which is why, yeah, the thing that I'm sort of most interested in investigating next is the expected free energy approach. And again, I don't think you need to talk about Mark of Blankets to talk about that right OK."
"Speaker 1","00;32;26;01","00;32;53;17","Thanks for sharing that one thought on where the mark and blanket comes in. So you said that variational inference and the minimization of expected free energy in the context of a paper that was structurally laid out with first perception and then introducing action into the loop. So it kind of fits this perception of case as like action affordances are not possible."
"Speaker 1","00;32;54;06","00;33;53;22","And so that's the special case. The more general case is when action can come into play that whole realm of action theory, decision theory, game theory, cybernetics signal processing, none of that, it was said, requires the mark of blanket formalism. I'd like to maybe add that there may be a weak sense requirement, like in the sense that on a Bayesian graph or using Bayesian methods using Perl 1988 version of the Markov blanket, there are Markov blankets in the machinery of these Bayesian methods because there are variables that are isolated or conditioned on each other so that's like the trivial Markov blanket, the non-contentious one that people are not spending a lot of time and attention"
"Speaker 1","00;33;53;22","00;34;31;20","on that. And then part of the unknown, or at least less clear, is the action and perception interpretation or concordance that first and has introduced kind of taking the unicycle Markov blanket concept and splitting it into like an incoming sense state dependency in an outgoing action state. And then none of that gives a clear action perception topology which is why we've seen like around the clock and then with the ones like action and sense are connected and backwards arrows."
"Speaker 1","00;34;32;02","00;35;02;16","So there's the part about the partitioning of the Markov blanket and then taking something that's kind of a trivial consequence of statistical models and then tying it to potentially realism in the strong cases like people saying Markov blankets as defining things. And then even just within the formalism, how do you go from how do you ramp up the meaning of this Markov, or does it need to even be that way?"
"Speaker 1","00;35;04;28","00;35;28;17","Which is kind of related to this question, which I'll ask you then. Anyone can give a thought like you talked about necessary and sufficient so is this some of the necessary and sufficient pieces of FP? What is what is necessary? Like, what's the kernel that everything else can continue to elaborate around? What section and page number, please."
"Speaker 3","00;35;32;07","00;35;45;24","Well, you'll notice that we were cheeky in defining three distinct re energy principles, probably none of which would be, you know, assented to by the actual proponents of the free energy principle. Yeah, exactly."
"Speaker 1","00;35;47;08","00;35;56;22","Could you go through and just describe in, if you like, sentences or just what is each one of these? The Three Free Energy Principles, inference, action selection, what do they mean to you?"
"Speaker 3","00;35;58;10","00;36;32;23","First one, free energy principle for inference, as you know, as we've defined it, is when we're dating you're sorry my cat is biting now sorry. Hold them up here so it doesn't bite me. I'm well, the short version is choose Q by minimizing F, so choose your beliefs about hidden states by minimizing variation of free energy. So that's it's a principle in the sense that philosophers would call a normative principle."
"Speaker 3","00;36;33;02","00;37;20;15","It's a command for how to act, in this case, the specific kind of action that is how to choose your beliefs OK? And finish principle for action. Also a normative principle telling you how to act. And this one is, you know, again, in our terminology, choose Z by minimizing G. So choose your action by minimizing its expected free energy and this is all for anybody who's watching this who hasn't looked at the paper we've tried to sort of describe in very slow but understand able way what what these different sort of letters are standing for."
"Speaker 3","00;37;21;29","00;37;28;00","We give the definitions for discrete case OK."
"Speaker 1","00;37;28;10","00;38;05;00","So we have perceptual inference. Bayesian expectation maximization like choose Q, the member of the Variational family distribution by minimizing this snapshot F based upon your priors, basically and new information coming in. And then that takes on a normative interpretation. It's kind of like saying if you were doing linear regression, you would do the L2 norm. These squares, if you're doing this type of regression, then do this kind of inference."
"Speaker 1","00;38;05;17","00;38;37;29","The second one is also normative, but it's action theoretic because you introduced action and then that introduced the elaboration on F to the G function um, maybe Steven S, how would you say that this movement's into the future first matter for maybe not necessarily how a philosopher, but how any other relevant area might see this in an applied context, like what is the F to G movement have to do?"
"Speaker 2","00;38;38;20","00;39;02;18","What I think is I think what's useful is that it's like it's almost taking what's evolved out with a mock of blanket with the expected free energy and bringing it back down into a more a form, which isn't only a form which is involved in the modeling out of particular systems. Low dimensionality is coming in and say, OK, this is a broader principle that can be talked about."
"Speaker 2","00;39;03;06","00;39;50;28","And I think that then ties into some of the stuff, the active inference, let's try to look at is how can active inference itself be used as a way to think of organizing and structuring our lives like George Perec might have thought about it, and how can it be used as a as a hubristic in areas like coaching and psychology, in areas where you look in an action orientated decision, support or in complex evolving ways, you know, so you can't you can't model it in the traditional sense of it because there's nowhere near the dimensionality can be approached."
"Speaker 2","00;39;51;16","00;40;35;24","So what's useful is I say, OK, look, we've got these general ideas we've got a route to it, but this the general deflated forms of that actually then because they're not so high order and they're not so nailed down to one idea of a mark or blanket maybe has a more universal application when someone is trying to look at complex contexts and how to act in the world so I know what your thoughts on that, but that's that's what I'm very interested in is this idea between sort of diagnostic kind of syndrome based psychology and how do we look at actually what's going on in a context, look at the symptoms, look at the context"
"Speaker 2","00;40;35;24","00;40;46;07","unfolding and work on modeling using our own apparatus as dialogical. So collaborative human beings."
"Speaker 1","00;40;50;09","00;41;02;06","Stephen Dean first and then Stephen. And if you want to give a thought on that and we're just going to talk about this inference and action piece because I think there's a few more pieces to draw out and then we'll get to the third selection. But Dean, go for it."
"Speaker 3","00;41;03;18","00;41;31;05","Yeah. So back to my strange, twisted metaphor. So now I'll send the plus for walks into the bar and instead of 11 Matt showing up, we'll call it the geometry, which is much more amenable to the model in terms of how a philosopher might walk into a space and see the geometry first. All of a sudden there's two math there's this statistical math that's that's showed up at the same time."
"Speaker 3","00;41;31;19","00;41;58;17","Are they twins? What's going on here? And I think that's where the guide is kind of handy because if you first walk into the space, I'm I'm not arguing that a mark off blanket exists. I think relationship matters, but I think what most people that walk into that bar don't realize is that you're walking in on two different math and they're both showing up at the same time."
"Speaker 3","00;41;58;22","00;42;25;28","When you were expecting one, you were expecting to be able to work with a model, which is what as I said, it's far more proximal to the geometry math than to the statistical one. And so I think that, again, when we're talking about guides I don't have to I can put my hand in the ocean and figure out what the current is, and I can look up at the stars, figure out where I am in that invariant space."
"Speaker 3","00;42;26;13","00;42;52;16","I don't necessarily have to have a laptop with the statistical distribution. I mean, that might help, but that's not a tool that I need. At first hand. Whereas I think the modeling part, which is what you were were trying to bring up with this guide, is at hand. And so it's the availability piece that I think philosophers are trying to are trying to what, what, what, what did I walk into here?"
"Speaker 3","00;42;52;21","00;43;15;22","That's essentially what am I walking into and what is the between the set those two types of math that they're probably if they're like me, but I'm not a philosopher. They're asking when they're when they're being introduced to this. So I'm just curious again, if I'm if I'm going way off on a tangent or if we're introducing something, we actually know what we're being introduced to."
"Speaker 3","00;43;16;17","00;43;49;25","And that's the part where. Stephen, you talk about slowing down because I really agree it's not a breaking down. It's an actual slow down nothing wrong that whoa, I mean, I could try an approach, an answer by sort of extending your metaphor, if you'll give me license to do so. Imagine you go into the bar and there's dozens or even hundreds of math or different components of math or different approaches to math."
"Speaker 3","00;43;50;18","00;44;18;04","And what you'd really like is some way of paring that down to something that is approachable you know, that only a few of these will be approachable, but you don't know which ahead of time. I'd like to think that you could use what we've written as at least a first step to paring some of that away. So what we've left out essentially is the stuff that you could pair away and say, I can't approach that yet."
"Speaker 3","00;44;19;03","00;44;44;22","What I know I can approach is these first few things. And what I like to think is that we've done OK getting at least some of those first few things in there, you know, not too much, not too little, not really trying to find that Goldilocks zone and those are be the ones that are approachable, even, you know, approachable for a philosopher who's met very little math before."
"Speaker 3","00;44;45;18","00;44;53;13","And I owe Stephen as a response to the earlier question as well. But if you want to go ahead first, Stephen or Daniel, you say, well, yes."
"Speaker 1","00;44;53;25","00;44;54;26","Stephen has to go for it."
"Speaker 2","00;44;55;04","00;45;03;24","Yeah. Let's just say maybe bring up slide 13 if you're able to. Daniel with that might be a useful one. Yep. Just as it has."
"Speaker 1","00;45;06;15","00;45;07;02","I have it."
"Speaker 2","00;45;07;22","00;45;08;01","Yeah."
"Speaker 2","00;45;11;01","00;45;26;14","That's got the little bit there about the penalty for overfitting, penalty for failing to explain the data and 13. Oh is it. Oh I said maybe I'm looking at the numbers at the bottom."
"Speaker 1","00;45;26;14","00;45;33;24","OK, but on page 23 or. Yeah it's 135 here. Yeah."
"Speaker 2","00;45;33;24","00;45;35;26","Yeah. OK, yes. Slide 21."
"Speaker 1","00;45;36;16","00;46;22;23","Yes. Yeah. This definitely juxtaposes the the F and the G, it's like a Pokemon evolution but it includes those different pieces about bringing in action with the uncertainty on the consequences of action and the fundamental and the ability to impact it. But that was actually what I had kind of written down. So Stephen made the point about how action is a lower dimensional space, and that's like making an algorithm tractable, like conditioning inference on action, which is something that's very different structurally than a lot of other control theory, where the target of inference is a policy selection."
"Speaker 1","00;46;23;18","00;46;46;22","Here, the affordances play a little bit of an upstream role, and they make the downstream calculation conditioned on action. So that speaks to a different embeddedness of action in active inference. And then there's a few other things. But first, Steven, what was you what was the answer that you showed the other Stephen Yeah."
"Speaker 3","00;46;46;22","00;47;20;09","I mean, I was really just picking up on the point that Stephen made about the difficulty of accurately modeling. And we talk about this a lot in philosophy of science. I mean, the philosophy of any of the special sciences, but in the sort of philosophy of science more broadly, one of the biggest topics is modeling and one of the biggest questions is how do you trade off between getting a model, which is a perfectly accurate representation of the thing that you are modeling versus something that is tractable and that you can handle."
"Speaker 3","00;47;20;20","00;47;46;06","And the analogy is always made with maps. Sort of the first analogy you can't have a map that is an exact replica replica excuse me, of its territory because you wouldn't be able to use it to navigate it could not provide you with anything that was more helpful than the territory itself. So we have some kind of practical knowledge of how to make maps."
"Speaker 3","00;47;46;06","00;48;21;15","We know what to leave out, we know how to condense it. We should at least, you know, shrink it. Usually if we're creating a map from a territory, what we don't really have in a in a very general sense across all of science is a set of principles for how, given a specific situation that is too complex to produce a perfect representation of what you leave out and what will you keep in, and how should you transform that space into a representation of that space in order to produce a representation that is a useful approximation of it."
"Speaker 3","00;48;22;08","00;48;41;00","So the question coming back to the formalism would be how do you choose a kind of a cue distribution, your approximate distribution, the thing that you're going to harbor in your brain and believe that throws out enough of the useless stuff of the real world, but keeps in enough of the stuff that you really need to keep it in the world."
"Speaker 3","00;48;41;22","00;48;50;20","This is sort of the one of the big questions in philosophy of science and I guess science proper, like the early 21st century."
"Speaker 1","00;48;51;07","00;48;57;06","And closing answer. Thank you, Dean. Ethan Blue."
"Speaker 3","00;48;58;02","00;49;39;12","Yeah, just real quick, so Daniel, when Daniel talked in the point one about the third P, but he called it the p h i t and he s the, the fitness, that's what basically you're describing. How do we take that, that variance field and collapse it down to something more tractable, as you said. And so at some point later on, either either later on today or in our next stream, I think that's what the active inference model, which is not a map and it has probably two parts, it has a frame, but it also has a it also has a filtering effect."
"Speaker 3","00;49;39;16","00;50;03;20","Maybe we can talk a little bit about that because that's that's what the fitness is really about. So I'm looking forward to sort of diving a little bit deeper on that because it's not just a back and forth across and reaching edges, it's actually going deeper into and then returning from. So yeah, I'm kind of looking looking forward to that from a mathematical standpoint as well."
"Speaker 1","00;50;06;04","00;50;06;17","Thanks, Dean."
"Speaker 4","00;50;06;17","00;50;45;05","Blue so that's a perfect segue fitness and into what I was going to bring up. And so even something that you mentioned earlier is like your attempts to capture the essence of the FCP and the things that will not change and kind of build slowly, incrementally. And so if we have a theory that does not change, essentially that does not evolve it will die like it will become extinct because we are constantly learning new things."
"Speaker 4","00;50;45;05","00;51;20;06","And so, I mean, I think I look from a counter point think that it's kind of critical to capture the evolution of the efficacy over time because it really changes the the potential applications and ways that that people interpret the the principle and the theory of actual difference also. And so what if it doesn't change? I mean, will it not ever change or is it subject to change or just what are your thoughts on that?"
"Speaker 4","00;51;20;19","00;51;27;19","Is it totally inflexible these these points that you would have to to label now?"
"Speaker 3","00;51;27;19","00;51;55;09","I mean, yeah, that general point is very well taken indeed. I guess. I think that by trying to capture something that we thought wouldn't change, I think we meant or I should have said we're trying to capture the parts of it that the rest of the framework will continue to depend on for sort of as long as possible."
"Speaker 3","00;51;55;09","00;52;21;01","We try to keep the most stable parts of it without necessarily implying that active inference could survive without these mathematical components. But just that the change to the theory or the change to the approach would have to be so radical once you'd got rid of these core mathematical components that someone could legitimately ask, is it still the same theory?"
"Speaker 3","00;52;21;19","00;52;46;04","So that's roughly what I would mean by essential, such that if, for example, tomorrow first and what to say, we don't need to talk about variational inference anymore, or we don't need to talk about minimizing expected free energy anymore. Someone could legitimately ask, OK, is he now talking about a new theory that's no longer active inference? Is it so different because he's thrown out that sort of fundamental part that he's now actually proposing something completely different?"
"Speaker 3","00;52;47;14","00;53;15;08","I think that someone could legitimately ask that question. I think the reasonable person could say that he's now talking about a different theory because I think that those mathematical thoughts so crucial to it, as opposed to some of the other parts which seem some of the more complex parts seem more dispensable. You could throw out some of the more complex things, keep these more basic things, and you would still more likely be having the same theory yeah."
"Speaker 1","00;53;15;08","00;53;15;15","Blue."
"Speaker 4","00;53;16;24","00;53;41;23","So just respond quickly. Like so for me, that's kind of an arbitrary line in the sand. And like one thing that we talked about back and forth a lot is this concept of electricity and their knowledge system versus like an equilibrium steady state density locally. Got it. Like what does it mean? And is if we throw out every density and eliminate this requirement, is the theory still the same theory?"
"Speaker 4","00;53;42;00","00;54;07;16","And so that's one point. But I mean, there are many points in like the minimization of gravity and so on and so forth. And so unless we add on to the theory, we are changing the theory all the time, like as new papers come out, like the recognition model versus the generative model and the Bayesian mechanics of stationary processes is kind of really highlighting a couple of key points."
"Speaker 4","00;54;07;17","00;54;27;22","But as the theory goes and changes, it's like at any point we could say, well, that's not the same theory. And so if you're so the theory is not allowed to evolve over time. Like it's just this arbitrary point in the sense that that you don't want to cross like the minimization of reality. What if we decide that the minimization of free energy means something totally different?"
"Speaker 4","00;54;27;22","00;54;59;02","Like even in this paper, I mean, you have in a footnote about the complexity versus accuracy. But but to refer to free energy as inaccuracy is like I've not heard of it described that way before. And so for me, I mean, it is this complexity and accuracy. And I understand like the the way they framed it, but it's a completely novel way to talk about free energy, like another term out here, here in terms of like uncertainty or surprise but not inaccuracy."
"Speaker 4","00;54;59;02","00;55;13;28","Like that was completely like caught me off guard actually. So, I mean, as the theory evolves, I don't know that it's just what are the what's what's the irreducible component of the MVP? Like does such a thing exist or is it just turtles the whole way?"
"Speaker 3","00;55;16;03","00;55;34;04","Yeah, you're asking me the really hard questions. I like this because it's tough. It's really tough to think it's honestly yeah. It's tough to think and answer that and to to ensure that I'm answering sort of honestly as to what I really believe as opposed to just trying to sort of dismiss what you say you know, I'm not trying to dismiss what you say."
"Speaker 3","00;55;34;04","00;55;55;10","I do think that the line is blurry, so it's not clear and distinct I don't think that it's arbitrary. I might be wrong in that, but I don't believe that it's arbitrary. Let me just leave to the side for a moment. The the description of free energy as inaccuracy. I'll come back to that because I'm interested in thinking."
"Speaker 3","00;55;55;25","00;56;20;21","Yeah. What you think about the different interpretations of of the function f but I'll try and go back to sort of the idea of the city yeah. There's a sense in which things are still being worked out. And one of the things we put in the paper is something that we were urged to make clear, which is that active inference is a work in progress."
"Speaker 3","00;56;21;19","00;56;43;11","Even the sort of mathematical underpinnings are still being fleshed out in a sense, or still being put together in a way that helps connect the different parts of the theory. OK, that's OK. That in fact was a little bit difficult for me to swallow at first because I felt that if that's true, then it doesn't legitimate all of the strong claims that are being sort of made."
"Speaker 3","00;56;43;17","00;57;00;14","But all of our complaints about that are in that fourth section of the paper. So we tried to make clear what we think is sort of justified and not justified on that basis. But it's still true to say that it's fair to have a framework and, you know, to spend time trying to put together the mathematical underpinnings of this framework, even though they don't yet exist."
"Speaker 3","00;57;00;14","00;57;32;19","You know, we don't have to we shouldn't just throw out the theory or disparage it just because the full math hasn't been worked out. Yeah, I agree. We should allow it to change. We should allow it to evolve. We should allow it to be applied to different things and see what works and what doesn't. With all that being said, I, I don't think in this particular case, maybe it's true of all the theories, but for active inference, I don't think that it's true that there are things that you could remove and still reasonably say, yeah, this is still active inference."
"Speaker 3","00;57;32;19","00;58;05;22","I think. I think a theory could not be that amorphous and still be sort of treated seriously as as a way of pursuing science. I think that you would have to say if you threw out minimizing variation free energy or you threw out minimizing expected free energy or some other of the core components, I think you would have to say if you're being reasonable again, the word reasonable is doing a lot of work in this paragraph and building up to I think you would have to say, OK, it's a different theory."
"Speaker 3","00;58;05;26","00;58;25;11","I think you'd have to say, OK, we were wrong to pursue the minimization of variation, free inference, the variation of free energy as a principle for understanding behavior of biology, cognition. We are wrong to pursue that. We're going to pursue something else instead. And so you couldn't just say, oh, it's still the same theory. But we've changed this core component of it."
"Speaker 3","00;58;25;22","00;58;47;20","I don't think that line is arbitrary. I think there are some things that if you change, you have to sort of admit you're wrong about that approach and go into something else. That's sort of my piece. I've told you a long time. I do want to pick up the idea of free energy is a function that measures inaccuracy, but I don't want to talk for like a huge amount of time, so maybe I should put a pin in that and we could potentially return to like."
"Speaker 1","00;58;49;10","00;58;59;12","How about first free energy selection? Steven M finished that three then as in accuracy then isn't over put."
"Speaker 3","00;59;01;11","00;59;25;13","Right? Correct. Yeah, I forgot we were only two thirds of the way through our descriptions of the energy principles and sorry. So for energy principle per selection, let me try and pull it up here so I can just read it directly off the page what we have asked is any system that survives long enough will act so as to appear to be minimizing f."
"Speaker 3","00;59;26;11","00;59;38;08","One of the issues here is that we've left out G, but for the sake of sort of focusing our attention, we can just talk about f OK."
"Speaker 1","00;59;38;25","00;59;45;29","And then how about the FP as a or free energy as inaccuracy interpretation great."
"Speaker 3","00;59;46;00","01;00;09;22","Yeah. So this is this is something that I was hoping would be again, a way to present it to philosophers so that it would be easier for them to grasp what was going on. I wanted them to understand why do we care about this function? F Why do we care about variation of free energy? Well, suppose that I tell you that in order to do inference, what you ought to do is minimize variation of free energy."
"Speaker 3","01;00;10;21","01;00;29;08","And then you could very well say, why? Why should I care about minimizing these things? And then if I tell you, Oh, it's the measure of the cost of inaccuracy in belief, then you immediately say, OK, I understand why I would want to minimize that, because I want to maximize my accuracy so very simply put, it's a way of explaining why we should care about F."
"Speaker 3","01;00;29;28","01;00;53;09","It's a measure of inaccuracy. I think that that interpretation holds up just to the extent that if you look at the two components, which can be sort of thought of as, you know, a cost penalty for overfitting, cost penalty for being inaccurate, there's a part of that which is inaccuracy. It's not the whole story, of course, because the other part is to do with complexity, not just to do with accuracy."
"Speaker 3","01;00;53;22","01;01;19;03","So what I think we've done by describing free energy as a measure of inaccuracy or the measure of the cost of inaccuracy is trading off that sort of ability to enter into understanding the math for, you know, a perfectly clear, mathematically very precise way of describing it. But I think I definitely think that it should be thought of as containing a term, which is a cost of inaccuracy."
"Speaker 1","01;01;21;24","01;01;47;08","So we talked in the zero about it's kind of like finding the shape from the data and the fineness of the mesh and inaccuracy in the real world kind of has elements of both. Or at least we're used to thinking about complex decision tradeoffs. Like you could make a bad decision because it took too long, but then you came to the right outcome in the scheme of thinking bigger than just one P value."
"Speaker 1","01;01;47;25","01;02;07;17","And so it's kind of opening up even this very kernel piece of the puzzle to the whole question of how specific and how many subgroups and always leaving space for not overfitting, given this whole mapped territory for this discussion. Steven."
"Speaker 2","01;02;08;12","01;02;41;18","As and would you say that the the overfitting inaccuracy is more around when you talk about adaptive active inference where there's a way to adaptively look and have an idea of beliefs in some way and that underneath that there could be a kind of a more objective swarm in kind of entropic kind of process which is sitting in the background."
"Speaker 2","01;02;41;18","01;02;53;23","But in terms of how we normally explicitly think about meaning we would think about it more in terms of what can be understood as beliefs. So I'll just be interested in how that how you see that from a philosophical point of view."
"Speaker 3","01;02;57;06","01;03;33;10","Well, one of the things that's still unclear to me about the overfitting part of F is that it seems that it can only be interpreted as sort of across the complexity if what you already believe is simple because what it's really measuring is how far you are straying from what you already believe. So that there's kind of an implication there that everybody always has simple beliefs in the first place and that therefore they ought not stray from those simple beliefs."
"Speaker 3","01;03;34;02","01;04;02;20","One of the things that I'm trying to think about now is what happens if you are starting with sort of more complex beliefs. Maybe that's not a sort of appropriate question to ask given the framework or the way we're supposed to interpret the match, but I can't help wondering it, given that it strikes me that you know, in order to interpret it as a penalty for complexity, you have to say you have to assume that what you're starting with is simplicity."
"Speaker 3","01;04;02;26","01;04;24;28","And I guess that would be real life situations in which you don't start with simple beliefs. And then presumably this would tell you, well, if your beliefs are complex, than they ought to stay complex. Because that penalty is a penalty for straying from that kind of complexity, which seems, you know, different from how it's usually described yeah."
"Speaker 1","01;04;24;28","01;04;25;16","Stephen, us."
"Speaker 2","01;04;27;01","01;05;03;29","And would you say that that that falls into our more recent move from science as creating models and fitting things to those models in the most simple way to be models like with post normal science and even, for instance, work with the covered. So there's a belief in engaging with a complex non resolvable system question, which is different to science's traditional goal, which is to have an answer and to fit things to it."
"Speaker 3","01;05;06;25","01;05;49;29","Well, one of the most exciting and sort of scary aspects of active inference is the idea that it's applied not just as a way of understanding what our target systems are doing. So not just as a way of understanding what a biological system or a brain that I'm studying is doing, but also as a way of understanding what I myself am doing when I represent that target system in order to try and understand it you get a kind of loop in a way, in a sort of sense in which you feel as though you could model your own activity by using these technical tools which are active in, for instance, giving you."
"Speaker 3","01;05;50;17","01;06;16;16","But then you feel like how could that be done in a way that doesn't invite any kind of infinite regress? That's why it's scary as well as exciting. It's exciting because it seems to potentially provide some kind of extra power or insight into our own activities. As scientists or as models of any kind. But it's scary because it seems to then drop you into a kind of spiraling hole of the model who is modeling themself, modeling themself, et cetera."
"Speaker 3","01;06;17;14","01;06;22;00","That's something which I can't think around even informally, let alone try and get to the bottom of this."
"Speaker 1","01;06;23;24","01;07;00;11","That was the very structure of paper number 36. So even in its qualitative application, just at the terms and concept level, it does turn the mirror back and that is speaking to the pre and post or pre post trans distributional aspects of active the all the funny things that Dean says as well and the strange loop there. So what that made me think of is like the statistics and then the famous quote, like the statistician can come in for the post mortem, something like that."
"Speaker 1","01;07;00;24","01;07;27;19","But a lot happens before the statistics happen like the design of the experiment and so the optimal experimentation and then the knowledge that it will be passed through a distributional filter in the big macro of the scientific method, like planning months in advance for how many minutes and hours one is going to count insects or how many microliters of a fluid they're going to move."
"Speaker 1","01;07;28;05","01;07;40;04","That is sort of the implementation phase. And then there's a design time. And so that's also what tie science to engineering in a way that it hasn't been in design thinking in a lot of the other areas to do in."
"Speaker 3","01;07;42;13","01;08;19;20","Yeah, this is awesome. So I mean, one of the things that we talk about is some of those density questions around what's, what's the linear aspect? And then what's the soul and oil aspect of it. And we also talk about walking into a room of mirrors with the mirror suit on. I mean, it all comes together in the sense that there I think one of the things that Steven Mann pointed out is that there are I think there is one of the things I think we can say about act of inference that's consistent is that it has at least a minimum of two in that back and forth, up and down the density bump and"
"Speaker 3","01;08;19;20","01;08;56;16","around the density bump, you can go either direction. And so that that has me asking whether every time we we say that this is a framework where there were only giving it half its due, whether it's a framework and also a filtering exercise, like does there have to be a minimum of two, not just the bound three, but then what is actually going on dynamically within that border so that we know when we're crossing, when we know when we're within the boundary that we maybe are looking at empirically, right, because we selected our unit of analysis."
"Speaker 3","01;08;56;23","01;09;22;23","But then when we know when we've crossed outside that when we've when we've gotten to a place where the mesh is holding certain things back while other things that are of a smaller circumference are still able to sort of pass through. And so I think as a, as a as a guide, that question of as we model, as we model, the model is the minimum."
"Speaker 3","01;09;23;10","01;09;43;16","I think if we just say the model, we don't do it justice. And if we just look at that as we model the act of doing that, I think again, we're looking at sort of beside a beef and expecting to be able to milk it. And I don't think that that works. I think you have to have the whole thing or else you don't really have act of inference."
"Speaker 3","01;09;43;16","01;10;09;24","So that's I think that's kind of where we're at when we're coming to the place where we're trying to decide what goes in and what doesn't go into a guide. And it's a struggle, right? There's no there's no question it's probably one of the hardest things that you can do because the majority of people that our guides are there because they've been there before versus the one who hasn't."
"Speaker 3","01;10;11;07","01;10;36;28","And that would require upending that that basic premise, which is, no, everybody has to get into the boat and we're sailing off onto their onto the event horizon. That would be the only way that we would change that. So the actual nature of guides would only change if everybody had to get their skin in the game. And start at that basic place of not knowing, but that we'll leave that for another another another livestream."
"Speaker 3","01;10;36;28","01;10;59;01","But at this point, that's what's really interesting here. One of the assumptions that we made is somebody has taken the time to go and search and explore and come back with information. And the other people don't have it. And the only way that changes is if everybody gets in the boat and sails off and hopes that they don't come to the edge of the cliff and fall."
"Speaker 1","01;10;59;11","01;11;25;19","So OK, lot there. Thank you, Dean. Just a few other points. People have different perspectives on what is core or not, some of the uncertainty. Let's get at it with the ontology development and making some definitions and translations and the formalisms clear in the history of science and all of that. But even then it might be pretty fundamental."
"Speaker 1","01;11;25;27","01;11;43;00","Like if it includes action and inference is variational methods necessary. So who knows, people will have different interpretations, just about a lot of things. And so that's again, all part of the fun. So Stephen."
"Speaker 2","01;11;47;29","01;12;12;08","So one question to be interested is talking about guides in terms of that book, Life Use uses guide. That's a very deep I read it for a long time and then I lost it. But it's sort of like it takes you into all these aspects of people's lives in that Parisian neighborhood, and it never gives you an answer."
"Speaker 2","01;12;12;23","01;12;43;12","It doesn't. But in some ways it's leaving it. Your intuition is leaving to your integration. And I'm wondering where you see that that integration that's happening at a non perspective or level, the integration, the intuition, the, the affective consciousness that is part of our knowing and how that relates to this. And maybe if it's even something that's not part of science but is part of this kind of work."
"Speaker 3","01;12;47;07","01;13;29;28","Well, I mean, firstly, you sort of crack the code in a way because the title of the paper was directly and explicitly stolen from the project book it wasn't necessarily a sort of the best like joke because it's not, it's in a, in the sense in which the book is about an incredibly hyper specific and detailed description of a system, you know, an apartment block at a specific time point on a specific day of the year gave me the idea about, OK, it's like it's not true that we ever really represent things that way."
"Speaker 3","01;13;30;09","01;13;59;26","It's not true that science intends to represent things that way in the way that Brecht does, and he sort of making fun of, but also he's he's incredibly constrained in the way that he wrote the book. As I understand, there's some there's some really crazy games that he plays with language in writing it. And the course, for example, translates as a huge amount of difficulty in translating it because how do you know how do you translate the game that he's played in French into a game that you can play in English while writing the English version of the novel?"
"Speaker 3","01;14;00;12","01;14;22;11","So definitely the idea of representation and sort of naturalism was on my mind. But the sort of the short reason we go to that is because we wanted the punchy title. We wanted something that people would think was accessible, but definitely when it came to casting about for punchy and accessible titles, that was the one the primary that came to mind."
"Speaker 3","01;14;23;24","01;14;48;28","When it comes to sort of affective consciousness and sort of experience, again, it's, it's a little out of my wheelhouse. I, I was very, very impressed upon by the novel, even just in the English translation, because it can't read French. I was really, really sort of moved by it in various different ways. You know, intellectually, emotionally, things like that."
"Speaker 3","01;14;49;13","01;15;10;16","There's a lot about sort of representation in that, just the concept of representation. And that's something that I'm interested in. But again, that pulls sort of in the opposite direction from in activism or affective consciousness and things. I'm very, very much situated in that kind of formal dry approach to philosophy, the kind of an electric tradition where we try and chop things down."
"Speaker 3","01;15;10;16","01;15;24;21","We think we're scientists, you know, inspecting the human condition under a microscope and so, you know, I can't deny that in reading a novel, it flows over me in the same way, you know, I'll experience it in a similar way that you experience. And I hope."
"Speaker 1","01;15;27;05","01;15;27;28","Yes, Blue."
"Speaker 4","01;15;31;07","01;15;50;14","So totally funny. I was also I had a question about the guide, but like on the opposite of life is Earth Guide. I was reminded of the movie Beetlejuice and they, like the couple dies and they have this like handbook for the recently deceased and like the the core of the theme that they can put. Well, did you read the guy?"
"Speaker 4","01;15;50;18","01;16;11;18","Well, did you read the guide? And it's apparently like a very thick, dense book like that. No, like, I mean, for death, you don't know to deal with freaking out. We don't time to read this book. And so I was reminded of that just totally juxtaposition. But it's like when you are creating a guide, it's very difficult to like make it usable, right?"
"Speaker 4","01;16;11;19","01;16;41;16","Like the map versus the territory. Like what? What will people read and be able to take away and walk away with some kind of general understanding versus like if you want to know what to do when you're dead in the situation, you've got to read the book. You know how to contact the house and all these things and so like do do we really need to get full grip of that to really sit down with the guide, you know, whatever like 3000 page manual or like where."
"Speaker 4","01;16;41;26","01;16;49;04","How do you distill the essence of something that's so complicated? Like what is that to be dead or what is the FPP? Right."
"Speaker 3","01;16;49;06","01;17;15;25","So that's such a good example. Like it's a handbook for the handbook for the long lived the, I guess, the free agent principle as opposed to handbook for the recently deceased. Yeah. What, what is the, the line that they have in that it's something like some incredibly dry statement, which is absolutely no help at all. Like operational parameters vary from manifestation to manifestation of something."
"Speaker 3","01;17;16;10","01;17;38;09","And yeah, I mean the idea behind it was that the philosophies that we talked to, the urge just to try and research and write this were pointing out that when they attempted to read those papers in the active inference tradition, even those were billed as tutorials. It was like trying to read the handbook for the recently deceased. It was, if not too long then at least too dense."
"Speaker 3","01;17;38;24","01;18;02;26","And they couldn't pick apart those statements because they were too condensed. And so, yeah, the difficulty was on condensing it, pulling it apart, selecting what was necessary, and then presenting it in an accessible way. I mean, all I'll say is that it took sort of on the order of years to do it. We, we sort of got commissioned, as it were, in 2019."
"Speaker 3","01;18;02;27","01;18;27;10","I started researching it in earnest at the beginning of 2020, and the first went through a few, you know, drafts and people gave us a lot of comments behind the scenes. But the first preprint came out in December 20, 21. So yeah, it's for me at least, and for us the authors, it was that difficult to troll through the literature, find what was necessary and then present it in a presentable way."
"Speaker 3","01;18;28;28","01;18;35;18","So that's such a great example. Thanks so much the of course of mine, but I love that film and the concept of the handbook as well."
"Speaker 1","01;18;37;12","01;19;29;24","So just a few comments on that. It's not called Free Energy Principle A User's Guide. It's actually very specific. It's about the variational free energy and the expected free energy F and G respectively. What's the FP so that's sort of where it takes you and it's very subtle then. That was pretty interesting. However, for the long lived and it reminded me about metacognition and learning and about what we expect and prefer and think we can know and how like just being a learner and like a teacher's assistants, seeing how there'd be lecturers that would give maybe it could be thought of in sort of an energy framework for another day, but they would simplify and"
"Speaker 1","01;19;29;24","01;19;54;19","learners would have high precision on a very simple model and then other times they would convey too much of the complexity. And so at the end of the quarter, even if the students learned a ton and they would still feel like lost in a bigger space and there's like good and bad aspects of all of that. So I think this is kind of like a snapshot."
"Speaker 1","01;19;54;19","01;20;15;24","It's kind of cool. That is so recent. That was only a few months ago, right? Now that it's February 22. But this is very recent in and still kind of ongoing that you're looking to update it too. So it's sort of like a kind of window where there's interactions with the community and hopefully people really think about it."
"Speaker 1","01;20;15;24","01;20;41;11","And the people for whom a section isn't clear have an opportunity through this affordances. We have now a scientific publishing with pre prints like to ask or correct or you missed a citation here that is awesome. And it's a world apart from sort of three people with it on their desk who are delaying it in review and then maybe they have good comments, maybe they don't."
"Speaker 1","01;20;42;05","01;21;11;13","But here there can be something that's so much beyond that as this is just like one thing that you're working on and you're developing and then one last comment on that is like SPM, the textbooks are still kind of classics, cult classics, we might even say and it's not that the notation hasn't changed a lot because it has in some cases it's a snapshot and there's some amount of linking back to the past that's clarifying."
"Speaker 1","01;21;12;05","01;21;33;02","And then there can be an understanding that there's drift and focus and evolution of techniques. And the SPM textbook, it's going to have sentences that you would include if you're writing it today. Great. That's why it's different. But also there's something about it that helps inform. So every snapshot that's well intended always is good. Dean."
"Speaker 3","01;21;34;26","01;22;05;01","Yeah, I think one of the other things that's really interesting about this is this Stephen M is kind of pointed to the, the length of time when the question was posed, can you, can you summarize this for us? Can you synopsize this for us? Basically, what the philosophy tells me is what the philosophers were asking was, can you go and do the figuring out and then present that to us in a finding out way, will you save us time?"
"Speaker 3","01;22;05;22","01;22;25;21","And so I think that's one of the things we have to keep in front of mind when we look at this, because those philosophers now didn't do the two years of heavy lifting and searching and foraging. There's that's a whole different aspect that figuring out is a whole different processing math method and mechanism than the finding out. Right."
"Speaker 3","01;22;25;21","01;22;50;11","And so again, if you want people if you want people to come away from guide use with more than the finding out they're still going to have to get in the field and do the figuring out themselves. And it's that interaction part which thank thank goodness for blue and Beetlejuice because that was again, that was just a wicked example, right?"
"Speaker 3","01;22;50;11","01;23;19;19","Because the timing of this, the wind ness of this really, really matters and I know that in a lot of educational settings time is that the yes it's right. 13 weeks, X number of hours, blah, blah, blah. We tend to get that. We tend to that's the only part of the wellness that we focus on, not should the guide or the plan be the thing that initiates all the action or is that the thing that falls out afterwards?"
"Speaker 3","01;23;19;26","01;23;45;13","If we're doing figuring out it has to fall out afterwards, not before. And we have a really hard time with that because traditionally it's always been, well, the legitimizing of guides because they've been there before and they'll help you find out, but they don't necessarily help you figure out just because the amount of time."
"Speaker 1","01;23;49;05","01;23;50;11","Yes, please. Stephen, am."
"Speaker 3","01;23;51;15","01;24;04;01","I mean, yeah. So both of the things that you both just said, Daniel and then Dean like they're both opened up huge topics which have so many interesting questions and so many interesting ways of approaching them."
"Speaker 3","01;24;06;08","01;24;54;03","Dean, I think I agree 100% with what you just said they've done the they're going to have to use guide as a kind of shortcut in a way to doing the initial stuff, the finding out. But it behooves them in a way to do some extra work of figuring out afterwards the thing that that most sort of resonates with me regarding is just the idea that our like mandate, what we had to do in producing this was give them the ability to work through like the examples themselves because that's a part of I mean, you know, I'm not sure how you distinguish in these two things, but to me that's a part of figuring out"
"Speaker 3","01;24;54;03","01;25;19;02","as well as just finding out. To me, we're not just saying this is a measure of inaccuracy and this is the algorithm by which you minimize it. We're saying, look at this example with these numbers, you know, in the imaginary situation. And if you work through it and if you, you know, print out the graph yourself, you will find that this is where the minimum lives, for example."
"Speaker 3","01;25;19;09","01;25;43;00","And you will compare that with this other thing. So we're doing the sort of the first tiny step in helping them figure out how they would figure it out in a way, if you see what I mean, giving them the means to go ahead and do it again themselves in a different kind of situation. But the sort of the other thing that he brings up, I mean, I shouldn't say that, you know, they they like Michael Weisberg didn't say, you know, go and do this for me."
"Speaker 3","01;25;43;00","01;26;06;29","Go and be my like research assistant for two and half years to print this thing. He along with Peter Godfrey-smith, who is another person not connected with the journal in that capacity, but very interested in having this framework explained for a wider audience, pointed out that first and foremost, we ourselves would get some kind of like plaudits for having done the work, having helped people to understand it."
"Speaker 3","01;26;07;08","01;26;31;19","So, you know, there was that the personal selfish incentive to do it, but also that it would be something that would benefit the community in a sort of in a positive way, not something that we would be giving them for free, as it were, but something that we would be creating for everybody to draw in and use and just improving how the community approaches this question."
"Speaker 3","01;26;32;04","01;26;53;29","So in the same sense in which, you know, in the best case, academia is a wonderful collection of people who are all helping each other to, you know, find those shortcuts to do the finding out without going through however long it takes to sift out the the stuff that is not necessary. We're all helping each other to do that."
"Speaker 3","01;26;53;29","01;27;33;05","You know, I can read somebody else's paper who was working for two years and something completely different and having split up that labor divided that labor up, we can both sort of benefit from it. So I'm going on far too long. Go. No, no, no, no. One answering one question. One last thing about the minimal two thing, though, if we could get you, you and Connor Haines into a livestream, I think my mind would be blown just because that math and this philosophy in one proximal location because that that to triangulate off that would be amazing because that's essentially what you have to do."
"Speaker 3","01;27;33;05","01;27;45;19","You have to put the finding out and the figuring out together. I don't think again I don't think it's one or the other. I think it's our ability to sort of be able to hold up both at once and appreciate how each of those things fills in the picture."
"Speaker 3","01;27;49;02","01;28;09;06","Yeah. And I do want to thank you. You should tell me when I should stop by, you know, please just jump in and interrupt me anytime. But, you know, I just wanted to sort of respond to your points as well. The other good thing, since I'm in an optimistic mood about academia, like you say, the kind of pre publication pre-print sending it out in enabling people to give us comments back on it."
"Speaker 3","01;28;09;24","01;28;42;14","If you think about it like is that metaphor with going to a classroom and teaching before you go in and teach, you have to pare away all of the nonsense, the stuff that's too complex, get it down to the level that simple enough so they can understand but has enough information so they can actually learn something in the really good case of getting a kind of course evaluation, you do a whole course, you get a bunch of students tell you what was right, what was wrong, what went too fast, what went too slow, you know, and hopefully there's a kind of average word which is out and you improve it sort of next time you"
"Speaker 3","01;28;42;14","01;29;12;24","make it easier for the learners because the learners have told you what was right and what was wrong about it. So it's that kind of feedback process. Obviously in real life situations, it doesn't always work that well. Getting that kind of feedback but if you sort of lucky enough to start off from a decent point, as I think we have at this paper, you can you can get to a kind of point which once it is snapshot it because that's the other important thing."
"Speaker 3","01;29;12;24","01;29;40;03","I think that this kind of pre-publication peer review is really useful, but that there shouldn't be constantly evolving documents all the time. There should be some kind of snapshot. Once it's snapshot, it it's like it's as good as it can be at that time, even if it becomes redundant eventually, even if it uses language which won't be used in ten, 20 years, once it becomes something that people can refer to valuably for kind of certain amount of time afterwards, that's really the best that you can hope for."
"Speaker 3","01;29;40;03","01;29;46;16","So, you know, certainly if you know just a paper, this is just a paper, it's nothing more than that really."
"Speaker 1","01;29;47;26","01;30;31;16","Just one thought on that, like on the finding out and figuring out, connecting that to the peer review, it's almost like we're all co learners in participatory, engaging education. So we want to make it easier for the learners, which is us and we're all colors. So sometimes we find out that would be somebody with more domain expertize giving us the feedback on the paper and then in the CI channel, maybe there's another time and place where it's a different roles, not relationship, but like and then there's the figuring out and then maybe there's other things here too that's actually not like feedback from the bottom up, but beginners questions, abduct of logic applications, adversarial or"
"Speaker 1","01;30;31;16","01;30;56;14","contrarian, even questions. That is always like what is active inference? Why does that matter? What does the FFP have to do with active inference? What does evolution have to do with natural selection? What does natural selection have to do with drift? If those were not resolved, then there going to be some open ones in this area as well."
"Speaker 1","01;30;56;29","01;31;24;14","And I think there is also another analogy with sort of like in a concordance with evolutionary theory and like Darwin's Dangerous Idea, Dennett and 95, that type of book perhaps has already or soon will be written for something like FFP because it has that same ability to like spawn an adjective and then reintegrate the adjective back into the corpus so it was like there was like evolution of this type."
"Speaker 1","01;31;24;14","01;31;54;05","And then people add like a modality or a subdomain or a new word and then it re joins the main threat so we have like deep affective sophisticated contrastive data, but it's going to reintegrate because it will be versioning and that returns to like Blue's point about what is core, what isn't, and how will that change. And so and then you just kind of close the loop with the snapshot, but the recognition of the process."
"Speaker 1","01;31;54;17","01;32;13;12","But we have to make the static modification in the niche but of course, it's a process. So it's really interesting where we've gone today. Yes. Stephen M and then S Oh yeah."
"Speaker 3","01;32;13;13","01;32;49;23","Just very quickly, I think the point about contrarian questions is a very good one. It's often philosophers main method of figuring something out, beginning with the contrarian question that is uppermost in their mind, going out and trying to find the answer to it. And certainly in this case on my side, when I was doing my part of writing the paper I was starting with what on earth is this math and what is the interpretation of these different components of it?"
"Speaker 3","01;32;51;20","01;33;07;10","And that was just for the for the math. When you get onto the sort of philosophy side, the interpretation of the dialectic, I mean, one thing I haven't said is that there are some quite skeptical portions of this paper, probably, you know, notes just when you read it and we try to, you know, pull back a little bit."
"Speaker 3","01;33;07;10","01;33;30;20","But what we wanted to do was provide you, will, for figuring out. And you always want to try and do that in good faith. You know, you always want to do it in a way that's not combative or dismissive. You want to do it in a way that is designed to help you. And the person that you're asking come to a consensus about the answer."
"Speaker 1","01;33;33;06","01;33;35;16","Thanks, Stephen. OK, Stephen."
"Speaker 2","01;33;35;17","01;34;03;26","As you know, I really find this helpful, this intuitive use of the term guide, because you chose that title, which maybe if you weren't doing a preprint, maybe I notice people are a bit more creative with the titles, which then that's maybe also a nice benefit. But by going there, this discussion has been really helpful to me. I often hear people when they talk about the findings from research that, Oh, we're going to roll out a tool kit, which is a tool kit."
"Speaker 2","01;34;04;06","01;34;27;13","And then then when they talk about a guide, it's really a sort of a guide, a guide to teach the toolkit. And but here in a way you're looking at, especially if you're getting into the more deeper tacit knowledge is what's the guiding principles to being a modeler? What's it about being a model? And that's where with these kind of conversations, are useful."
"Speaker 2","01;34;27;13","01;34;57;03","But I think that the type of stuff that's been brought up here are things where, you know, they're not resolved down to a tool kit level, but it opens a question for someone to have a conversation about. So I just thought I'd mention that. And what your thoughts are about that challenge of someone becoming a practitioner rather than necessarily an academic disseminator."
"Speaker 3","01;35;03;17","01;35;37;21","Yeah, it's tough because I'm really not sure in part because all that I'm sort of trying to be right now is an academic Disseminator So I would have to shift into a sort of different gear to think about what it would mean to be a practitioner I mean, I would start by asking you what you take being a practitioner to be and then see if I can, you know, resonate with something in that."
"Speaker 2","01;35;39;26","01;36;17;05","Well, for me, it's more contextual and it's more about being able to adapt and evolve based on a situation. And often you find the practitioner work is when you're in a face to face performative context in a way where you have to perform either the dialog, I suppose in science when you're in the field of practice, in other areas, it could be the performance of giving a performance, be a performance as a, as a, as a teacher, could be a performer."
"Speaker 2","01;36;17;05","01;36;57;17","Being an actor being a a workshop facilitator, being a therapist, being whatever that might be, and I suppose that that, that question about how something being a guide, a toolkit or some way to access the sort of heuristics and ways of knowing which aren't even representational in the kind of the way that we can easily externalize. So I suppose there's some of that, there's the stuff that we can't take a perspective on directly because we can't necessarily encode it into artifacts and place them in our environment in words."
"Speaker 2","01;36;58;06","01;37;30;25","However, that knowing is a skillful practice that has been sort of cultivated. So I, I kind of feel there's, there's a need for that and there's a, there's a big move towards that now with the world trying to embrace transdisciplinary to participation complexity where you have no way to make any sort of movement forward without the ability to, to find other ways to hold the meaning theme."
"Speaker 3","01;37;32;16","01;37;54;24","Just to just to sort of piggyback on Stephen, I think I think if you want to try to draw a comparison, if you're disseminator, the result can often be something like a desire line, a wearing in a following. And if you're looking at the generative model, you're looking at a densify, at a foraging and then a and an accumulation."
"Speaker 3","01;37;55;10","01;38;08;16","And in that in that respect, it's it's quite clear what from a practical sense, what one is not better than the other, but one results in quite a different result than the other. It's something to think about."
"Speaker 1","01;38;10;04","01;38;41;12","And then one other thought on this, some practitioner and scientist, though, I hope we see 100 times more and more different ways to learn and apply active inference. Just total first thought would be like when Stephen was describing your practitioner contextual and adapting on situations with really lower levels of control. It's on a continuum but like a crisis or a transition moment or an adversarial scenario has a lot of an implicit factor."
"Speaker 1","01;38;41;12","01;39;26;15","And it's not always as focused on like the coolest, calmest, most collected stick magic artifact modification. It's more like the firefighting was done appropriately in that scenario, given what it was and then the scientist generates niches like epistemic niche, laboratory niche, computer niche that allows them to generate scenarios where they can apply distributions. And then when they apply the distributional methods where there shouldn't be a distributional method, it's going to be unfortunately a silent error most of the time because of how little paid attention to all these differences are."
"Speaker 1","01;39;27;26","01;39;28;18","So, Stephen, am."
"Speaker 3","01;39;32;24","01;40;00;05","Yeah, this is really tricky to think about. I mean, I think I agree that knowing ought to be considered a kind of skillful practice. That was one thing that you said, Stephen, that I really sort of jumped out at me in part as being not sufficiently emphasized elsewhere, certainly not sufficiently emphasized in the tradition of philosophy that I come from."
"Speaker 3","01;40;00;06","01;40;52;05","That tends to be a fairly clear distinction between knowing in terms of representational knowledge and knowing how in terms of skill and there's not that often the consideration of the kinds of things we would usually consider representational knowledge as underpinning a kind of skillful practice. But when I think about the way that I'm thinking about philosophy conferences and the kinds of conversations that go on, it's pretty clear to me that having a conversation with somebody else about a topic that is so sort of steeped in law and intellectual recognition and texts as having a philosophy conversation is what it requires is a kind of skill, a kind of a smooth kind of automatically picking out"
"Speaker 3","01;40;52;05","01;41;16;13","the topics as you go along, not sort of sitting back and thinking very hard on your own before going about 30 minutes later and responding to the things that your interlocutor has just said. It has all the hallmarks of a skill as far as I can see. And what happens is well, the way that I have been brought up to view it is you do all your thinking at whole, you do all your thinking in the armchair."
"Speaker 3","01;41;16;20","01;41;37;08","And then when you come out to have the conversation you're ready with that skill because you've done all of that slow, solitary work first, the kind of propositional or representational kind of work. Then when you're ready, you come out and you practice discussing it thanks."
"Speaker 1","01;41;37;15","01;42;14;01","Great point. It's a lot like the representational dimension is kind of a non linear knowledge model, which is it cannot be conveyed in a linear sequence. Linear presentation in video and in writing is rhetoric. And that was one of the most interesting areas in the paper was like the claims justification. The whole second part and I'm happy that we spent almost all the dot zero and our conversation leading up to it because there's a whole paper and it sounds like it."
"Speaker 1","01;42;14;02","01;42;48;18","There's so much more to explore. But like the part about the rhetoric and the way that people not just have an edge in their knowledge graph, their armchair knowledge graph or their relational database, not just an edge between concepts, but actually when a question is raised to move to that answer first or the first topic that's mentioned, like if somebody asks, what is it, Mark, I'll blanket the first noun, what is it going to be well for a cell?"
"Speaker 1","01;42;48;28","01;43;19;27","Or is it because of Bayesian or what is the actual first rhetorical node that somebody gives? And those kinds of knowledge like representations are really interesting to it's not even just that it's the most important thing because that's not how people always structure their speech. So like there's both sides. We need a nonlinear part so that we can actually build a bigger structure than just an oral script."
"Speaker 1","01;43;21;02","01;44;07;29","But then it has to be in that like runtime that you kind of described at the Philosophy Conference. It has to be presented in a linear way. And if there weren't disagreements or like contrasts and people's perspective, then they would just be reading off the same book so maybe you would love to hear your thoughts on any of these latter sections in for like which one of these areas of claims we won't stay long, but just what of the areas of claims or the relationships between areas was interesting to you or like you learned while reading about it because you had the gist of a justification?"
"Speaker 1","01;44;08;00","01;44;17;02","Three links between dialectical categories with mathematical, empirical and general. So maybe just one edge or one section of those. What did you find interesting."
"Speaker 3","01;44;26;11","01;44;28;17","Or was that an open question or you asking me? I wasn't sure."
"Speaker 1","01;44;29;00","01;44;33;22","I guess to you I mean."
"Speaker 3","01;44;34;06","01;45;10;29","I can definitely start with the first section, which was the mathematical two empirical direction and as you said, we for each edge of the triangle, we were only sort of considering one direction, mainly for considerations of space what's most interesting to me about this is just that it is an established research field called computational cognitive science. When when the specific math that is being looked at is certain kinds of neural networks or other kinds of computational systems, and the specific empirical system that is being looked at is the brain, especially the human brain."
"Speaker 3","01;45;11;11","01;45;43;08","And what we really wanted to emphasize in this section was that the kinds of tools that have already been developed by computational cognitive science. So that includes the models and the explanatory tools and the justification or inferential tools could be applied to active inference models as well. So this was our attempt to say to the philosophers, we already have some equipment we can use when what we're trying to do is evaluate active inference."
"Speaker 1","01;45;48;15","01;46;15;18","So whether we call it deflationary or not, there's a lot of relevance in emphasizing which parts are specific to active inference and which ones aren't. Like bringing action into the loop is not a novelty. In the last 15 years doing Bayesian statistics, doing Variational inference. And so that work helps us really highlight the parts that do have unique and different interpretations."
"Speaker 1","01;46;15;29","01;46;44;15","Like this is definitely one of my favorite paragraphs. I think that we've come across and gotten the highlight on the discussions like and then you even brought it up that it's actually in the distillation. There is a novel not just implicit knowledge or notational connection, but a rhetorical element that arises, and then also one with like educational and didactic implications."
"Speaker 1","01;46;44;15","01;46;45;28","So that's really interesting. Dean."
"Speaker 3","01;46;47;19","01;47;10;02","Yeah, and I think when I was reading a paper, Stephen, I noticed the number of times you had the word evaluate, evaluate, evaluate which again is another one of those. Do you get, does this pass, pass muster, pass a standard pass, what goes, what goes on and what gets held back, what gets continued attention and what do we now ignore?"
"Speaker 3","01;47;10;09","01;47;33;01","And that's why I like when you were talking earlier about well, when we put a guide together, we just want to basically walk into the bar and make sure that the 98 things that we really can't pay attention to first that that doesn't pass what does pass? Or maybe these two be these two first nascent ideas. And so again, I."
"Speaker 1","01;47;33;23","01;47;33;28","Know."
"Speaker 3","01;47;34;11","01;48;02;09","You don't need me here this that if you want to just do factory link, that is one right there in real time in terms of what, what, what carries on, what can we build off of and what falls away because it doesn't, it doesn't seem to pass whatever value evaluative methods we've implied. But then again that goes to when do we start evaluating from the from the moment we started."
"Speaker 3","01;48;02;09","01;48;08;27","Do we want it to be something a little bit more creative and hold that thing open a little longer before we jump to assessment."
"Speaker 1","01;48;13;05","01;48;22;03","OK, so in the last just few minutes. Yeah. Stephen, you want to give a response there or would you like to have a little bit of a closing statement."
"Speaker 3","01;48;25;11","01;49;05;24","Let me give a quick response, which is just that I agree exactly with what you said, Dean. And yeah, we wanted to show that some things could be evaluated very directly just by working through the numbers. And that gives some directions for how other things could be evaluated. And you're right, it's like sort of how a philosopher evaluates a scientific theory as being sort of in a sense, at first level, plausibility of this level of acceptability, how it passes that it's kind of a philosophers technical term, but I can sort of give a kind of closing statement that goes back to what you just mentioned, Daniel, that paragraph, which is just that the the thing"
"Speaker 3","01;49;05;24","01;49;38;03","that I'm thinking about most often when I think about active inference right now is the interpretation of P in the expected free energy function and the sense in which it can have probabilistic interpretation as well as an interpretation of a kind of preference. That is the thing which I really want to try and get to the bottom of again, just by working with very, very simple models, try and throw some numbers around, try and intuitively grasp what that model can represent."
"Speaker 3","01;49;38;16","01;49;43;28","We have one in there with the example of the cat, but I want to try and expand it a little bit."
"Speaker 3","01;49;46;05","01;49;55;00","Yeah, I'm glad that you liked the paragraph because it's the thing that is causing me the most. It's the thing that's itching the most that I'm attempting to scratch right now."
"Speaker 1","01;49;57;24","01;50;08;09","All right, so we'll each give our closing thoughts. So just what did people enjoy? What would they look forward to talking about next week? So Stephens left first."
"Speaker 2","01;50;09;22","01;50;47;22","I just think you look really great, engaging conversation in the lots of insights. I'm really interested in that idea of the the PS so I think that's very interesting and I'd be interested in how that maybe applies both on the on the sensory side and the action side. So how much is the probabilities and preferences for sensing as much as or is it the one is more for sensing, one's more for action, but very interested in all of that."
"Speaker 2","01;50;47;22","01;50;52;08","So thank you very much and look forward to more conversations."
"Speaker 1","01;50;54;18","01;50;56;06","OK, Dean or Blue."
"Speaker 4","01;50;58;16","01;51;22;00","I'll go ahead. So thanks for entertaining all my interrogations. I appreciate it. If you're going to come back next week, I would encourage you to check out the tenancy densities because I like to see them with the piece of the Q I'd be curious to, to think about or to hear what your interpretation of that is and if you would maybe change or maybe you will."
"Speaker 4","01;51;22;00","01;51;49;14","I mean, it's just a preference to me that you have a burgeoning audience to kind of consider that in your estimation in the beginning. I'm curious, or if you think it's one of these superfluous extra components that is for the handbook for the recently deceased, not necessarily, you know, like the 13 steps of dying or whatever so I'd be curious to hear what you have to say about that."
"Speaker 1","01;51;52;16","01;51;53;14","Dean. Anything."
"Speaker 3","01;51;54;28","01;52;18;06","Yeah, it's just that I don't want it to drop down to the sort of quantum level. But I think that when you're doing a guide, it's hard not to sort of try and juggle both the dynamic aspects of what you're trying to share and the stable aspects of what structure you want, that you want the screwdriver to remain robust and constant."
"Speaker 3","01;52;18;06","01;52;53;04","And then you want it to also be able to be manipulated in such a way that it drives the screw. And there's a dynamic and a stability piece, this this guiding that's really, really hard to, as you say, square. I don't know that it can be squared. I think it I think they both have to be maintained. And so my sense is, is that I, I didn't know what you were going to do in terms of the guiding, but I think the way that you laid it out did slow things down, did allow that the teeth of the screwdriver to get set and then you could actually do something dynamic with it."
"Speaker 3","01;52;53;25","01;53;20;19","So really appreciate that. And maybe, maybe next week we can talk about when the screwdrivers used for creative purposes other than driving screws because I think what the math if we use that the geometry and the statistics and the philosophy all in one concoction, I think that's the basis or the minimum that we have then to be able to be do creative things and not just re combinatorial so maybe we can touch on that."
"Speaker 3","01;53;20;19","01;53;36;23","I would be really curious to hear how you see this going off in creative ways without going. And because the big fear people have is that just means destabilization where I'm saying it has to start from both stable and the potential to move."
"Speaker 1","01;53;39;11","01;53;41;20","Thanks, Steve. Steven, any last thoughts."
"Speaker 3","01;53;45;08","01;54;03;25","Just to thank you all very much for engaging with our paper, for inviting me on the stream and for asking me really great questions, embracing great points that just had never crossed my mind. This is exactly the reason why I was hoping to do this. I am going to try and come back next week. I can't make any promises right now, though, because next week is a bit of a heavy week for us."
"Speaker 3","01;54;03;25","01;54;24;20","But just yeah, the the prospect of going and reading that paper and then being able to respond in a more intelligent way to produce question is making me really want it. Not to mention all of the other topics which, you know, we haven't talked about yet. The rest as well. So I will let you know during the week, but fingers crossed next week."
"Speaker 3","01;54;25;08","01;54;25;25","Well, thank you."
"Speaker 1","01;54;25;29","01;54;32;28","Thank you. Yeah. Really appreciated everybody sharing their perspective. And you're welcome back any time. So to you, everybody, peace."
