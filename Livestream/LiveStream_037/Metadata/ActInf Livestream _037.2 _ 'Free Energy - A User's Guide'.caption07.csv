"00;00;14;05","00;00;14;26","Hello, everyone."
"00;00;14;26","00;00;19;15","Welcome to act in Livestream number 37.2."
"00;00;20;04","00;00;22;00","It's February 9th."
"00;00;22;00","00;00;23;23","2022."
"00;00;24;19","00;00;26;29","Welcome to the Active Inference Lab."
"00;00;26;29","00;00;30;09","We are a participatory online labthat is communicating,"
"00;00;30;09","00;00;33;00","learning and practicingapplied active inference."
"00;00;33;17","00;00;35;24","You can find us at the linkshere on this slide."
"00;00;36;26","00;00;39;03","This is a recordedand an archived live stream,"
"00;00;39;13","00;00;41;09","so please provide us with feedback."
"00;00;41;09","00;00;43;12","So that we can improve our work."
"00;00;43;12","00;00;46;05","All backgroundsand perspectives are welcome here"
"00;00;46;19","00;00;50;10","and will be followinggood video etiquette for live streams."
"00;00;50;18","00;00;53;10","Feel freeto officially raise your physical hand"
"00;00;53;10","00;00;56;19","if you'd like or useany of our emoji affordances"
"00;00;58;23","00;01;00;04","check out active inference"
"00;01;00;04","00;01;04;00","dot org to get updates onwhat the lab is up to"
"00;01;04;10","00;01;06;25","and also get more informationon how to participate."
"00;01;07;02","00;01;12;04","Or check out this code link if you'd liketo see our past and upcoming streams"
"00;01;14;14","00;01;18;07","we're here today in stream number 37.2."
"00;01;18;13","00;01;22;24","It's our third streamafter the dot zero background video"
"00;01;22;24","00;01;26;22","and the dot one group discussionwe had on the paper."
"00;01;27;07","00;01;30;07","Free Energy A User's Guide by Man"
"00;01;30;07","00;01;32;20","Pane and kickoff from 2021"
"00;01;33;11","00;01;36;20","and today we have a few things written."
"00;01;36;20","00;01;40;15","There's a couple sections of the paperthat we didn't get to last time,"
"00;01;41;02","00;01;45;10","and I'm sure everyone has broughtsome interesting thoughts."
"00;01;45;10","00;01;49;12","And of course, if you're watching live,please feel free to add any questions"
"00;01;49;12","00;01;52;10","or comments into the live chatbecause we'll definitely have time"
"00;01;52;20","00;01;55;28","to address anything there."
"00;01;55;28","00;01;58;12","We'll startwith an introduction and warm up"
"00;01;58;12","00;02;03;09","so we'll say hi, mention anythingthat we're excited to talk about today."
"00;02;03;23","00;02;07;17","Something that we liked or rememberedor reviewed about the paper"
"00;02;07;17","00;02;10;22","this past week,anything that we're wondering about."
"00;02;11;06","00;02;14;19","And as we just mentionedbefore we began, like"
"00;02;15;05","00;02;20;00","what does a dotto for a guide look like? So"
"00;02;21;07","00;02;23;24","I'm DanielI'm a researcher in California,"
"00;02;24;07","00;02;27;03","and I'm going to thinkwhile others are speaking"
"00;02;27;03","00;02;32;09","and then return to what the data can beand I'll pass it to Steven."
"00;02;33;04","00;02;35;00","Hmm. Hello, I'm Steven."
"00;02;35;00","00;02;36;28","I'm in Toronto."
"00;02;36;28","00;02;39;17","Steven so I, I'm doing a practice"
"00;02;39;17","00;02;42;21","based page de around Social Topographies"
"00;02;43;03","00;02;46;22","and how they can be used in communitydevelopment and specific development."
"00;02;46;28","00;02;51;07","And yeah, I'm looking forwardto looking at some of the implication"
"00;02;51;13","00;02;55;19","of how this might be rolled outin different types of context."
"00;02;56;15","00;02;58;29","I'll pass this over"
"00;03;01;24","00;03;02;11","I'm Dean."
"00;03;02;11","00;03;05;12","I'm in BritishColumbia at the moment. And"
"00;03;07;00","00;03;08;18","as with all things"
"00;03;08;18","00;03;13;08","guide related, I'm always interested inhow we translate from the word"
"00;03;13;20","00;03;16;08","to the deed,getting it, getting from a place of"
"00;03;17;05","00;03;21;22","of information that's curated to actions"
"00;03;21;22","00;03;26;00","that are also maybe curatedbased on that bit of information."
"00;03;26;00","00;03;27;00","And I'll pass it to blue."
"00;03;32;27","00;03;34;24","So that's my mute button."
"00;03;34;24","00;03;35;12","I'm blue."
"00;03;35;12","00;03;38;08","I'm a research assistant or"
"00;03;38;08","00;03;42;12","researcher consultant in New Mexico,transported back to my grad school days."
"00;03;42;12","00;03;44;29","I had like a mute button,lost the time warp all at the same time."
"00;03;46;20","00;03;49;14","I'm excitedto get into the sections of the paper"
"00;03;49;14","00;03;53;17","that we didn't really discuss,like in particular,"
"00;03;53;17","00;03;57;13","like using mathematicsto validate empirical claims"
"00;03;57;13","00;04;02;02","or justify empirical claimsand also kind of zooming out"
"00;04;02;02","00;04;06;11","and evaluating this workfrom that perspective of a guide."
"00;04;07;03","00;04;09;11","And like I think about The Hitchhiker'sGuide and like,"
"00;04;09;11","00;04;13;02","Don't Panic and what are the thingsthat we really need?"
"00;04;13;02","00;04;16;02","What are the essential componentsof the FIP"
"00;04;16;23","00;04;17;28","and act of inference that"
"00;04;17;28","00;04;19;28","that we need to communicate to others?"
"00;04;20;12","00;04;23;14","And I'll pass it back to Daniel, who's going to tell us what a document really is"
"00;04;25;28","00;04;26;18","well."
"00;04;27;01","00;04;29;21","What it really has been"
"00;04;29;21","00;04;34;14","is the far side of the bathtub"
"00;04;35;16","00;04;36;18","the dot zero."
"00;04;36;18","00;04;38;23","We're kind of dropping into the skating rink."
"00;04;39;10","00;04;41;25","And then in the dark one"
"00;04;42;05","00;04;46;19","there's an opening and we exploreand last week was an awesome discussion."
"00;04;46;19","00;04;52;01","We got to speak with the first authorand now we continue."
"00;04;53;08","00;04;54;25","But also"
"00;04;55;16","00;04;57;12","recollectsome of the threads that we opened"
"00;04;57;12","00;05;00;18","and build inertia towardswhere we take it next."
"00;05;00;18","00;05;06;08","And I think there's almost no genremore appropriate for a dot"
"00;05;06;08","00;05;09;05","to than the guidebook like you put down"
"00;05;09;28","00;05;12;11","in Dean's car manual metaphor."
"00;05;12;11","00;05;14;26","Like you don't hold that upand you drive it."
"00;05;15;15","00;05;18;11","And so papers similarly, they engage"
"00;05;18;11","00;05;20;29","our regime of attention transiently."
"00;05;21;23","00;05;24;29","You're not supposedto only be looking at the paper."
"00;05;25;09","00;05;27;29","So we're going to put this paper down."
"00;05;28;29","00;05;29;15","We're going to end"
"00;05;29;15","00;05;33;09","this video eventually,and then what will be left with us?"
"00;05;33;09","00;05;36;06","How will our generative modelhave been updated"
"00;05;37;06","00;05;40;07","so that our policy selectionsare different,"
"00;05;40;16","00;05;44;27","whether they're mental actionpolicies related to attention"
"00;05;45;09","00;05;49;10","or metacognition, or whether they'rephysical action policies?"
"00;05;49;29","00;05;52;16","So I guess it relates to that"
"00;05;52;16","00;05;58;02","quintessential DOT two question of movingfrom the word of the paper"
"00;05;58;02","00;06;01;27","that we're engaging in in our discussions"
"00;06;02;12","00;06;05;23","to the deeds and what are those deeds."
"00;06;06;23","00;06;08;29","And then it's almost like"
"00;06;08;29","00;06;11;20","this is an action oriented framing"
"00;06;12;20","00;06;14;25","of a dot two"
"00;06;14;29","00;06;17;25","or of just what we're up to today."
"00;06;17;25","00;06;19;28","And then there's this"
"00;06;20;15","00;06;23;29","asynchronous or not temporally binding"
"00;06;24;14","00;06;28;19","elements of which is raised by the paperthough, of what are the essential"
"00;06;28;19","00;06;33;02","components of FFP and active,and also the differentiation"
"00;06;33;02","00;06;37;27","perhaps between the conceptualand the pedagogical like"
"00;06;39;00","00;06;40;24","are the pieces"
"00;06;40;24","00;06;44;28","that are the minimal kernel of an active"
"00;06;46;26","00;06;48;09","is that where we are?"
"00;06;48;09","00;06;50;25","Is that page one on the guide?"
"00;06;51;25","00;06;54;00","How does education,"
"00;06;54;00","00;06;56;11","which is going to be the trajectoryof a learner"
"00;06;57;08","00;07;03;14","relate to the theoretical apparatus,which is kind of like a building"
"00;07;03;14","00;07;06;18","or some sort of structure that doesn'tnecessarily have a trajectory"
"00;07;07;01","00;07;09;13","like format"
"00;07;11;08","00;07;12;22","so maybe just to return to"
"00;07;12;22","00;07;16;03","this question of the word in the deed"
"00;07;16;26","00;07;18;05","in the dot one,"
"00;07;18;05","00;07;20;26","we heard about what the target"
"00;07;20;26","00;07;26;01","audience was from the author'sperspective for this paper"
"00;07;26;19","00;07;29;13","which was it's a special issue."
"00;07;30;07","00;07;33;11","It's a topical collectioncalled the Free Energy Principle"
"00;07;33;26","00;07;36;14","From Biology to Cognition."
"00;07;37;01","00;07;39;13","And we heard a little bitabout how the editor"
"00;07;40;02","00;07;43;02","made a request of the authors to"
"00;07;44;03","00;07;45;23","write this"
"00;07;46;00","00;07;47;17","special piece,"
"00;07;47;28","00;07;51;05","and they also summarized itin their last aim."
"00;07;51;27","00;07;54;18","We aim to increase philosophical"
"00;07;54;18","00;07;57;05","understanding of active inference"
"00;07;57;24","00;08;00;16","so that it may be more readily evaluated"
"00;08;00;29","00;08;03;02","so within the philosophical domain"
"00;08;04;11","00;08;06;26","so that it can be evaluated."
"00;08;06;26","00;08;10;14","But what other domains or"
"00;08;11;22","00;08;15;00","ideas are important here,then what are these actions"
"00;08;15;01","00;08;18;17","so philosophers might be interestedin reading this so that they can better"
"00;08;19;00","00;08;24;15","philosophically evaluate,but what are the idea to deed"
"00;08;25;17","00;08;29;06","pipelines that we're interestedin or opening up here?"
"00;08;29;11","00;08;31;23","Stephen and then anyone else."
"00;08;32;14","00;08;34;24","One of the aspects that"
"00;08;34;24","00;08;36;27","this this paper talks about is"
"00;08;37;14","00;08;39;25","how much things can be screened off,"
"00;08;40;09","00;08;44;05","how much it gives us latitudeto separate out"
"00;08;45;08","00;08;48;14","realistic empirical interpretations from"
"00;08;49;18","00;08;52;14","the modeling of"
"00;08;52;14","00;08;55;23","and I think that's the featurethey also talk about."
"00;08;56;04","00;08;57;00","And I'd be interested in"
"00;08;57;00","00;09;00;07","what others think about this,but they talk about the mark of blank."
"00;09;00;08","00;09;03;08","Is this opportunity to screen"
"00;09;05;02","00;09;07;15","or screen out what's inside an outside?"
"00;09;07;17","00;09;13;16","And I wonder how this idea of screeningbecause screens are not"
"00;09;13;16","00;09;16;20","the same as a wallit's not it's not rolling off."
"00;09;17;16","00;09;19;20","But as come up on the Twitter"
"00;09;20;05","00;09;24;11","conversation with Casper has this weekthis idea of leakage"
"00;09;24;24","00;09;28;05","like if I have a screen,I've got a blind date,"
"00;09;28;05","00;09;32;02","as I described earlier, and there'ssome leakage through the blind."
"00;09;32;07","00;09;33;02","Right."
"00;09;33;22","00;09;36;17","But is even that idea of screening off?"
"00;09;36;17","00;09;38;26","I'm a little bit passive."
"00;09;38;26","00;09;41;00","I'm curious about that a little bit. That"
"00;09;45;19","00;09;45;29","yeah."
"00;09;45;29","00;09;49;25","If there weren't statistical dependenciesbetween"
"00;09;49;25","00;09;52;25","internal and external states,"
"00;09;52;25","00;09;55;17","like if there were two statesthat were just"
"00;09;55;19","00;09;58;12","not eventhere was no path from here to there,"
"00;09;59;03","00;10;02;17","there wouldn't even be ableto be blanket states partitioned out."
"00;10;04;11","00;10;05;10","So internal"
"00;10;05;10","00;10;09;23","and external states are conditionallyindependent upon the blanket states"
"00;10;10;11","00;10;13;01","using the narrow Perl 1988"
"00;10;13;05","00;10;16;07","sense of markup, blanket"
"00;10;16;24","00;10;18;25","but there is a channel,"
"00;10;19;03","00;10;22;29","there is a path from the internalto the external stage again, otherwise"
"00;10;22;29","00;10;26;07","they wouldn't even be partof the same click in that part"
"00;10;26;07","00;10;29;09","of the Bayesian graph"
"00;10;29;27","00;10;32;17","and then also yes Stephen."
"00;10;32;17","00;10;32;25","Yeah."
"00;10;32;25","00;10;36;27","So that this, this, this, this clickthis question of how much"
"00;10;37;14","00;10;39;16","we need to"
"00;10;41;02","00;10;44;12","find purchase through that blanket"
"00;10;44;28","00;10;47;25","and the screening offand how much we can get away with"
"00;10;48;23","00;10;52;00","more broadly thinking aboutthe free energy principle in inference"
"00;10;52;00","00;10;56;03","and how that can be stepped up and downdepending on"
"00;10;57;11","00;10;59;18","where we are in terms of empiricism"
"00;11;00;08","00;11;03;04","and trying to make claims"
"00;11;03;04","00;11;05;28","seems to feature a lot in this paper."
"00;11;05;28","00;11;10;01","And I'm, I'm, I'm sensing thatbecause the"
"00;11;10;06","00;11;15;17","they're sort of arguing in a waythat as long as you can get functional"
"00;11;16;25","00;11;20;00","functional correlations"
"00;11;20;00","00;11;25;10","then how you get them to bethe approximate"
"00;11;25;29","00;11;28;10","isn't necessarily"
"00;11;28;10","00;11;30;14","about it being the real world."
"00;11;30;27","00;11;33;17","That gives you the maybe different ways"
"00;11;33;17","00;11;35;22","to arrive at something"
"00;11;36;19","00;11;39;21","that's approximately useful."
"00;11;39;21","00;11;42;00","And I think that speaksto dynamical systems"
"00;11;42;00","00;11;47;03","over traditional systems in the sensethat I can have a system which isn't"
"00;11;47;03","00;11;52;01","the real system, but it might systemflips or the regime shifts"
"00;11;52;22","00;11;55;02","in similar ways to the target"
"00;11;56;13","00;11;58;27","as opposed to actually being in and"
"00;11;59;00","00;12;01;18","and having the right types of valuesin it."
"00;12;02;02","00;12;04;15","In itself, it's more about what's the"
"00;12;04;27","00;12;07;02","what's the way that I start to see"
"00;12;07;15","00;12;11;02","my uncertainty flitfrom one belief to another."
"00;12;12;01","00;12;15;11","If theif the way that belief updating happens"
"00;12;15;20","00;12;18;02","is still approximately useful enough"
"00;12;19;09","00;12;22;07","for something to happen that's viable,"
"00;12;23;08","00;12;25;26","then that is still okay."
"00;12;26;09","00;12;28;09","And I'm wondering if that is impossible."
"00;12;28;09","00;12;31;15","The normal systems work,which isn't dynamical systems"
"00;12;31;15","00;12;32;07","work."
"00;12;36;04","00;12;37;00","Let's"
"00;12;37;21","00;12;42;21","look at the order and kind of tracethe trails of the authors."
"00;12;42;21","00;12;48;08","So in the early example, we had justthe case of perceptual inference,"
"00;12;48;20","00;12;52;13","which was first introducedin the exact base context."
"00;12;52;16","00;12;56;07","Then we movedinto the Variational Base Conference"
"00;12;56;25","00;13;00;15","and we had two world states unobserved."
"00;13;01;17","00;13;05;09","That's the actual temperature in the roomX observed data."
"00;13;05;13","00;13;07;27","That's the reading on the thermometer."
"00;13;07;27","00;13;09;22","So this is the"
"00;13;09;28","00;13;11;09","simplest"
"00;13;12;12","00;13;14;23","Bayesian latent or hidden state model."
"00;13;15;15","00;13;17;27","So is there a marker blanket here"
"00;13;21;05","00;13;23;01","asking for a friend"
"00;13;25;29","00;13;28;05","no, because there's only two notes,"
"00;13;28;13","00;13;30;29","so there cannot be a partitioning"
"00;13;31;10","00;13;34;29","between internal and external statescondition, not a third note."
"00;13;34;29","00;13;37;20","There's sort of it'skind of like the minimum two,"
"00;13;37;29","00;13;40;04","but now we're taking twolike minimum three."
"00;13;40;04","00;13;44;01","You can't have a blanket, an interveningor an intermediating"
"00;13;44;11","00;13;47;14","or a state which makes two othersconditionally independent."
"00;13;49;00","00;13;50;16","Unless you have three"
"00;13;50;16","00;13;54;07","three's a crowd throws a partynow in FIG."
"00;13;54;07","00;13;57;09","three, there's the basic model of action."
"00;13;57;21","00;14;00;27","So we still have the same definitionsand meanings of W"
"00;14;01;06","00;14;05;01","unobservedworld states and ex observations."
"00;14;05;14","00;14;08;24","Those observationsare now being passed to the agent,"
"00;14;09;10","00;14;13;18","and indeed they were implicitlybeing passed to the agent above."
"00;14;14;09","00;14;16;26","If there would have been a third nodeagent there,"
"00;14;17;08","00;14;20;07","it could have been saidthat the X was a markup blanket."
"00;14;20;07","00;14;22;26","But as it's exactly written there isn't."
"00;14;24;09","00;14;26;22","Now here,"
"00;14;26;22","00;14;29;03","what are the blanketing states"
"00;14;33;04","00;14;34;17","X and Z?"
"00;14;34;26","00;14;38;08","If you are conditioning upon X and Z,"
"00;14;38;18","00;14;41;16","it makes Wand the agents conditionally independent."
"00;14;42;06","00;14;46;25","And this is sort of presagingthe first in partition"
"00;14;46;29","00;14;50;22","on the marquee blanket,which is to split up the notion"
"00;14;50;22","00;14;54;18","of the total set of intermediating or"
"00;14;55;03","00;14;58;00","conditionally independent ising states."
"00;14;59;04","00;15;02;10","No Markov to Perl epoch"
"00;15;03;01","00;15;07;23","and showing them in a way that'spartitioned into incoming from the agents"
"00;15;07;23","00;15;11;03","perspective, statistical dependencieswhich can be interpreted"
"00;15;11;03","00;15;14;27","as sensory statesor the observation of model data"
"00;15;15;18","00;15;17;29","and then outgoingstatistical dependencies,"
"00;15;18;07","00;15;20;24","z, z, action you select."
"00;15;21;08","00;15;25;19","And then those can have some influenceon world states."
"00;15;26;24","00;15;28;16","Yes. Steven."
"00;15;28;24","00;15;31;17","No, you say outgoingstatistical dependencies."
"00;15;31;17","00;15;35;03","And that's also interestingbecause at some point the outgoing"
"00;15;36;26","00;15;39;24","cannot be statistical alone."
"00;15;40;03","00;15;45;09","Because you don't have the same kindof information availability."
"00;15;45;09","00;15;49;21","So it tends to be more using energy and"
"00;15;50;25","00;15;53;06","sort of least action type approaches."
"00;15;53;14","00;15;55;09","So that would be"
"00;15;55;22","00;15;58;22","so preemption that but that'swhere it starts to split out later."
"00;15;58;22","00;16;01;19","But they they don'tget bogged down in that at this stage."
"00;16;01;25","00;16;04;27","They they keep itall in the sort of Bayesian"
"00;16;05;28","00;16;07;09","environment."
"00;16;09;03","00;16;13;05","I'm not exactly sure what you mean,"
"00;16;13;05","00;16;18;00","since these arrows representnot mechanistic or causal influence,"
"00;16;18;00","00;16;20;22","but just statistical dependenciesin the graph."
"00;16;22;13","00;16;24;11","Yeah,I was thinking more when that becomes"
"00;16;24;11","00;16;27;18","action,when it's then translated to be action."
"00;16;27;23","00;16;29;00","So then"
"00;16;30;14","00;16;34;00","rather than sensory,which has much more sort of"
"00;16;34;00","00;16;36;02","informational content,"
"00;16;37;26","00;16;39;28","action can be seen as being more"
"00;16;41;02","00;16;42;00","about"
"00;16;42;21","00;16;45;08","what is more energy efficient"
"00;16;46;00","00;16;49;22","or starts to look at what the shape of"
"00;16;51;02","00;16;54;04","the way that action happens."
"00;16;54;04","00;16;55;21","So far."
"00;16;55;21","00;16;56;06","The and"
"00;16;57;09","00;17;00;25","I'm wondering whether that is"
"00;17;01;08","00;17;04;29","needed to be concerned about."
"00;17;05;11","00;17;07;19","If it were a software agent"
"00;17;07;19","00;17;09;24","then these are both informational,"
"00;17;10;27","00;17;11;29","really."
"00;17;12;11","00;17;15;01","And no matter what type of agentwe're modeling or"
"00;17;15;17","00;17;17;25","it still is just physical dependance."
"00;17;17;25","00;17;22;11","OK, then you brought up questionsabout energy expenditure"
"00;17;22;26","00;17;25;17","during actionand that's one of the pieces"
"00;17;25;17","00;17;30;22","that is sometimes challengingto parse out, which is like"
"00;17;32;20","00;17;33;24","first looking at"
"00;17;33;24","00;17;36;18","variational free energy minimization."
"00;17;37;06","00;17;39;12","So this is on the perceptual side."
"00;17;39;28","00;17;43;09","We're looking at the instantaneousfitting of a variational model"
"00;17;44;01","00;17;46;19","of ongoing sensory information."
"00;17;46;19","00;17;48;26","Given the priors,"
"00;17;48;26","00;17;52;29","that doesn't mean that for, for example,an organism,"
"00;17;53;06","00;17;57;29","it's the lowest energy possibleinterpretation of the sensory data."
"00;17;58;17","00;18;02;03","And then when we bring actioninto the picture and look at expected"
"00;18;02;07","00;18;06;08","free energy,neither does this mean that the Z"
"00;18;06;08","00;18;08;13","that is selected is the laziest."
"00;18;09;19","00;18;13;10","It just means thatthis G is being minimized and"
"00;18;14;25","00;18;17;05","so it's not the gives"
"00;18;17;05","00;18;20;23","free energyor the calories that are being minimized."
"00;18;20;23","00;18;25;11","It's something informationall that has to do with model fitting and"
"00;18;26;12","00;18;28;01","yes. Go for it."
"00;18;28;01","00;18;30;16","Yeah. No, that certainly makes sense."
"00;18;30;28","00;18;35;02","And and one thing culpritsand mentioned in the symposium we did"
"00;18;35;13","00;18;37;18","is this this kind of two boundaries."
"00;18;37;18","00;18;40;20","There is kind of two boundarieshappening in terms of Markov"
"00;18;40;20","00;18;43;28","and boundaries is one coming inand this one going out"
"00;18;44;13","00;18;48;18","and the blank it's kind of gotboth of those boundaries happening."
"00;18;48;28","00;18;52;02","So like you saidyeah it's the way that then"
"00;18;52;12","00;18;55;15","the inference happensto know what actions to take"
"00;18;56;22","00;18;57;11","is different."
"00;18;57;11","00;19;00;25","But the way that information is"
"00;19;02;01","00;19;03;27","established"
"00;19;03;27","00;19;06;26","is for sure differentgoing through each of those."
"00;19;07;04","00;19;11;00","I mean, as it iswith every mode of sensory data"
"00;19;11;00","00;19;14;02","that comes in because it could be vision,it could be here and it could be"
"00;19;15;00","00;19;16;11","kinesthetic."
"00;19;16;11","00;19;20;19","So you've got different types of inputand you've got different types"
"00;19;20;19","00;19;21;26","of output with that."
"00;19;21;26","00;19;24;11","And this diagram modelis keeping both of those."
"00;19;24;11","00;19;27;09","There's no idea of leakage or"
"00;19;27;09","00;19;30;21","or those questionsabout how things lead to cross between."
"00;19;31;02","00;19;34;25","It's like there's twodistinct flows going on,"
"00;19;35;14","00;19;44;08","but that and it simplifiesin that sense yes."
"00;19;47;04","00;19;48;17","We've seen other"
"00;19;48;17","00;19;51;15","typologies of perception, cognitionin action,"
"00;19;51;26","00;19;57;01","like an edge connectingsense and action states or an arrow"
"00;19;57;01","00;20;00;06","that's having a statistical dependencythe other way."
"00;20;00;14","00;20;03;27","OK, but just to returnhere, Justine, go for it."
"00;20;05;11","00;20;07;07","So this is a question for everybody here."
"00;20;07;07","00;20;12;04","So Steven,the first author, talked about the fact"
"00;20;12;04","00;20;15;24","that sort of the back storyof this whole guide thing was to"
"00;20;16;15","00;20;19;24","and I'm putting words into it,but I want to keep it reasonably short."
"00;20;19;24","00;20;20;14","I talk too much."
"00;20;20;14","00;20;25;25","Last week, he basically wanted to be ableto remove some of the impediments."
"00;20;25;25","00;20;30;15","And he pointed directlyat some of the math that acted as a"
"00;20;30;16","00;20;33;27","maybe a kind of a a bridge too far"
"00;20;34;22","00;20;37;00","and so he wanted to make that a simpler"
"00;20;39;25","00;20;41;26","maybe something that's more user friendly"
"00;20;42;16","00;20;45;25","and therefore somethingthat people will take up or adopt."
"00;20;46;09","00;20;50;06","And when you're putting on this andputting up this slide here now, Daniel,"
"00;20;51;05","00;20;54;01","I don't know whether I knowwhat eventually will be"
"00;20;54;01","00;20;58;04","translated into the math Formalismsyou just pointed up a minute ago"
"00;20;58;21","00;21;03;09","but I'm not really sure whetherthe evaluation aspect that philosophers"
"00;21;04;19","00;21;06;19","are going to then decide"
"00;21;06;19","00;21;10;15","whether something is worthy of theirtheir continued attention or not."
"00;21;10;23","00;21;12;03","I'm not sure of that."
"00;21;12;03","00;21;15;25","I don't knowhow does this critical path critical"
"00;21;15;25","00;21;18;24","and evaluationbeing related in this context,"
"00;21;19;08","00;21;22;22","how does this minimize or reduce"
"00;21;23;13","00;21;26;21","the impedimentnature of what the math is like"
"00;21;26;21","00;21;27;27","if we're going to we're going"
"00;21;27;27","00;21;31;12","to guide somebody through thisand there and there, one of their hopes"
"00;21;31;12","00;21;35;25","is to be able to say, OK,well, I'm not just making this stuff up."
"00;21;35;25","00;21;39;27","There's actually some some wayof being able to formalize this."
"00;21;40;09","00;21;44;14","How does that through this kindof first step,"
"00;21;45;09","00;21;46;13","become"
"00;21;47;18","00;21;51;17","become easier, I guess, in terms of whatthe actual formula says?"
"00;21;51;17","00;21;55;19","Because I know that when I firstactually touched on the formulas myself,"
"00;21;57;03","00;21;59;13","it didn't go back to a critical path."
"00;22;00;02","00;22;04;03","Like there was no real physical exampleI could find in the world."
"00;22;04;12","00;22;08;08","And I think maybe that'swhat helped me understand that maybe this"
"00;22;08;08","00;22;12;17","this thinking or this abilityto think statistically, sorry,"
"00;22;13;20","00;22;17;27","to think statistically,maybe that requires, as Karl"
"00;22;17;27","00;22;24;17","also said, our ability to do the math,we have to be able to do the math."
"00;22;24;27","00;22;26;09","And the math doesn't get simple."
"00;22;26;09","00;22;29;20","So I'm wondering what people thinkabout that."
"00;22;30;10","00;22;32;08","OK, Stephen,if you have a direct response."
"00;22;32;08","00;22;33;10","Yeah. Yeah."
"00;22;33;10","00;22;36;04","Well, I think that"
"00;22;36;13","00;22;38;19","in some waysthis goes back to a little bit"
"00;22;38;24","00;22;42;01","before where the math it helps ussee why the math was"
"00;22;42;01","00;22;46;05","put in at certain pointsby going to even a stage earlier."
"00;22;46;07","00;22;49;22","So I think there is some use in thatbecause I think like you say,"
"00;22;52;03","00;22;53;21","there is a slight inflation"
"00;22;53;21","00;22;54;23","in the way that the"
"00;22;54;23","00;22;58;17","process theory then gets interpreted asand if it's already locked in too much"
"00;22;58;27","00;22;59;25","in what's given to us"
"00;22;59;25","00;23;02;24","with all the math stuff, well,where did that math come from? And"
"00;23;03;08","00;23;06;29","and then that starts to get us involvedin some of these earlier questions."
"00;23;06;29","00;23;11;29","Because what's interestinghere is see the blanket,"
"00;23;12;12","00;23;16;24","I think of a blanket oftenas as a method for transfer."
"00;23;18;07","00;23;22;24","It's a mode of transport just a bit likelight lithographic blankets, transfer"
"00;23;22;24","00;23;28;11","from an analog roller to a blanket,roll it to a printed image."
"00;23;28;19","00;23;31;02","And so the paper is transferring."
"00;23;31;03","00;23;35;08","Now, it also does mean thatthere's no direct"
"00;23;35;08","00;23;37;29","contact between paper and"
"00;23;40;28","00;23;42;29","paper and print in play, right?"
"00;23;43;18","00;23;48;01","So it's screened off as well, but it depends which way it's going to, you know,"
"00;23;49;07","00;23;51;22","and in this case here with"
"00;23;51;22","00;23;55;05","these red circles, it'suseful to think about, OK, well,"
"00;23;56;06","00;23;59;10","there's there's somethingthat's been inferred"
"00;23;59;10","00;24;03;10","word in the world"
"00;24;03;12","00;24;06;18","but that inference isn't directlyaccessible"
"00;24;06;18","00;24;10;14","is it's not that observed data"
"00;24;11;16","00;24;15;20","isn't coming in as data is coming in is"
"00;24;17;18","00;24;21;03","what's inferred to be"
"00;24;21;03","00;24;24;15","about what's out there"
"00;24;24;18","00;24;27;03","which isn't the same as a signal."
"00;24;27;03","00;24;30;02","So it's like how much is the agent"
"00;24;30;25","00;24;34;00","able to have the environment, transfer"
"00;24;34;00","00;24;38;01","something onto them and transfersomething onto the environment?"
"00;24;38;06","00;24;40;13","And how much are they screened off from"
"00;24;42;05","00;24;42;25","the environment?"
"00;24;42;25","00;24;45;04","How much is the environmentscreened off from them?"
"00;24;45;05","00;24;48;05","I suppose that'sthat's something that relates to"
"00;24;48;05","00;24;48;21","that."
"00;24;51;12","00;24;52;22","Hey, thanks."
"00;24;52;27","00;24;56;12","So, Dean, just how does the."
"00;24;56;12","00;24;58;15","Yes, John, go for it first?"
"00;24;58;16","00;25;01;13","No, go ahead and then I'll just follow upboth you and Stephen."
"00;25;01;24","00;25;04;29","OK, so you askedhow does the critical path, the linear"
"00;25;04;29","00;25;09;26","pedagogical path that is tracedby this version of this guide"
"00;25;10;12","00;25;12;27","reduce the actual perceived impediments"
"00;25;14;06","00;25;14;15","in an"
"00;25;14;15","00;25;16;19","audience specific or in a general sense?"
"00;25;17;18","00;25;20;29","So it definitely helps ussee where math could"
"00;25;20;29","00;25;23;09","or shouldor does or will enter the picture."
"00;25;24;04","00;25;26;23","I think it sets upin about ness of the math,"
"00;25;26;27","00;25;29;15","like what is perception about"
"00;25;30;19","00;25;33;28","this is a graphical interpretation,graphical"
"00;25;33;28","00;25;38;07","meaning visual,but also like a network pacing graph"
"00;25;39;02","00;25;41;20","and so if you're concernedwith a different"
"00;25;43;02","00;25;45;04","connectedness of terms,"
"00;25;45;25","00;25;48;14","this is not the math you're looking for,"
"00;25;48;14","00;25;51;25","but on the perception side,if this is kind of how you're setting up"
"00;25;52;14","00;25;55;24","the template for what you'rewondering about, like what's out there,"
"00;25;56;09","00;25;58;15","that's whatthis first image shows with W an X"
"00;25;59;11","00;26;01;19","what's out there"
"00;26;01;19","00;26;04;08","and how do I actor how does an agent act?"
"00;26;04;21","00;26;08;05","That's the about this, which is notunique to active of inference."
"00;26;08;05","00;26;10;21","That's controltheory, cybernetics, et cetera,"
"00;26;12;17","00;26;14;18","the step wise guide elements."
"00;26;15;17","00;26;19;24","It reminds me, I hope it's not unrelatedin high school cross-country."
"00;26;20;12","00;26;22;10","The coach would say something like, well,"
"00;26;22;10","00;26;24;24","the race is going to startand you got to get out there faster."
"00;26;24;24","00;26;27;14","Then it's the middle is the partwhere you need to be running, going hard."
"00;26;27;14","00;26;30;06","And at the end you got to push itand finish and run hard and everything."
"00;26;30;25","00;26;33;21","And I was like, you could have just saidrun the whole time."
"00;26;34;03","00;26;38;27","Was it not the same thing as saying runat the beginning, middle and end and so"
"00;26;39;28","00;26;42;18","but run really hardduring the whole race?"
"00;26;43;08","00;26;45;06","I don't know, Coach."
"00;26;45;06","00;26;48;08","A whole race is a long time to run"
"00;26;48;08","00;26;51;26","here by breaking it into really specific"
"00;26;52;11","00;26;55;29","stepwise changes to the math,like a piece wise to find function"
"00;26;56;28","00;26;59;25","there's an opportunity to pace and lead"
"00;27;01;03","00;27;05;29","a learner and then to accumulate"
"00;27;05;29","00;27;07;29","or pause for"
"00;27;09;06","00;27;12;11","divergence or prediction errorthat they're experiencing."
"00;27;13;01","00;27;17;20","Like maybe before this first train stopsomeone has a question about that,"
"00;27;18;03","00;27;21;12","or maybe just graphicallywhen action enters"
"00;27;21;12","00;27;23;29","the picture,somebody has a question about that."
"00;27;23;29","00;27;29;04","Now, we could be talking about equationssymbolic equations that describe the W"
"00;27;29;05","00;27;33;21","to X relationshipor the agent to Z to W relationship."
"00;27;34;04","00;27;38;22","And then this paper is going to proposejust one symbolic expression"
"00;27;38;22","00;27;42;01","or several symbolic expressions"
"00;27;42;01","00;27;44;04","that today we call active inference"
"00;27;44;19","00;27;47;16","approach to addressing that question."
"00;27;47;16","00;27;50;26","But it builds up the about thisin a stepwise way,"
"00;27;51;09","00;27;55;27","that even though it is conceptuallyno different than just saying"
"00;27;56;08","00;27;57;17","here's the action perception loop"
"00;27;57;17","00;28;00;28","and the equations, which is prettymuch what every paper does."
"00;28;02;01","00;28;05;13","But bystarting somewhere a lot more atomic"
"00;28;05;27","00;28;09;27","it allows the stepwise additionof the math in a way that's incremental"
"00;28;09;27","00;28;12;13","rather than like here's the apparatus"
"00;28;13;00","00;28;15;16","and that leaves much of it implied Dean."
"00;28;16;18","00;28;19;22","Yeah, and I wouldn't disagreewith anything you're saying there because"
"00;28;19;22","00;28;24;19","I but I do think that there's a nottoo subtle difference between stepwise"
"00;28;25;07","00;28;29;10","and then the kind of step function,the leaving of the critical path"
"00;28;29;26","00;28;32;19","and now seeing a, seeing a set"
"00;28;32;19","00;28;36;28","of mathematical formalismsaround a statistical distribution."
"00;28;36;28","00;28;40;21","And I'm just wonderinghow that transition occurs,"
"00;28;40;21","00;28;44;28","because it doesn't seem likethere's a natural round from follow ing,"
"00;28;45;28","00;28;49;06","something clockwise or counterclockwiseto being able"
"00;28;49;06","00;28;52;18","to change things into"
"00;28;52;29","00;28;55;29","alpha alphanumeric"
"00;28;58;05","00;28;59;11","ratios,"
"00;28;59;11","00;29;02;21","which is essentially what the statisticwhen when it's written out"
"00;29;03;00","00;29;07;24","statistically what that does rightthe sum and the and the and the ratio. So"
"00;29;08;26","00;29;12;10","if if if the impediment was some of the"
"00;29;14;00","00;29;16;17","non frequent math"
"00;29;16;17","00;29;19;08","and I'm not I'm not critiquing in any waywhat Stephen's"
"00;29;20;08","00;29;22;29","written out here in his guide but"
"00;29;22;29","00;29;25;00","it seems like there's still"
"00;29;26;01","00;29;28;21","some assumption on the author's partauthors"
"00;29;28;26","00;29;31;29","plural part that"
"00;29;31;29","00;29;35;11","you will be able to take enoughfrom this critical path representation"
"00;29;35;26","00;29;40;05","to see what it looks likewhen you're overfitting like I like that"
"00;29;40;05","00;29;44;23","there was a lot of explanation of whatoverfitting is and then there was plunk"
"00;29;45;02","00;29;48;13","and here's the formula that,that, that, that, that,"
"00;29;49;18","00;29;51;15","that overfitting"
"00;29;52;29","00;29;55;00","looks like in mathematical form."
"00;29;55;05","00;29;59;05","So it's kind of a big assumptionthat the person who is reading"
"00;29;59;05","00;30;03;02","this is going to be ableto make that leap go from this level"
"00;30;03;12","00;30;05;29","of walking clockwise or counterclockwise"
"00;30;06;08","00;30;10;09","to now suddenly being able to understandwhat all of those"
"00;30;10;15","00;30;14;21","different symbols in that formula meansand not saying it can't be done."
"00;30;14;26","00;30;19;11","But I'm just wondering how, how,as people who are trying"
"00;30;19;11","00;30;23;12","to layout somethingin a kind of step step progression,"
"00;30;24;04","00;30;27;15","how they assume that they can justsort of put holes"
"00;30;27;21","00;30;31;11","in that big wall and people stilldon't have a fear of heights"
"00;30;32;10","00;30;32;18","right?"
"00;30;32;18","00;30;35;06","Like it's still it'sstill better than not having a ladder."
"00;30;35;17","00;30;41;06","But but it doesn't mean I want to go up40 feet without safety."
"00;30;41;06","00;30;43;10","Right. Just because it's there."
"00;30;43;10","00;30;47;01","And I kind of see that in termsof how the transition works between"
"00;30;47;17","00;30;49;25","this kind of this this"
"00;30;51;18","00;30;54;21","this form of representation and then whatthe representation looks like"
"00;30;55;01","00;30;58;06","in the math, that's a big leap,I think, for a lot of people."
"00;31;00;12","00;31;02;01","Thanks, Steven."
"00;31;03;18","00;31;06;10","And one, I suppose one danger"
"00;31;06;10","00;31;09;17","that's always presentwhen naming things is"
"00;31;11;16","00;31;12;24","they then move into this"
"00;31;12;24","00;31;15;08","with with the predictive process in"
"00;31;16;21","00;31;18;24","discussion, you know, how much"
"00;31;19;01","00;31;23;14","can you name thingsas being data in these contexts?"
"00;31;23;26","00;31;25;06","So it becomes statistical."
"00;31;25;06","00;31;27;16","But like you say,"
"00;31;27;22","00;31;30;10","the there is effectively"
"00;31;31;13","00;31;33;27","information coming in."
"00;31;33;27","00;31;37;06","But data in some ways"
"00;31;37;14","00;31;41;00","may be a bit of a tricky word to usebecause data"
"00;31;41;00","00;31;45;01","kind of implies an inherent"
"00;31;46;22","00;31;48;12","representational nature."
"00;31;48;12","00;31;50;06","And they talk about this in the paper,a little bit,"
"00;31;50;06","00;31;53;07","and that tensionbetween something that is coherent"
"00;31;53;07","00;31;57;04","enough and can be representedand something where you can't ever quite"
"00;31;57;04","00;32;01;14","get it, that the inference,the predictive processing has to then"
"00;32;02;19","00;32;06;24","leverage something like generative modelsusing the body, et cetera,"
"00;32;07;04","00;32;11;11","to even get the that that that that that"
"00;32;12;19","00;32;17;22","to allow that arrowto be something in a much more fuzzy way."
"00;32;18;00","00;32;18;26","You know,"
"00;32;19;14","00;32;24;11","and so there is alwaysthat risk of leading people astray"
"00;32;24;11","00;32;27;04","even at this early stage."
"00;32;29;22","00;32;32;02","So a few comments there,"
"00;32;33;19","00;32;36;15","Gene, you asked like,how do we get from this graphical layout?"
"00;32;36;15","00;32;42;02","So we've taken the first byte,which is this is roughly"
"00;32;42;10","00;32;46;23","the correct topology for thinkingabout problems of perceptual inference."
"00;32;46;23","00;32;48;04","And action inference."
"00;32;49;12","00;32;51;06","That is,"
"00;32;51;06","00;32;55;06","if someone re imagines this amazing,"
"00;32;56;06","00;32;59;25","but this is just the approachto perception, cognition"
"00;32;59;25","00;33;01;28","and action and impact."
"00;33;01;28","00;33;04;21","That is a common kernel of a phrasing."
"00;33;05;12","00;33;08;21","Now, let's just think about it"
"00;33;08;21","00;33;11;22","as an examplerather than just the abstraction."
"00;33;12;04","00;33;15;21","Let's just say that we're interested in"
"00;33;15;21","00;33;18;06","listening to a cat"
"00;33;18;06","00;33;20;24","and then inferring what its location is."
"00;33;21;09","00;33;24;04","So we're only talking about thissimpler W"
"00;33;24;04","00;33;26;12","and X connection first."
"00;33;27;08","00;33;29;23","So here's what the empirical data"
"00;33;29;23","00;33;32;18","are for two, one and three,"
"00;33;34;03","00;33;37;07","you could have a model of decisionmaking on it just says"
"00;33;38;04","00;33;40;08","the cat is always in the kitchen."
"00;33;40;08","00;33;42;12","Just I don't care. I'mOK with being wrong."
"00;33;42;18","00;33;44;01","The cat's in the kitchen."
"00;33;44;15","00;33;46;06","Or some could saythe cat's always in the bedroom."
"00;33;46;06","00;33;51;06","Or I flip a coin or I go with whatsome other person told me."
"00;33;51;06","00;33;54;05","Like,there's many ways to make a decision"
"00;33;54;19","00;33;56;26","about world states conditioned on data."
"00;33;57;12","00;33;59;17","One principled approach"
"00;34;00;03","00;34;03;21","which they right here, one famous methodfor solving this problem."
"00;34;04;00","00;34;06;05","Bayesian conditional position"
"00;34;06;05","00;34;09;23","so that's the question which is framednormatively here about one."
"00;34;09;23","00;34;12;04","What one ought to do is"
"00;34;13;08","00;34;13;28","integrate"
"00;34;13;28","00;34;16;28","their beliefswhich can be empirically grounded."
"00;34;16;28","00;34;19;27","That's parametric empirical based"
"00;34;19;27","00;34;22;12","upon incoming data."
"00;34;22;12","00;34;26;22","So first, in this case,the next little tiny step is"
"00;34;27;08","00;34;29;21","we can use Bayes theorem"
"00;34;29;21","00;34;35;05","to look at inference on external statesgiven incoming data again, if someone"
"00;34;35;05","00;34;38;08","disagrees with using a Bayesian approach,an exact Bayesian approach,"
"00;34;39;13","00;34;43;01","that's the time to speak their piece."
"00;34;43;01","00;34;46;16","This is a very simple example"
"00;34;46;24","00;34;49;28","with a kind of a minimumtwo by two matrix."
"00;34;49;28","00;34;53;14","If it was any thinner of a modelon any dimension"
"00;34;53;25","00;34;55;25","like if there was only a kitchen,"
"00;34;55;25","00;34;58;07","then the question of location inferencewould be trivial."
"00;34;58;16","00;34;59;28","It's in the kitchen."
"00;35;00;17","00;35;02;13","If there was only one sound"
"00;35;02;13","00;35;06;21","equally, it would be a trivial problembecause the sound would then"
"00;35;06;21","00;35;08;01","be uninformative"
"00;35;08;01","00;35;10;24","from an information theory perspective,which they're not bringing up here yet"
"00;35;12;07","00;35;13;20","about location"
"00;35;13;25","00;35;15;27","then the next tiny step, an ending,"
"00;35;16;07","00;35;19;09","is to go from the exactBayesian approach,"
"00;35;20;06","00;35;22;18","the parametric Bayesian approach"
"00;35;22;18","00;35;25;06","to variational conference,"
"00;35;25;19","00;35;29;11","which is imaginethat this was not just two by two table,"
"00;35;29;26","00;35;34;16","but there was a higher dimensional statespace of observations."
"00;35;35;04","00;35;38;15","And so it's not going to be possibleto just look at this in a spreadsheet"
"00;35;38;15","00;35;41;17","or on a piece of paper, but it's actually"
"00;35;42;23","00;35;44;20","a large model."
"00;35;44;20","00;35;47;23","And so we need tractable heuristics."
"00;35;48;15","00;35;51;06","And so that is the nexttiny step from now."
"00;35;51;06","00;35;53;21","We're going to takenot just a principled approach"
"00;35;53;21","00;35;57;21","to treating the to X relationship,Bayesian perceptual inference,"
"00;35;58;04","00;36;02;10","but we're going to go beyond thatand ask what's a track table"
"00;36;02;10","00;36;05;06","and reasonable approximationvariation inference."
"00;36;05;25","00;36;08;23","There's other situations where"
"00;36;08;29","00;36;14;02","maybe there's another tractable approachlike EMC EMC Markov chain Monte Carlo."
"00;36;14;14","00;36;17;03","That's another approachwhich we've talked about."
"00;36;17;03","00;36;18;03","In other cases."
"00;36;18;03","00;36;20;04","That's the pointillismsampling based approach."
"00;36;20;04","00;36;22;04","It works really wellfor certain problems."
"00;36;22;04","00;36;24;06","It doesn't work as wellfor other problems."
"00;36;24;06","00;36;26;03","And so that's the next little tiny step."
"00;36;26;03","00;36;29;06","We're going to gofrom this setup of perception"
"00;36;29;18","00;36;32;09","to using Bayes Theoremyou could do otherwise."
"00;36;32;19","00;36;36;18","And then from using exact or parametricempirical Bayes to using Variational"
"00;36;36;18","00;36;40;09","Bayesian approaches, and again,you could do otherwise, and that's do."
"00;36;41;24","00;36;42;06","Yeah."
"00;36;42;06","00;36;46;21","And again, all I, all Ithink I'm pointing out is that I for some"
"00;36;46;21","00;36;50;01","it is a tiny little step,"
"00;36;50;01","00;36;54;08","but I don't think it's a rampgoing from one version of representation"
"00;36;54;17","00;36;57;05","to four square version of representation"
"00;36;57;23","00;37;00;29","to formulaic version of representation."
"00;37;00;29","00;37;04;23","I think for people who see the mathmaybe as an impediment"
"00;37;05;11","00;37;07;24","to their further continuation of"
"00;37;07;24","00;37;10;19","using the the potential of the"
"00;37;11;03","00;37;16;03","to the three energy principle,maybe they aren't such small steps."
"00;37;16;04","00;37;20;12","They certainly aren't ramps in termsof how we interpret"
"00;37;20;22","00;37;24;24","each of those three particular waysof representing information."
"00;37;24;28","00;37;26;11","There's no ramp."
"00;37;26;11","00;37;28;12","There's actual an actual transition"
"00;37;29;03","00;37;32;12","moving fromfrom what you've got on the screen now"
"00;37;32;18","00;37;36;22","to the 6040, 50,50 way of being able to interpret"
"00;37;36;22","00;37;41;10","that way of representing the informationto the one that has an equal sign."
"00;37;43;09","00;37;45;03","They're very, very different."
"00;37;45;03","00;37;45;16","Right."
"00;37;45;16","00;37;49;23","I mean, I understand the relativity pieceand all that"
"00;37;49;24","00;37;54;05","and I see that carrying throughoutthis is relatively relativity"
"00;37;54;05","00;37;57;24","looks like this way and then this wayand then this way."
"00;37;57;24","00;38;01;09","But I think, I think the strugglefor people who are putting guides"
"00;38;01;09","00;38;06;13","together is the assumption thatwhat's little for you is little for me."
"00;38;06;24","00;38;07;26","It isn't always that way."
"00;38;07;26","00;38;11;18","And I'm not I don't knowif we can fix in that here in these labs,"
"00;38;11;18","00;38;16;06","but I don't think it's somethingthat we should assume is necessarily"
"00;38;16;13","00;38;20;09","once one small step for humankind,"
"00;38;21;00","00;38;23;12","because I think the reasonwhy the authors were asked"
"00;38;23;12","00;38;26;27","to put two years worth of work in thisand in the first place"
"00;38;27;17","00;38;30;24","was becausethe math is acting as an impediment."
"00;38;31;10","00;38;33;00","Now, do you start with the math?"
"00;38;33;00","00;38;36;29","Because I agreed with Steven last weekwhen he said this is the direction"
"00;38;36;29","00;38;37;10","we took."
"00;38;37;10","00;38;40;13","We decided to slow things down,"
"00;38;40;13","00;38;43;13","not simplify, but slow things down."
"00;38;43;18","00;38;46;07","So I really appreciatewhy they've done what they've done."
"00;38;46;07","00;38;50;04","But if they knew going inthat they were going to have to go slow,"
"00;38;50;25","00;38;53;24","then they're probably going to seewhether or not that bump"
"00;38;54;14","00;38;57;26","as we change representations is actually"
"00;38;58;15","00;39;01;21","relatable to the previous version"
"00;39;01;21","00;39;05;26","or form that the relationship waswas presented us."
"00;39;06;13","00;39;09;16","And I don't knowthat people necessarily do like blue."
"00;39;09;23","00;39;11;23","Blue is going to have has 60 on this too."
"00;39;11;23","00;39;16;03","But she mentioned the arbitrarinessof something that doesn't update"
"00;39;17;14","00;39;19;28","right and so it doesn't retain its form."
"00;39;20;09","00;39;23;24","And should we just assume that we all saw"
"00;39;24;08","00;39;27;25","the the morphology in the same way."
"00;39;27;29","00;39;30;08","It's, it's tricky."
"00;39;30;08","00;39;32;28","I'm just going to leave it at trickybecause I'm not sure"
"00;39;33;18","00;39;37;28","anybody that's putting a guide togethernecessarily has the the,"
"00;39;37;29","00;39;39;29","the perfect way of being able deliver it."
"00;39;42;12","00;39;43;29","OK thanks blue"
"00;39;43;29","00;39;45;08","and then you."
"00;39;47;18","00;39;50;28","So something that I think is interesting"
"00;39;50;28","00;39;53;10","is that mathematical"
"00;39;55;17","00;39;57;19","interpretations have like"
"00;39;57;19","00;40;01;11","philosophical underpinnings almostor maybe it's the other way around."
"00;40;01;20","00;40;06;07","So when you're looking at likefor example, this difference"
"00;40;06;07","00;40;10;14","between a probability distributionand a preference distribution,"
"00;40;10;27","00;40;16;02","like if the cat is in the kitchen,75% of the time,"
"00;40;16;09","00;40;19;14","you can just assumethere's like the underlying assumption"
"00;40;19;21","00;40;23;11","that it prefers to be in the kitchenmost of the time."
"00;40;23;15","00;40;23;29","Right."
"00;40;24;00","00;40;27;29","Like so because that'swhere the food is or whatever. So"
"00;40;29;06","00;40;31;08","and similarly, like in"
"00;40;31;08","00;40;35;01","homeostasis, if I'm at 37 degrees Celsiusthat's my temperature."
"00;40;35;26","00;40;39;25","If I'm there 95% of the time,you can assume"
"00;40;39;25","00;40;43;16","that I have a preference to have a bodytemperature of 37 degrees Celsius."
"00;40;43;16","00;40;46;04","I think that there'sthat underlying connection."
"00;40;46;13","00;40;49;10","But, but it gets really complicatedwhen we try to extrapolate to"
"00;40;49;10","00;40;51;02","something like cognition."
"00;40;51;02","00;40;57;08","There's like, I prefer to be rich,I prefer to have 90% of the money"
"00;40;57;08","00;40;59;06","in the world, for example,like you can say like"
"00;40;59;06","00;41;01;25","I want all the money,like you think about something like that."
"00;41;01;25","00;41;04;17","But then there are so many complicatedlike,"
"00;41;04;17","00;41;05;24","like, do I really want all the money?"
"00;41;05;24","00;41;07;18","No, because then everyone else would be"
"00;41;07;18","00;41;09;23","homeless and impoverishedwould be horrible. Right."
"00;41;09;23","00;41;11;17","And so you don't really wantall the money."
"00;41;11;17","00;41;12;17","Like there's"
"00;41;13;23","00;41;15;07","and then if I"
"00;41;15;07","00;41;18;29","say if I prefer to be rich, but I'm stuckin an impoverished situation,"
"00;41;18;29","00;41;22;28","you can assume that there's like alearning gap between how do I earn money"
"00;41;23;11","00;41;26;09","and being in the spacewhere I don't have any money,"
"00;41;26;14","00;41;28;01","I don't know how to have money."
"00;41;28;01","00;41;29;12","Like there's a knowledge level."
"00;41;29;12","00;41;33;20","So when you when you bring cognition intoit and like, you ask people like what"
"00;41;33;20","00;41;36;12","their preferences are like,I prefer to live by the beach."
"00;41;36;12","00;41;37;16","But I live in New Mexico."
"00;41;37;16","00;41;39;06","I mean, we have lots of beach, butno water."
"00;41;39;06","00;41;41;06","So there's like,you know, there's there's"
"00;41;41;27","00;41;45;11","I don't know, there's the preferencesand then the probability."
"00;41;45;11","00;41;50;00","But but is there some kind oflike cognitive dissonance like you think?"
"00;41;50;00","00;41;52;17","We think what our preferences are"
"00;41;52;17","00;41;55;11","or maybe notwhere our probability distributions are."
"00;41;55;12","00;41;58;14","Like, I prefer to be by the beach,but 90% of the time"
"00;41;58;14","00;41;59;19","I prefer to be by the ocean."
"00;41;59;19","00;42;02;10","But some of the time you find mein the desert, that there's"
"00;42;03;04","00;42;05;16","like there's some cognitive dissonancegoing on there."
"00;42;05;28","00;42;08;08","And so I think that the mathematical"
"00;42;09;10","00;42;11;20","interpretationshave a lot of philosophical"
"00;42;13;00","00;42;14;22","implications"
"00;42;14;22","00;42;17;17","that maybe, you know,we need to think about more"
"00;42;17;27","00;42;22;11","like when is a preference distributionand a probability difference"
"00;42;22;29","00;42;25;29","distributions differentand why are they different? Like"
"00;42;25;29","00;42;28;29","what is going on when the preferencesare not the probabilities"
"00;42;33;21","00;42;34;03","thanks."
"00;42;34;03","00;42;35;00","Blue."
"00;42;35;25","00;42;38;17","Yes. This will take us soonto the tale of three piece."
"00;42;38;17","00;42;40;02","Steven, first."
"00;42;41;25","00;42;44;11","Yeah, very good points there."
"00;42;44;20","00;42;48;16","When you said ten, you thereabout the exact base on the world"
"00;42;50;08","00;42;53;27","it goes into thatso goes into the variational base,"
"00;42;54;09","00;42;57;01","which in some ways isit starts to hit the mark blind blanket"
"00;42;57;01","00;43;02;04","start to give time steps as it startsto go through into the generative model."
"00;43;02;25","00;43;06;02","You then go and as was useful for now"
"00;43;06;02","00;43;10;25","and again the symposium with Carl Kristenwe talked about you know"
"00;43;10;26","00;43;13;23","the starting point often practicein person is the generative model."
"00;43;14;00","00;43;15;16","How do you get at the generative model?"
"00;43;15;16","00;43;21;05","So the general view is that in some waysthis exact base is almost needed"
"00;43;21;05","00;43;25;06","in the modeling senseto give you what we think we know"
"00;43;25;06","00;43;30;01","the world is when we're setting upour model or experiment of people"
"00;43;30;18","00;43;33;29","doing something, where are we goingto see what the results are?"
"00;43;33;29","00;43;34;14","So it's like"
"00;43;35;13","00;43;38;11","the agent can't know what w is."
"00;43;38;11","00;43;42;13","They can't know what the exact base isthat like with the cat experiment."
"00;43;42;25","00;43;48;11","So you can matrix thereand we could arbitrary put one in that"
"00;43;48;11","00;43;54;18","we kind of can say we know as objectiveobservers is going through goes the agent"
"00;43;54;27","00;43;57;25","and then the agent does something OK"
"00;43;58;05","00;44;00;18","and and as you said sometimes that"
"00;44;02;03","00;44;04;05","that what they do"
"00;44;04;05","00;44;07;03","isn't only in responseto what's coming in in"
"00;44;08;03","00;44;10;11","which is quite oftennot it's not just can I"
"00;44;10;11","00;44;14;17","I've seen foodcan I eat food as much food as possible."
"00;44;14;17","00;44;17;23","This is well what's the consequenceof my actions going forward?"
"00;44;18;03","00;44;22;05","Maybe a lot of times we then startto get into this higher dimensional stuff"
"00;44;23;08","00;44;27;07","where the circle that you put in theregoing into w"
"00;44;27;08","00;44;31;16","there's that red circle on the leftwhich sort of goes into the W"
"00;44;32;15","00;44;33;19","is what"
"00;44;34;21","00;44;37;26","is really a concern"
"00;44;37;26","00;44;40;17","you know, the humanities around what's,what's that about."
"00;44;41;00","00;44;41;27","Right."
"00;44;42;00","00;44;46;02","And a lot normallythe generative model work is done"
"00;44;46;02","00;44;50;06","in active inference isis the circle on the right hand side eye?"
"00;44;50;06","00;44;53;05","How do we predictthe way beliefs are being updated"
"00;44;53;17","00;44;57;07","and what's the way the beliefs becauseit's normally coming in that direction"
"00;44;58;11","00;45;02;11","because you can sort of controlyou can do an exact basis."
"00;45;02;11","00;45;06;02","The one place you could theoretically setyou experiment with an exact basis w"
"00;45;07;02","00;45;09;17","it's kind of hardto put exact based on an agent"
"00;45;09;24","00;45;11;24","unless of courseit's a robot potentially."
"00;45;13;16","00;45;15;03","So I think there's something quiteinteresting"
"00;45;15;03","00;45;18;12","there about it"
"00;45;18;28","00;45;21;19","how much is this"
"00;45;22;14","00;45;25;03","and it it's a practical instrumental. So."
"00;45;25;05","00;45;29;26","All right, how much is this aboutthe way that modeling happens"
"00;45;30;19","00;45;33;27","and how much and the mathto make that happen"
"00;45;34;05","00;45;37;20","and the philosophiesand how much then is this broader?"
"00;45;38;03","00;45;41;14","And it may be that it gets recapitulated,depends on which"
"00;45;42;13","00;45;45;13","partswe simplify or allow to be more complex"
"00;45;45;13","00;45;49;28","or want to get a purchaseso on out of those circles."
"00;45;49;28","00;45;51;23","So maybe you just explain whyyou put the circles"
"00;45;51;23","00;45;54;19","where you put themjust to see if I'm getting your"
"00;45;55;19","00;45;56;13","your rationale."
"00;45;56;13","00;45;59;17","But I think that was kind of usefulto put them in."
"00;45;59;17","00;46;01;22","I'm just highlighting the direct oddness"
"00;46;01;26","00;46;03;28","of these statistical dependance"
"00;46;06;20","00;46;09;06","this circle of action"
"00;46;09;06","00;46;11;25","policy influencing unobserved states."
"00;46;12;18","00;46;16;06","We've seen it in the partially observableMarkov decision process"
"00;46;16;14","00;46;18;04","as where"
"00;46;20;14","00;46;22;13","that's b"
"00;46;22;13","00;46;25;13","w changing through time is B."
"00;46;26;06","00;46;28;13","That's how hidden states change overtime."
"00;46;29;10","00;46;32;14","Stateone state at a time, one state at time to"
"00;46;33;11","00;46;36;14","then Z influences"
"00;46;37;14","00;46;41;01","here in this simple only four nodes."
"00;46;41;01","00;46;44;23","So if you only get four nodes,you draw the dependency that way."
"00;46;45;17","00;46;48;02","Like my action to change the thermostat"
"00;46;48;24","00;46;51;02","in the future will change the temperature"
"00;46;52;06","00;46;52;22","when we can"
"00;46;52;22","00;46;55;26","unpack it a little bit more and move it"
"00;46;55;26","00;47;00;06","from this sort of minimal cyberneticsor control framing into"
"00;47;01;07","00;47;04;02","some of the little bitmore built up models we've looked at."
"00;47;04;12","00;47;06;20","That is where policy selection"
"00;47;07;23","00;47;10;06","influences be."
"00;47;10;06","00;47;12;15","And so,yes, there's enormous concern over"
"00;47;12;23","00;47;16;08","how our actions influence thingsthat we can't directly observe,"
"00;47;16;20","00;47;20;21","say, for by proxy informationin coming back to us."
"00;47;21;18","00;47;24;18","And that is not a unique problemto active inference."
"00;47;25;02","00;47;25;22","Dean."
"00;47;26;07","00;47;33;17","You think I'm going to circleback to what Blue is saying,"
"00;47;33;17","00;47;36;05","because I think she's hit on somethingreally critical."
"00;47;36;23","00;47;40;01","Um, the weirdness of this,I think is what"
"00;47;41;12","00;47;45;02","I won't say was the,was the thing that Karl started on"
"00;47;45;02","00;47;48;24","when he tookhis First Nations steps into trying to"
"00;47;50;08","00;47;50;27","put something"
"00;47;50;27","00;47;54;28","that we can, we can hold on to,something that we can look"
"00;47;54;28","00;47;59;00","at philosophically and mathematicallyI don't know if he was thinking about"
"00;47;59;00","00;48;02;29","when this at that pointwhen he started down that path."
"00;48;03;01","00;48;06;21","But I think the more we talk about it,the more we"
"00;48;06;21","00;48;09;17","we realize that"
"00;48;09;27","00;48;12;16","as a for example, in a guide use,"
"00;48;13;12","00;48;15;19","I think a person who reads"
"00;48;15;19","00;48;17;20","Stephen and the other authors work"
"00;48;18;23","00;48;20;13","have two questions."
"00;48;20;13","00;48;24;25","The first one is my use of time,the number of minutes"
"00;48;24;25","00;48;28;07","I have to commit to reading the guide"
"00;48;29;20","00;48;32;09","before I canthen say whether or not certain"
"00;48;32;09","00;48;35;05","impediments have been removed"
"00;48;36;07","00;48;37;19","while at the same time"
"00;48;37;19","00;48;41;18","and this is what I think active inferencedoes, it also allows us to invert"
"00;48;41;18","00;48;46;03","that first accountingof what we are doing with our time,"
"00;48;46;23","00;48;51;02","invert it from use of timeto time of use like."
"00;48;51;18","00;48;56;26","So if I do commit to reading this guidewhat's the shelf life of that like?"
"00;48;56;26","00;49;00;21","How long am I goingto be able to take the my takeaways"
"00;49;00;28","00;49;03;16","and actually be able to apply themto different concepts"
"00;49;04;08","00;49;06;18","and then there's a fleshing it out part,"
"00;49;06;18","00;49;10;01","which I think Stephen's kind of talkingto, which is so"
"00;49;10;23","00;49;15;08","when we take all of this information andwe embody it what does that feel like?"
"00;49;15;17","00;49;20;21","What does that what does that read outin terms of our behaviors, et cetera?"
"00;49;20;21","00;49;23;00","Reactions are responses."
"00;49;23;00","00;49;26;20","So I think ultimately,if we're looking at the wellness of this,"
"00;49;26;27","00;49;29;25","we have to start talkingabout heuristics."
"00;49;29;25","00;49;31;19","And Stephenspecifically spoke about that."
"00;49;31;19","00;49;34;27","He said, I wasn't I think I'mparaphrasing him, but I think he said"
"00;49;36;24","00;49;37;04","we were"
"00;49;37;04","00;49;39;29","concernedabout whether starting with simple"
"00;49;41;13","00;49;43;03","doesn't also have a cost"
"00;49;43;03","00;49;46;27","we know that it has a benefitbecause it doesn't overwhelm people."
"00;49;47;15","00;49;51;04","But if if if we are going tolook at simple rules like heuristics,"
"00;49;51;16","00;49;53;29","does that also have a cost no,he didn't answer that."
"00;49;53;29","00;49;58;13","I was just rewatching the 37 onebefore we came on today."
"00;49;58;26","00;50;01;26","But I think that's something herethe blue is now touched on"
"00;50;02;10","00;50;04;15","and I think Stephenis touching on as well."
"00;50;04;15","00;50;09;06","If we're going to put a guide together,when did when did the rules fall out?"
"00;50;09;24","00;50;13;06","Do we assume that they fall outjust by picking the guide up,"
"00;50;13;26","00;50;18;15","or do they are they something thatthat the reader or the user manufactures"
"00;50;18;24","00;50;22;14","after having the experiencethat when this I think"
"00;50;22;21","00;50;27;06","is what this act of inference stuffis touching on and and,"
"00;50;27;16","00;50;31;00","and it's in some casesit feels pretty arbitrary."
"00;50;31;14","00;50;35;21","It's hardto tell the win of the heuristic."
"00;50;35;21","00;50;39;10","Do I start with the rule as my priormy priority"
"00;50;39;17","00;50;42;11","or am I really trying to update and I'm"
"00;50;42;11","00;50;44;25","trying to come up with somethingthat really applies"
"00;50;45;17","00;50;48;19","at some point in the futurethat I haven't arrived at yet."
"00;50;49;11","00;50;53;05","And I know that sounds kindof not answering anything,"
"00;50;53;16","00;50;56;12","but even even with the statistics,"
"00;50;56;23","00;51;00;13","it's hard to figure out whateach agent is going to do"
"00;51;01;15","00;51;03;23","depending upon what their biases."
"00;51;03;23","00;51;06;15","So they want to start with the ruleor they want to develop"
"00;51;06;16","00;51;08;08","one as they go along."
"00;51;09;05","00;51;11;26","And as the bacillus accelerates"
"00;51;12;15","00;51;14;16","in 34 Axios bacterium"
"00;51;14;29","00;51;18;08","showed exact Bayesdoesn't mean you get it exactly right."
"00;51;18;27","00;51;20;26","It means you're following a process."
"00;51;20;26","00;51;24;26","And with maladaptive tive priors,even accurate information"
"00;51;24;26","00;51;27;26","coming in can resultin a maladaptive decision making."
"00;51;28;06","00;51;30;14","So this is not"
"00;51;30;15","00;51;32;20","panglossian or Pollyannish"
"00;51;32;20","00;51;36;09","just because there's an approachdoesn't mean that it succeeds."
"00;51;37;01","00;51;38;28","Perfect, right? Yeah."
"00;51;38;28","00;51;41;03","So Steven then blew."
"00;51;42;07","00;51;43;07","You know, so"
"00;51;43;07","00;51;45;11","two points that sort of speak to that."
"00;51;47;03","00;51;49;03","Well, I'll say the second one first,"
"00;51;49;03","00;51;52;07","because it was in mind is when we"
"00;51;52;12","00;51;55;25","when we see the modeling, we often seesay we talk about the bacillus."
"00;51;55;25","00;51;58;09","So we see the way that modeling happens."
"00;51;58;09","00;52;02;27","High order agentssuch as humans tend to find that the"
"00;52;03;08","00;52;07;16","the w is fixed is like the,the cat is either purring"
"00;52;08;08","00;52;11;13","or it's, it's meowing,it's in the kitchen."
"00;52;11;26","00;52;14;03","It's, it's an exactoh it's in the bedroom."
"00;52;14;08","00;52;15;03","Right."
"00;52;15;04","00;52;17;15","So it's, it's a, it's a kind of defined"
"00;52;18;27","00;52;20;02","exact Bayes kind of"
"00;52;20;02","00;52;24;23","context and then that allows the,the other parts to kind of"
"00;52;25;08","00;52;29;23","still find some very interestingand tractable useful trends."
"00;52;29;23","00;52;30;08","Right?"
"00;52;30;08","00;52;32;15","So as it goes through"
"00;52;33;15","00;52;38;04","now when it goes, then the other wayis, OK, how do you get into something"
"00;52;38;04","00;52;39;13","which is an exact phase"
"00;52;39;13","00;52;44;16","and you tend to see itturning to the swarm of voxels there."
"00;52;44;16","00;52;47;04","So, you know,"
"00;52;47;04","00;52;49;15","Lorenzo Attractors or Bacillus."
"00;52;49;24","00;52;53;12","So very, very very simple, a gentle"
"00;52;56;05","00;52;56;29","scenarios"
"00;52;56;29","00;52;59;18","with very little degrees of freedom"
"00;53;00;07","00;53;04;12","because it's in a waytrying to address that challenge of,"
"00;53;04;21","00;53;08;04","well, you know what, if you don't knowif it's in the kitchen or the bedroom,"
"00;53;08;08","00;53;11;22","it's in the doorwayand it's it's wandering around"
"00;53;11;28","00;53;17;15","and the time the time in betweengets in sensory information."
"00;53;18;20","00;53;21;03","And my the action"
"00;53;22;16","00;53;26;16","is, you know, isn't in stepthere's a lot more bleed out,"
"00;53;26;21","00;53;32;04","you know, and and that becomes thiskind of how much is the temporal"
"00;53;32;13","00;53;35;10","I saw this word from fromCasper has leakage"
"00;53;37;04","00;53;39;24","because there's a leakageout of that sensory"
"00;53;40;26","00;53;43;11","input sensoryI don't want to use the word input but"
"00;53;43;18","00;53;48;00","the statistical dependencies coming inand the statistical dependencies"
"00;53;48;00","00;53;51;28","going out there's athere's a leakage going on"
"00;53;52;01","00;53;54;03","which makes the modeleven kind of challenging, though"
"00;53;54;05","00;53;58;18","at some point it becomesOK, well, it's overwhelming that the"
"00;53;59;04","00;54;04;04","we might philosophically say somehowwe were able to do something like that."
"00;54;04;04","00;54;08;03","And and our biology has enabled usto overcome that challenge."
"00;54;08;17","00;54;11;06","But to actually put it into a model"
"00;54;11;06","00;54;14;29","like the one on the right top rightthere starts to become."
"00;54;15;06","00;54;19;05","And in a way, maybe that'swhere effect comes in as maybe OK, that"
"00;54;19;23","00;54;21;13","that may be also true. For us."
"00;54;21;13","00;54;23;24","That's why we need something that affects"
"00;54;24;22","00;54;27;16","the hold together, this sort of fuzzy"
"00;54;27;22","00;54;32;12","kind of knowing which can't be resolvedin that such a solid way."
"00;54;32;12","00;54;33;26","So that's the first piece."
"00;54;33;26","00;54;37;29","The second piece very quickly isyou put know these"
"00;54;38;21","00;54;42;01","the red circlethat you put next to the X."
"00;54;43;24","00;54;45;18","So in some ways is"
"00;54;46;05","00;54;50;21","that that is what's what it'ssort of inferring w"
"00;54;50;22","00;54;52;27","what we're really doingis we're inferring"
"00;54;54;01","00;54;56;02","we're either inferring the circle there"
"00;54;56;13","00;54;59;08","that comes in to the X or maybe"
"00;54;59;20","00;55;03;15","and that's assuming the arrowthat's going into the agent is,"
"00;55;03;22","00;55;07;01","is what's coming out of Xor is coming from X."
"00;55;07;17","00;55;10;14","So that's in a way"
"00;55;10;14","00;55;11;11","the edge, isn't it?"
"00;55;11;11","00;55;14;20","That's the kind of boundarythat's being the beliefs."
"00;55;14;20","00;55;17;01","When you say B, the B is about that,"
"00;55;17;23","00;55;20;17","not strictly about W."
"00;55;21;13","00;55;24;12","There's a belief distribution on W and X"
"00;55;24;12","00;55;27;26","W is latent modeled on observed states"
"00;55;28;07","00;55;31;24","and X is modeledempirical observed states."
"00;55;33;22","00;55;34;19","Right."
"00;55;36;21","00;55;37;20","OK, blue."
"00;55;39;18","00;55;43;11","So just to kind of riff off of whatboth of you guys were saying,"
"00;55;43;13","00;55;47;08","maybe this is tangential, but butwhen you talked about leakage, Steven,"
"00;55;48;13","00;55;50;00","it reminds me of like the"
"00;55;50;00","00;55;53;11","information partitioningthat we discussed with Majid"
"00;55;53;23","00;55;57;26","and how there kind of alwayshas to be some kind of leakage"
"00;55;58;15","00;56;01;01","if you have a complete informationpartitioning,"
"00;56;02;22","00;56;04;06","you're actually like"
"00;56;04;06","00;56;07;12","in a in a vacuum or a bubblelike you're existing,"
"00;56;07;12","00;56;11;25","there has to be some kind of leakageacross the partition all the time."
"00;56;12;29","00;56;16;29","Like and I've I've come to realize thislike we have to be sharing information"
"00;56;16;29","00;56;20;07","with people that are, you know,how do we form a markup like at"
"00;56;20;08","00;56;24;01","how do the four of us come togetherand form this live stream today?"
"00;56;24;10","00;56;24;16","Right."
"00;56;24;16","00;56;27;12","Like we're sharing informationeven though there's a markup blanket"
"00;56;27;13","00;56;29;02","that exists between us."
"00;56;29;02","00;56;31;04","And for some of us,it's thicker and thinner."
"00;56;31;11","00;56;34;15","Like Daniel and I will be often likedoing the same thing at the same time,"
"00;56;34;24","00;56;39;11","like, even like separately just becausewe work together so much. But"
"00;56;40;26","00;56;42;17","there's this leakage, is there?"
"00;56;42;17","00;56;43;17","And then it also made me think"
"00;56;43;17","00;56;48;03","about the maladaptive behaviorthat Daniel was mentioning."
"00;56;48;03","00;56;51;28","And so when you have this, like,we always wonder what is the cause"
"00;56;51;28","00;56;53;10","of this maladaptive behavior?"
"00;56;53;10","00;56;54;02","And this is something"
"00;56;54;02","00;56;57;00","that we were discussingmaybe a couple weeks ago with Jason,"
"00;56;57;12","00;57;00;11","you know, what is the explanationfor maladaptive behavior?"
"00;57;00;11","00;57;02;19","And it always makes methink about the scale,"
"00;57;03;13","00;57;06;12","like in the situationsthat are utilitarian"
"00;57;06;25","00;57;09;22","like, you know,maybe someone sacrifices themself"
"00;57;10;06","00;57;12;03","for you know,they jump in front of a train"
"00;57;12;03","00;57;14;26","to stop the train, to save the 300 peoplethat are on the train."
"00;57;15;03","00;57;19;04","And so there's this maladaptive decisionsdo occur,"
"00;57;19;12","00;57;22;28","but perhaps it'snot like a societal scale or,"
"00;57;22;29","00;57;28;16","you know, like in a body you know, onepiece will die off to save another piece."
"00;57;28;16","00;57;32;23","Like even in the brain, likethe formation of like the little scar."
"00;57;32;23","00;57;35;09","I think of thatlike it's like essentially like an"
"00;57;35;18","00;57;39;06","it puts a hole in your brain,but it's to protect the rest of the brain"
"00;57;39;06","00;57;42;22","from the cell death that's happeningin that in that spider hole."
"00;57;43;10","00;57;47;16","And so, you know, it'sthere is this information leakage"
"00;57;47;16","00;57;50;08","and and even maladaptive behavior"
"00;57;51;01","00;57;54;28","that I think are scaledependent scale friendly"
"00;57;57;25","00;57;59;02","slew dean."
"00;57;59;02","00;58;01;16","And then we'll move to another section."
"00;58;01;16","00;58;04;22","Call yeah."
"00;58;05;19","00;58;07;23","I don't know if we're at an inflectionpoint with this,"
"00;58;07;23","00;58;09;26","but I do want to bring this up again."
"00;58;09;26","00;58;13;23","I think that the leakage speaksto another metaphor"
"00;58;13;23","00;58;15;26","that I brought upway too many times last week,"
"00;58;15;26","00;58;20;04","which is I mentioned in the point zero,which I think there is a filtering piece"
"00;58;20;04","00;58;21;01","to this."
"00;58;21;07","00;58;23;21","I mean, this morningI put the raspberries in the sieve"
"00;58;24;05","00;58;27;24","and I assumed the raspberries would stayand the water would pass through."
"00;58;28;07","00;58;29;02","And there were parts"
"00;58;29;02","00;58;32;07","that I didn't need, likeI wasn't trying to make raspberry water."
"00;58;32;07","00;58;33;20","I just wanted to eat the raspberries."
"00;58;33;20","00;58;38;24","And I think that if we understandthat there's to a minimum of two aspects"
"00;58;38;24","00;58;42;05","to when we're talking about activeinference, I think we do ourselves favor"
"00;58;42;27","00;58;44;12","and I think we do ourselves a favor"
"00;58;44;12","00;58;47;24","for writing guidebooksabout active inference and free energy."
"00;58;48;09","00;58;51;07","So I think I think the guidebookfor the guidebook,"
"00;58;51;28","00;58;54;14","if there was if there were,if were there are some pillars"
"00;58;54;24","00;58;57;22","that we could put a guidebook on herewould be my suggestions."
"00;58;58;18","00;59;01;26","First of all, there is going to bebecause we have a markup blanket,"
"00;59;01;26","00;59;03;16","we have a separation."
"00;59;03;16","00;59;07;12","That differentiation and that integrationare going to be inherent"
"00;59;07;19","00;59;12;05","in however, we observe somethingand then respond to it."
"00;59;12;17","00;59;14;25","Second thing that I would suggest is"
"00;59;14;25","00;59;17;16","there's a certain blindspot removal piece to this."
"00;59;18;23","00;59;22;01","And I mean that in the in the context of,say, something like"
"00;59;22;01","00;59;26;04","change blindness because of overattending or understanding."
"00;59;26;04","00;59;29;23","And we talked about overfittingor failing to explain"
"00;59;30;19","00;59;33;09","that change blindness is now becoming"
"00;59;33;20","00;59;37;14","a greater awareness availabilitybecause we don't"
"00;59;37;15","00;59;42;05","necessarily have to lock in prematurelyor wait too long."
"00;59;42;12","00;59;45;27","There's kind of a sweet spotthat active inference is,"
"00;59;46;03","00;59;48;14","is trying to say exists not perfect,"
"00;59;49;29","00;59;52;22","but it's better than not having a sweetspot."
"00;59;53;02","00;59;57;13","Third thing I would say is if we'reignoring the foraging aspect of this,"
"00;59;58;03","01;00;02;11","if we expect that the frameworkis going to be another frozen meal,"
"01;00;02;19","01;00;04;28","then you're going to get the qualityof a frozen meal."
"01;00;05;12","01;00;08;03","If you're willing to forgearound the perimeter of the store,"
"01;00;08;20","01;00;11;10","you're going to come awaywith a whole different experience it's"
"01;00;11;10","01;00;15;02","more time consuming, but in the end,it's like learning to fish."
"01;00;15;24","01;00;18;10","It's a whole different way of trying"
"01;00;18;10","01;00;20;28","to process those uncertainties."
"01;00;21;17","01;00;22;09","Right?"
"01;00;22;17","01;00;27;01","So I think at the end of the day,what pops out or when"
"01;00;27;16","01;00;30;19","when we decide that we can actually say"
"01;00;30;20","01;00;34;06","somebody is using active inference,whereas before they weren't."
"01;00;35;14","01;00;36;18","I think what they do is they"
"01;00;36;18","01;00;39;26","come up with a new sense of what rules"
"01;00;41;17","01;00;43;27","which are being updated,which are being modified,"
"01;00;43;27","01;00;48;10","which are being iterated,and sometimes even being extrapolated."
"01;00;48;21","01;00;51;10","So we have to really focus on what"
"01;00;51;10","01;00;54;00","that means under particular circumstances"
"01;00;54;10","01;00;56;23","as we move from place to place."
"01;00;57;25","01;00;59;25","So again, I'm not sure"
"01;01;01;07","01;01;04;08","maybe that'smaybe that's not being fair to the people"
"01;01;04;08","01;01;08;27","who wrote a 60 pageguide for philosophers."
"01;01;09;07","01;01;12;21","But I think if we're going to lookat the foundational things,"
"01;01;13;07","01;01;15;13","they're going to be able to tellwhether or not we're actually"
"01;01;16;00","01;01;18;00","doing and using active inference."
"01;01;18;17","01;01;22;02","I would think that at minimum those fourthings are going to be present,"
"01;01;23;09","01;01;25;17","starting with the filtering thing,because again,"
"01;01;25;24","01;01;29;16","if it's not a minimum of two,I think we over reduce"
"01;01;30;00","01;01;33;12","we put a frame around it, butwe don't actually know what's actually"
"01;01;33;26","01;01;36;20","a gradient descentand dynamically stable within that."
"01;01;37;10","01;01;39;26","So just something to think about."
"01;01;40;05","01;01;41;21","If we're going to write guides."
"01;01;43;27","01;01;44;22","They seem OK."
"01;01;44;22","01;01;46;27","Stephen, specifically on thatand then we'll go on."
"01;01;46;27","01;01;47;20","Yeah,"
"01;01;48;13","01;01;52;09","just referring to this idea of screensand it comes back to the idea"
"01;01;52;09","01;01;55;13","of screening all fulfilled wrongor I think that"
"01;01;56;00","01;01;58;24","the X and the Z here"
"01;01;58;24","01;01;59;15","is a question."
"01;01;59;15","01;02;02;24","We often in this particular context,"
"01;02;03;11","01;02;07;09","the I talk a lot about screening it offand it seems to be that"
"01;02;07;27","01;02;10;22","whereas in other contextssay actual constants work."
"01;02;11;05","01;02;14;07","So like it's trying to extractas much as possible"
"01;02;14;07","01;02;19;08","from the informational potentialin an environment."
"01;02;19;20","01;02;21;06","I think that's important, isn't it?"
"01;02;21;06","01;02;24;16","That isthis is a very different I've I've worked"
"01;02;24;22","01;02;28;04","I actually used to work as a print"
"01;02;28;04","01;02;31;29","broker,so I had to fire up these big presses"
"01;02;31;29","01;02;36;06","and it takes one a thousand copiesto get the magazine actually started"
"01;02;36;06","01;02;40;08","to print properly like the rollersand the blanket has to get tough."
"01;02;40;08","01;02;41;18","And everything we got with this waits."
"01;02;41;18","01;02;44;05","Eventually you get, you get somethingthat looks good and now it's running."
"01;02;44;17","01;02;46;13","So you got a thousand wasted copies."
"01;02;46;13","01;02;50;12","Basically, you're trying to extractas much as possible from the top"
"01;02;51;00","01;02;54;04","prints, print heads, printsit in the right is I'm a big press."
"01;02;54;20","01;02;57;26","Now, in that case, then you're tryingto get as much information"
"01;02;58;11","01;03;00;17","basically across into the paper."
"01;03;01;03","01;03;03;08","Now, there's other casesthat you can imagine"
"01;03;03;08","01;03;06;15","where it'sI don't know, someone's taken a video in"
"01;03;07;02","01;03;09;02","and there's brightlights going on in this."
"01;03;09;02","01;03;13;04","You know, you're trying to filter out,I would say copyright light."
"01;03;13;04","01;03;14;06","You know, you're looking at the sun."
"01;03;14;06","01;03;16;13","You got to filter out to see anything."
"01;03;16;13","01;03;19;03","In that case is still tryingto get the sensory"
"01;03;19;03","01;03;21;17","data, really still trying to workon the action policies."
"01;03;22;07","01;03;25;12","But both X and Z in a traditional"
"01;03;25;12","01;03;30;06","blanket is a dead thing,you know, but how much is X and Z"
"01;03;32;24","01;03;34;08","you know, and"
"01;03;34;08","01;03;39;14","how much is that a living kind of processat certain times that is moving."
"01;03;39;21","01;03;41;03","I mean, you could say it'sdoing a bit of everything,"
"01;03;41;03","01;03;44;21","but how much is ittrying to just to screen out noise"
"01;03;45;09","01;03;47;25","and bringing and how much is it trying"
"01;03;47;25","01;03;51;23","to extract, you know,from Shannon entropy and stuff like that."
"01;03;51;23","01;03;54;12","So, you know,I thought I'd mentioned that."
"01;03;54;12","01;03;54;18","Yeah."
"01;03;54;18","01;03;59;29","Makes me think of like being on the phonewith somebody and it's like you're both"
"01;03;59;29","01;04;03;04","trying to pull as much informationout of that limited channel"
"01;04;03;25","01;04;06;00","and put as much into a limited channel."
"01;04;06;02","01;04;10;14","So let's go on to"
"01;04;11;00","01;04;13;03","just a victory links"
"01;04;13;15","01;04;17;04","between or among dialectical categories."
"01;04;17;12","01;04;20;01","So we'll do some slide play."
"01;04;20;01","01;04;24;15","We have three types of claims."
"01;04;25;18","01;04;27;21","Dave, I hope I'm using the wordappropriately"
"01;04;27;21","01;04;31;04","that there are domainsof claims, mathematical"
"01;04;33;06","01;04;35;20","red, empirical"
"01;04;36;24","01;04;39;25","blue, general green,"
"01;04;41;24","01;04;45;23","OK, so no commitments,"
"01;04;46;09","01;04;49;01","but can somebody just like"
"01;04;49;01","01;04;54;25","give a specific conciseexample of where we see"
"01;04;55;02","01;04;59;10","one of these cross category statements?"
"01;05;00;10","01;05;02;25","It can be in any directionamong the three."
"01;05;03;09","01;05;06;05","Where's a casewhere somebody uses a mathematical"
"01;05;06;05","01;05;08;09","the first part of their sentenceis mathematical."
"01;05;08;22","01;05;10;19","And then the second part is empirical."
"01;05;10;19","01;05;11;23","Or vice versa."
"01;05;11;23","01;05;14;09","Where's the situation wherethe first part of someone's sentence"
"01;05;14;15","01;05;17;00","is mathematicaland the second part is general."
"01;05;17;20","01;05;21;11","So I'm sure that many have been saideven today,"
"01;05;21;18","01;05;25;07","but let's try to geta few really specific examples"
"01;05;25;07","01;05;28;17","so that people can just learn to identifythese kinds of sentences."
"01;05;28;26","01;05;30;21","And then we'll be evaluatingwhat they mean."
"01;05;30;21","01;05;31;20","So blue, go for it."
"01;05;33;11","01;05;35;14","So nothing that's been mentioned today."
"01;05;35;14","01;05;39;18","But you know, the the P value of point"
"01;05;39;27","01;05;42;20","five you know, demonstrates that that"
"01;05;43;03","01;05;45;20","whatever my claim is inmy experiment is significant."
"01;05;46;16","01;05;48;23","So that's something that's all the time"
"01;05;49;03","01;05;52;22","you see the statistic all,"
"01;05;52;29","01;05;53;22","you know,"
"01;05;54;13","01;05;56;19","justifying the empirical and less."
"01;05;56;19","01;06;00;07","So I think it's we're coming awayfrom the significance of the P value"
"01;06;01;03","01;06;03;26","in scientific literature,but you see that a lot."
"01;06;03;26","01;06;07;28","So where would we put that kind ofwhere would we put statistics?"
"01;06;07;28","01;06;12;02","What domains does statistics jump among?"
"01;06;12;25","01;06;17;09","So statistics to me is mathlike statistics is the sentence."
"01;06;18;03","01;06;20;11","That's the field that producesmathematics."
"01;06;20;14","01;06;23;00","And empirical clear conflictthough when you make the sentence"
"01;06;23;09","01;06;27;14","my p value of 4.5P less than point of five demonstrates"
"01;06;27;14","01;06;30;20","that whatever my claim is,my empirical claim is significant."
"01;06;30;20","01;06;34;18","So for me, statistics is that frictionbetween math and empirical claims."
"01;06;35;01","01;06;36;00","Awesome."
"01;06;36;10","01;06;39;07","Yes, totally agreed. We"
"01;06;40;06","01;06;41;13","looked at these two"
"01;06;41;13","01;06;45;17","categories of antsand we saw this one doing it six times."
"01;06;45;17","01;06;47;07","This one did it two times."
"01;06;47;07","01;06;50;11","We did some math on the numberssix and two."
"01;06;50;11","01;06;52;17","You can't do math on ants."
"01;06;52;17","01;06;54;21","You do math on the numbers, six and two."
"01;06;55;16","01;06;58;02","And from that mathematical claim"
"01;06;58;29","01;07;02;14","we're going to say somethingabout those two categories of ants."
"01;07;02;27","01;07;05;29","So yes, mathematics going to empirical"
"01;07;06;14","01;07;09;14","is a lot like statistics OK,"
"01;07;11;09","01;07;15;23","what about empiricalgoing back to mathematics?"
"01;07;16;11","01;07;19;08","What is a specific"
"01;07;19;08","01;07;21;17","natural language expression"
"01;07;21;17","01;07;24;00","where somebody begins"
"01;07;24;14","01;07;28;06","where the warrant of the rhetoricis empirically driven,"
"01;07;29;08","01;07;31;18","meaning based upon observation."
"01;07;31;18","01;07;35;19","And then the consequence of the argument"
"01;07;35;19","01;07;37;17","is mathematical"
"01;07;46;21","01;07;47;22","how about"
"01;07;48;18","01;07;51;26","because the organism is maintaining"
"01;07;51;26","01;07;55;08","body temperature,homeostasis is empirical."
"01;07;56;17","01;07;59;16","It is the case that it is doing"
"01;07;59;25","01;08;02;25","predictive processing or active inference"
"01;08;05;07","01;08;06;16","so here"
"01;08;10;13","01;08;12;24","it's now"
"01;08;12;24","01;08;15;19","there's so many ways to even enter here."
"01;08;15;26","01;08;18;19","But this would be like from results"
"01;08;19;15","01;08;22;13","that's the hallmark of startingin Empirical"
"01;08;23;00","01;08;26;19","is you're starting with somethingthat is almost either"
"01;08;26;19","01;08;30;00","trivial or just simply a factor observation about the world."
"01;08;30;21","01;08;33;27","So from results to what"
"01;08;35;26","01;08;38;27","some sort of"
"01;08;38;27","01;08;41;04","statement about."
"01;08;41;04","01;08;44;05","Now, what's interesting about the waythat the authors did it here"
"01;08;45;00","01;08;48;20","is they have noor none of the three cases"
"01;08;49;15","01;08;51;23","have mathematics"
"01;08;52;24","01;08;54;28","in the second position."
"01;08;55;10","01;08;57;24","And that's kind of like the xkcd comic"
"01;08;57;24","01;09;00;29","where mathematics is like,Oh, I'm way over here, I can't hear you."
"01;09;00;29","01;09;03;02","The fields arranged by purity mean"
"01;09;04;03","01;09;06;10","because mathematics is almost"
"01;09;06;21","01;09;09;08","framed as like internally coherent."
"01;09;09;22","01;09;12;16","And then informationcomes out of mathematics"
"01;09;13;12","01;09;15;21","but because it's theoretical or abstract,"
"01;09;16;11","01;09;20;13","there is an internal logicin mathematics called proof."
"01;09;21;15","01;09;22;16","And then"
"01;09;22;16","01;09;26;19","there's very littleneed to have something enter mathematics,"
"01;09;27;10","01;09;31;00","which is why it's a we'll seeas we start to flesh out this"
"01;09;32;16","01;09;33;18","shape."
"01;09;33;18","01;09;36;11","Stephen Yeah."
"01;09;36;11","01;09;37;22","As you're doing that, I'm curious,"
"01;09;37;22","01;09;40;06","what do you think aboutsomething like gambling?"
"01;09;40;06","01;09;42;04","So someone is"
"01;09;42;20","01;09;44;09","betting on horses?"
"01;09;44;09","01;09;47;06","Is this statistics of the horse gambling?"
"01;09;47;23","01;09;51;05","And then there's their motivationfor gambling."
"01;09;51;22","01;09;54;29","So in terms of the empirical,you can say, OK, the behavior"
"01;09;55;27","01;09;58;09","is fairly consistent certainly over"
"01;09;58;09","01;10;01;01","the type of gambler horse race."
"01;10;01;15","01;10;03;10","The math can be established."
"01;10;03;10","01;10;06;10","But then there's I don't knowwhether it goes into the general well,"
"01;10;06;10","01;10;09;26","what's people'smotivation for the teleology"
"01;10;09;26","01;10;13;00","if I maybe I'm jumping the gun there,but am I on the right lines there"
"01;10;13;17","01;10;15;20","in terms ofhow would you put that into this"
"01;10;17;09","01;10;18;20","scenario?"
"01;10;18;29","01;10;21;07","Can you restate it with an antecedentand a post"
"01;10;21;07","01;10;24;05","student,just a specific rhetorical nucleus."
"01;10;24;20","01;10;27;12","OK, so this is because."
"01;10;27;16","01;10;29;04","X then Y."
"01;10;29;04","01;10;32;23","Oh, because because there is"
"01;10;32;24","01;10;37;15","a group of people at a horse"
"01;10;38;23","01;10;40;19","racing track"
"01;10;41;15","01;10;45;20","and because we know that these horses"
"01;10;46;02","01;10;48;10","have performed"
"01;10;48;29","01;10;51;22","in a certain way over previous races,"
"01;10;52;18","01;10;54;26","we can predict the probability"
"01;10;55;23","01;10;57;28","that the horse will win"
"01;10;58;18","01;11;01;27","or be sold to people to win as being x."
"01;11;02;11","01;11;05;01","The motivation for people to make that"
"01;11;06;20","01;11;08;20","inference about"
"01;11;08;20","01;11;11;25","and the behavioral choicesis may be more general,"
"01;11;12;20","01;11;15;07","but since yes."
"01;11;15;07","01;11;17;28","We'll get to the general edgebecause it's very connected to math."
"01;11;17;29","01;11;19;14","OK, Dean."
"01;11;21;02","01;11;24;03","I was just going to say,I like the word results there, but I,"
"01;11;24;22","01;11;25;24","I think what,"
"01;11;25;24","01;11;29;15","what it's implied is that there werea certain number of observations taken"
"01;11;30;28","01;11;33;27","that then moved the formalism"
"01;11;33;27","01;11;35;23","to something specific."
"01;11;35;23","01;11;36;20","Is that"
"01;11;37;08","01;11;40;15","am I just confirming somethingor am I putting more in there"
"01;11;40;15","01;11;43;09","that needs to needs to be."
"01;11;43;20","01;11;46;25","I had a really similar question."
"01;11;46;27","01;11;50;13","So when you're talking about goingfrom empirical to math,"
"01;11;51;00","01;11;53;18","to me, like you brought up"
"01;11;53;18","01;11;56;16","that the ideaof like a probability density"
"01;11;56;16","01;11;59;23","or like a non equilibrium steady stateand like that's immediately"
"01;11;59;23","01;12;01;07","what came to my mind."
"01;12;01;07","01;12;04;09","So if that's echoes what Dean just said."
"01;12;04;21","01;12;05;29","Yeah. Does"
"01;12;08;02","01;12;10;13","let's get at the distinction"
"01;12;10;13","01;12;13;11","between general claimsand mathematical claims."
"01;12;14;13","01;12;16;28","So math is sometimes seen as general"
"01;12;17;12","01;12;20;12","and when ideas are framed mathematically,"
"01;12;20;26","01;12;25;02","indeed, there's a lot of overlap,but the authors do separate it out."
"01;12;25;02","01;12;27;12","It's in section 4.2.2."
"01;12;27;12","01;12;29;25","So what would be like an example"
"01;12;30;15","01;12;34;06","of going from a mathematicalto a general?"
"01;12;34;06","01;12;37;17","Because math then general or"
"01;12;37;25","01;12;40;18","because general claim, then mathematics."
"01;12;45;09","01;12;46;29","Well, you could,you can, you can talk about the rate"
"01;12;46;29","01;12;50;03","of the rate of the rate of accelerationdue to gravity"
"01;12;50;28","01;12;54;26","and then then make the general claimthat that"
"01;12;56;00","01;12;59;20","if I, if I go from,from this height to this height,"
"01;13;01;02","01;13;03;07","I I can I can expect to"
"01;13;04;22","01;13;06;28","hit the groundat a certain rate of speed or something."
"01;13;06;28","01;13;08;17","I would imagine."
"01;13;10;03","01;13;11;19","OK, great."
"01;13;11;19","01;13;15;24","I'm going to also pull outjust two examples from the paper."
"01;13;15;24","01;13;16;29","From the paper."
"01;13;16;29","01;13;19;11","So here we go. So we're in 4.2.2."
"01;13;19;23","01;13;22;19","So there can be two examples given."
"01;13;22;19","01;13;25;03","So again, we're looking here at math"
"01;13;25;03","01;13;28;07","going to general,and then we'll see if we can run it back."
"01;13;28;13","01;13;30;26","So how can mathematical claimsjustify general claims"
"01;13;33;04","01;13;35;24","Ramstad at all 2018 assert"
"01;13;36;17","01;13;40;11","the FP is a mathematical formulationthat explains from first principles"
"01;13;40;19","01;13;43;27","the characteristics of biological systemsthat are able to resist"
"01;13;44;14","01;13;46;28","decay and persist over time."
"01;13;46;28","01;13;51;24","The first part of the sentencemathematical second part general"
"01;13;53;12","01;13;54;09","it rests on the idea"
"01;13;54;09","01;13;58;09","that all biological systems instantiatea hierarchy"
"01;13;59;04","01;14;01;11","a hierarchical generativemodel of the world"
"01;14;01;11","01;14;04;24","that implicitly minimizesits entropy by minimizing free energy."
"01;14;06;17","01;14;08;16","I almost see the reflection"
"01;14;08;16","01;14;11;09","in that sentence"
"01;14;12;13","01;14;14;09","that because"
"01;14;14;09","01;14;18;00","of the hierarchical generative model,which is a general claim"
"01;14;18;20","01;14;21;11","though a formal one, then"
"01;14;21;21","01;14;23;24","there is a mathematical implication."
"01;14;24;25","01;14;28;16","So maybe we can put this Ramstad 2018here."
"01;14;29;09","01;14;31;20","OK, and then here's the secondor a second example"
"01;14;31;20","01;14;34;15","that the authors raise in the paper"
"01;14;35;11","01;14;38;13","actual constants contributionto this topical collection"
"01;14;39;03","01;14;41;22","uses a mathematical claimto make a general claim"
"01;14;42;26","01;14;44;26","on the basis of a numerical example"
"01;14;45;10","01;14;48;26","he argues against the claimthat minimizing free energy entails life."
"01;14;49;23","01;14;51;28","Rather, he believes the converse is true."
"01;14;51;28","01;14;53;26","Life entails minimizing free energy"
"01;14;54;25","01;14;57;05","we read and loved that paper"
"01;14;57;05","01;15;03;05","and that's very muchrelated to the quote."
"01;15;03;05","01;15;07;25","Like One ugly fact destroys a beautifultheory or something like that."
"01;15;09;10","01;15;11;15","Now is an example"
"01;15;12;10","01;15;15;16","mathematical or empirical,"
"01;15;15;16","01;15;17;28","but not if it were just"
"01;15;17;29","01;15;20;24","on the basis of a family of equations."
"01;15;21;21","01;15;24;23","He argues against the general claim"
"01;15;25;26","01;15;26;20","but then again,"
"01;15;26;20","01;15;29;06","isn't even the family of an equations"
"01;15;30;00","01;15;32;03","an empirical"
"01;15;33;02","01;15;35;10","observation from the domain of math?"
"01;15;35;22","01;15;37;27","But we'll put it in the sectionthat they had it."
"01;15;38;14","01;15;42;26","So in these caseswe're using specific math examples"
"01;15;43;06","01;15;46;29","and that was sort of the provocationof 34"
"01;15;47;12","01;15;51;23","and Axel's paper,which was like I did a math example."
"01;15;52;03","01;15;54;28","So it's kind of resting on boththe empirical and the mathematical."
"01;15;55;08","01;15;56;15","I did a math example"
"01;15;57;16","01;16;00;16","and now I'm going to make a claimabout a general topic,"
"01;16;00;16","01;16;03;27","which is the relationship between freeenergy minimization and life."
"01;16;04;27","01;16;08;17","So that is certainly movingin this direction,"
"01;16;10;13","01;16;13;15","whereas so"
"01;16;13;15","01;16;16;22","because math can be abstractedand generalized,"
"01;16;17;16","01;16;19;19","there's often similarity here"
"01;16;21;08","01;16;26;09","because math restsupon specific examples,"
"01;16;27;01","01;16;31;19","even if the examples are some examplesare more general than other examples."
"01;16;32;12","01;16;35;13","It still can be saidthat they're empirical,"
"01;16;35;13","01;16;38;07","not exactly in the waythat cat location measurement is,"
"01;16;38;16","01;16;43;03","but still it is the casethat math produces results."
"01;16;43;03","01;16;46;23","There could be a result sectionin a math paper"
"01;16;47;04","01;16;49;12","what about this third edge?"
"01;16;49;12","01;16;52;02","What's the relationshipbetween general and empirical?"
"01;16;52;21","01;16;57;23","And let's leave math out of it. Blue"
"01;17;01;13","01;17;04;10","so this is something like"
"01;17;04;10","01;17;06;21","I I think about like what Dean was saying"
"01;17;07;09","01;17;09;23","because the acceleration"
"01;17;09;23","01;17;13;05","due to gravity is -9.8meters per second squared"
"01;17;14;02","01;17;16;05","when I drop the sample,it will fall to the ground."
"01;17;16;24","01;17;19;08","Like thatgoes maybe empirical to general."
"01;17;23;29","01;17;26;07","When I when I dropped the apple"
"01;17;28;26","01;17;31;18","because when I drop the apple,it falls to the ground."
"01;17;32;14","01;17;34;28","Comma, gravity exists"
"01;17;34;28","01;17;38;10","in the whole universe."
"01;17;40;02","01;17;43;08","That was quite a jump."
"01;17;43;08","01;17;45;22","Well, because apples"
"01;17;45;22","01;17;48;01","fell in, not down"
"01;17;48;01","01;17;50;21","that's flat earth because apples fell in."
"01;17;51;16","01;17;53;21","Gravity is everywhere."
"01;17;56;24","01;17;59;13","OK, that's one example."
"01;18;00;12","01;18;03;14","So then I was thinking oflike a sort of ants evolution example."
"01;18;03;14","01;18;07;15","So the general to empiricalwould be like because of the way"
"01;18;07;15","01;18;09;19","that evolution by natural selection is"
"01;18;11;21","01;18;13;27","ants optimize"
"01;18;14;24","01;18;16;16","task efficiency"
"01;18;18;21","01;18;22;01","and then the other directionwould be like"
"01;18;22;25","01;18;26;08","because in my experiment, 30% of the time"
"01;18;26;19","01;18;29;08","ants were observed to be doing this"
"01;18;29;08","01;18;32;29","selection has been acting on ants"
"01;18;33;26","01;18;38;01","so these are very interestingbecause are there"
"01;18;38;01","01;18;41;06","some edgesthat we rest upon more like what"
"01;18;41;06","01;18;44;01","if we could just number of these edgesone, two, three, four, or five, six,"
"01;18;44;22","01;18;47;05","and then annotate and people could have"
"01;18;47;05","01;18;50;14","different perspectives on it,but we could annotate papers"
"01;18;51;19","01;18;54;02","in different areas."
"01;18;54;02","01;18;58;28","And OK, if you're just doing 111111111,"
"01;18;59;12","01;19;02;11","it's like a one note paperfrom a structural"
"01;19;02;12","01;19;04;24","topical perspective"
"01;19;05;29","01;19;09;08","under what situations is that preferable?"
"01;19;09;17","01;19;11;11","Not preferable."
"01;19;11;11","01;19;14;05","Are there certain edges that are weak?"
"01;19;14;05","01;19;17;25","Are there pairs of edges like a chordthat we want to play together?"
"01;19;18;12","01;19;21;22","Just like the Rams said, it was likesort of forwards and backwards."
"01;19;22;17","01;19;26;08","Law of the jungle, law of the pack,from the mathematics"
"01;19;26;08","01;19;29;00","to the general, and then instantly"
"01;19;30;17","01;19;33;04","a grammatical reflection"
"01;19;33;04","01;19;35;26","from the empirical into the mathematical"
"01;19;37;22","01;19;40;18","OK, Stephen, the need."
"01;19;41;19","01;19;46;05","So one question first, just ask Empirical"
"01;19;46;13","01;19;50;12","could be seenas is that exact Bayes going empirical."
"01;19;50;12","01;19;51;23","Means observed."
"01;19;51;26","01;19;55;13","Observed so the exact byif you just take in however you like,"
"01;19;55;13","01;19;58;12","the owl actually hasn't been computed"
"01;19;59;07","01;20;01;15","beyond observed."
"01;20;01;16","01;20;03;23","OK, so effectively that's true."
"01;20;03;23","01;20;04;27","OK, that's the first thing."
"01;20;04;27","01;20;06;27","And then General"
"01;20;07;29","01;20;08;17","in my"
"01;20;08;17","01;20;11;21","sense is, is what we might call inflateto the higher dimensional."
"01;20;12;16","01;20;16;10","So we go generally speaking,the models are empirical"
"01;20;17;17","01;20;21;14","from observe observationsinto math into generative model,"
"01;20;21;23","01;20;24;27","into some general pattern of actionselection."
"01;20;25;11","01;20;30;16","However, it could be possible,but generally it's interactive"
"01;20;30;16","01;20;34;17","for complex situations to go from general"
"01;20;36;13","01;20;38;00","to empirical"
"01;20;38;00","01;20;41;00","and then try and get the math out"
"01;20;41;01","01;20;43;10","which is kind of what Alex is saying."
"01;20;43;10","01;20;48;15","It's like there's a general principlethat empirically plays out"
"01;20;49;02","01;20;51;17","that good luck finds in the mathto show outside"
"01;20;51;17","01;20;53;09","of a bacteria."
"01;20;56;20","01;20;58;14","OK, Dean."
"01;20;59;20","01;21;03;06","So I find it interesting, Daniel,that you"
"01;21;03;06","01;21;06;12","just just keep the conversationsort of alive."
"01;21;06;12","01;21;09;04","As you talkedabout the edges of those three circles"
"01;21;10;07","01;21;11;13","and I think"
"01;21;12;12","01;21;16;01","I think the task of being ableto find examples"
"01;21;16;17","01;21;19;06","of those by directionality is"
"01;21;19;06","01;21;21;08","again, goes back to that question of so,"
"01;21;22;06","01;21;25;10","so what are the rulesand how fluid are they?"
"01;21;25;18","01;21;30;20","And as we're moving from one nodeso there's a change, the moving"
"01;21;30;20","01;21;34;18","from node to node,we're building that relationship."
"01;21;34;29","01;21;37;04","We're building out these rules."
"01;21;37;04","01;21;39;24","Is that is that one of the great"
"01;21;40;03","01;21;42;27","byproducts of being able to"
"01;21;44;21","01;21;45;10","maneuver and"
"01;21;45;10","01;21;47;28","manipulate, not getting stuck with only"
"01;21;49;11","01;21;52;06","a sense of unit directionality"
"01;21;52;06","01;21;53;27","or oneness?"
"01;21;54;05","01;21;57;01","Does this reinforce the ideathat if we're going to actually"
"01;21;57;01","01;22;00;24","really be able to demonstratethe use of active inference,"
"01;22;01;06","01;22;05;16","for example, as an instrumentor a tool to be able to gain"
"01;22;06;29","01;22;08;27","a greater awareness?"
"01;22;08;27","01;22;11;18","Are we really then talking about how"
"01;22;11;18","01;22;14;18","we not just find examples of rules,"
"01;22;14;18","01;22;17;22","but actually form them"
"01;22;22;03","01;22;22;26","because that's what you did."
"01;22;22;26","01;22;24;21","That was the exercise that you just went."
"01;22;24;21","01;22;26;18","You just built a whole bunch of rules."
"01;22;26;18","01;22;30;14","I know I know we've laid them downon the slide as examples, but"
"01;22;31;14","01;22;33;27","those relationships now are"
"01;22;34;07","01;22;37;00","they're not even bridged right"
"01;22;37;00","01;22;37;20","there."
"01;22;38;02","01;22;41;07","They've now some got some sort of aa pairing effect"
"01;22;45;02","01;22;47;04","so is that was that is that is that it?"
"01;22;47;10","01;22;50;10","I'm looking today back to theand then what happens?"
"01;22;50;11","01;22;53;06","What I'm looking today for isso we got our way."
"01;22;53;15","01;22;58;11","We guide our way to what is thereis there now an awareness, a sense"
"01;22;59;12","01;23;01;26","that we didn't have before"
"01;23;01;26","01;23;04;05","we went through that that effort"
"01;23;05;06","01;23;09;29","then is the thing that kicks out rulesor is it just examples?"
"01;23;09;29","01;23;11;08","What do you think?"
"01;23;12;05","01;23;16;01","I'm asking you, Daniel, because youyou did the most of this work."
"01;23;16;09","01;23;19;17","Do you see the rulesor do we just see the examples."
"01;23;23;22","01;23;24;19","I just think about"
"01;23;24;19","01;23;27;14","how in a nested cognitive model,"
"01;23;28;16","01;23;32;10","the outcome of one layeris like the inflow of another layer."
"01;23;32;16","01;23;37;05","So even a rule can be a rule in one layer"
"01;23;37;05","01;23;39;23","or application,but yet it's also an example"
"01;23;40;12","01;23;42;01","of a rule"
"01;23;43;09","01;23;46;02","mathematics and general claims"
"01;23;47;17","01;23;50;08","tend to be more rule like"
"01;23;51;03","01;23;53;07","but again, even rules are examples,"
"01;23;53;22","01;23;56;24","whereas empirical,"
"01;23;57;04","01;23;59;14","it's always the exceptionthat proves the rule like it's"
"01;23;59;14","01;24;02;26","the exception is the observation,which transcends rules,"
"01;24;03;28","01;24;04;12","because"
"01;24;04;12","01;24;06;14","if it happened, it had to have occurred."
"01;24;07;12","01;24;10;29","And so the empirical to meis like examples"
"01;24;12;05","01;24;14;18","when you're in this domain"
"01;24;14;18","01;24;16;07","and then"
"01;24;16;13","01;24;19;19","movements away from the examples"
"01;24;20;03","01;24;22;21","in the scientific empirical sense"
"01;24;23;15","01;24;26;09","pushes us into the rule world."
"01;24;26;24","01;24;28;04","So here"
"01;24;28;22","01;24;34;08","this redline is going to be more example, like"
"01;24;36;26","01;24;39;16","and so in that sense, like impure"
"01;24;40;06","01;24;42;23","with the caveat again that even rules"
"01;24;42;23","01;24;45;14","and generalizations are examples of"
"01;24;46;11","01;24;49;03","but in the scientific empirical sense,"
"01;24;49;13","01;24;52;05","this is more like an example."
"01;24;54;07","01;24;57;06","Can you hear,can you hear in your own explanation"
"01;24;57;14","01;24;59;18","the sort of just a factory link"
"01;25;00;12","01;25;02;24","between example and rule?"
"01;25;02;24","01;25;06;02","Do you hear yourselfjustifying the difference between"
"01;25;06;10","01;25;09;02","how we might look at math in general"
"01;25;09;02","01;25;11;28","as being different than the empirical?"
"01;25;12;13","01;25;13;26","That's all I'm trying to bring out."
"01;25;13;26","01;25;17;06","And and again, it's a not it's not."
"01;25;17;06","01;25;19;12","It's not. It's just nothing to me."
"01;25;19;12","01;25;22;27","I mean, it makes perfect sense,but I think if we're going to find"
"01;25;23;26","01;25;24;05","if we're"
"01;25;24;05","01;25;27;09","going to find that somebody used a guide"
"01;25;27;28","01;25;32;06","and what is the what is thewhat is the result of that?"
"01;25;32;14","01;25;36;10","It's going to bethat people have a better sense of"
"01;25;36;28","01;25;39;23","what the rules areand what the examples are"
"01;25;39;23","01;25;42;12","and what the relationship isbetween those two things."
"01;25;43;12","01;25;45;20","That would be goodness gracious."
"01;25;45;20","01;25;50;12","I mean, if I'm talking to anybodybetween the ages of 22 and 62,"
"01;25;50;18","01;25;53;04","if we could get their holy mackerel"
"01;25;56;01","01;25;56;20","thanks Steve."
"01;25;56;20","01;25;59;21","In terms of, in terms of opening upour understanding of things right"
"01;26;01;26","01;26;04;02","now. One thingI think with what you're saying"
"01;26;04;02","01;26;05;17","that Dean is"
"01;26;07;03","01;26;08;27","which is it does become interested in"
"01;26;08;27","01;26;11;12","and that's something that you mentioned"
"01;26;12;21","01;26;16;21","when we have multi scale,the actual nature"
"01;26;17;21","01;26;19;24","of the rule example"
"01;26;21;26","01;26;23;29","actually can shift"
"01;26;23;29","01;26;28;24","and it's technology's shift that I thinkis kind of revolutionary in a way."
"01;26;29;05","01;26;31;19","When we start to think about"
"01;26;32;03","01;26;34;15","there's a variation"
"01;26;34;15","01;26;39;20","in the nature of what rules are present,you know, so, you know, there's"
"01;26;39;20","01;26;43;26","sort of rules around what it means for meto do something in my environment."
"01;26;45;25","01;26;47;08","My cells individually."
"01;26;47;08","01;26;49;11","I can't play that game."
"01;26;49;11","01;26;51;14","I organs can't play that gameindividually."
"01;26;51;14","01;26;52;04","Right."
"01;26;52;04","01;26;55;23","So this these this there is"
"01;26;58;13","01;27;01;01","this this challenge of integrating"
"01;27;01;01","01;27;04;18","or maybe this isI do that table as well as saying"
"01;27;06;17","01;27;08;18","what's happening"
"01;27;09;26","01;27;11;26","what where is something"
"01;27;11;26","01;27;15;05","or what temporal and temporal and"
"01;27;16;29","01;27;19;09","temporal and spatial scale"
"01;27;20;20","01;27;22;18","does it hold?"
"01;27;22;18","01;27;26;08","And I think that may be somethingthat's kind of interesting is where"
"01;27;26;23","01;27;30;11","so generally speaking, peoplego to the racetrack"
"01;27;31;06","01;27;35;15","and, you know, they behavein certain behaviors at the scale of"
"01;27;37;01","01;27;39;13","that they're that that part in society."
"01;27;40;01","01;27;41;27","But they"
"01;27;42;00","01;27;44;09","and we have empirical datato support that."
"01;27;44;29","01;27;46;10","However,"
"01;27;47;00","01;27;49;15","at the biological level."
"01;27;49;15","01;27;53;12","And it may be somethingto do with adrenaline rush."
"01;27;53;12","01;27;56;07","You could talk aboutor you could talk about"
"01;27;56;07","01;27;58;14","the fact that they just happenedto have a nice sandwich bar"
"01;27;59;00","01;28;00;27","and someone enjoys getting the food."
"01;28;00;27","01;28;05;20","They don't even like gambling that much,whatever it is, or wearing a funny hat."
"01;28;05;20","01;28;10;03","ASCO so there's thisthere's something there that cool."
"01;28;10;24","01;28;13;13","How do we I wonder that"
"01;28;13;13","01;28;17;20","that multi scale questionbecause I'm very cool with the idea"
"01;28;17;20","01;28;22;16","that you've got actual consenttaking very, very small."
"01;28;22;29","01;28;27;15","You have this incredibly small worldbeing addressed with active environments."
"01;28;28;09","01;28;31;04","And then we have quite"
"01;28;31;13","01;28;32;06","sort of"
"01;28;33;02","01;28;36;16","you could say gross examples at scale"
"01;28;36;16","01;28;41;04","which ends uprevealing a large, you know, larger scale"
"01;28;43;14","01;28;47;24","but I wonder what you think, Daniel,about what"
"01;28;47;25","01;28;51;03","what happens and that reflectswhat then you I think was saying"
"01;28;51;03","01;28;55;28","about nested systems and the sort ofinforming each other in a way"
"01;28;55;28","01;29;00;13","like if I if I think I'm going to winsome money on the races"
"01;29;00;13","01;29;05;07","and I better get myself sorted,I might sustain my stomach a bit more."
"01;29;05;07","01;29;08;26","So I've got a better glucose levelto make a good choice."
"01;29;09;08","01;29;09;29","Right."
"01;29;09;29","01;29;11;11","So suddenly"
"01;29;11;11","01;29;14;17","there's two different levels coming intoplay with is different scales."
"01;29;14;17","01;29;17;29","So I don't if that'sI don't think that confusing things,"
"01;29;17;29","01;29;21;03","but I think it doesmake the modeling question"
"01;29;22;00","01;29;25;01","because an act of inferenceis ultimately a modeling process"
"01;29;28;23","01;29;31;20","which is trying to get at"
"01;29;33;10","01;29;36;09","I would say it's trying to eitherget at the general"
"01;29;37;02","01;29;41;02","or to to predict and empirical"
"01;29;42;12","01;29;43;10","if I if I'm"
"01;29;43;10","01;29;46;13","looking at this diagram,but maybe I'm mistaken there."
"01;29;47;22","01;29;47;29","Right."
"01;29;47;29","01;29;50;17","Where is active inference"
"01;29;50;22","01;29;51;11","in this?"
"01;29;51;11","01;29;53;16","Is this the trace of active inference?"
"01;29;54;10","01;29;55;16","Is this the map?"
"01;29;55;16","01;29;57;24","But then we play on this territory,"
"01;29;59;08","01;30;00;29","what is the adjacent possible?"
"01;30;00;29","01;30;05;19","And so we can ask first, where's activeinference here and when is it here?"
"01;30;05;19","01;30;08;12","And then what next? Dean?"
"01;30;08;12","01;30;12;08","Yeah, this is where I thinkit's it's about it's in the relationships"
"01;30;12;24","01;30;16;12","and how we decide to parsethose relationships and it seems rather"
"01;30;16;12","01;30;17;12","arbitrary."
"01;30;17;12","01;30;21;05","And I think it's one of the reasonswhy we're we can always disagree on"
"01;30;21;05","01;30;24;08","when the rules are in effectand when they're not in effect"
"01;30;24;15","01;30;27;28","when it's happening up here in Canada,we've got all these rules in place"
"01;30;27;28","01;30;32;09","and then people just decide to pull upbig trucks to the border"
"01;30;32;09","01;30;36;06","and go, no,we don't like your rule right."
"01;30;36;06","01;30;36;28","And so now there's"
"01;30;38;08","01;30;39;01","being Canadian."
"01;30;39;01","01;30;40;26","Now we have to figure outhow we're going to deal with that"
"01;30;40;26","01;30;42;23","because we don't have any guns."
"01;30;42;23","01;30;44;15","So I guess we're going to have to"
"01;30;44;15","01;30;46;19","disassembleall the trucks or something by hand."
"01;30;46;19","01;30;49;21","But the thing is, is that"
"01;30;49;21","01;30;53;06","if you actually look at this act,inference is in the relationship."
"01;30;53;23","01;30;56;25","And I think it'sand then and I think to Stephen's point,"
"01;30;58;03","01;31;00;27","if we if we think that a rule applies"
"01;31;01;10","01;31;04;20","without limits,that's the scale free part of it."
"01;31;05;06","01;31;09;14","From a mathematical standpoint, we canwe can find cases where that's true,"
"01;31;09;28","01;31;13;04","but then there's a very scalefriendly part of it which says, I don't"
"01;31;13;15","01;31;16;24","this rule doesn't seem to make sensein this specific situation."
"01;31;17;06","01;31;18;23","And that's where Axel came forward."
"01;31;20;25","01;31;22;27","He essentially said, I'm sorry, but"
"01;31;23;16","01;31;25;17","and so did I'm sorry. The"
"01;31;27;20","01;31;30;07","there was another authorwe had very recently"
"01;31;31;08","01;31;33;24","who agreed and said,there's this machine."
"01;31;34;07","01;31;37;29","She'd said, look,there's there's a piece to this that says"
"01;31;39;03","01;31;41;18","there's something that's localand proximal and specific."
"01;31;41;18","01;31;44;19","And why are we pretending like that?"
"01;31;44;19","01;31;48;04","That fitsthe same context. To scale free."
"01;31;48;04","01;31;51;24","So again, I think I don't see"
"01;31;51;24","01;31;54;26","that meansthat active inference is useless."
"01;31;55;07","01;31;58;19","I think what it means isit can tell us when we can differentiate"
"01;31;58;23","01;32;00;09","and when we can integrate."
"01;32;00;09","01;32;02;17","That's relational"
"01;32;05;10","01;32;07;23","so one thing this made me think ofis that"
"01;32;09;09","01;32;11;24","we're reading a paper on"
"01;32;11;24","01;32;14;07","free energy, free energyprinciple, active inference."
"01;32;15;24","01;32;17;13","Look at the road map."
"01;32;17;13","01;32;22;06","There's no dialectic within a domain"
"01;32;22;29","01;32;26;18","the claims are listed, butit goes immediately to the relationship."
"01;32;26;18","01;32;28;26","So it's like minimum to domains."
"01;32;28;26","01;32;33;16","OK, now it makes me think about thestructure of scientific communication."
"01;32;33;28","01;32;37;18","So in the results section of the paper,what so the introduction"
"01;32;38;04","01;32;40;14","might have a lot ofgeneral and empirical claims"
"01;32;41;23","01;32;44;16","selectionacts on ants and look at their mandibles."
"01;32;44;26","01;32;47;27","And we know this about new constructionand look at how they do it."
"01;32;48;15","01;32;51;08","So that is like a very introductorypiece."
"01;32;51;08","01;32;54;17","There's not often formalismsin the introduction of the paper."
"01;32;54;17","01;32;58;07","So that sort of Blue Arrow Generaland empirical is very introductory"
"01;32;58;16","01;32;59;26","in its scope."
"01;33;00;04","01;33;02;07","Then the results section of the paper"
"01;33;02;26","01;33;06;06","is like Blue mentioned,it's about like empirical and math."
"01;33;06;19","01;33;08;27","We saw it do it11 times, and here's the P value."
"01;33;08;27","01;33;11;01","And then we did thisand we calculated the model"
"01;33;11;01","01;33;14;20","and so it's like it shouldn'tgeneralize in some senses."
"01;33;15;04","01;33;19;25","And then in the discussion,there's probably all edges in play,"
"01;33;20;10","01;33;22;18","but especially math to general,"
"01;33;23;07","01;33;27;01","because it's now been generalizedbeyond the mere empirical,"
"01;33;27;12","01;33;29;26","because we saw a P valuein the difference"
"01;33;29;26","01;33;32;14","between the estimates of this typeand that type."
"01;33;32;26","01;33;36;15","It does say something about evolutionor because there's something"
"01;33;36;15","01;33;40;13","happening at an evolutionary timescale, it's consistent or inconsistent"
"01;33;40;13","01;33;43;25","with our mathematical summary statistics."
"01;33;44;07","01;33;48;09","Yes, that came from empirical,but that edge is more in play."
"01;33;49;17","01;33;50;14","And that"
"01;33;51;05","01;33;53;21","in simple, simple terms, that's how"
"01;33;53;21","01;33;56;16","and when we fit out the rule."
"01;33;58;28","01;34;00;15","And that almost"
"01;34;00;15","01;34;02;26","it does return us to the third P,"
"01;34;04;17","01;34;06;09","but I think it's so we'll kind of"
"01;34;06;09","01;34;10;28","close this sectionon the two point of four or whatever"
"01;34;10;28","01;34;14;29","it was with the linksamong the dialectical categories,"
"01;34;16;15","01;34;18;26","active inferenceas a transgressive Flynn."
"01;34;20;16","01;34;23;18","All of these are often in play,and it's almost like"
"01;34;24;05","01;34;26;06","if the paper would have just been"
"01;34;26;21","01;34;31;21","lists of empirical observations,there'd be nothing contentious because"
"01;34;31;21","01;34;35;01","it wouldn't make any general claimsthat would just be called a data set."
"01;34;36;03","01;34;38;28","If it were just general claims"
"01;34;39;27","01;34;42;04","it would be just philosophy."
"01;34;42;04","01;34;46;03","And that's not to sayphilosophy is easier or simpler."
"01;34;46;03","01;34;50;23","It's like it doesn't triggeranyone's domain crossing alarm,"
"01;34;51;29","01;34;54;26","but like mathematical biology that does"
"01;34;56;01","01;34;59;15","raise people's alarmsor generalized for math."
"01;35;00;03","01;35;02;09","You're saying thatbecause of the free energy minimizing"
"01;35;02;09","01;35;06;02","that there's a general imperativefor information foraging or"
"01;35;06;20","01;35;09;02","relationshipbetween the general and the empirical"
"01;35;09;02","01;35;11;07","of course,always fraught in empirical science."
"01;35;11;19","01;35;14;23","OK, you measured in that laboratory study"
"01;35;14;23","01;35;17;19","with those undergrads and that stimuli,"
"01;35;17;28","01;35;21;01","and you're going to say somethingabout aggression."
"01;35;21;01","01;35;23;23","So it's just very interesting"
"01;35;23;23","01;35;27;01","because active inference does lay claim"
"01;35;27;29","01;35;30;00","or at least they play"
"01;35;30;17","01;35;33;18","to all these areas that"
"01;35;34;19","01;35;38;06","it raises alarms on all sides."
"01;35;38;25","01;35;42;20","But how do we take that alarm,pheromones and attention"
"01;35;43;07","01;35;47;07","and then just align it"
"01;35;47;17","01;35;50;15","with somethingthat's going to be a public good"
"01;35;50;15","01;35;52;21","rather than just"
"01;35;54;02","01;35;55;27","let it fizzle?"
"01;35;55;27","01;35;56;20","Stephen"
"01;35;58;28","01;35;59;20","That's very helpful."
"01;35;59;20","01;36;04;15","And the nature of actionand the idea that biology,"
"01;36;05;14","01;36;07;19","soon as that comes in, I don't knowif you can avoid"
"01;36;07;19","01;36;12;05","being in in the generaland maybe active vision that's just doing"
"01;36;12;19","01;36;16;04","a thousanddimensional interpretation of a data set."
"01;36;16;04","01;36;19;08","You know, can stick with empirical math."
"01;36;19;13","01;36;22;14","You know, it's eitherrecognizing a photo, it's"
"01;36;22;14","01;36;24;29","not recognizing the photo,doing some deep"
"01;36;26;09","01;36;30;08","the computational processes, but action"
"01;36;30;27","01;36;34;14","and particularly then action policyand then take the other G"
"01;36;36;13","01;36;37;18","and would you say that"
"01;36;37;18","01;36;41;14","would you say this just general claimsor is where"
"01;36;41;14","01;36;43;17","where would Teleology fits in here?"
"01;36;54;03","01;36;56;29","Teleology is never directly measured."
"01;36;57;18","01;36;59;09","Is that fair to say?"
"01;37;00;07","01;37;01;19","So it can it"
"01;37;01;19","01;37;04;13","can always it can be it can be in green,"
"01;37;05;16","01;37;07;03","but it cannot be blue."
"01;37;07;03","01;37;09;11","One can say, I observed sorry blue,"
"01;37;10;10","01;37;13;04","but I chose the colors for reason to one"
"01;37;13;04","01;37;16;26","could observe the animaltrying to swim to the surface."
"01;37;17;07","01;37;19;25","And you can say, well,the teleology is obviously not to drown"
"01;37;19;25","01;37;22;07","or something like that,but that's actually structured"
"01;37;22;07","01;37;25;16","as because I empirically observedthe swimming behavior,"
"01;37;26;02","01;37;29;17","I am going to make aclaim about the teleology. So"
"01;37;31;19","01;37;35;00","I wouldsay Teleology is in a general case,"
"01;37;36;16","01;37;38;27","even another spin on"
"01;37;38;27","01;37;43;00","this one would be empirical is like X."
"01;37;43;20","01;37;46;09","This is the datathat we're actually observing."
"01;37;47;07","01;37;49;23","General is unobserved"
"01;37;50;05","01;37;53;19","you can't observe thingsthat are general."
"01;37;53;20","01;37;56;22","You're only observing what Blake callsthe mind particular"
"01;37;57;26","01;38;00;08","W Yeah."
"01;38;00;08","01;38;02;03","What is math"
"01;38;05;18","01;38;08;13","math is in the examples"
"01;38;08;13","01;38;11;04","that we looked at, it's like the process."
"01;38;12;06","01;38;12;29","Oh, wait."
"01;38;12;29","01;38;13;27","Active inference."
"01;38;13;27","01;38;17;16","It's a mathematical process theory."
"01;38;17;25","01;38;20;19","So math is a process or of inference"
"01;38;21;20","01;38;23;14","that yes."
"01;38;23;14","01;38;26;10","Connects to generalities."
"01;38;26;17","01;38;27;27","And this is not hard"
"01;38;27;27","01;38;30;19","and fast, I hope is not being interpretedin the most rigorous way."
"01;38;31;07","01;38;33;09","But it does generalize"
"01;38;34;17","01;38;36;25","because it has to be"
"01;38;36;25","01;38;38;26","like the intermediating blanket."
"01;38;39;10","01;38;42;15","So let's pull this W and X back in here."
"01;38;43;02","01;38;43;12","All right."
"01;38;44;11","01;38;48;13","So here we have the empirical states here"
"01;38;49;20","01;38;50;23","being observed."
"01;38;50;23","01;38;53;29","That's our data. OK,"
"01;38;55;00","01;38;57;23","then here's the thingsthat we would like to generalize on."
"01;39;00;10","01;39;04;15","And then this gets to Dean's questionabout how do you go from this"
"01;39;04;15","01;39;06;10","to equations"
"01;39;07;23","01;39;08;21","and here's math"
"01;39;08;21","01;39;12;07","as our sort of blanket in the middle"
"01;39;12;17","01;39;14;16","that's when we actually do,"
"01;39;14;16","01;39;17;09","whether it's variational, uh,"
"01;39;18;23","01;39;21;12","base or whether it's exact"
"01;39;21;12","01;39;24;05","or whether there'ssome other mathematical approach,"
"01;39;25;06","01;39;29;26","it's how we're going to go from thesegeneralized or hypothesized things"
"01;39;29;26","01;39;33;28","that we didn't observehow are we going to connect that domain?"
"01;39;34;22","01;39;37;01","And so it'salmost like a little boomerang."
"01;39;38;00","01;39;41;17","So there's probably a lot moreto explore here to Dean."
"01;39;42;25","01;39;45;08","I just like,I like how this has come together"
"01;39;45;08","01;39;48;19","because math, as we said before, well,as I mentioned before,"
"01;39;49;04","01;39;52;12","I think when the authors in the author'smind, the motivation"
"01;39;52;22","01;39;55;15","moving forward on the paper was mathcould be a vehicle"
"01;39;56;07","01;39;59;17","and it can move the process alongbecause it is a process"
"01;39;59;28","01;40;02;00","or it can be an impedimentthe other thing"
"01;40;02;00","01;40;04;05","that's really interesting hereis that because it's in the middle,"
"01;40;05;10","01;40;07;06","isn't math got a lot of rules in it?"
"01;40;07;06","01;40;10;05","I mean, man, right."
"01;40;10;12","01;40;14;13","So again, I don't think I don't thinkwe're contradicting ourselves."
"01;40;14;20","01;40;16;02","I just think we're asking."
"01;40;16;02","01;40;18;12","So again, what do we allowto pass through the sieve"
"01;40;19;01","01;40;20;26","and what do we hold back"
"01;40;20;26","01;40;24;04","and then what assumptions do we makeabout the sophistication?"
"01;40;24;21","01;40;28;18","What what's the minimum amountof sophistication around the math process"
"01;40;28;25","01;40;31;12","that one must have talked to Karl firstand said,"
"01;40;32;11","01;40;34;25","you must have a you must have a good,"
"01;40;35;09","01;40;37;17","grounded sense of what the math is"
"01;40;37;27","01;40;41;11","if you're going to go forwardlike you didn't coach his words,"
"01;40;42;15","01;40;45;13","you said, if you want this to becomea vehicle and not an impediment,"
"01;40;45;29","01;40;48;06","you're going to have toget familiar with the math."
"01;40;49;08","01;40;53;16","So and sometimes,oh, the math is not the territory,"
"01;40;53;22","01;40;56;24","you know, important contributionin means for sure."
"01;40;57;28","01;41;01;26","If the debate were aboutwhether territories were maps,"
"01;41;02;07","01;41;05;23","it would be the silver bullet to simplyclaim that the math is not the territory,"
"01;41;06;04","01;41;07;21","but it's right."
"01;41;07;21","01;41;09;20","And we want the map"
"01;41;09;20","01;41;13;22","so that we can take actionand be on our road trip or whatever."
"01;41;14;08","01;41;17;29","So it's the math is not the territory"
"01;41;18;05","01;41;21;03","while it's the conclusion or the"
"01;41;22;07","01;41;25;20","second part of the rhetoric"
"01;41;25;20","01;41;27;29","for some, especially philosophers"
"01;41;27;29","01;41;30;18","who might be interested inwhat is really out there"
"01;41;32;12","01;41;35;24","because the math is not the territory,comma, then what"
"01;41;36;20","01;41;39;09","that's like the dot two of active,"
"01;41;40;08","01;41;42;21","which is instead of just debating."
"01;41;42;21","01;41;47;01","Well, yeah, well, because of homeostasis,what can you really say about Teleology"
"01;41;47;01","01;41;51;00","and because of our status, doesthat contribute to a new understanding"
"01;41;51;00","01;41;53;27","of new construction?They're all important questions."
"01;41;56;07","01;41;58;16","But then where do we go"
"01;41;59;12","01;42;03;23","when we put the math is not the territoryas our antecedent"
"01;42;03;23","01;42;06;04","rather than in our conclusionrhetorically."
"01;42;06;08","01;42;08;23","Stephen Yeah."
"01;42;08;23","01;42;12;07","And like when you put here,so first the math."
"01;42;12;07","01;42;13;03","I totally agree."
"01;42;13;03","01;42;16;23","I was thinking that vehicle was thinkingit also takes in different."
"01;42;16;23","01;42;21;27","So for instance say I have $1,000,000,it gets picked up, is counted,"
"01;42;21;27","01;42;25;03","is picked up in a car, taken somewhereand then it's counts as $1,000,000."
"01;42;25;18","01;42;26;18","The bit in between."
"01;42;26;18","01;42;28;20","It's not math, it's just stuff. Right."
"01;42;29;08","01;42;31;09","But in this process theory,"
"01;42;32;01","01;42;35;05","it's in a way in thewhat is the math is a nice evening"
"01;42;35;15","01;42;38;26","and it could be an end topic processand it could be math thing."
"01;42;38;26","01;42;43;03","These may be some sort of virtual numbersway or noise way,"
"01;42;43;14","01;42;45;24","but the math is the vehicle for the data."
"01;42;46;21","01;42;47;01","Right."
"01;42;47;02","01;42;49;12","There is no data.There is no banknote. Right."
"01;42;49;21","01;42;52;18","There is only a process which enables"
"01;42;53;13","01;42;55;18","the general to the empirical."
"01;42;55;18","01;43;01;07","And the empirical in this context isit is a model is empirical in a way."
"01;43;01;07","01;43;04;04","What we're saying is we're going to takemost of the models that we see."
"01;43;04;04","01;43;08;10","There's a very simple general ideaabout behavior."
"01;43;08;20","01;43;13;10","So Ryan Smith's idea about how the heartbehaves, how the gut behaves,"
"01;43;13;21","01;43;18;25","something about how access consciousnessor access awareness"
"01;43;19;05","01;43;22;12","is achieved, some general thing."
"01;43;22;18","01;43;25;22","And then we basically dowhat we might call the modeled empirical,"
"01;43;26;04","01;43;28;24","but you could flip it around theother way and you could have,"
"01;43;30;24","01;43;33;08","OK, well, the real world"
"01;43;33;08","01;43;35;28","we could have high dimensional"
"01;43;36;04","01;43;38;09","empirical upside there."
"01;43;39;04","01;43;40;20","What's the general W?"
"01;43;40;20","01;43;42;24","What's the general X?"
"01;43;42;24","01;43;45;13","Internally, what's the general,"
"01;43;45;13","01;43;47;14","which is what we use as our heuristics,"
"01;43;48;29","01;43;49;29","you know,"
"01;43;50;19","01;43;52;10","which could be kind ofinteresting as well."
"01;43;52;10","01;43;57;28","Which is may be more in the actionbecause this is coming in on the century."
"01;43;58;04","01;43;58;25","Right."
"01;43;58;26","01;44;01;11","But I think this is quite helpful."
"01;44;01;11","01;44;03;25","Would you say that's true? It'sthat it's a model empirical."
"01;44;03;25","01;44;05;15","What we get on the"
"01;44;06;25","01;44;08;17","in terms of how we work with it in the"
"01;44;08;17","01;44;11;09","in the active inference I."
"01;44;13;04","01;44;15;16","Mean, looking back on it,"
"01;44;16;01","01;44;19;03","is there anyone who disagreesthat empirical is always"
"01;44;19;03","01;44;21;13","as modeled like"
"01;44;22;28","01;44;24;21","it's kind of funny, like"
"01;44;24;21","01;44;27;04","now I want to put a little red guy"
"01;44;27;04","01;44;30;01","always intervening on this edge."
"01;44;33;09","01;44;33;17","Little."
"01;44;33;17","01;44;37;13","Blue guy,always talking about specific examples"
"01;44;37;13","01;44;41;12","of math and generalityand then, you know,"
"01;44;41;17","01;44;43;22","the generalization is we use that,"
"01;44;44;13","01;44;47;07","you know, in equal variance t test."
"01;44;47;07","01;44;51;22","So he generalizedto connect the empirical and the math."
"01;44;52;26","01;44;58;04","Then I really didn'twant to go there here, but I have to"
"01;44;58;16","01;45;01;29","like as a way too excited last weekwhen I had a little thought bubble"
"01;45;01;29","01;45;04;24","and said, wouldn't it be coolif my f Michael"
"01;45;06;18","01;45;07;28","or sorry if Steven Mann"
"01;45;07;28","01;45;11;14","and Connor Hinesif we could get them in a room"
"01;45;11;24","01;45;15;02","and instead of themtalking about what they know,"
"01;45;15;13","01;45;17;27","get them to go through this process."
"01;45;18;11","01;45;19;16","Because that's essentially"
"01;45;19;16","01;45;24;09","what we want to do is thiswe want to have that little guy pop out"
"01;45;24;09","01;45;28;15","as opposed to the one who knowsso much in a dense way about their math."
"01;45;28;15","01;45;31;26","There's so much in a dense wayabout their philosophical guide"
"01;45;32;14","01;45;37;14","because that's when the that's whenthe true grasp of what the potential is."
"01;45;37;14","01;45;40;28","And it's not it'snot about always having the right answer."
"01;45;41;09","01;45;44;16","It's coming up with the best answerin that moment."
"01;45;44;16","01;45;45;06","Right."
"01;45;45;06","01;45;48;08","And if we could get moreof those kind of situations,"
"01;45;48;25","01;45;50;06","I think people would actually"
"01;45;51;12","01;45;52;22","think people actually come"
"01;45;52;22","01;45;56;06","away feeling even more confidentbecause that's what this is about."
"01;45;56;22","01;45;58;01","It's about confidence developing."
"01;45;58;01","01;45;59;00","I think"
"01;46;00;10","01;46;04;02","one a thought onthat is like it's possible"
"01;46;04;02","01;46;07;16","to stay purely internal to math,"
"01;46;07;16","01;46;09;29","and that's the internal logic of proofs."
"01;46;10;20","01;46;14;14","It's also possibleto stay internal to general claims"
"01;46;16;24","01;46;18;18","and do philosophy"
"01;46;19;18","01;46;22;28","is it possible to stay purely"
"01;46;24;04","01;46;26;06","within the realm of empiricism?"
"01;46;29;03","01;46;30;19","In the trivial case, yes."
"01;46;30;19","01;46;35;04","If you're just aggregating data setsand never interpreting them, yes."
"01;46;35;18","01;46;38;25","But empirical in application"
"01;46;40;04","01;46;43;12","must either connect to a general questionlike, you know,"
"01;46;43;16","01;46;45;17","we observed the ants and nowwe're going to talk about evolution."
"01;46;45;17","01;46;49;12","So it's still qualitativebut it's it's an edge."
"01;46;49;12","01;46;53;07","And then it rests on mathwhen it's more statistical"
"01;46;53;20","01;46;55;17","and on generalities, when it's more"
"01;46;57;10","01;47;00;10","conceptualwell, but it's just sort of interesting"
"01;47;00;10","01;47;04;29","that the internal logic of empiricismis basically just data integrity,"
"01;47;05;22","01;47;07;29","but it's like pre interpretation"
"01;47;07;29","01;47;10;02","which is perfect for it being X."
"01;47;10;24","01;47;11;10","Yeah."
"01;47;11;16","01;47;14;12","Whereas there's a whole"
"01;47;14;12","01;47;16;18","guild structure and discipline"
"01;47;17;15","01;47;19;18","around internal mathematics"
"01;47;19;18","01;47;21;28","and internal generalizationsand philosophy."
"01;47;23;23","01;47;25;28","And so it's like"
"01;47;26;04","01;47;28;18","I and I also really agreewith that, having them, I thought,"
"01;47;28;18","01;47;31;04","you're going to say, just get themin the same room and then just"
"01;47;32;11","01;47;35;00","talk about food or musicor something like that."
"01;47;35;00","01;47;36;23","No, but I know what you mean."
"01;47;36;23","01;47;41;16","Have them and just likewe're all learning by doing in this space"
"01;47;42;10","01;47;43;13","and to say"
"01;47;43;13","01;47;46;16","that this is a lifelong journey,it would just be a total understatement."
"01;47;46;16","01;47;49;29","It's it's broader and deeper than that."
"01;47;50;15","01;47;53;01","So how do we recognize"
"01;47;53;01","01;47;56;15","the complexity of this arrangementas well?"
"01;47;56;15","01;47;59;10","As the adjacent possible,other ways that it could have been made,"
"01;47;59;19","01;48;01;20","other end statesthat we could have reached,"
"01;48;03;06","01;48;03;24","bringing in"
"01;48;03;24","01;48;06;04","any number of fourth pointsto make a tetrahedra"
"01;48;06;24","01;48;09;28","any other number of orders of pathsthat we could have done"
"01;48;09;28","01;48;13;08","to reach this point, likeif we had started with these little dots"
"01;48;13;23","01;48;18;08","and then later added the arrowsand how did we start this whole thing"
"01;48;18;20","01;48;21;12","with examples of each edge?"
"01;48;21;12","01;48;24;15","So getting to the super"
"01;48;24;15","01;48;27;04","like fractal multi scale level where"
"01;48;27;28","01;48;30;20","and we didn't even addany formalisms or mathematics here,"
"01;48;31;12","01;48;35;10","but we could have done some pseudo codeor some pseudo equations"
"01;48;35;28","01;48;40;00","to really start to link thisand to lean more on our mathematical leg."
"01;48;40;12","01;48;43;24","And that's the whole thing that you justsaid about confidence, which is like"
"01;48;44;13","01;48;46;24","this is the spacethat we're going to be bouncing around"
"01;48;47;03","01;48;50;10","and you can ignore statisticsand you can just have"
"01;48;50;10","01;48;52;18","an emotional responseto values and stuff like that, but"
"01;48;53;14","01;48;56;18","you will need that as part of the journey"
"01;48;58;18","01;48;59;07","we can't just"
"01;48;59;07","01;49;01;26","be like the post office vehiclesthat don't make left turns."
"01;49;02;09","01;49;05;15","We have to make all of our toolsavailable"
"01;49;06;03","01;49;10;06","at the team level and then trust thatwith like distributed cognition"
"01;49;10;06","01;49;13;03","and with guides and way finders"
"01;49;13;28","01;49;17;12","and peer facilitation that like we can"
"01;49;18;16","01;49;22;17","make it workdespite how vast this area is."
"01;49;22;29","01;49;25;12","So, yes, Stephen,"
"01;49;25;25","01;49;28;08","as we go for our final commentary."
"01;49;28;13","01;49;31;23","Yeah, I think you made a good point therewith that Green Arrow."
"01;49;31;23","01;49;34;12","Just one last thing with the Green Arrowyou put there"
"01;49;34;12","01;49;38;12","that be more incremental in fermentable"
"01;49;39;14","01;49;42;27","and like it becomes more implementable"
"01;49;42;27","01;49;45;25","as she comes that directionand away from the math"
"01;49;47;05","01;49;50;14","with a mixture of genuine and empiricaland just curious."
"01;49;51;07","01;49;52;20","So the arrows."
"01;49;52;20","01;49;53;19","Yeah, the arrows."
"01;49;53;19","01;49;54;13","I mean, again,"
"01;49;54;13","01;49;56;25","they're open to interpretation other waysyou could have been done."
"01;49;57;06","01;49;59;21","I was thinking what links of mathand empirical are?"
"01;49;59;27","01;50;01;28","They're both more numerical."
"01;50;01;28","01;50;04;11","That's the bottom edge. OK, then, then"
"01;50;05;16","01;50;06;08","what?"
"01;50;07;00","01;50;09;13","Then what makes math in general similar"
"01;50;09;17","01;50;12;14","there less example like"
"01;50;12;14","01;50;16;04","and then what is the similaritybetween empirical and general?"
"01;50;16;08","01;50;18;04","So what is not just pointing?"
"01;50;18;04","01;50;21;12","What's the arrow that doesn'tpoint to general, but what's the arrow"
"01;50;21;12","01;50;24;04","that pointsbetween general and empirical?"
"01;50;24;23","01;50;27;02","And what distinguishes mathematics"
"01;50;27;16","01;50;30;23","from general empiricalit might be it's formalism, but"
"01;50;32;05","01;50;33;05","general."
"01;50;33;05","01;50;34;06","Is it"
"01;50;34;22","01;50;35;08","what I'm thinking?"
"01;50;35;08","01;50;38;08","Implementation, or maybe this doesget into teleology like"
"01;50;38;11","01;50;41;15","it shows you more at Empiricalwhat's actually happened."
"01;50;41;15","01;50;43;27","So like, like always this is an example."
"01;50;43;27","01;50;48;06","As the accountant said to us once, italways stuck in my mind is"
"01;50;48;07","01;50;50;26","you know, I've said this before, what is"
"01;50;52;02","01;50;54;10","an organization doing? What's they about?"
"01;50;54;11","01;50;55;21","He said, Don't tell me your mission."
"01;50;55;21","01;50;57;23","Don'ttell me your vision. Show me a budget"
"01;50;58;15","01;51;01;10","show me what you're doingor show me where you spend your time."
"01;51;02;02","01;51;04;08","So in a way, it's like that."
"01;51;04;08","01;51;06;26","What's the empirical as well as the"
"01;51;07;21","01;51;09;08","the goes to the general to show me?"
"01;51;09;08","01;51;15;21","Well, that's that gives an idea then ofsomething that can be done as opposed to"
"01;51;16;26","01;51;17;26","words or"
"01;51;17;26","01;51;21;03","even a mathematical wordscan be like a mathematical formula"
"01;51;21;23","01;51;23;25","and many ways to help"
"01;51;24;18","01;51;26;29","tell people what you want them to think,but maybe not."
"01;51;26;29","01;51;28;04","What is going on."
"01;51;28;04","01;51;30;21","So anyway, I like those three arrowthings very useful."
"01;51;32;16","01;51;35;24","Any final commentsin the last one minute?"
"01;51;36;12","01;51;39;08","Dean and then Blue."
"01;51;39;08","01;51;41;28","If you're a real quickly,I think that a lot of times conferences"
"01;51;41;28","01;51;44;09","people go and they want to talk aboutwhat they know."
"01;51;44;23","01;51;48;25","But I think that this exampletoday was an example of where you come in"
"01;51;49;04","01;51;51;20","not necessarily knowing but discovering."
"01;51;52;06","01;51;54;27","I think it's another fine exampleof what we're talking about"
"01;51;54;27","01;51;57;06","when we're talkingabout active inference."
"01;51;57;28","01;52;01;19","If I can, if I got StephenMann and Connor in the same room,"
"01;52;02;08","01;52;04;26","the place that I would want to begin iswhat don't you know?"
"01;52;05;05","01;52;09;05","How would you guys attack thisfrom not your strength,"
"01;52;09;19","01;52;12;00","preferences, probabilities and fit,"
"01;52;12;11","01;52;16;20","but from what you what you don't knowbut is still in the room"
"01;52;17;18","01;52;19;21","and I think that's very complementaryto the"
"01;52;19;21","01;52;23;26","to the more traditional conference wayof disseminating information."
"01;52;23;29","01;52;25;05","There's my word for today."
"01;52;26;14","01;52;29;01","And then even socially at the conference,people connect"
"01;52;29;01","01;52;33;02","with the people who they do know,and that's the little click network."
"01;52;33;11","01;52;36;03","Instead of connectingwith people who we don't know"
"01;52;36;13","01;52;40;27","and so it also ties tohopefully some of our values, too."
"01;52;41;07","01;52;44;08","So blue. Any last thoughts?"
"01;52;44;08","01;52;47;26","Just I'm just thoughtof complexity science"
"01;52;47;26","01;52;52;18","and the interdisciplinarityand the real value that goes into co"
"01;52;52;22","01;52;56;07","learningor working outside of your comfort zone"
"01;52;56;07","01;52;58;29","because reallythat's where where the growth happens."
"01;52;59;12","01;53;02;20","So I like those ideas a lot."
"01;53;02;20","01;53;05;07","Yep. Working with people, you know,"
"01;53;05;07","01;53;09;22","can have amazing pragmatic utilityand it must be balanced"
"01;53;09;22","01;53;13;08","with the epistemic and with expandingour horizons and perspectives as well."
"01;53;13;08","01;53;15;13","So yeah, totally agreed."
"01;53;15;13","01;53;16;07","Well,"
"01;53;16;29","01;53;18;25","another fun one."
"01;53;18;25","01;53;22;20","Can't say we prepared too much,but I think in the end it went just fine."
"01;53;23;07","01;53;27;04","So thank you all for joiningand for participating and,"
"01;53;27;06","01;53;30;05","and for participating and,and for participating and,"
"01;53;30;08","01;53;33;02","and for participating and,and for participating and,"
"01;53;33;04","01;53;36;03","and for participating andand for participating and"
"01;53;36;06","01;53;39;02","and for participating andand for participating and"
"01;53;39;04","01;53;42;24","and for participating and and forparticipating and and for purchasing."
