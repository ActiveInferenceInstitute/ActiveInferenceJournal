"Unknown","00;00;12;28","00;00;41;01","All right. Hello, everyone. Welcome to act in Livestream number 37.2. It's February 9th. 2022. Welcome to the Active Inference Lab. We are a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at the links here on this slide. This is a recorded and an archived live stream, so please provide us with feedback."
"Unknown","00;00;41;08","00;01;06;25","So that we can improve our work. All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and will be following good video etiquette for live streams. Feel free to officially raise your physical hand if you'd like or use any of our emoji affordances check out active inference dot org to get updates on what the lab is up to and also get more information on how to participate."
"Unknown","00;01;07;02","00;01;36;20","Or check out this code link if you'd like to see our past and upcoming streams we're here today in stream number 37.2. It's our third stream after the dot zero background video and the dot one group discussion we had on the paper. Free Energy A User's Guide by Man Pane and kickoff from 2021 and today we have a few things written."
"Unknown","00;01;36;20","00;02;03;09","There's a couple sections of the paper that we didn't get to last time, and I'm sure everyone has brought some interesting thoughts. And of course, if you're watching live, please feel free to add any questions or comments into the live chat because we'll definitely have time to address anything there. We'll start with an introduction and warm up so we'll say hi, mention anything that we're excited to talk about today."
"Unknown","00;02;03;23","00;02;32;09","Something that we liked or remembered or reviewed about the paper this past week, anything that we're wondering about. And as we just mentioned before we began, like what does a dot to for a guide look like? So I'm Daniel I'm a researcher in California, and I'm going to think while others are speaking and then return to what the data can be and I'll pass it to Steven."
"Unknown","00;02;33;04","00;03;02;11","Hmm. Hello, I'm Steven. I'm in Toronto. Steven so I, I'm doing a practice based page de around Social Topographies and how they can be used in community development and specific development. And yeah, I'm looking forward to looking at some of the implication of how this might be rolled out in different types of context. I'll pass this over I'm Dean."
"Unknown","00;03;02;11","00;03;34;09","I'm in British Columbia at the moment. And as with all things guide related, I'm always interested in how we translate from the word to the deed, getting it, getting from a place of of information that's curated to actions that are also maybe curated based on that bit of information. And I'll pass it to blue so that's my mute button."
"Unknown","00;03;34;24","00;04;06;11","I'm blue. I'm a research assistant or researcher consultant in New Mexico, transported back to my grad school days. I had like a mute button, lost the time warp all at the same time. I'm excited to get into the sections of the paper that we didn't really discuss, like in particular, like using mathematics to validate empirical claims or justify empirical claims and also kind of zooming out and evaluating this work from that perspective of a guide."
"Unknown","00;04;07;02","00;04;36;18","And like I think about The Hitchhiker's Guide and like, Don't Panic and what are the things that we really need? What are the essential components of the FIP and act of inference that that we need to communicate to others? And I'll pass it back to Daniel, who's going to tell us what a document really is well, what it really has been is the far side of the bathtub the dot zero."
"Unknown","00;04;36;18","00;05;12;11","We're kind of dropping in to the skating rink. And then in the dark one there's an opening and we explore and last week was an awesome discussion. We got to speak with the first author and now we continue. But also recollect some of the threads that we opened and build inertia towards where we take it next. And I think there's almost no genre more appropriate for a dot to than the guidebook like you put down in Dean's car manual metaphor."
"Unknown","00;05;12;11","00;05;49;10","Like you don't hold that up and you drive it. And so papers similarly, they engage our regime of attention transiently. You're not supposed to only be looking at the paper. So we're going to put this paper down. We're going to end this video eventually, and then what will be left with us? How will our generative model have been updated so that our policy selections are different, whether they're mental action policies related to attention or metacognition, or whether they're physical action policies?"
"Unknown","00;05;49;28","00;06;48;05","So I guess it relates to that quintessential DOT two question of moving from the word of the paper that we're engaging in in our discussions to the deeds and what are those deeds. And then it's almost like this is an action oriented framing of a dot two or of just what we're up to today. And then there's this asynchronous or not temporally binding elements of which is raised by the paper though, of what are the essential components of FFP and active, and also the differentiation perhaps between the conceptual and the pedagogical like are the pieces that are the minimal kernel of an active is that where we are?"
"Unknown","00;06;48;09","00;07;29;13","Is that page one on the guide? How does education, which is going to be the trajectory of a learner relate to the theoretical apparatus, which is kind of like a building or some sort of structure that doesn't necessarily have a trajectory like format so maybe just to return to this question of the word in the deed in the dot one, we heard about what the target audience was from the author's perspective for this paper which was it's a special issue."
"Unknown","00;07;30;07","00;08;06;06","It's a topical collection called the Free Energy Principle From Biology to Cognition. And we heard a little bit about how the editor made a request of the authors to write this special piece, and they also summarized it in their last aim. We aim to increase philosophical understanding of active inference so that it may be more readily evaluated so within the philosophical domain so that it can be evaluated."
"Unknown","00;08;06;26","00;08;55;23","But what other domains or ideas are important here, then what are these actions so philosophers might be interested in reading this so that they can better philosophically evaluate, but what are the idea to deed pipelines that we're interested in or opening up here? Stephen and then anyone else one of the aspects that this this paper talks about is how much things can be screened off, how much it gives us latitude to separate out realistic empirical interpretations from the modeling of and I think that's the feature they also talk about."
"Unknown","00;08;56;04","00;09;32;02","And I'd be interested in what others think about this, but they talk about the mark of blank. Is this opportunity to screen or screen out what's inside an outside? And I wonder how this idea of screening because screens are not the same as a wall it's not it's not rolling off. But as come up on the Twitter conversation with Casper has this week this idea of leakage like if I have a screen, I've got a blind date, as I described earlier, and there's some leakage through the blind."
"Unknown","00;09;32;07","00;10;02;17","Right. But is even that idea of screening off? I'm a little bit passive. I'm curious about that a little bit. That yeah. If there weren't statistical dependencies between internal and external states, like if there were two states that were just not even there was no path from here to there, there wouldn't even be able to be blanket states partitioned out."
"Unknown","00;10;04;11","00;10;32;25","So internal and external states are conditionally independent upon the blanket states using the narrow Perl 1988 sense of markup, blanket but there is a channel, there is a path from the internal to the external stage again, otherwise they wouldn't even be part of the same click in that part of the Bayesian graph and then also yes Stephen. Yeah."
"Unknown","00;10;32;25","00;11;05;00","So that this, this, this, this click this question of how much we need to find purchase through that blanket and the screening off and how much we can get away with more broadly thinking about the free energy principle in inference and how that can be stepped up and down depending on where we are in terms of empiricism and trying to make claims seems to feature a lot in this paper."
"Unknown","00;11;05;28","00;12;01;18","And I'm, I'm, I'm sensing that because the they're sort of arguing in a way that as long as you can get functional functional correlations then how you get them to be the approximate isn't necessarily about it being the real world. That gives you the maybe different ways to arrive at something that's approximately useful. And I think that speaks to dynamical systems over traditional systems in the sense that I can have a system which isn't the real system, but it might system flips or the regime shifts in similar ways to the target as opposed to actually being in and and having the right types of values in it."
"Unknown","00;12;02;02","00;12;42;21","In itself, it's more about what's the what's the way that I start to see my uncertainty flit from one belief to another. If the if the way that belief updating happens is still approximately useful enough for something to happen that's viable, then that is still okay. And I'm wondering if that is impossible. The normal systems work, which isn't dynamical systems work let's look at the order and kind of trace the trails of the authors."
"Unknown","00;12;42;21","00;13;14;23","So in the early example, we had just the case of perceptual inference, which was first introduced in the exact base context. Then we moved into the Variational Base Conference and we had two world states unobserved. That's the actual temperature in the room X observed data. That's the reading on the thermometer. So this is the simplest Bayesian latent or hidden state model."
"Unknown","00;13;15;15","00;13;47;14","So is there a marker blanket here asking for a friend no, because there's only two notes, so there cannot be a partitioning between internal and external states condition, not a third note. There's sort of it's kind of like the minimum two, but now we're taking two like minimum three. You can't have a blanket, an intervening or an intermediating or a state which makes two others conditionally independent."
"Unknown","00;13;49;00","00;14;20;07","Unless you have three three's a crowd throws a party now in FIG. three, there's the basic model of action. So we still have the same definitions and meanings of W unobserved world states and ex observations. Those observations are now being passed to the agent, and indeed they were implicitly being passed to the agent above. If there would have been a third node agent there, it could have been said that the X was a markup blanket."
"Unknown","00;14;20;07","00;14;58;00","But as it's exactly written there isn't. Now here, what are the blanketing states X and Z? If you are conditioning upon X and Z, it makes W and the agents conditionally independent. And this is sort of presaging the first in partition on the marquee blanket, which is to split up the notion of the total set of intermediating or conditionally independent ising states."
"Unknown","00;14;59;04","00;15;31;17","No Markov to Perl epoch and showing them in a way that's partitioned into incoming from the agents perspective, statistical dependencies which can be interpreted as sensory states or the observation of model data and then outgoing statistical dependencies, z, z, action you select. And then those can have some influence on world states. Yes. Steven. No, you say outgoing statistical dependencies."
"Unknown","00;15;31;17","00;16;01;19","And that's also interesting because at some point the outgoing cannot be statistical alone. Because you don't have the same kind of information availability. So it tends to be more using energy and sort of least action type approaches. So that would be so preemption that but that's where it starts to split out later. But they they don't get bogged down in that at this stage."
"Unknown","00;16;01;25","00;16;06;19","They they keep it all in the sort of Bayesian environment."
"Unknown","00;16;09;03","00;16;52;28","I'm not exactly sure what you mean, since these arrows represent not mechanistic or causal influence, but just statistical dependencies in the graph. Yeah, I was thinking more when that becomes action, when it's then translated to be action. So then rather than sensory, which has much more sort of informational content, action can be seen as being more about what is more energy efficient or starts to look at what the shape of the way that action happens."
"Unknown","00;16;54;04","00;17;36;18","So far. The and I'm wondering whether that is needed to be concerned about if it were a software agent then these are both informational, really. And no matter what type of agent we're modeling or it still is just physical dependance. OK, then you brought up questions about energy expenditure during action and that's one of the pieces that is sometimes challenging to parse out, which is like first looking at variational free energy minimization."
"Unknown","00;17;37;06","00;18;08;13","So this is on the perceptual side. We're looking at the instantaneous fitting of a variational model of ongoing sensory information. Given the priors, that doesn't mean that for, for example, an organism, it's the lowest energy possible interpretation of the sensory data. And then when we bring action into the picture and look at expected free energy, neither does this mean that the Z that is selected is the laziest."
"Unknown","00;18;09;19","00;18;37;11","It just means that this G is being minimized and so it's not the gives free energy or the calories that are being minimized. It's something information all that has to do with model fitting and yes. Go for it. Yeah. No, that certainly makes sense. And and one thing culprits and mentioned in the symposium we did is this this kind of two boundaries."
"Unknown","00;18;37;18","00;19;06;26","There is kind of two boundaries happening in terms of Markov and boundaries is one coming in and this one going out and the blank it's kind of got both of those boundaries happening. So like you said yeah it's the way that then the inference happens to know what actions to take is different. But the way that information is established is for sure different going through each of those."
"Unknown","00;19;07;04","00;19;30;21","I mean, as it is with every mode of sensory data that comes in because it could be vision, it could be here and it could be kinesthetic. So you've got different types of input and you've got different types of output with that. And this diagram model is keeping both of those. There's no idea of leakage or or those questions about how things lead to cross between."
"Unknown","00;19;31;02","00;19;44;08","It's like there's two distinct flows going on, but that and it simplifies in that sense yes."
"Unknown","00;19;47;04","00;20;19;24","We've seen other typologies of perception, cognition in action, like an edge connecting sense and action states or an arrow that's having a statistical dependency the other way. OK, but just to return here, Justine, go for it. So this is a question for everybody here. So Steven, the first author, talked about the fact that sort of the back story of this whole guide thing was to and I'm putting words into it, but I want to keep it reasonably short."
"Unknown","00;20;19;24","00;20;45;25","I talk too much. Last week, he basically wanted to be able to remove some of the impediments. And he pointed directly at some of the math that acted as a maybe a kind of a a bridge too far and so he wanted to make that a simpler maybe something that's more user friendly and therefore something that people will take up or adopt."
"Unknown","00;20;46;09","00;21;10;14","And when you're putting on this and putting up this slide here now, Daniel, I don't know whether I know what eventually will be translated into the math Formalisms you just pointed up a minute ago but I'm not really sure whether the evaluation aspect that philosophers are going to then decide whether something is worthy of their their continued attention or not."
"Unknown","00;21;10;23","00;21;35;25","I'm not sure of that. I don't know how does this critical path critical and evaluation being related in this context, how does this minimize or reduce the impediment nature of what the math is like if we're going to we're going to guide somebody through this and there and there, one of their hopes is to be able to say, OK, well, I'm not just making this stuff up."
"Unknown","00;21;35;25","00;22;04;03","There's actually some some way of being able to formalize this. How does that through this kind of first step, become become easier, I guess, in terms of what the actual formula says? Because I know that when I first actually touched on the formulas myself, it didn't go back to a critical path. Like there was no real physical example I could find in the world."
"Unknown","00;22;04;12","00;22;28;00","And I think maybe that's what helped me understand that maybe this this thinking or this ability to think statistically, sorry, to think statistically, maybe that requires, as Karl also said, our ability to do the math, we have to be able to do the math. And the math doesn't get simple. So I'm wondering what people think about that."
"Unknown","00;22;30;10","00;23;02;19","OK, Stephen, if you have a direct response. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think that in some ways this goes back to a little bit before where the math it helps us see why the math was put in at certain points by going to even a stage earlier. So I think there is some use in that because I think like you say, there is a slight inflation in the way that the process theory then gets interpreted as and if it's already locked in too much in what's given to us with all the math stuff, well, where did that math come from?"
"Unknown","00;23;02;19","00;23;28;11","And and then that starts to get us involved in some of these earlier questions. Because what's interesting here is see the blanket, I think of a blanket often as as a method for transfer. It's a mode of transport just a bit like light lithographic blankets, transfer from an analog roller to a blanket, roll it to a printed image."
"Unknown","00;23;28;19","00;24;26;16","And so the paper is transferring. Now, it also does mean that there's no direct contact between paper and paper and print in play, right? So it's screened off as well, but it depends which way it's going to, you know, and in this case here with these red circles, it's useful to think about, OK, well, there's there's something that's been inferred word in the world but that inference isn't directly accessible is it's not that observed data isn't coming in as data is coming in is what's inferred to be about what's out there which isn't the same as a signal."
"Unknown","00;24;27;03","00;24;57;13","So it's like how much is the agent able to have the environment, transfer something onto them and transfer something onto the environment? And how much are they screened off from the environment? How much is the environment screened off from them? I suppose that's that's something that relates to that hey, thanks. So, Dean, just how does the. Yes, John, go for it first?"
"Unknown","00;24;58;16","00;25;23;09","No, go ahead and then I'll just follow up both you and Stephen. OK, so you asked how does the critical path, the linear pedagogical path that is traced by this version of this guide reduce the actual perceived impediments in an audience specific or in a general sense? So it definitely helps us see where math could or should or does or will enter the picture."
"Unknown","00;25;24;04","00;26;04;08","I think it sets up in about ness of the math, like what is perception about this is a graphical interpretation, graphical meaning visual, but also like a network pacing graph and so if you're concerned with a different connectedness of terms, this is not the math you're looking for, but on the perception side, if this is kind of how you're setting up the template for what you're wondering about, like what's out there, that's what this first image shows with W an X what's out there and how do I act or how does an agent act?"
"Unknown","00;26;04;21","00;26;27;14","That's the about this, which is not unique to active of inference. That's control theory, cybernetics, et cetera, the step wise guide elements. It reminds me, I hope it's not unrelated in high school cross-country. The coach would say something like, well, the race is going to start and you got to get out there faster. Then it's the middle is the part where you need to be running, going hard."
"Unknown","00;26;27;14","00;27;12;11","And at the end you got to push it and finish and run hard and everything. And I was like, you could have just said run the whole time. Was it not the same thing as saying run at the beginning, middle and end and so but run really hard during the whole race? I don't know, Coach. A whole race is a long time to run here by breaking it into really specific stepwise changes to the math, like a piece wise to find function there's an opportunity to pace and lead a learner and then to accumulate or pause for divergence or prediction error that they're experiencing."
"Unknown","00;27;13;01","00;27;47;16","Like maybe before this first train stop someone has a question about that, or maybe just graphically when action enters the picture, somebody has a question about that. Now, we could be talking about equations symbolic equations that describe the W to X relationship or the agent to Z to W relationship. And then this paper is going to propose just one symbolic expression or several symbolic expressions that today we call active inference approach to addressing that question."
"Unknown","00;27;47;16","00;28;15;16","But it builds up the about this in a stepwise way, that even though it is conceptually no different than just saying here's the action perception loop and the equations, which is pretty much what every paper does. But by starting somewhere a lot more atomic it allows the stepwise addition of the math in a way that's incremental rather than like here's the apparatus and that leaves much of it implied Dean."
"Unknown","00;28;16;18","00;29;07;06","Yeah, and I wouldn't disagree with anything you're saying there because I but I do think that there's a not too subtle difference between stepwise and then the kind of step function, the leaving of the critical path and now seeing a, seeing a set of mathematical formalisms around a statistical distribution. And I'm just wondering how that transition occurs, because it doesn't seem like there's a natural round from follow ing, something clockwise or counterclockwise to being able to change things into alpha alphanumeric ratios, which is essentially what the statistic when when it's written out statistically what that does right the sum and the and the and the ratio."
"Unknown","00;29;07;13","00;29;54;29","So if if if the impediment was some of the non frequent math and I'm not I'm not critiquing in any way what Stephen's written out here in his guide but it seems like there's still some assumption on the author's part authors plural part that you will be able to take enough from this critical path representation to see what it looks like when you're overfitting like I like that there was a lot of explanation of what overfitting is and then there was plunk and here's the formula that, that, that, that, that, that overfitting looks like in mathematical form."
"Unknown","00;29;55;05","00;30;32;18","So it's kind of a big assumption that the person who is reading this is going to be able to make that leap go from this level of walking clockwise or counterclockwise to now suddenly being able to understand what all of those different symbols in that formula means and not saying it can't be done. But I'm just wondering how, how, as people who are trying to layout something in a kind of step step progression, how they assume that they can just sort of put holes in that big wall and people still don't have a fear of heights right?"
"Unknown","00;30;32;18","00;30;58;06","Like it's still it's still better than not having a ladder. But but it doesn't mean I want to go up 40 feet without safety. Right. Just because it's there. And I kind of see that in terms of how the transition works between this kind of this this this form of representation and then what the representation looks like in the math, that's a big leap, I think, for a lot of people."
"Unknown","00;31;00;12","00;31;01;07","Thanks, Steven."
"Unknown","00;31;03;18","00;31;48;12","And one, I suppose one danger that's always present when naming things is they then move into this with with the predictive process in discussion, you know, how much can you name things as being data in these contexts? So it becomes statistical. But like you say, the there is effectively information coming in. But data in some ways may be a bit of a tricky word to use because data kind of implies an inherent representational nature."
"Unknown","00;31;48;12","00;32;17;22","And they talk about this in the paper, a little bit, and that tension between something that is coherent enough and can be represented and something where you can't ever quite get it, that the inference, the predictive processing has to then leverage something like generative models using the body, et cetera, to even get the that that that that that to allow that arrow to be something in a much more fuzzy way."
"Unknown","00;32;17;29","00;32;25;22","You know, and so there is always that risk of leading people astray even at this early stage."
"Unknown","00;32;29;22","00;33;01;12","So a few comments there, Gene, you asked like, how do we get from this graphical layout? So we've taken the first byte, which is this is roughly the correct topology for thinking about problems of perceptual inference. And action inference. That is, if someone re imagines this amazing, but this is just the approach to perception, cognition and action and impact."
"Unknown","00;33;01;28","00;33;39;14","That is a common kernel of a phrasing. Now, let's just think about it as an example rather than just the abstraction. Let's just say that we're interested in listening to a cat and then inferring what its location is. So we're only talking about this simpler W and X connection first. So here's what the empirical data are for two, one and three, you could have a model of decision making on it just says the cat is always in the kitchen."
"Unknown","00;33;40;08","00;34;03;21","Just I don't care. I'm OK with being wrong. The cat's in the kitchen. Or some could say the cat's always in the bedroom. Or I flip a coin or I go with what some other person told me. Like, there's many ways to make a decision about world states conditioned on data. One principled approach which they right here, one famous method for solving this problem."
"Unknown","00;34;04;00","00;34;41;09","Bayesian conditional position so that's the question which is framed normatively here about one. What one ought to do is integrate their beliefs which can be empirically grounded. That's parametric empirical based upon incoming data. So first, in this case, the next little tiny step is we can use Bayes theorem to look at inference on external states given incoming data again, if someone disagrees with using a Bayesian approach, an exact Bayesian approach, that's the time to speak their piece."
"Unknown","00;34;43;01","00;35;32;00","This is a very simple example with a kind of a minimum two by two matrix. If it was any thinner of a model on any dimension like if there was only a kitchen, then the question of location inference would be trivial. It's in the kitchen. If there was only one sound equally, it would be a trivial problem because the sound would then be uninformative from an information theory perspective, which they're not bringing up here yet about location then the next tiny step, an ending, is to go from the exact Bayesian approach, the parametric Bayesian approach to variational conference, which is imagine that this was not just two by two table, but there was a higher"
"Unknown","00;35;32;00","00;36;05;05","dimensional state space of observations. And so it's not going to be possible to just look at this in a spreadsheet or on a piece of paper, but it's actually a large model. And so we need tractable heuristics. And so that is the next tiny step from now. We're going to take not just a principled approach to treating the to X relationship, Bayesian perceptual inference, but we're going to go beyond that and ask what's a track table and reasonable approximation variation inference."
"Unknown","00;36;05;25","00;36;32;09","There's other situations where maybe there's another tractable approach like EMC EMC Markov chain Monte Carlo. That's another approach which we've talked about. In other cases. That's the pointillism sampling based approach. It works really well for certain problems. It doesn't work as well for other problems. And so that's the next little tiny step. We're going to go from this setup of perception to using Bayes Theorem you could do otherwise."
"Unknown","00;36;32;19","00;37;00;29","And then from using exact or parametric empirical Bayes to using Variational Bayesian approaches, and again, you could do otherwise, and that's do yeah. And again, all I, all I think I'm pointing out is that I for some it is a tiny little step, but I don't think it's a ramp going from one version of representation to four square version of representation to formulaic version of representation."
"Unknown","00;37;00;29","00;37;41;10","I think for people who see the math maybe as an impediment to their further continuation of using the the potential of the to the three energy principle, maybe they aren't such small steps. They certainly aren't ramps in terms of how we interpret each of those three particular ways of representing information. There's no ramp. There's actual an actual transition moving from from what you've got on the screen now to the 6040, 50, 50 way of being able to interpret that way of representing the information to the one that has an equal sign."
"Unknown","00;37;43;09","00;38;06;13","They're very, very different. Right. I mean, I understand the relativity piece and all that and I see that carrying throughout this is relatively relativity looks like this way and then this way and then this way. But I think, I think the struggle for people who are putting guides together is the assumption that what's little for you is little for me."
"Unknown","00;38;06;24","00;38;30;24","It isn't always that way. And I'm not I don't know if we can fix in that here in these labs, but I don't think it's something that we should assume is necessarily once one small step for humankind, because I think the reason why the authors were asked to put two years worth of work in this and in the first place was because the math is acting as an impediment."
"Unknown","00;38;31;10","00;39;05;26","Now, do you start with the math? Because I agreed with Steven last week when he said this is the direction we took. We decided to slow things down, not simplify, but slow things down. So I really appreciate why they've done what they've done. But if they knew going in that they were going to have to go slow, then they're probably going to see whether or not that bump as we change representations is actually relatable to the previous version or form that the relationship was was presented us."
"Unknown","00;39;06;13","00;40;01;11","And I don't know that people necessarily do like blue. Blue is going to have has 60 on this too. But she mentioned the arbitrariness of something that doesn't update right and so it doesn't retain its form. And should we just assume that we all saw the the morphology in the same way. It's, it's tricky. I'm just going to leave it at tricky because I'm not sure anybody that's putting a guide together necessarily has the the, the perfect way of being able deliver it OK thanks blue and then you so something that I think is interesting is that mathematical interpretations have like philosophical underpinnings almost or maybe it's the other way around."
"Unknown","00;40;01;20","00;40;27;05","So when you're looking at like for example, this difference between a probability distribution and a preference distribution, like if the cat is in the kitchen, 75% of the time, you can just assume there's like the underlying assumption that it prefers to be in the kitchen most of the time. Right. Like so because that's where the food is or whatever."
"Unknown","00;40;27;15","00;40;50;15","So and similarly, like in homeostasis, if I'm at 37 degrees Celsius that's my temperature. If I'm there 95% of the time, you can assume that I have a preference to have a body temperature of 37 degrees Celsius. I think that there's that underlying connection. But, but it gets really complicated when we try to extrapolate to something like cognition."
"Unknown","00;40;51;02","00;41;09;09","There's like, I prefer to be rich, I prefer to have 90% of the money in the world, for example, like you can say like I want all the money, like you think about something like that. But then there are so many complicated like, like, do I really want all the money? No, because then everyone else would be homeless and impoverished would be horrible."
"Unknown","00;41;09;09","00;41;28;01","Right. And so you don't really want all the money. Like there's and then if I say if I prefer to be rich, but I'm stuck in an impoverished situation, you can assume that there's like a learning gap between how do I earn money and being in the space where I don't have any money, I don't know how to have money."
"Unknown","00;41;28;01","00;41;45;11","Like there's a knowledge level. So when you when you bring cognition into it and like, you ask people like what their preferences are like, I prefer to live by the beach. But I live in New Mexico. I mean, we have lots of beach, but no water. So there's like, you know, there's there's I don't know, there's the preferences and then the probability."
"Unknown","00;41;45;11","00;42;05;16","But but is there some kind of like cognitive dissonance like you think? We think what our preferences are or maybe not where our probability distributions are. Like, I prefer to be by the beach, but 90% of the time I prefer to be by the ocean. But some of the time you find me in the desert, that there's like there's some cognitive dissonance going on there."
"Unknown","00;42;05;28","00;42;38;17","And so I think that the mathematical interpretations have a lot of philosophical implications that maybe, you know, we need to think about more like when is a preference distribution and a probability difference distributions different and why are they different? Like what is going on when the preferences are not the probabilities thanks. Blue. Yes. This will take us soon to the tale of three piece."
"Unknown","00;42;38;17","00;43;13;23","Steven, first yeah, very good points there. When you said ten, you there about the exact base on the world it goes into that so goes into the variational base, which in some ways is it starts to hit the mark blind blanket start to give time steps as it starts to go through into the generative model. You then go and as was useful for now and again the symposium with Carl Kristen we talked about you know the starting point often practice in person is the generative model."
"Unknown","00;43;14;00","00;43;38;11","How do you get at the generative model? So the general view is that in some ways this exact base is almost needed in the modeling sense to give you what we think we know the world is when we're setting up our model or experiment of people doing something, where are we going to see what the results are? So it's like the agent can't know what w is."
"Unknown","00;43;38;11","00;44;14;17","They can't know what the exact base is that like with the cat experiment. So you can matrix there and we could arbitrary put one in that we kind of can say we know as objective observers is going through goes the agent and then the agent does something OK and and as you said sometimes that that what they do isn't only in response to what's coming in in which is quite often not it's not just can I I've seen food can I eat food as much food as possible."
"Unknown","00;44;14;17","00;44;40;17","This is well what's the consequence of my actions going forward? Maybe a lot of times we then start to get into this higher dimensional stuff where the circle that you put in there going into w there's that red circle on the left which sort of goes into the W is what is really a concern you know, the humanities around what's, what's that about."
"Unknown","00;44;41;00","00;45;11;24","Right. And a lot normally the generative model work is done in active inference is is the circle on the right hand side eye? How do we predict the way beliefs are being updated and what's the way the beliefs because it's normally coming in that direction because you can sort of control you can do an exact basis. The one place you could theoretically set you experiment with an exact basis w it's kind of hard to put exact based on an agent unless of course it's a robot potentially."
"Unknown","00;45;13;16","00;45;49;28","So I think there's something quite interesting there about it how much is this and it it's a practical instrumental. So. All right, how much is this about the way that modeling happens and how much and the math to make that happen and the philosophies and how much then is this broader? And it may be that it gets recapitulated, depends on which parts we simplify or allow to be more complex or want to get a purchase so on out of those circles."
"Unknown","00;45;49;28","00;46;25;13","So maybe you just explain why you put the circles where you put them just to see if I'm getting your your rationale. But I think that was kind of useful to put them in. I'm just highlighting the direct oddness of these statistical dependance this circle of action policy influencing unobserved states. We've seen it in the partially observable Markov decision process as where that's b w changing through time is B."
"Unknown","00;46;26;06","00;47;04;02","That's how hidden states change over time. State one state at a time, one state at time to then Z influences here in this simple only four nodes. So if you only get four nodes, you draw the dependency that way. Like my action to change the thermostat in the future will change the temperature when we can unpack it a little bit more and move it from this sort of minimal cybernetics or control framing into some of the little bit more built up models we've looked at."
"Unknown","00;47;04;12","00;47;36;04","That is where policy selection influences be. And so, yes, there's enormous concern over how our actions influence things that we can't directly observe, say, for by proxy information in coming back to us. And that is not a unique problem to active inference. Dean, you think I'm going to circle back to what Blue is saying, because I think she's hit on something really critical."
"Unknown","00;47;36;23","00;48;02;28","Um, the weirdness of this, I think is what I won't say was the, was the thing that Karl started on when he took his First Nations steps into trying to put something that we can, we can hold on to, something that we can look at philosophically and mathematically I don't know if he was thinking about when this at that point when he started down that path."
"Unknown","00;48;03;01","00;48;51;02","But I think the more we talk about it, the more we we realize that as a for example, in a guide use, I think a person who reads Stephen and the other authors work have two questions. The first one is my use of time, the number of minutes I have to commit to reading the guide before I can then say whether or not certain impediments have been removed while at the same time and this is what I think active inference does, it also allows us to invert that first accounting of what we are doing with our time, invert it from use of time to time of use like."
"Unknown","00;48;51;18","00;49;15;08","So if I do commit to reading this guide what's the shelf life of that like? How long am I going to be able to take the my takeaways and actually be able to apply them to different concepts and then there's a fleshing it out part, which I think Stephen's kind of talking to, which is so when we take all of this information and we embody it what does that feel like?"
"Unknown","00;49;15;17","00;49;46;27","What does that what does that read out in terms of our behaviors, et cetera? Reactions are responses. So I think ultimately, if we're looking at the wellness of this, we have to start talking about heuristics. And Stephen specifically spoke about that. He said, I wasn't I think I'm paraphrasing him, but I think he said we were concerned about whether starting with simple doesn't also have a cost we know that it has a benefit because it doesn't overwhelm people."
"Unknown","00;49;47;15","00;50;09;06","But if if if we are going to look at simple rules like heuristics, does that also have a cost no, he didn't answer that. I was just rewatching the 37 one before we came on today. But I think that's something here the blue is now touched on and I think Stephen is touching on as well. If we're going to put a guide together, when did when did the rules fall out?"
"Unknown","00;50;09;24","00;50;35;21","Do we assume that they fall out just by picking the guide up, or do they are they something that that the reader or the user manufactures after having the experience that when this I think is what this act of inference stuff is touching on and and, and it's in some cases it feels pretty arbitrary. It's hard to tell the win of the heuristic."
"Unknown","00;50;35;21","00;51;03;10","Do I start with the rule as my prior my priority or am I really trying to update and I'm trying to come up with something that really applies at some point in the future that I haven't arrived at yet. And I know that sounds kind of not answering anything, but even even with the statistics, it's hard to figure out what each agent is going to do depending upon what their biases."
"Unknown","00;51;03;23","00;51;36;09","So they want to start with the rule or they want to develop one as they go along and as the bacillus accelerates in 34 Axios bacterium showed exact Bayes doesn't mean you get it exactly right. It means you're following a process. And with maladaptive tive priors, even accurate information coming in can result in a maladaptive decision making. So this is not panglossian or Pollyannish just because there's an approach doesn't mean that it succeeds."
"Unknown","00;51;37;01","00;52;11;13","Perfect, right? Yeah. So Steven then blew you know, so two points that sort of speak to that. Well, I'll say the second one first, because it was in mind is when we when we see the modeling, we often see say we talk about the bacillus. So we see the way that modeling happens. High order agents such as humans tend to find that the the w is fixed is like the, the cat is either purring or it's, it's meowing, it's in the kitchen."
"Unknown","00;52;11;26","00;52;44;16","It's, it's an exact oh it's in the bedroom. Right. So it's, it's a, it's a kind of defined exact Bayes kind of context and then that allows the, the other parts to kind of still find some very interesting and tractable useful trends. Right? So as it goes through now when it goes, then the other way is, OK, how do you get into something which is an exact phase and you tend to see it turning to the swarm of voxels there."
"Unknown","00;52;44;16","00;53;17;15","So, you know, Lorenzo Attractors or Bacillus. So very, very very simple, a gentle scenarios with very little degrees of freedom because it's in a way trying to address that challenge of, well, you know what, if you don't know if it's in the kitchen or the bedroom, it's in the doorway and it's it's wandering around and the time the time in between gets in sensory information."
"Unknown","00;53;18;19","00;54;04;04","And my the action is, you know, isn't in step there's a lot more bleed out, you know, and and that becomes this kind of how much is the temporal I saw this word from from Casper has leakage because there's a leakage out of that sensory input sensory I don't want to use the word input but the statistical dependencies coming in and the statistical dependencies going out there's a there's a leakage going on which makes the model even kind of challenging, though at some point it becomes OK, well, it's overwhelming that the we might philosophically say somehow we were able to do something like that."
"Unknown","00;54;04;04","00;54;32;11","And and our biology has enabled us to overcome that challenge. But to actually put it into a model like the one on the right top right there starts to become. And in a way, maybe that's where effect comes in as maybe OK, that that may be also true. For us. That's why we need something that affects the hold together, this sort of fuzzy kind of knowing which can't be resolved in that such a solid way."
"Unknown","00;54;32;11","00;55;07;01","So that's the first piece. The second piece very quickly is you put know these the red circle that you put next to the X. So in some ways is that that is what's what it's sort of inferring w what we're really doing is we're inferring we're either inferring the circle there that comes in to the X or maybe and that's assuming the arrow that's going into the agent is, is what's coming out of X or is coming from X."
"Unknown","00;55;07;17","00;55;34;06","So that's in a way the edge, isn't it? That's the kind of boundary that's being the beliefs. When you say B, the B is about that, not strictly about W there's a belief distribution on W and X W is latent modeled on observed states and X is modeled empirical observed states right."
"Unknown","00;55;36;21","00;56;11;25","OK, blue so just to kind of riff off of what both of you guys were saying, maybe this is tangential, but but when you talked about leakage, Steven, it reminds me of like the information partitioning that we discussed with Majid and how there kind of always has to be some kind of leakage if you have a complete information partitioning, you're actually like in a in a vacuum or a bubble like you're existing, there has to be some kind of leakage across the partition all the time."
"Unknown","00;56;12;29","00;56;31;04","Like and I've I've come to realize this like we have to be sharing information with people that are, you know, how do we form a markup like at how do the four of us come together and form this live stream today? Right. Like we're sharing information even though there's a markup blanket that exists between us. And for some of us, it's thicker and thinner."
"Unknown","00;56;31;11","00;56;53;09","Like Daniel and I will be often like doing the same thing at the same time, like, even like separately just because we work together so much. But there's this leakage, is there? And then it also made me think about the maladaptive behavior that Daniel was mentioning. And so when you have this, like, we always wonder what is the cause of this maladaptive behavior?"
"Unknown","00;56;53;09","00;57;14;26","And this is something that we were discussing maybe a couple weeks ago with Jason, you know, what is the explanation for maladaptive behavior? And it always makes me think about the scale, like in the situations that are utilitarian like, you know, maybe someone sacrifices themself for you know, they jump in front of a train to stop the train, to save the 300 people that are on the train."
"Unknown","00;57;15;03","00;57;42;22","And so there's this maladaptive decisions do occur, but perhaps it's not like a societal scale or, you know, like in a body you know, one piece will die off to save another piece. Like even in the brain, like the formation of like the little scar. I think of that like it's like essentially like an it puts a hole in your brain, but it's to protect the rest of the brain from the cell death that's happening in that in that spider hole."
"Unknown","00;57;43;10","00;58;20;17","And so, you know, it's there is this information leakage and and even maladaptive behavior that I think are scale dependent scale friendly slew dean. And then we'll move to another section, call yeah. I don't know if we're at an inflection point with this, but I do want to bring this up again. I think that the leakage speaks to another metaphor that I brought up way too many times last week, which is I mentioned in the point zero, which I think there is a filtering piece to this."
"Unknown","00;58;21;07","00;58;47;24","I mean, this morning I put the raspberries in the sieve and I assumed the raspberries would stay and the water would pass through. And there were parts that I didn't need, like I wasn't trying to make raspberry water. I just wanted to eat the raspberries. And I think that if we understand that there's to a minimum of two aspects to when we're talking about active inference, I think we do ourselves favor and I think we do ourselves a favor for writing guidebooks about active inference and free energy."
"Unknown","00;58;48;09","00;59;12;05","So I think I think the guidebook for the guidebook, if there was if there were, if were there are some pillars that we could put a guidebook on here would be my suggestions. First of all, there is going to be because we have a markup blanket, we have a separation. That differentiation and that integration are going to be inherent in however, we observe something and then respond to it."
"Unknown","00;59;12;17","00;59;42;05","Second thing that I would suggest is there's a certain blind spot removal piece to this. And I mean that in the in the context of, say, something like change blindness because of over attending or understanding. And we talked about overfitting or failing to explain that change blindness is now becoming a greater awareness availability because we don't necessarily have to lock in prematurely or wait too long."
"Unknown","00;59;42;12","01;00;04;28","There's kind of a sweet spot that active inference is, is trying to say exists not perfect, but it's better than not having a sweet spot. Third thing I would say is if we're ignoring the foraging aspect of this, if we expect that the framework is going to be another frozen meal, then you're going to get the quality of a frozen meal."
"Unknown","01;00;05;12","01;00;34;05","If you're willing to forge around the perimeter of the store, you're going to come away with a whole different experience it's more time consuming, but in the end, it's like learning to fish. It's a whole different way of trying to process those uncertainties. Right? So I think at the end of the day, what pops out or when when we decide that we can actually say somebody is using active inference, whereas before they weren't."
"Unknown","01;00;35;14","01;01;08;27","I think what they do is they come up with a new sense of what rules which are being updated, which are being modified, which are being iterated, and sometimes even being extrapolated. So we have to really focus on what that means under particular circumstances as we move from place to place. So again, I'm not sure maybe that's maybe that's not being fair to the people who wrote a 60 page guide for philosophers."
"Unknown","01;01;09;07","01;01;36;20","But I think if we're going to look at the foundational things, they're going to be able to tell whether or not we're actually doing and using active inference. I would think that at minimum those four things are going to be present, starting with the filtering thing, because again, if it's not a minimum of two, I think we over reduce we put a frame around it, but we don't actually know what's actually a gradient descent and dynamically stable within that."
"Unknown","01;01;37;10","01;02;10;22","So just something to think about. If we're going to write guides they seem OK. Stephen, specifically on that and then we'll go on. Yeah, just referring to this idea of screens and it comes back to the idea of screening all fulfilled wrong or I think that the X and the Z here is a question. We often in this particular context, the I talk a lot about screening it off and it seems to be that whereas in other contexts say actual constants work."
"Unknown","01;02;11;05","01;02;40;08","So like it's trying to extract as much as possible from the informational potential in an environment. I think that's important, isn't it? That is this is a very different I've I've worked I actually used to work as a print broker, so I had to fire up these big presses and it takes one a thousand copies to get the magazine actually started to print properly like the rollers and the blanket has to get tough."
"Unknown","01;02;40;08","01;03;00;16","And everything we got with this waits. Eventually you get, you get something that looks good and now it's running. So you got a thousand wasted copies. Basically, you're trying to extract as much as possible from the top prints, print heads, prints it in the right is I'm a big press. Now, in that case, then you're trying to get as much information basically across into the paper."
"Unknown","01;03;01;03","01;03;21;17","Now, there's other cases that you can imagine where it's I don't know, someone's taken a video in and there's bright lights going on in this. You know, you're trying to filter out, I would say copyright light. You know, you're looking at the sun. You got to filter out to see anything. In that case is still trying to get the sensory data, really still trying to work on the action policies."
"Unknown","01;03;22;06","01;03;51;23","But both X and Z in a traditional blanket is a dead thing, you know, but how much is X and Z you know, and how much is that a living kind of process at certain times that is moving. I mean, you could say it's doing a bit of everything, but how much is it trying to just to screen out noise and bringing and how much is it trying to extract, you know, from Shannon entropy and stuff like that."
"Unknown","01;03;51;23","01;04;19;09","So, you know, I thought I'd mentioned that. Yeah. Makes me think of like being on the phone with somebody and it's like you're both trying to pull as much information out of that limited channel and put as much into a limited channel. So let's go on to just a victory links between or among dialectical categories. So we'll do some slide play."
"Unknown","01;04;20;01","01;05;08;09","We have three types of claims. Dave, I hope I'm using the word appropriately that there are domains of claims, mathematical red, empirical blue, general green, OK, so no commitments, but can somebody just like give a specific concise example of where we see one of these cross category statements? It can be in any direction among the three. Where's a case where somebody uses a mathematical the first part of their sentence is mathematical."
"Unknown","01;05;08;22","01;05;30;16","And then the second part is empirical. Or vice versa. Where's the situation where the first part of someone's sentence is mathematical and the second part is general. So I'm sure that many have been said even today, but let's try to get a few really specific examples so that people can just learn to identify these kinds of sentences. And then we'll be evaluating what they mean."
"Unknown","01;05;30;21","01;06;03;03","So blue, go for it. So nothing that's been mentioned today. But you know, the the P value of point five you know, demonstrates that that whatever my claim is in my experiment is significant. So that's something that's all the time you see the statistic all, you know, justifying the empirical and less. So I think it's we're coming away from the significance of the P value in scientific literature, but you see that a lot."
"Unknown","01;06;03;26","01;06;30;20","So where would we put that kind of where would we put statistics? What domains does statistics jump among? So statistics to me is math like statistics is the sentence. That's the field that produces mathematics. And empirical clear conflict though when you make the sentence my p value of 4.5 P less than point of five demonstrates that whatever my claim is, my empirical claim is significant."
"Unknown","01;06;30;20","01;06;54;21","So for me, statistics is that friction between math and empirical claims. Awesome. Yes, totally agreed. We looked at these two categories of ants and we saw this one doing it six times. This one did it two times. We did some math on the numbers six and two. You can't do math on ants. You do math on the numbers, six and two."
"Unknown","01;06;55;16","01;07;55;08","And from that mathematical claim we're going to say something about those two categories of ants. So yes, mathematics going to empirical is a lot like statistics OK, what about empirical going back to mathematics? What is a specific natural language expression where somebody begins where the warrant of the rhetoric is empirically driven, meaning based upon observation. And then the consequence of the argument is mathematical how about because the organism is maintaining body temperature, homeostasis is empirical."
"Unknown","01;07;56;17","01;08;40;09","It is the case that it is doing predictive processing or active inference so here it's now there's so many ways to even enter here. But this would be like from results that's the hallmark of starting in Empirical is you're starting with something that is almost either trivial or just simply a fact or observation about the world. So from results to what some sort of statement about."
"Unknown","01;08;41;04","01;09;09;07","Now, what's interesting about the way that the authors did it here is they have no or none of the three cases have mathematics in the second position. And that's kind of like the xkcd comic where mathematics is like, Oh, I'm way over here, I can't hear you. The fields arranged by purity mean because mathematics is almost framed as like internally coherent."
"Unknown","01;09;09;22","01;09;40;06","And then information comes out of mathematics but because it's theoretical or abstract, there is an internal logic in mathematics called proof. And then there's very little need to have something enter mathematics, which is why it's a we'll see as we start to flesh out this shape. Stephen Yeah. As you're doing that, I'm curious, what do you think about something like gambling?"
"Unknown","01;09;40;06","01;10;17;29","So someone is betting on horses? Is this statistics of the horse gambling? And then there's their motivation for gambling. So in terms of the empirical, you can say, OK, the behavior is fairly consistent certainly over the type of gambler horse race. The math can be established. But then there's I don't know whether it goes into the general well, what's people's motivation for the teleology if I maybe I'm jumping the gun there, but am I on the right lines there in terms of how would you put that into this scenario?"
"Unknown","01;10;18;29","01;11;01;27","Can you restate it with an antecedent and a post student, just a specific rhetorical nucleus OK, so this is because X then Y oh, because because there is a group of people at a horse racing track and because we know that these horses have performed in a certain way over previous races, we can predict the probability that the horse will win or be sold to people to win as being x."
"Unknown","01;11;02;11","01;11;35;04","The motivation for people to make that inference about and the behavioral choices is may be more general, but since yes, we'll get to the general edge because it's very connected to math. OK, Dean, I was just going to say, I like the word results there, but I, I think what, what it's implied is that there were a certain number of observations taken that then moved the formalism to something specific."
"Unknown","01;11;35;23","01;12;00;27","Is that am I just confirming something or am I putting more in there that needs to needs to be I had a really similar question. So when you're talking about going from empirical to math, to me, like you brought up that the idea of like a probability density or like a non equilibrium steady state and like that's immediately what came to my mind."
"Unknown","01;12;01;07","01;12;34;06","So if that's echoes what Dean just said. Yeah. Does let's get at the distinction between general claims and mathematical claims. So math is sometimes seen as general and when ideas are framed mathematically, indeed, there's a lot of overlap, but the authors do separate it out. It's in section 4.2.2. So what would be like an example of going from a mathematical to a general?"
"Unknown","01;12;34;06","01;13;06;28","Because math then general or because general claim, then mathematics well, you could, you can, you can talk about the rate of the rate of the rate of acceleration due to gravity and then then make the general claim that that if I, if I go from, from this height to this height, I I can I can expect to hit the ground at a certain rate of speed or something."
"Unknown","01;13;06;28","01;13;46;07","I would imagine OK, great. I'm going to also pull out just two examples from the paper. From the paper. So here we go. So we're in 4.2.2. So there can be two examples given. So again, we're looking here at math going to general, and then we'll see if we can run it back. So how can mathematical claims justify general claims Ramstad at all 2018 assert the FP is a mathematical formulation that explains from first principles the characteristics of biological systems that are able to resist decay and persist over time."
"Unknown","01;13;46;28","01;14;23;24","The first part of the sentence mathematical second part general it rests on the idea that all biological systems instantiate a hierarchy a hierarchical generative model of the world that implicitly minimizes its entropy by minimizing free energy. I almost see the reflection in that sentence that because of the hierarchical generative model, which is a general claim though a formal one, then there is a mathematical implication."
"Unknown","01;14;24;25","01;14;51;19","So maybe we can put this Ramstad 2018 here. OK, and then here's the second or a second example that the authors raise in the paper actual constants contribution to this topical collection uses a mathematical claim to make a general claim on the basis of a numerical example he argues against the claim that minimizing free energy entails life. Rather, he believes the converse is true."
"Unknown","01;14;51;28","01;15;35;10","Life entails minimizing free energy we read and loved that paper and that's very much related to the quote. Like One ugly fact destroys a beautiful theory or something like that. Now is an example mathematical or empirical, but not if it were just on the basis of a family of equations. He argues against the general claim but then again, isn't even the family of an equations an empirical observation from the domain of math?"
"Unknown","01;15;35;22","01;16;03;27","But we'll put it in the section that they had it. So in these cases we're using specific math examples and that was sort of the provocation of 34 and Axel's paper, which was like I did a math example. So it's kind of resting on both the empirical and the mathematical. I did a math example and now I'm going to make a claim about a general topic, which is the relationship between free energy minimization and life."
"Unknown","01;16;04;27","01;16;43;03","So that is certainly moving in this direction, whereas so because math can be abstracted and generalized, there's often similarity here because math rests upon specific examples, even if the examples are some examples are more general than other examples. It still can be said that they're empirical, not exactly in the way that cat location measurement is, but still it is the case that math produces results."
"Unknown","01;16;43;03","01;16;54;08","There could be a result section in a math paper what about this third edge? What's the relationship between general and empirical? And let's leave math out of it."
"Unknown","01;16;57;13","01;17;31;18","Blue so this is something like I I think about like what Dean was saying because the acceleration due to gravity is -9.8 meters per second squared when I drop the sample, it will fall to the ground. Like that goes maybe empirical to general when I when I dropped the apple because when I drop the apple, it falls to the ground."
"Unknown","01;17;32;14","01;17;36;19","Comma, gravity exists in the whole universe."
"Unknown","01;17;40;02","01;17;53;20","That was quite a jump. Well, because apples fell in, not down that's flat earth because apples fell in. Gravity is everywhere."
"Unknown","01;17;56;24","01;18;53;12","OK, that's one example. So then I was thinking of like a sort of ants evolution example. So the general to empirical would be like because of the way that evolution by natural selection is ants optimize task efficiency and then the other direction would be like because in my experiment, 30% of the time ants were observed to be doing this selection has been acting on ants so these are very interesting because are there some edges that we rest upon more like what if we could just number of these edges one, two, three, four, or five, six, and then annotate and people could have different perspectives on it, but we could annotate papers in different areas."
"Unknown","01;18;54;02","01;19;55;03","And OK, if you're just doing 111111111, it's like a one note paper from a structural topical perspective under what situations is that preferable? Not preferable. Are there certain edges that are weak? Are there pairs of edges like a chord that we want to play together? Just like the Rams said, it was like sort of forwards and backwards. Law of the jungle, law of the pack, from the mathematics to the general, and then instantly a grammatical reflection from the empirical into the mathematical OK, Stephen, the need so one question first, just ask Empirical could be seen as is that exact Bayes going empirical means observed observed so the exact by if you just take in however"
"Unknown","01;19;55;03","01;20;24;27","you like, the owl actually hasn't been computed beyond observed. OK, so effectively that's true. OK, that's the first thing. And then General in my sense is, is what we might call inflate to the higher dimensional. So we go generally speaking, the models are empirical from observe observations into math into generative model, into some general pattern of action selection."
"Unknown","01;20;25;11","01;21;06;12","However, it could be possible, but generally it's interactive for complex situations to go from general to empirical and then try and get the math out which is kind of what Alex is saying. It's like there's a general principle that empirically plays out that good luck finds in the math to show outside of a bacteria OK, Dean so I find it interesting, Daniel, that you just just keep the conversation sort of alive."
"Unknown","01;21;06;12","01;21;34;17","As you talked about the edges of those three circles and I think I think the task of being able to find examples of those by directionality is again, goes back to that question of so, so what are the rules and how fluid are they? And as we're moving from one node so there's a change, the moving from node to node, we're building that relationship."
"Unknown","01;21;34;29","01;22;08;14","We're building out these rules. Is that is that one of the great byproducts of being able to maneuver and manipulate, not getting stuck with only a sense of unit directionality or oneness? Does this reinforce the idea that if we're going to actually really be able to demonstrate the use of active inference, for example, as an instrument or a tool to be able to gain a greater awareness?"
"Unknown","01;22;08;27","01;22;37;10","Are we really then talking about how we not just find examples of rules, but actually form them because that's what you did. That was the exercise that you just went. You just built a whole bunch of rules. I know I know we've laid them down on the slide as examples, but those relationships now are they're not even bridged right there."
"Unknown","01;22;38;02","01;23;09;29","They've now some got some sort of a a pairing effect so is that was that is that is that it? I'm looking today back to the and then what happens? What I'm looking today for is so we got our way. We guide our way to what is there is there now an awareness, a sense that we didn't have before we went through that that effort then is the thing that kicks out rules or is it just examples?"
"Unknown","01;23;09;29","01;24;06;14","What do you think? I'm asking you, Daniel, because you you did the most of this work. Do you see the rules or do we just see the examples I just think about how in a nested cognitive model, the outcome of one layer is like the inflow of another layer. So even a rule can be a rule in one layer or application, but yet it's also an example of a rule mathematics and general claims tend to be more rule like but again, even rules are examples, whereas empirical, it's always the exception that proves the rule like it's the exception is the observation, which transcends rules, because if it happened, it had to have occurred."
"Unknown","01;24;07;12","01;25;01;29","And so the empirical to me is like examples when you're in this domain and then movements away from the examples in the scientific empirical sense pushes us into the rule world. So here this red line is going to be more example, like and so in that sense, like impure with the caveat again that even rules and generalizations are examples of but in the scientific empirical sense, this is more like an example can you hear, can you hear in your own explanation the sort of just a factory link between example and rule?"
"Unknown","01;25;02;24","01;25;32;06","Do you hear yourself justifying the difference between how we might look at math in general as being different than the empirical? That's all I'm trying to bring out. And and again, it's a not it's not. It's not. It's just nothing to me. I mean, it makes perfect sense, but I think if we're going to find if we're going to find that somebody used a guide and what is the what is the what is the result of that?"
"Unknown","01;25;32;13","01;26;26;26","It's going to be that people have a better sense of what the rules are and what the examples are and what the relationship is between those two things. That would be goodness gracious. I mean, if I'm talking to anybody between the ages of 22 and 62, if we could get their holy mackerel thanks Steve. In terms of, in terms of opening up our understanding of things right now, one thing I think with what you're saying that Dean is which is it does become interested in and that's something that you mentioned when we have multi scale, the actual nature of the rule example actually can shift and it's technology's shift that I think is kind of"
"Unknown","01;26;26;26","01;27;21;21","revolutionary in a way. When we start to think about there's a variation in the nature of what rules are present, you know, so, you know, there's sort of rules around what it means for me to do something in my environment. My cells individually. I can't play that game. I organs can't play that game individually. Right. So this these this there is this this challenge of integrating or maybe this is I do that table as well as saying what's happening what where is something or what temporal and temporal and temporal and spatial scale does it hold?"
"Unknown","01;27;22;18","01;27;53;12","And I think that may be something that's kind of interesting is where so generally speaking, people go to the racetrack and, you know, they behave in certain behaviors at the scale of that they're that that part in society. But they and we have empirical data to support that. However, at the biological level. And it may be something to do with adrenaline rush."
"Unknown","01;27;53;12","01;28;22;16","You could talk about or you could talk about the fact that they just happened to have a nice sandwich bar and someone enjoys getting the food. They don't even like gambling that much, whatever it is, or wearing a funny hat. ASCO so there's this there's something there that cool. How do we I wonder that that multi scale question because I'm very cool with the idea that you've got actual consent taking very, very small."
"Unknown","01;28;22;29","01;29;05;07","You have this incredibly small world being addressed with active environments. And then we have quite sort of you could say gross examples at scale which ends up revealing a large, you know, larger scale but I wonder what you think, Daniel, about what what happens and that reflects what then you I think was saying about nested systems and the sort of informing each other in a way like if I if I think I'm going to win some money on the races and I better get myself sorted, I might sustain my stomach a bit more."
"Unknown","01;29;05;07","01;29;46;13","So I've got a better glucose level to make a good choice. Right. So suddenly there's two different levels coming into play with is different scales. So I don't if that's I don't think that confusing things, but I think it does make the modeling question because an act of inference is ultimately a modeling process which is trying to get at I would say it's trying to either get at the general or to to predict and empirical if I if I'm looking at this diagram, but maybe I'm mistaken there."
"Unknown","01;29;47;22","01;30;17;00","Right. Where is active inference in this? Is this the trace of active inference? Is this the map? But then we play on this territory, what is the adjacent possible? And so we can ask first, where's active inference here and when is it here? And then what next? Dean? Yeah, this is where I think it's it's about it's in the relationships and how we decide to parse those relationships and it seems rather arbitrary."
"Unknown","01;30;17;12","01;30;36;06","And I think it's one of the reasons why we're we can always disagree on when the rules are in effect and when they're not in effect when it's happening up here in Canada, we've got all these rules in place and then people just decide to pull up big trucks to the border and go, no, we don't like your rule right."
"Unknown","01;30;36;06","01;31;04;20","And so now there's being Canadian. Now we have to figure out how we're going to deal with that because we don't have any guns. So I guess we're going to have to disassemble all the trucks or something by hand. But the thing is, is that if you actually look at this act, inference is in the relationship. And I think it's and then and I think to Stephen's point, if we if we think that a rule applies without limits, that's the scale free part of it."
"Unknown","01;31;05;05","01;31;18;23","From a mathematical standpoint, we can we can find cases where that's true, but then there's a very scale friendly part of it which says, I don't this rule doesn't seem to make sense in this specific situation. And that's where Axel came forward."
"Unknown","01;31;20;25","01;31;48;04","He essentially said, I'm sorry, but and so did I'm sorry. The there was another author we had very recently who agreed and said, there's this machine. She'd said, look, there's there's a piece to this that says there's something that's local and proximal and specific. And why are we pretending like that? That fits the same context. To scale free."
"Unknown","01;31;48;04","01;32;16;25","So again, I think I don't see that means that active inference is useless. I think what it means is it can tell us when we can differentiate and when we can integrate. That's relational so one thing this made me think of is that we're reading a paper on free energy, free energy principle, active inference. Look at the road map."
"Unknown","01;32;17;13","01;32;44;16","There's no dialectic within a domain the claims are listed, but it goes immediately to the relationship. So it's like minimum to domains. OK, now it makes me think about the structure of scientific communication. So in the results section of the paper, what so the introduction might have a lot of general and empirical claims selection acts on ants and look at their mandibles."
"Unknown","01;32;44;26","01;33;06;06","And we know this about new construction and look at how they do it. So that is like a very introductory piece. There's not often formalisms in the introduction of the paper. So that sort of Blue Arrow General and empirical is very introductory in its scope. Then the results section of the paper is like Blue mentioned, it's about like empirical and math."
"Unknown","01;33;06;19","01;33;32;14","We saw it do it 11 times, and here's the P value. And then we did this and we calculated the model and so it's like it shouldn't generalize in some senses. And then in the discussion, there's probably all edges in play, but especially math to general, because it's now been generalized beyond the mere empirical, because we saw a P value in the difference between the estimates of this type and that type."
"Unknown","01;33;32;26","01;34;18;26","It does say something about evolution or because there's something happening at an evolutionary time scale, it's consistent or inconsistent with our mathematical summary statistics. Yes, that came from empirical, but that edge is more in play and that in simple, simple terms, that's how and when we fit out the rule and that almost it does return us to the third P, but I think it's so we'll kind of close this section on the two point of four or whatever it was with the links among the dialectical categories, active inference as a transgressive Flynn."
"Unknown","01;34;20;16","01;34;46;03","All of these are often in play, and it's almost like if the paper would have just been lists of empirical observations, there'd be nothing contentious because it wouldn't make any general claims that would just be called a data set. If it were just general claims it would be just philosophy. And that's not to say philosophy is easier or simpler."
"Unknown","01;34;46;03","01;35;19;18","It's like it doesn't trigger anyone's domain crossing alarm, but like mathematical biology that does raise people's alarms or generalized for math. You're saying that because of the free energy minimizing that there's a general imperative for information foraging or relationship between the general and the empirical of course, always fraught in empirical science. OK, you measured in that laboratory study with those undergrads and that stimuli, and you're going to say something about aggression."
"Unknown","01;35;21;01","01;35;59;20","So it's just very interesting because active inference does lay claim or at least they play to all these areas that it raises alarms on all sides. But how do we take that alarm, pheromones and attention and then just align it with something that's going to be a public good rather than just let it fizzle? Stephen That's very helpful."
"Unknown","01;35;59;20","01;36;43;17","And the nature of action and the idea that biology, soon as that comes in, I don't know if you can avoid being in in the general and maybe active vision that's just doing a thousand dimensional interpretation of a data set. You know, can stick with empirical math. You know, it's either recognizing a photo, it's not recognizing the photo, doing some deep the computational processes, but action and particularly then action policy and then take the other G and would you say that would you say this just general claims or is where where would Teleology fits in here?"
"Unknown","01;36;54;03","01;37;28;14","Teleology is never directly measured. Is that fair to say? So it can it can always it can be it can be in green, but it cannot be blue. One can say, I observed sorry blue, but I chose the colors for reason to one could observe the animal trying to swim to the surface. And you can say, well, the teleology is obviously not to drown or something like that, but that's actually structured as because I empirically observed the swimming behavior, I am going to make a claim about the teleology."
"Unknown","01;37;29;06","01;38;11;04","So I would say Teleology is in a general case, even another spin on this one would be empirical is like X. This is the data that we're actually observing. General is unobserved you can't observe things that are general. You're only observing what Blake calls the mind particular W Yeah. What is math math is in the examples that we looked at, it's like the process."
"Unknown","01;38;12;06","01;38;15;22","Oh, wait. Active inference. It's a mathematical process theory."
"Unknown","01;38;17;25","01;38;50;19","So math is a process or of inference that yes. Connects to generalities. And this is not hard and fast, I hope is not being interpreted in the most rigorous way. But it does generalize because it has to be like the intermediating blanket. So let's pull this W and X back in here. All right. So here we have the empirical states here being observed."
"Unknown","01;38;50;23","01;38;57;23","That's our data. OK, then here's the things that we would like to generalize on."
"Unknown","01;39;00;10","01;39;33;28","And then this gets to Dean's question about how do you go from this to equations and here's math as our sort of blanket in the middle that's when we actually do, whether it's variational, uh, base or whether it's exact or whether there's some other mathematical approach, it's how we're going to go from these generalized or hypothesized things that we didn't observe how are we going to connect that domain?"
"Unknown","01;39;34;22","01;40;07;04","And so it's almost like a little boomerang. So there's probably a lot more to explore here to Dean. I just like, I like how this has come together because math, as we said before, well, as I mentioned before, I think when the authors in the author's mind, the motivation moving forward on the paper was math could be a vehicle and it can move the process along because it is a process or it can be an impediment the other thing that's really interesting here is that because it's in the middle, isn't math got a lot of rules in it?"
"Unknown","01;40;07;06","01;40;48;06","I mean, man, right. So again, I don't think I don't think we're contradicting ourselves. I just think we're asking. So again, what do we allow to pass through the sieve and what do we hold back and then what assumptions do we make about the sophistication? What what's the minimum amount of sophistication around the math process that one must have talked to Karl first and said, you must have a you must have a good, grounded sense of what the math is if you're going to go forward like you didn't coach his words, you said, if you want this to become a vehicle and not an impediment, you're going to have to get familiar with the math."
"Unknown","01;40;49;08","01;41;13;22","So and sometimes, oh, the math is not the territory, you know, important contribution in means for sure. If the debate were about whether territories were maps, it would be the silver bullet to simply claim that the math is not the territory, but it's right. And we want the map so that we can take action and be on our road trip or whatever."
"Unknown","01;41;14;08","01;41;52;02","So it's the math is not the territory while it's the conclusion or the second part of the rhetoric for some, especially philosophers who might be interested in what is really out there because the math is not the territory, comma, then what that's like the dot two of active, which is instead of just debating. Well, yeah, well, because of homeostasis, what can you really say about Teleology and because of our status, does that contribute to a new understanding of new construction?"
"Unknown","01;41;52;12","01;41;53;27","They're all important questions."
"Unknown","01;41;56;07","01;42;25;03","But then where do we go when we put the math is not the territory as our antecedent rather than in our conclusion rhetorically. Stephen Yeah. And like when you put here, so first the math. I totally agree. I was thinking that vehicle was thinking it also takes in different. So for instance say I have $1,000,000, it gets picked up, is counted, is picked up in a car, taken somewhere and then it's counts as $1,000,000."
"Unknown","01;42;25;18","01;42;45;24","The bit in between. It's not math, it's just stuff. Right. But in this process theory, it's in a way in the what is the math is a nice evening and it could be an end topic process and it could be math thing. These may be some sort of virtual numbers way or noise way, but the math is the vehicle for the data."
"Unknown","01;42;46;21","01;43;08;10","Right. There is no data. There is no banknote. Right. There is only a process which enables the general to the empirical. And the empirical in this context is it is a model is empirical in a way. What we're saying is we're going to take most of the models that we see. There's a very simple general idea about behavior."
"Unknown","01;43;08;20","01;43;38;08","So Ryan Smith's idea about how the heart behaves, how the gut behaves, something about how access consciousness or access awareness is achieved, some general thing. And then we basically do what we might call the modeled empirical, but you could flip it around the other way and you could have, OK, well, the real world we could have high dimensional empirical upside there."
"Unknown","01;43;39;04","01;44;03;25","What's the general W? What's the general X? Internally, what's the general, which is what we use as our heuristics, you know, which could be kind of interesting as well. Which is may be more in the action because this is coming in on the century. Right. But I think this is quite helpful. Would you say that's true? It's that it's a model empirical."
"Unknown","01;44;03;25","01;44;46;12","What we get on the in terms of how we work with it in the in the active inference I mean, looking back on it, is there anyone who disagrees that empirical is always as modeled like it's kind of funny, like now I want to put a little red guy always intervening on this edge little blue guy, always talking about specific examples of math and generality and then, you know, the generalization is we use that, you know, in equal variance t test."
"Unknown","01;44;47;07","01;45;17;27","So he generalized to connect the empirical and the math. Then I really didn't want to go there here, but I have to like as a way too excited last week when I had a little thought bubble and said, wouldn't it be cool if my f Michael or sorry if Steven Mann and Connor Hines if we could get them in a room and instead of them talking about what they know, get them to go through this process."
"Unknown","01;45;18;11","01;45;40;28","Because that's essentially what we want to do is this we want to have that little guy pop out as opposed to the one who knows so much in a dense way about their math. There's so much in a dense way about their philosophical guide because that's when the that's when the true grasp of what the potential is. And it's not it's not about always having the right answer."
"Unknown","01;45;41;09","01;46;09;28","It's coming up with the best answer in that moment. Right. And if we could get more of those kind of situations, I think people would actually think people actually come away feeling even more confident because that's what this is about. It's about confidence developing. I think one a thought on that is like it's possible to stay purely internal to math, and that's the internal logic of proofs."
"Unknown","01;46;10;20","01;46;26;06","It's also possible to stay internal to general claims and do philosophy is it possible to stay purely within the realm of empiricism?"
"Unknown","01;46;29;03","01;47;10;01","In the trivial case, yes. If you're just aggregating data sets and never interpreting them, yes. But empirical in application must either connect to a general question like, you know, we observed the ants and now we're going to talk about evolution. So it's still qualitative but it's it's an edge. And then it rests on math when it's more statistical and on generalities, when it's more conceptual well, but it's just sort of interesting that the internal logic of empiricism is basically just data integrity, but it's like pre interpretation which is perfect for it being X."
"Unknown","01;47;10;24","01;47;36;12","Yeah. Whereas there's a whole guild structure and discipline around internal mathematics and internal generalizations and philosophy. And so it's like I and I also really agree with that, having them, I thought, you're going to say, just get them in the same room and then just talk about food or music or something like that. No, but I know what you mean."
"Unknown","01;47;36;22","01;48;19;18","Have them and just like we're all learning by doing in this space and to say that this is a lifelong journey, it would just be a total understatement. It's it's broader and deeper than that. So how do we recognize the complexity of this arrangement as well? As the adjacent possible, other ways that it could have been made, other end states that we could have reached, bringing in any number of fourth points to make a tetrahedra any other number of orders of paths that we could have done to reach this point, like if we had started with these little dots and then later added the arrows and how did we start this whole thing with examples"
"Unknown","01;48;19;18","01;49;01;26","of each edge? So getting to the super like fractal multi scale level where and we didn't even add any formalisms or mathematics here, but we could have done some pseudo code or some pseudo equations to really start to link this and to lean more on our mathematical leg. And that's the whole thing that you just said about confidence, which is like this is the space that we're going to be bouncing around and you can ignore statistics and you can just have an emotional response to values and stuff like that, but you will need that as part of the journey we can't just be like the post office vehicles that don't make left turns."
"Unknown","01;49;02;09","01;49;31;23","We have to make all of our tools available at the team level and then trust that with like distributed cognition and with guides and way finders and peer facilitation that like we can make it work despite how vast this area is. So, yes, Stephen, as we go for our final commentary. Yeah, I think you made a good point there with that Green Arrow."
"Unknown","01;49;31;23","01;49;56;24","Just one last thing with the Green Arrow you put there that be more incremental in fermentable and like it becomes more implementable as she comes that direction and away from the math with a mixture of genuine and empirical and just curious. So the arrows. Yeah, the arrows. I mean, again, they're open to interpretation other ways you could have been done."
"Unknown","01;49;57;06","01;50;24;04","I was thinking what links of math and empirical are? They're both more numerical. That's the bottom edge. OK, then, then what? Then what makes math in general similar there less example like and then what is the similarity between empirical and general? So what is not just pointing? What's the arrow that doesn't point to general, but what's the arrow that points between general and empirical?"
"Unknown","01;50;24;23","01;50;53;15","And what distinguishes mathematics from general empirical it might be it's formalism, but general, is it what I'm thinking? Implementation, or maybe this does get into teleology like it shows you more at Empirical what's actually happened. So like, like always this is an example. As the accountant said to us once, it always stuck in my mind is you know, I've said this before, what is an organization doing?"
"Unknown","01;50;53;15","01;51;26;29","What's they about? He said, Don't tell me your mission. Don't tell me your vision. Show me a budget show me what you're doing or show me where you spend your time. So in a way, it's like that. What's the empirical as well as the the goes to the general to show me? Well, that's that gives an idea then of something that can be done as opposed to words or even a mathematical words can be like a mathematical formula and many ways to help tell people what you want them to think, but maybe not."
"Unknown","01;51;26;29","01;51;51;20","What is going on. So anyway, I like those three arrow things very useful. Any final comments in the last one minute? Dean and then Blue. If you're a real quickly, I think that a lot of times conferences people go and they want to talk about what they know. But I think that this example today was an example of where you come in not necessarily knowing but discovering."
"Unknown","01;51;52;06","01;52;23;26","I think it's another fine example of what we're talking about when we're talking about active inference. If I can, if I got Stephen Mann and Connor in the same room, the place that I would want to begin is what don't you know? How would you guys attack this from not your strength, preferences, probabilities and fit, but from what you what you don't know but is still in the room and I think that's very complementary to the to the more traditional conference way of disseminating information."
"Unknown","01;52;23;29","01;52;58;29","There's my word for today and then even socially at the conference, people connect with the people who they do know, and that's the little click network. Instead of connecting with people who we don't know and so it also ties to hopefully some of our values, too. So blue. Any last thoughts? Just I'm just thought of complexity science and the interdisciplinarity and the real value that goes into co learning or working outside of your comfort zone because really that's where where the growth happens."
"Unknown","01;52;59;12","01;53;42;24","So I like those ideas a lot. Yep. Working with people, you know, can have amazing pragmatic utility and it must be balanced with the epistemic and with expanding our horizons and perspectives as well. So yeah, totally agreed. Well, another fun one. Can't say we prepared too much, but I think in the end it went just fine. So thank you all for joining and for participating and, and for participating and, and for participating and, and for participating and, and for participating and, and for participating and and for participating and and for participating and and for participating and and for participating and and for participating and and for purchasing."
