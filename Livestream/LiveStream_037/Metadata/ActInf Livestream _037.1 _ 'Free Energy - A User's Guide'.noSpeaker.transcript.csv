"Unknown","00;00;23;25","00;00;57;24","All right. Hello and welcome to Active Flab Live Stream Number 37.13 Energy A User's Guide. It's February 2nd. 2022 to two 2220 days till the big one. Of course welcome to Active Inference Lab. We are a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference you can find us at links here on this slide this is a recorded in an archived livestream, so please provide us with feedback so we can improve our work."
"Unknown","00;00;58;17","00;01;50;10","All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome and we'll be following good video etiquette for Livestream. Maybe people can raise their hand visually so there's not a little gypsy blip until we figure it out. Or by the way, go to active inference dot org if you want to learn more about participating or check the code link here. OK, today in 37.1, the goal is to learn and discuss and also appreciate having Steven Man the first author here with us this paper Free Energy A User's Guide and for this 37.1 we'll start with an introduction and then we'll just fire up some slides and here perhaps an opening in the contextualizing statement from Steven to be introduced last"
"Unknown","00;01;50;21","00;02;25;20","and then go into whatever questions that everyone else has brought and anyone watching love so I'm Daniel I'm a researcher in California and I will pass on to Steven Hello, Steven. I'm a practice based Ph.D. researcher based in Toronto, and I'll pass it over to Dean Morning, everybody. I'm Dean. I'm up here in Calgary. I'm I'm somebody who just did some programing, went from being an educator to a way finder."
"Unknown","00;02;26;05","00;03;02;27","And I find guides really an interesting topic to have conversations around. I'll pass it down to blue Hi. I'm Blue. I'm a research consultant based out of New Mexico, and I will pass it to the first author, Stephen Hi, everyone. And Stephen, I am a philosophy Ph.D., currently a postdoc at the in the linguistics department at the University of Surrey and a guest at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, where I live all right."
"Unknown","00;03;03;20","00;03;27;01","Maybe, Stephen, would you or Stephen M, would you like to just give a little context on the paper? Like how did this fit into your PhD or research interests? How did this specific collaboration come to be in the format of the paper and the way it is so first, thanks for having me and thanks very much for the last week session with Zero."
"Unknown","00;03;27;01","00;04;18;27","I think you did a really excellent job at Overview and I'm really looking forward to talking about it today. This paper came about because we, myself and Ross and Michael, the other authors had been in discussions with a few of authors around a symposium discussing adaptive inference and the free energy principle and also predictive processing at the Australian Society for Philosophy and Psychology Conference in 2018 we put together a small symposium it went relatively well, and after a few more months of sort of then pursing ideas back and forth we approached Michael Weisberg, the editor of Biology and philosophy, about putting together a topical collection, sort of like a special issue, but sort of collected"
"Unknown","00;04;18;27","00;04;53;28","digitally and eventually sort of after sort of pitching it to him and managing to get to talk to him in person, he said that he and the other editors were quite excited, but what they wanted was an introduction from us that would explain the mathematics and the philosophical dialectics behind sort of at the core of active inference and the free energy principle in a way that was accessible for philosophers and so we said, Sure, we can do that."
"Unknown","00;04;54;07","00;05;31;20","And that was a little while ago. We started soliciting other papers. We've now published most of the papers in that topical collection, and since then at the same time sort of finalizing, finishing off my Ph.D. and then moving to Europe from Australia with my Ph.D. was we were getting to grips with the real mathematical core of active inference and trying to figure out what was the necessary mathematics to explain the basics of the framework and then how to present that mathematics to a philosopher legal audience who has sort of some mathematical competence."
"Unknown","00;05;32;12","00;06;10;23","And the result is the current preprint. So we think we're probably about one more set of provisions away from submitted for publication, and it will eventually come out as the introduction to that topical collection. So what I'm really interested in hearing from everyone else today the same thing, we're interested preparing for the wider community, which is the reason we released the preprint, which is just comments and suggestions and any kind of corrections that can help improve the paper so that its final form is sort of even better as good as we can make it OK, thanks for the awesome context."
"Unknown","00;06;10;23","00;06;36;23","Steven s. Thank you. Yeah, we really enjoy in this paper and one thing will be interesting to, to think about, even though you sort of I think maybe a philosophy audience is some of the aspects of it this nascent kind of foundational level could help in an applied context that may be beyond the modeling so we're kind of interested in some of that."
"Unknown","00;06;36;23","00;07;07;28","So that might be something we might tap into, even if it's not in the remit of this paper's direct publication. I think it would be really helpful in the broader sort of journey of using active influence in the world awesome. OK, Blue or Dean, would you like to start with a question? Or we can return to one of the points that we're already kind of brought up I'm good for now."
"Unknown","00;07;09;14","00;07;40;18","OK, so maybe just one starting point was just what backgrounds like how did you go from thinking about who you wanted to make the paper accessible to, to writing in a certain way? And then you mentioned it was for philosophers. So what is the impact in this community that you'd like to how would you like to update their generative models nicely put."
"Unknown","00;07;42;28","00;08;31;06","First and foremost, we would like to fix in their mind the relationship between variational inference and Bayesian inference. So I know that's something you've talked about before. It's something that predates the free energy principle and active inference as an explanatory framework for cognitive science and biology. And it's something which, as far as I can tell, is sort of the first step in understanding what's going on with that mathematics so that's the sort of the key thing we want philosophers to sort of have in their minds also because almost all philosophers, especially philosophers, have cognitive science but but also philosophers of biology will be familiar with Bayesian inference, at least to some extent."
"Unknown","00;08;31;22","00;09;04;08","So by pointing out that what active inference is, is something sort of a step to the right of Bayesian, something that they can start to understand by analogy with that, we hope it will stop them from sort of getting scared of all the complicated mathematics that you can read in order papers so that's on the math side. On the philosophy side, a lot of the stuff in section four of the paper was our attempt to really strip back a lot of the claims that were being made, but also sort of categorize the claims being made."
"Unknown","00;09;04;24","00;09;31;14","One thing that I noticed in reading the literature and attempting to understand it was that different kinds of claims were being conflated and that was jumping around from claims in different domains, mathematical claims that suddenly leverage to justify an empirical claim and then suddenly move to an extremely general claim about all of cognitive science or all of biology in general."
"Unknown","00;09;32;00","00;10;01;16","So that's the second thing we want the philosophers to get that it is possible to disentangle these claims despite the fact that they are habitually sort of conflated or not made distinct enough in the rest of the literature All right. One follow up and then I see Stephen and Dean, you mentioned that Bayesian inference, maybe more familiar, especially because it's used in all kinds of modern statistical descriptive approaches as well as generative."
"Unknown","00;10;02;04","00;10;39;12","Just to hear it in your own words, where do you think variation or inference is more familiar? So who does it represent? Who's more familiar with variational methods or who would be familiar? And then what are the key differences sure. So my understanding is that physicists, statisticians and machine learning practitioners may well have come across variation inference. Certainly will have had a much better chance of having come across variation inference than philosophers, at least as of 20, 22."
"Unknown","00;10;40;27","00;11;30;08","What I understand variation inference to be is a certain kind of technique for choosing a probability distribution over unobserved states that started in physics, as I understand it, with Feynman, although I put a little footnote in the pre-print pointing out that I haven't been able to translate the stuff in that Feynman book to the latest stuff, especially stuff that David Mackay talks about in his textbook on information theory, which includes some issues in variation inference, but as I understand it started in physics, then was adopted into sort of statistics more broadly as a means of approximating Bayesian inference in cases where exact Bayesian inference is too difficult to carry out, too computationally difficult, and then"
"Unknown","00;11;30;08","00;12;06;05","moved from statistics into machine learning where it's possible to actually build machine learning algorithms or systems that can perform variation inference. And then from there and then in the active inference framework, all right. Thank you. So, Dean, first Steven, thanks for joining us. Really appreciate it. Is a question for you now that now that an examination of the situation and situation, as you stated, was kind of math and philosophy."
"Unknown","00;12;07;09","00;12;39;01","Now I've got a relationship and we're going to open up a guidebook or a primer when the when the pump is primed. What do you see as being the effect of that that relationship between the sort of philosophical audience and the and the math that was used to get us to this place the relationship between the philosophical audience and the math that was used to get us to this place."
"Unknown","00;12;39;01","00;13;01;20","I mean, first and foremost, I want the philosophical audience to gain a certain kind of facility with the math. I think one of you I'm not sure who of you was that in the point zero put it extremely well by saying it's like learning how the horse moves in chess. I think it might have been Daniel, but I don't want to miss attribute it to you."
"Unknown","00;13;02;08","00;13;27;00","Giving the philosophical audience the basic understanding of the most basic math will give them that first kind of tool, which they can then go on if they so wish to build up and learn more of the moves, learn more of the complex math if they want to, then go on and interrogate the rest of that literature, which is more complex we've tried to sort of forego too much critical analysis in the paper."
"Unknown","00;13;27;00","00;14;04;16","There is some in there. We've tried to forego that a little bit just in order to get the understanding of that math across. OK, again, follow up there. What does it matter for the philosophers? So what are they in your sense or their sense? What will, knowing the difference between Bayesian and Variational, help them evaluate or what will seeing it structured this way help them evaluate I think there's a few."
"Unknown","00;14;04;16","00;14;36;09","So I hope other people also can think of philosophical questions that knowing the difference between the two would help you change your mind on yeah. I mean, the simple answer is just it will help them understand what forest them is claiming. And by forest, then of course, I'm using him as just an umbrella for anybody who's writing positively in the active interest tradition, attempting to demonstrate that the active inference framework can provide or inform certain process theories that explain cognitive or biological systems."
"Unknown","00;14;37;18","00;14;48;02","Philosophers need to know the difference between Bayesian inference or variational inference because they need to know what it is that Frishman is claiming can be attributed to systems like this."
"Unknown","00;14;53;22","00;15;20;26","OK, blue on that so I have a question and like maybe I missed it and I was looking, I just said like a click control on a paper just to make sure that I didn't miss it. And I'm not misinterpreting. But in your explanation of the generative model, like I just wonder why you didn't choose to go into the recognition model."
"Unknown","00;15;20;26","00;15;52;22","And I think that why you discuss at length like PS and Qs why did you leave that out or do you think it's not significant or did I miss it and did you talk about it so by the recognition model, I understand that to be a sort of alternative way of doing inference that an agent could employ. So I'm just I'm saying what I understand by so you can correct me before I try to answer the question, I understand it to be."
"Unknown","00;15;52;29","00;16;21;04","Yeah. And an alternative to generative inference is just to employ a kind of recognition model which simply takes in data and immediately produces some kind of statistical result from that data. It doesn't need to simulate or generate its own data and then compare that to what it sees. That would be the generative way. Instead, it just applies some kind of, say, mathematical statistical function to the data and then gets a kind of result which describes what it hasn't observed."
"Unknown","00;16;21;04","00;17;02;12","Is that what you mean by recognition model so no, I'm referring to the paper, the tale of two densities, the 2019 paper by grams to that out. And in that paper they, they refer to the recognition model as the Q right the inverse of the likelihood model. It's the mapping from the consequences to the hidden causes. And so like you got really into the math but and discuss the, the generative model but just didn't it's like acknowledge that the recognition model, I just was curious."
"Unknown","00;17;03;04","00;17;35;14","So OK, so you just mean the, the distribution. Q By, by the recognition model I mean using a different. Q I haven't read a tale of two densities, I should say so. Yeah. And the recognition model is on the, it's in the kind of namespace of expectation maximization modeling. The recognition model is like the sensory update and then the generative part was like emphasized."
"Unknown","00;17;35;14","00;18;11;13","I hope that's not to simplify to what two densities were. And then the outbound was more like associated with the generativity and that's also that's why it's important to go from the Frequentist to the Bayesian at all, because with Bayesian generative modeling like the model can be run both ways, though it's used with different adjectives, that's like Variational Auto Encoder, that's all these methods where it's not just descriptive modeling on a data set like principle component analysis or multiple regression."
"Unknown","00;18;11;22","00;18;55;22","It doesn't just describe that it can be used, although those can be used or be thought of as Bayesian like maybe used in a shattered of way as well. But that's the part that people will have less empirical experience seeing. But let's think about this and then return to it next week. Yeah, OK, so Steven s just following on from the Bayesian, which is often used in the embodied context, people think about embodying multi-sensory integration and that type of work, and that field is a bit challenged by moving over to this variational machine learning paradigm because it's highly mathematical."
"Unknown","00;18;56;01","00;20;02;02","But what's interesting with active inference is sort of comes back into that being grounded in embodied action because that gives the preferences somewhere to be anchored. So how do you see an this going back into embodied cognition as a way for those preferences to be grounded that's a difficult one for me to answer, in part because I'm not really part of the tradition that emphasizes embodied and inactive approaches to cognition the way I was taught it, they were sort of alternatives to the representation list tradition, and I was much more in the representation list tradition so there has been some talk of whether and how free energy approaches support one or the other of those"
"Unknown","00;20;02;02","00;20;02;29","two traditions."
"Unknown","00;20;05;02","00;20;34;22","And to some extent, because I'm already sympathetic to the representation of tradition, I'm already leaning towards the idea that free energy approach will support that as opposed to an embodied or inactive kind of approach, which is sort of a shame because like all of those kinds of binaries, it's probably somewhat a false dichotomy and it just means that, you know, my direct my attention has been directed elsewhere than your attention in looking at these issues."
"Unknown","00;20;36;09","00;21;08;01","And so, yeah, I don't have enough of value to add, unfortunately, think it yes, Steven was saying, but our previous paper, 36 was like a taxonomy of prospec tives on the representation question. And so I think we're all very primed to just take it totally open stance and is, is every possible stance for every person to focus on."
"Unknown","00;21;08;16","00;21;34;20","It's just kind of not within our time and attention capacity so I think it just speaks to like a diverse field where of course people are focusing on chemistry of this element, of that element. It won't be exactly that split, but in the broadening field of like active inference in FFP, there's going to be people who are focused more on one question rather so that's kind of cool."
"Unknown","00;21;34;26","00;22;00;13","So like no where we have similar regimes of attention or not. Stephen Yeah, I'm agreeing with Daniel. And also actually we found this really, really helpful from an embodied perspective because the way that you separated or you gave the probabilities and preferences of working together was it was kind of like a deflated or a more nascent form of representation."
"Unknown","00;22;00;22","00;22;37;21","And that jives quite nicely with potential ways that an active approaches are also potentially there because of the nature of preferences. So you start to have a way where they can both live together because they know we were talking about this the other day, weren't we, Daniel, that that wasn't so clear how these two can live together. And often when people who are from philosopher quote the free energy principle, they talk about early papers like 2000, you know, maybe ten years ago even and that is often then a false argument gets painted."
"Unknown","00;22;37;21","00;22;59;20","So now we've almost got a new paper which can kind of help ground those philosophers. So I wonder what your thought is in terms of whether you are trying to help people use the most latest form of free energy principle. When they were talking about philosophy and to stop some of the conflation of just people criticizing models which are now out of date."
"Unknown","00;23;00;07","00;23;39;14","Um, if that was part of your rationale for the way this paper was created, yeah, we absolutely wanted to direct people's attention to what we thought of as the real issues. In a way, the appropriate issues. I mean we reckon that the critical assessment that is not well informed by the actual workings of the theory is not going to be helpful because you might accidentally hit on a critique that works, but only accidentally if you're going to criticize the framework, you better at least understand what's going on."
"Unknown","00;23;41;03","00;23;58;07","My worry is that it will become out of date as things change, but there's not a lot you can do about that. I mean, it took us quite a long time to get this first draft together to get this pre-print together. And I'm sort of hoping that things haven't changed so much that it's out of date by the time it comes out."
"Unknown","00;23;59;02","00;24;36;03","I mean, one way to post all that is to just be as basic as possible so that you're really capturing the core that can't possibly change but otherwise your best chance is just to publish what you've got to the particular time and keep your eye on how things change and update as you go. Thanks, Justin. Steven, if I use a lot of metaphors, so if you walked into a singles bar and one of the singles was a philosopher and the other single was a mathematician, and you had to guess now going through the process of building that guy right?"
"Unknown","00;24;36;05","00;24;57;17","Like you're not Match.com, but. Right. You have to make a guess as to whether that long term relationship, they walk out hand in hand or they're completely repulsed by one another. I know it always depends, but you're talking about updating the guide. I'm kind of want to go back one previous step. What keeps them together? What pulls them apart?"
"Unknown","00;25;02;12","00;25;25;17","Yeah. So how do you write what is essentially a philosophy paper but include mathematics in a way that does justice to both is roughly how I'm hearing that question. Well, the long term relationship, right? Like they still get to have some compatibility and that fidelity. Right? And so it's point was up to now, it's been I don't know if I even want to go to the bar."
"Unknown","00;25;26;02","00;25;54;25","So that's that's what I'm asking, you know, based on what you've what you've journeyed into. Right. Because not everybody I know I appreciate the idea of the guidebook because not everybody goes into situations freely, right? Sometimes you get dropped into situations and it's a little bit more intense. But what causes people to go really into that kind of relationship and sustain it over a long enough period that it does make sense?"
"Unknown","00;25;55;20","00;26;08;04","Does it remain kind of a superficial thing or just a concept, but it actually becomes realized? It was curious what your thoughts on that are mm."
"Unknown","00;26;11;16","00;26;35;28","I think that you know, trying hard not to repeat myself too much. The way the way I try to think about the question is to try and think about what has prevented philosophers from really accessing the mathematical parts of active inference so far. And that's just from sort of communicating with philosophers and talking to them and hearing that dissatisfaction with it."
"Unknown","00;26;36;12","00;27;13;26","And it was always just that there was, there was too much of it too fast. And so the sort of the only approach we could see that could remedy that was to go as slow as possible in a way. And so spend sort of have a much heavier ratio ratio of words to equations in a way, and go into much much more depth in explaining each equation as it comes along rather than throwing all in at once and then decomposing it."
"Unknown","00;27;14;12","00;27;38;26","Right. I mean, we one of the earlier versions of the draft, we started with the main equations and then decomposed them in the current draft that you read, we start with the components and then build up to the main equation. That was a little bit risky, I thought, because I was worried that people would feel we were holding the main event back for too long, but so far it seems to be working, I'll say."
"Unknown","00;27;39;02","00;28;01;24","I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on that approach. What whether you think that meshes together well enough. Yeah, no, that's one of the things and and again, I don't think mathematicians are trying to be pushy, but if you don't have that context, it can feel pushy. And so how long you're willing to leave something open before you drop dropped?"
"Unknown","00;28;01;24","00;28;25;11","The big questions is sometimes easier for somebody then to size the situation up and contextualize it. So in this in this delivery, I don't know, previous versions right. But in this delivery, in that respect, I actually think it makes it less intimidating. But that's just my that's my personal opinion. Sorry, Steven. I know you wanted to say something severe."
"Unknown","00;28;26;01","00;28;50;18","Steven is. Oh, yeah. Just carried on from what Dean was saying as well is you you looked at the inference model almost prior to having a mark of blanket, you know, and I thought that was quite useful. And one thing that that may made me think as I was reading it and I'd be interested in your thoughts, is it helps with this idea of really thinking about, well, how are we going to create the blanket?"
"Unknown","00;28;51;00","00;29;11;19","When does a blanket come into play? And what assumptions are there about the blanket? In some ways, it's easy to pick up a pre built idea of what blankets are and then model off that was it's like, OK, well it's question there. And that actually could be useful at a more heuristic level, you know, for other fields of practice."
"Unknown","00;29;12;00","00;29;41;05","So I'd be interested in your thoughts about what do you think your motivation for that and also maybe the sort of surprising or unsurprising outcomes of not going straight for the blanket well, one of the big revelations for me in researching this paper was that you can talk about variation inference and you can talk about minimizing expected free energy without talking about mark of blankets."
"Unknown","00;29;41;05","00;30;10;27","I had sort of come into this with just sort of a huge deluge of literature from the active inference tradition. Lots and lots of like keywords. Well, what could more uncharitably be called? Buzz words like mark of blanket and non equilibrium, steady states and things like this. And it was a concern that I would first have to understand statistical physics and fluid dynamics before I could understand the claims that are being made about inference."
"Unknown","00;30;11;09","00;30;37;01","But looking back into the history, then you realize that first of all, variation inference is a precursor to that, even from so you can think about variation inference in its own little bubble as we have it in its own little section. And then the sort of next step, which is novel and is quite excitingly novel, which is minimizing expected free energy, can also be construed just in terms of decision theory."
"Unknown","00;30;37;01","00;31;00;03","You don't as far as I can see, you don't have to think or talk about mark of blankets at all to talk about decision theory. As minimizing expected free energy. So the reason why we separated them was because they're separable. The reason why we put those two first variational inference and expected minimizing spectra for energy is because I think they are simpler and easy to grasp."
"Unknown","00;31;00;15","00;31;43;10","And we were trying to start from the simple and build up to the more complex. It's I think it's definitely true that the most sort of intriguing and possibly the most difficult part of understanding this whole system which first in this building is understanding the things to do with Markov blankets in real, like physical situations. But what I'm sort of interested in now, to give you a preview of what I'm like thinking about next, the more the thing which I'm more optimistic about being able to make headway on is investigating minimizing expected free energy as a decision theory that sort of gets the middle ground between it's not just something that prefigured active inference as"
"Unknown","00;31;43;10","00;32;06;00","variational inference did. It's not something that seems to require a very large amount of mathematical understanding as the Mark of Blunkett stuff just seemed to. To me, it's something which is claimed to be a certain way of approaching decision theory, decision theory, sort of a philosophy, philosophical sort of technical term or statistical term. So it's that nice middle ground between novel, but understandable."
"Unknown","00;32;07;16","00;32;46;21","Which is why, yeah, the thing that I'm sort of most interested in investigating next is the expected free energy approach. And again, I don't think you need to talk about Mark of Blankets to talk about that right OK, thanks for sharing that one thought on where the mark and blanket comes in. So you said that variational inference and the minimization of expected free energy in the context of a paper that was structurally laid out with first perception and then introducing action into the loop."
"Unknown","00;32;47;00","00;33;46;26","So it kind of fits this perception of case as like action affordances are not possible. And so that's the special case. The more general case is when action can come into play that whole realm of action theory, decision theory, game theory, cybernetics signal processing, none of that, it was said, requires the mark of blanket formalism. I'd like to maybe add that there may be a weak sense requirement, like in the sense that on a Bayesian graph or using Bayesian methods using Perl 1988 version of the Markov blanket, there are Markov blankets in the machinery of these Bayesian methods because there are variables that are isolated or conditioned on each other so that's like the trivial"
"Unknown","00;33;46;27","00;34;19;12","Markov blanket, the non-contentious one that people are not spending a lot of time and attention on that. And then part of the unknown, or at least less clear, is the action and perception interpretation or concordance that first and has introduced kind of taking the unicycle Markov blanket concept and splitting it into like an incoming sense state dependency in an outgoing action state."
"Unknown","00;34;19;28","00;34;51;22","And then none of that gives a clear action perception topology which is why we've seen like around the clock and then with the ones like action and sense are connected and backwards arrows. So there's the part about the partitioning of the Markov blanket and then taking something that's kind of a trivial consequence of statistical models and then tying it to potentially realism in the strong cases like people saying Markov blankets as defining things."
"Unknown","00;34;52;05","00;35;02;16","And then even just within the formalism, how do you go from how do you ramp up the meaning of this Markov, or does it need to even be that way?"
"Unknown","00;35;04;28","00;35;43;19","Which is kind of related to this question, which I'll ask you then. Anyone can give a thought like you talked about necessary and sufficient so is this some of the necessary and sufficient pieces of FP? What is what is necessary? Like, what's the kernel that everything else can continue to elaborate around? What section and page number, please well, you'll notice that we were cheeky in defining three distinct re energy principles, probably none of which would be, you know, assented to by the actual proponents of the free energy principle."
"Unknown","00;35;44;18","00;36;11;06","Yeah, exactly. Could you go through and just describe in, if you like, sentences or just what is each one of these? The Three Free Energy Principles, inference, action selection, what do they mean to you? First one, free energy principle for inference, as you know, as we've defined it, is when we're dating you're sorry my cat is biting now sorry."
"Unknown","00;36;11;12","00;36;45;16","Hold them up here so it doesn't bite me. I'm well, the short version is choose Q by minimizing F, so choose your beliefs about hidden states by minimizing variation of free energy. So that's it's a principle in the sense that philosophers would call a normative principle. It's a command for how to act, in this case, the specific kind of action that is how to choose your beliefs OK?"
"Unknown","00;36;46;22","00;37;20;15","And finish principle for action. Also a normative principle telling you how to act. And this one is, you know, again, in our terminology, choose Z by minimizing G. So choose your action by minimizing its expected free energy and this is all for anybody who's watching this who hasn't looked at the paper we've tried to sort of describe in very slow but understand able way what what these different sort of letters are standing for."
"Unknown","00;37;21;29","00;37;56;22","We give the definitions for discrete case OK, so we have perceptual inference. Bayesian expectation maximization like choose Q, the member of the Variational family distribution by minimizing this snapshot F based upon your priors, basically and new information coming in. And then that takes on a normative interpretation. It's kind of like saying if you were doing linear regression, you would do the L2 norm."
"Unknown","00;37;57;03","00;38;37;29","These squares, if you're doing this type of regression, then do this kind of inference. The second one is also normative, but it's action theoretic because you introduced action and then that introduced the elaboration on F to the G function um, maybe Steven S, how would you say that this movement's into the future first matter for maybe not necessarily how a philosopher, but how any other relevant area might see this in an applied context, like what is the F to G movement have to do?"
"Unknown","00;38;38;20","00;39;02;18","What I think is I think what's useful is that it's like it's almost taking what's evolved out with a mock of blanket with the expected free energy and bringing it back down into a more a form, which isn't only a form which is involved in the modeling out of particular systems. Low dimensionality is coming in and say, OK, this is a broader principle that can be talked about."
"Unknown","00;39;03;06","00;39;50;28","And I think that then ties into some of the stuff, the active inference, let's try to look at is how can active inference itself be used as a way to think of organizing and structuring our lives like George Perec might have thought about it, and how can it be used as a as a hubristic in areas like coaching and psychology, in areas where you look in an action orientated decision, support or in complex evolving ways, you know, so you can't you can't model it in the traditional sense of it because there's nowhere near the dimensionality can be approached."
"Unknown","00;39;51;16","00;40;35;24","So what's useful is I say, OK, look, we've got these general ideas we've got a route to it, but this the general deflated forms of that actually then because they're not so high order and they're not so nailed down to one idea of a mark or blanket maybe has a more universal application when someone is trying to look at complex contexts and how to act in the world so I know what your thoughts on that, but that's that's what I'm very interested in is this idea between sort of diagnostic kind of syndrome based psychology and how do we look at actually what's going on in a context, look at the symptoms, look at the context"
"Unknown","00;40;35;24","00;41;01;08","unfolding and work on modeling using our own apparatus as dialogical. So collaborative human beings Stephen Dean first and then Stephen. And if you want to give a thought on that and we're just going to talk about this inference and action piece because I think there's a few more pieces to draw out and then we'll get to the third selection."
"Unknown","00;41;01;08","00;41;31;05","But Dean, go for it. Yeah. So back to my strange, twisted metaphor. So now I'll send the plus for walks into the bar and instead of 11 Matt showing up, we'll call it the geometry, which is much more amenable to the model in terms of how a philosopher might walk into a space and see the geometry first. All of a sudden there's two math there's this statistical math that's that's showed up at the same time."
"Unknown","00;41;31;19","00;41;58;17","Are they twins? What's going on here? And I think that's where the guide is kind of handy because if you first walk into the space, I'm I'm not arguing that a mark off blanket exists. I think relationship matters, but I think what most people that walk into that bar don't realize is that you're walking in on two different math and they're both showing up at the same time."
"Unknown","00;41;58;22","00;42;25;28","When you were expecting one, you were expecting to be able to work with a model, which is what as I said, it's far more proximal to the geometry math than to the statistical one. And so I think that, again, when we're talking about guides I don't have to I can put my hand in the ocean and figure out what the current is, and I can look up at the stars, figure out where I am in that invariant space."
"Unknown","00;42;26;13","00;42;52;16","I don't necessarily have to have a laptop with the statistical distribution. I mean, that might help, but that's not a tool that I need. At first hand. Whereas I think the modeling part, which is what you were were trying to bring up with this guide, is at hand. And so it's the availability piece that I think philosophers are trying to are trying to what, what, what, what did I walk into here?"
"Unknown","00;42;52;21","00;43;15;22","That's essentially what am I walking into and what is the between the set those two types of math that they're probably if they're like me, but I'm not a philosopher. They're asking when they're when they're being introduced to this. So I'm just curious again, if I'm if I'm going way off on a tangent or if we're introducing something, we actually know what we're being introduced to."
"Unknown","00;43;16;17","00;43;49;25","And that's the part where. Stephen, you talk about slowing down because I really agree it's not a breaking down. It's an actual slow down nothing wrong that whoa, I mean, I could try an approach, an answer by sort of extending your metaphor, if you'll give me license to do so. Imagine you go into the bar and there's dozens or even hundreds of math or different components of math or different approaches to math."
"Unknown","00;43;50;18","00;44;18;04","And what you'd really like is some way of paring that down to something that is approachable you know, that only a few of these will be approachable, but you don't know which ahead of time. I'd like to think that you could use what we've written as at least a first step to paring some of that away. So what we've left out essentially is the stuff that you could pair away and say, I can't approach that yet."
"Unknown","00;44;19;03","00;44;44;22","What I know I can approach is these first few things. And what I like to think is that we've done OK getting at least some of those first few things in there, you know, not too much, not too little, not really trying to find that Goldilocks zone and those are be the ones that are approachable, even, you know, approachable for a philosopher who's met very little math before."
"Unknown","00;44;45;18","00;45;07;02","And I owe Stephen as a response to the earlier question as well. But if you want to go ahead first, Stephen or Daniel, you say, well, yes, Stephen has to go for it. Yeah. Let's just say maybe bring up slide 13 if you're able to. Daniel with that might be a useful one. Yep. Just as it has I have it."
"Unknown","00;45;07;22","00;45;08;01","Yeah."
"Unknown","00;45;11;01","00;45;59;29","That's got the little bit there about the penalty for overfitting, penalty for failing to explain the data and 13. Oh is it. Oh I said maybe I'm looking at the numbers at the bottom. OK, but on page 23 or. Yeah it's 135 here. Yeah. Yeah. OK, yes. Slide 21. Yes. Yeah. This definitely juxtaposes the the F and the G, it's like a Pokemon evolution but it includes those different pieces about bringing in action with the uncertainty on the consequences of action and the fundamental and the ability to impact it."
"Unknown","00;46;00;14","00;46;31;22","But that was actually what I had kind of written down. So Stephen made the point about how action is a lower dimensional space, and that's like making an algorithm tractable, like conditioning inference on action, which is something that's very different structurally than a lot of other control theory, where the target of inference is a policy selection. Here, the affordances play a little bit of an upstream role, and they make the downstream calculation conditioned on action."
"Unknown","00;46;32;09","00;46;57;25","So that speaks to a different embeddedness of action in active inference. And then there's a few other things. But first, Steven, what was you what was the answer that you showed the other Stephen Yeah. I mean, I was really just picking up on the point that Stephen made about the difficulty of accurately modeling. And we talk about this a lot in philosophy of science."
"Unknown","00;46;57;25","00;47;20;09","I mean, the philosophy of any of the special sciences, but in the sort of philosophy of science more broadly, one of the biggest topics is modeling and one of the biggest questions is how do you trade off between getting a model, which is a perfectly accurate representation of the thing that you are modeling versus something that is tractable and that you can handle."
"Unknown","00;47;20;20","00;47;46;06","And the analogy is always made with maps. Sort of the first analogy you can't have a map that is an exact replica replica excuse me, of its territory because you wouldn't be able to use it to navigate it could not provide you with anything that was more helpful than the territory itself. So we have some kind of practical knowledge of how to make maps."
"Unknown","00;47;46;06","00;48;21;15","We know what to leave out, we know how to condense it. We should at least, you know, shrink it. Usually if we're creating a map from a territory, what we don't really have in a in a very general sense across all of science is a set of principles for how, given a specific situation that is too complex to produce a perfect representation of what you leave out and what will you keep in, and how should you transform that space into a representation of that space in order to produce a representation that is a useful approximation of it."
"Unknown","00;48;22;08","00;48;41;00","So the question coming back to the formalism would be how do you choose a kind of a cue distribution, your approximate distribution, the thing that you're going to harbor in your brain and believe that throws out enough of the useless stuff of the real world, but keeps in enough of the stuff that you really need to keep it in the world."
"Unknown","00;48;41;22","00;49;12;15","This is sort of the one of the big questions in philosophy of science and I guess science proper, like the early 21st century and closing answer. Thank you, Dean. Ethan Blue. Yeah, just real quick, so Daniel, when Daniel talked in the point one about the third P, but he called it the p h i t and he s the, the fitness, that's what basically you're describing."
"Unknown","00;49;12;15","00;49;39;12","How do we take that, that variance field and collapse it down to something more tractable, as you said. And so at some point later on, either either later on today or in our next stream, I think that's what the active inference model, which is not a map and it has probably two parts, it has a frame, but it also has a it also has a filtering effect."
"Unknown","00;49;39;16","00;50;03;20","Maybe we can talk a little bit about that because that's that's what the fitness is really about. So I'm looking forward to sort of diving a little bit deeper on that because it's not just a back and forth across and reaching edges, it's actually going deeper into and then returning from. So yeah, I'm kind of looking looking forward to that from a mathematical standpoint as well."
"Unknown","00;50;06;04","00;50;45;05","Thanks, Dean. Blue so that's a perfect segue fitness and into what I was going to bring up. And so even something that you mentioned earlier is like your attempts to capture the essence of the FCP and the things that will not change and kind of build slowly, incrementally. And so if we have a theory that does not change, essentially that does not evolve it will die like it will become extinct because we are constantly learning new things."
"Unknown","00;50;45;05","00;51;20;06","And so, I mean, I think I look from a counter point think that it's kind of critical to capture the evolution of the efficacy over time because it really changes the the potential applications and ways that that people interpret the the principle and the theory of actual difference also. And so what if it doesn't change? I mean, will it not ever change or is it subject to change or just what are your thoughts on that?"
"Unknown","00;51;20;19","00;51;55;09","Is it totally inflexible these these points that you would have to to label now? I mean, yeah, that general point is very well taken indeed. I guess. I think that by trying to capture something that we thought wouldn't change, I think we meant or I should have said we're trying to capture the parts of it that the rest of the framework will continue to depend on for sort of as long as possible."
"Unknown","00;51;55;09","00;52;21;01","We try to keep the most stable parts of it without necessarily implying that active inference could survive without these mathematical components. But just that the change to the theory or the change to the approach would have to be so radical once you'd got rid of these core mathematical components that someone could legitimately ask, is it still the same theory?"
"Unknown","00;52;21;19","00;52;46;04","So that's roughly what I would mean by essential, such that if, for example, tomorrow first and what to say, we don't need to talk about variational inference anymore, or we don't need to talk about minimizing expected free energy anymore. Someone could legitimately ask, OK, is he now talking about a new theory that's no longer active inference? Is it so different because he's thrown out that sort of fundamental part that he's now actually proposing something completely different?"
"Unknown","00;52;47;14","00;53;15;08","I think that someone could legitimately ask that question. I think the reasonable person could say that he's now talking about a different theory because I think that those mathematical thoughts so crucial to it, as opposed to some of the other parts which seem some of the more complex parts seem more dispensable. You could throw out some of the more complex things, keep these more basic things, and you would still more likely be having the same theory yeah."
"Unknown","00;53;15;08","00;53;41;23","Blue. So just respond quickly. Like so for me, that's kind of an arbitrary line in the sand. And like one thing that we talked about back and forth a lot is this concept of electricity and their knowledge system versus like an equilibrium steady state density locally. Got it. Like what does it mean? And is if we throw out every density and eliminate this requirement, is the theory still the same theory?"
"Unknown","00;53;42;00","00;54;07;16","And so that's one point. But I mean, there are many points in like the minimization of gravity and so on and so forth. And so unless we add on to the theory, we are changing the theory all the time, like as new papers come out, like the recognition model versus the generative model and the Bayesian mechanics of stationary processes is kind of really highlighting a couple of key points."
"Unknown","00;54;07;17","00;54;27;22","But as the theory goes and changes, it's like at any point we could say, well, that's not the same theory. And so if you're so the theory is not allowed to evolve over time. Like it's just this arbitrary point in the sense that that you don't want to cross like the minimization of reality. What if we decide that the minimization of free energy means something totally different?"
"Unknown","00;54;27;22","00;54;59;02","Like even in this paper, I mean, you have in a footnote about the complexity versus accuracy. But but to refer to free energy as inaccuracy is like I've not heard of it described that way before. And so for me, I mean, it is this complexity and accuracy. And I understand like the the way they framed it, but it's a completely novel way to talk about free energy, like another term out here, here in terms of like uncertainty or surprise but not inaccuracy."
"Unknown","00;54;59;02","00;55;13;28","Like that was completely like caught me off guard actually. So, I mean, as the theory evolves, I don't know that it's just what are the what's what's the irreducible component of the MVP? Like does such a thing exist or is it just turtles the whole way?"
"Unknown","00;55;16;03","00;55;34;04","Yeah, you're asking me the really hard questions. I like this because it's tough. It's really tough to think it's honestly yeah. It's tough to think and answer that and to to ensure that I'm answering sort of honestly as to what I really believe as opposed to just trying to sort of dismiss what you say you know, I'm not trying to dismiss what you say."
"Unknown","00;55;34;04","00;55;55;10","I do think that the line is blurry, so it's not clear and distinct I don't think that it's arbitrary. I might be wrong in that, but I don't believe that it's arbitrary. Let me just leave to the side for a moment. The the description of free energy as inaccuracy. I'll come back to that because I'm interested in thinking."
"Unknown","00;55;55;25","00;56;20;21","Yeah. What you think about the different interpretations of of the function f but I'll try and go back to sort of the idea of the city yeah. There's a sense in which things are still being worked out. And one of the things we put in the paper is something that we were urged to make clear, which is that active inference is a work in progress."
"Unknown","00;56;21;19","00;56;43;11","Even the sort of mathematical underpinnings are still being fleshed out in a sense, or still being put together in a way that helps connect the different parts of the theory. OK, that's OK. That in fact was a little bit difficult for me to swallow at first because I felt that if that's true, then it doesn't legitimate all of the strong claims that are being sort of made."
"Unknown","00;56;43;17","00;57;00;14","But all of our complaints about that are in that fourth section of the paper. So we tried to make clear what we think is sort of justified and not justified on that basis. But it's still true to say that it's fair to have a framework and, you know, to spend time trying to put together the mathematical underpinnings of this framework, even though they don't yet exist."
"Unknown","00;57;00;14","00;57;32;19","You know, we don't have to we shouldn't just throw out the theory or disparage it just because the full math hasn't been worked out. Yeah, I agree. We should allow it to change. We should allow it to evolve. We should allow it to be applied to different things and see what works and what doesn't. With all that being said, I, I don't think in this particular case, maybe it's true of all the theories, but for active inference, I don't think that it's true that there are things that you could remove and still reasonably say, yeah, this is still active inference."
"Unknown","00;57;32;19","00;58;05;22","I think. I think a theory could not be that amorphous and still be sort of treated seriously as as a way of pursuing science. I think that you would have to say if you threw out minimizing variation free energy or you threw out minimizing expected free energy or some other of the core components, I think you would have to say if you're being reasonable again, the word reasonable is doing a lot of work in this paragraph and building up to I think you would have to say, OK, it's a different theory."
"Unknown","00;58;05;26","00;58;25;11","I think you'd have to say, OK, we were wrong to pursue the minimization of variation, free inference, the variation of free energy as a principle for understanding behavior of biology, cognition. We are wrong to pursue that. We're going to pursue something else instead. And so you couldn't just say, oh, it's still the same theory. But we've changed this core component of it."
"Unknown","00;58;25;22","00;58;52;14","I don't think that line is arbitrary. I think there are some things that if you change, you have to sort of admit you're wrong about that approach and go into something else. That's sort of my piece. I've told you a long time. I do want to pick up the idea of free energy is a function that measures inaccuracy, but I don't want to talk for like a huge amount of time, so maybe I should put a pin in that and we could potentially return to like how about first free energy selection?"
"Unknown","00;58;53;10","00;59;25;13","Steven M finished that three then as in accuracy then isn't over put, right? Correct. Yeah, I forgot we were only two thirds of the way through our descriptions of the energy principles and sorry. So for energy principle per selection, let me try and pull it up here so I can just read it directly off the page what we have asked is any system that survives long enough will act so as to appear to be minimizing f."
"Unknown","00;59;26;11","00;59;57;08","One of the issues here is that we've left out G, but for the sake of sort of focusing our attention, we can just talk about f OK. And then how about the FP as a or free energy as inaccuracy interpretation great. Yeah. So this is this is something that I was hoping would be again, a way to present it to philosophers so that it would be easier for them to grasp what was going on."
"Unknown","00;59;57;22","01;00;13;28","I wanted them to understand why do we care about this function? F Why do we care about variation of free energy? Well, suppose that I tell you that in order to do inference, what you ought to do is minimize variation of free energy. And then you could very well say, why? Why should I care about minimizing these things?"
"Unknown","01;00;13;29","01;00;47;14","And then if I tell you, Oh, it's the measure of the cost of inaccuracy in belief, then you immediately say, OK, I understand why I would want to minimize that, because I want to maximize my accuracy so very simply put, it's a way of explaining why we should care about F. It's a measure of inaccuracy. I think that that interpretation holds up just to the extent that if you look at the two components, which can be sort of thought of as, you know, a cost penalty for overfitting, cost penalty for being inaccurate, there's a part of that which is inaccuracy."
"Unknown","01;00;48;03","01;01;11;22","It's not the whole story, of course, because the other part is to do with complexity, not just to do with accuracy. So what I think we've done by describing free energy as a measure of inaccuracy or the measure of the cost of inaccuracy is trading off that sort of ability to enter into understanding the math for, you know, a perfectly clear, mathematically very precise way of describing it."
"Unknown","01;01;12;25","01;01;19;03","But I think I definitely think that it should be thought of as containing a term, which is a cost of inaccuracy."
"Unknown","01;01;21;24","01;01;47;08","So we talked in the zero about it's kind of like finding the shape from the data and the fineness of the mesh and inaccuracy in the real world kind of has elements of both. Or at least we're used to thinking about complex decision tradeoffs. Like you could make a bad decision because it took too long, but then you came to the right outcome in the scheme of thinking bigger than just one P value."
"Unknown","01;01;47;25","01;02;41;18","And so it's kind of opening up even this very kernel piece of the puzzle to the whole question of how specific and how many subgroups and always leaving space for not overfitting, given this whole mapped territory for this discussion. Steven, as and would you say that the the overfitting inaccuracy is more around when you talk about adaptive active inference where there's a way to adaptively look and have an idea of beliefs in some way and that underneath that there could be a kind of a more objective swarm in kind of entropic kind of process which is sitting in the background."
"Unknown","01;02;41;18","01;02;53;23","But in terms of how we normally explicitly think about meaning we would think about it more in terms of what can be understood as beliefs. So I'll just be interested in how that how you see that from a philosophical point of view."
"Unknown","01;02;57;06","01;03;33;10","Well, one of the things that's still unclear to me about the overfitting part of F is that it seems that it can only be interpreted as sort of across the complexity if what you already believe is simple because what it's really measuring is how far you are straying from what you already believe. So that there's kind of an implication there that everybody always has simple beliefs in the first place and that therefore they ought not stray from those simple beliefs."
"Unknown","01;03;34;02","01;04;02;20","One of the things that I'm trying to think about now is what happens if you are starting with sort of more complex beliefs. Maybe that's not a sort of appropriate question to ask given the framework or the way we're supposed to interpret the match, but I can't help wondering it, given that it strikes me that you know, in order to interpret it as a penalty for complexity, you have to say you have to assume that what you're starting with is simplicity."
"Unknown","01;04;02;26","01;04;13;06","And I guess that would be real life situations in which you don't start with simple beliefs. And then presumably this would tell you, well, if your beliefs are complex, than they ought to stay complex."
