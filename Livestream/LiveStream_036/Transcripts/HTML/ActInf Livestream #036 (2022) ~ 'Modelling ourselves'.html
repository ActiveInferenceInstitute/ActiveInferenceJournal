All right. Hello and welcome everyone. It is Active livestream number
360, and it's January 13, 2022. Welcome to ActInf Lab. We are a
participatory online lab that is communicating, learning, and
practicing applied active inference.<br/>
<br/>
00:43 You can find us
at the links here on this slide. This is a recorded and an archived
livestream, so please provide us with feedback so that we can improve
on our work. And also, if you're watching Along Live, please write
any comments or questions you have in the live chat. All backgrounds
and perspectives are welcome here and cell be following good video
etiquette for live streams. And thanks, Bleu, for helping a lot with
those slides and for coming on because this will be a fun pop
up.<br/>
<br/>
01:11 Go to Activeinference.org to learn more about
how to participate in any of the lab activity or bring some new idea
to the lab. Okay, here we are in livestream number 36 in the second
half of January 2022, and the goal is to learn and discuss this paper
by Matt Sims and Giovanni Pezzulo from 2021. The paper is called
Modeling Ourselves what the Free Energy Principle Reveals about Our
Implicit Notions of Representation. And as with all dot zero videos,
the video is an introduction for some of the ideas and a hasty
review. So it's not a review or a final word.<br/>
<br/>
01:53 We're
going to have the upcoming two weeks to talk more about this paper
and hopefully talk to some of the authors or any other people who are
interested in this idea and get involved if you want to talk about
the paper. So let's just start with saying hello and an introduction
and then what we were excited to read about the paper. I'm Daniel,
I'm in California and was excited to read set another paper on
representations and the FEP because it feels like we had a stretch
back there of five in a row or something. What about you,
Bleu?<br/>
<br/>
02:29 Bleu:<br/>
I'm Bleu in New Mexico, and I
really enjoyed Matt Sims paper on symbiosis that we did a while ago.
And I thought this paper was really neat and really a clear
elucidation of the different categories of representation and how,
like, there's overarching, like representation and non representation
and then several different layers within that. So I thought it broke
it down in a really clear and concise way, even though it's a lot of
material to digest.<br/>
<br/>
03:01 Daniel:<br/>
You want to ask the
big question? Sure. The big question of the article was can the free
energy principle help us advance or even resolve the long lasting
debate on internal representation in philosophy of mind?<br/>
<br/>
03:20
It's a long lasting debate. So this is like the zeros because it's
clearly a topic you could spend a lot of time on. So that's our
disclaimer. It's a long standing debate. But here's kind of a meme
slide.<br/>
<br/>
03:34 So it's the first section of this paper right
below the title. It has this question from Walt Whitman and it says
hold it up Sternly. See this? It sends back who is it? Is it
you?<br/>
<br/>
03:49 And then here are several different images. And
just think about your perception of these images and the cultural
significance that you might attach to them. Or the way that black and
white pixels or gray pixels on a screen give the illusion of depth or
mind you of an emergence that you've never had. So that's kind of
trippy and representation gets at some of those issues that's one
nonphilosophical take on it. What are they going to aim to do in this
debate which we're going to sketch out the sides of in this talk or I
guess this discussion?<br/>
<br/>
04:29 Do you want to read it Bleu
or sure. The authors argue that even if the FEP can't solve this long
standing debate, it can play an invaluable role in revealing our
hidden assumptions about the very notion of representation and can
create some common ground to discuss and negotiate them. So they say
our general strategy is to use the FEP for concept clarification of
different notions of representation. We work backwards from
representational or internal representation interpretation of the
FEP's constructs to the various notions of representation that
motivate those interpretations. So they claim that it emerges from
their analysis that the FEP has been or can be used to implement
various kinds of computational models which satisfy the requirements
of certain theories of representation.<br/>
<br/>
05:18 Bleu:<br/>
Hence,
the question of whether or not the FEP entails representations
depends on what notion of representation one uses in the first place.
We're going to unpack that a lot, but just wanted to give the first
coat of paint on what they're aiming and what they claim to do. So
I'll read the first half. The abstract predictive processing theories
are increasingly popular in philosophy of mind. Such process theory
often gain support from the free energy principle FEP a normative
principle for adaptive selforganized systems.<br/>
<br/>
05:50
Daniel:<br/>
Yet there is a current and much discussed debate about
conflicting philosophical interpretations of FEP. For example,
representational versus representational. Here we argue that these
different interpretations depend on implicit assumptions about what
qualifies or fails to qualify as representational.<br/>
<br/>
06:13
Bleu:<br/>
The next part we deploy the FEP instrumentally to
distinguish four main notions of representation which focus on
organizational, structural, content, related and functional aspects
respectively. The various ways that these different aspects matter in
arriving at representation action oriented representation,
interpretation of the FEP area discussed. We also discuss how the FEP
may be seen as a unified view where terms that traditionally belong
to different ontologies. For example, notions of model and
expectation versus notions of autopilsis and synchronization can be
harmonized. However, rather than attempting to settle the
representationalism versus non representationalist debate and reveal
something about internal representation are implication.<br/>
<br/>
07:01
This paper demonstrates how the free energy principle may be used to
reveal something about those partaking in the debate. Namely, what
are hidden assumptions about internal representation are assumptions
that act as sometimes antithetical starting points in this persistent
philosophy debate. There's really two or three pieces to this paper.
There's an introduction and an abstract. I guess we can delete
that.<br/>
<br/>
07:31 Daniel:<br/>
The first part introduces a short
summary on the free energy principle and we'll see that Action
Perception Recognition Model. The bulk of the paper is in these four
segments of each with a dynamics relationship of internal
representation and the non representational perspectives. And that
section is a lot like a literature review and a philosophical
taxonomy of different perspectives and arguments related to
representation and the FEP. And these four subdivisions. There's then
a addendum on evolutionary function specifically, and that's apt as
nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution, as
they say.<br/>
<br/>
08:18 And then section Five kind of turns a
mirror back on the process and thought, just like those earlier
images with the mirror. And that's where FEP differences in
perspective are used almost as input data for theorizing and
speculating about different things, which we'll get to. So that takes
the authors then to the conclusion. So it's a pretty wide ranging
paper and the keywords that are here are active inference in free
energy principle, predictive processing, generative model, internal
representation, action oriented representation, inactivism forward
model, and Markov blanket's. There's no single path or single slide
that would do justice to all these keywords.<br/>
<br/>
09:07 So
we're just going to kind of jump in and knowing that some people will
be really familiar with some of these terms and others will be
hearing about them for the first time. So first the big topic is
representation. Now this is just a quote from the paper. Whether or
not living organisms have or need internal representation is an old
and fiercely debated topic. So we kind of like unzipped that citation
to add the titles and the links and just some of the images from
these citations.<br/>
<br/>
09:40 So if these topics or any of this
body of literature you feel like is well motivated or well reasoned
or you've never been exposed to it, that's sort of the continent
we're on. And it is such a large continuum. So the authors write such
a debate is reiterated within the predictive processing view. So
they're going to tell the story of representation from predictive
processing as sort of an implicit starting point from a more specific
and mechanistic angle. Assuming the FEP is a good model of living
organisms, does it entail the notion of internal representation or
not?<br/>
<br/>
10:15 So it's almost like we're conditioning our
analysis, whether it's a counterfactual or not, on FEP being used
instrumentally. So we're going to use it just like we would use a
ruler, not by questioning the ruler against known objects, but by
going to unknown objects and investigating them. So that's the way
that the FEP is going to be used in this very large scale topic and
complex area of representation. Any comments? Lu all right, another
big topic and word that comes up in this paper, but also a lot of
other of our discussions is enactivism.<br/>
<br/>
10:53 And so who
better to hear it from than the radicals? So Herek 2014. I think it's
a thesis why radical enactivism is not radical enough, a case for
really radical inactivism. So take it up with the author. If this is
oversimplifying or that's kind of the joke appeal here, it is
oversimplifying.<br/>
<br/>
11:15 And here we see three different
framework contrasted against each other cognitivism, radical
inactivism and then really radical inactivism. And cognition differs
from an activism on the top row in that cognition says basic
cognition is representational and enactivism is going to be rejecting
that claim on all accounts. And then where this author is saying that
you could even go further into the inactive camp or forest or
whatever is you could even deny that</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; orphans: 2; widows: 2; margin-bottom: 0in">
 linguistic cognition is representational. So even if it looks
symbolic and it looks like it has some representational
characteristic and it's the gray zone that makes people go, oh, okay,
maybe there is some redeeming aspect of representation, you just have
to keep on denying it. So maybe we can pick that threat up
again.<br/>
<br/>
12:08 But that's sort of the lay of the land, of
maybe the center and activists, the moderates and then the extremists
Bleu. Anything? that no. It's so interesting to really think about
representation and the brain. I mean, coming from neuroscience,
actually okay, I'll add something coming from neuroscience, it's
interesting to really think about.<br/>
<br/>
12:31 Bleu:<br/>
I
mean, the visual cortex is very unique in the sense that we know that
there's representation that is replicated in the brain, but
everywhere else, it's just kind of like, you know, we've never found
like the word for apple in the brain somewhere. Like there's no,
like, apple neurons. So it's just an interesting I don't know, just a
position, I guess, about representation and language, thinking about
it in terms of the brain. Also, one really important aspect that we
didn't mention is it's about action. Like, it is basically saying
that action is related to embodiment and all these other things, but
enactivism is just focusing on action and what that means.<br/>
<br/>
13:14
Daniel:<br/>
All right, free energy principle, which we're going to
spend a lot of the discussion on. It's an integrative proposal on
adaptive self organizing systems that remain far from thermodynamics
equilibrium. So that would be cool if we had one common framework for
things that maybe were far or close to equilibrium. Currently, we
only have some of those areas of Faithbase. It starts from the
premise that in order to survive, living organisms engage in
reciprocal action perception exchanges with their environment.<br/>
<br/>
13:45
They must do what they can in order to remain within a neighborhood
of viable states. That's kind of the cybernetic regulator insight.
Then the bottom paragraph, the idea is cast in Bayesian terms by
assuming that biological active state state the priors of the agents,
the states that an agent prefers to visit become the states that Bit
expects to visit. Hence minimizing surprise or its longterm average,
which is entropy becomes a primary imperative for living organisms as
it permits them to counteract an otherwise unavoidable process of
dimension and loss of integrity, which kind of closes the loop back
with the resistance to dissipation that was brought up in the
beginning. So this is kind of one FEP boomerang from starting switch,
a focus on resisting distinctions and then moving thought, the action
of perception loop to ecological preferences and facts of the
reduction of uncertainty and thus resisting dissipation.<br/>
<br/>
14:47
A partitioning that is natural or at least complementary to the FEP
is the Markov blanket partitioning. And we've talked about this in
several other streams, so we won't go into it in too much detail.
This is from 26. And the Markov blanket condition, at least in its
more narrow technical sense, is referring to some set of nodes,
representations, statistical variables. And that set of nodes that
make up the blanket makes some other sets of model, two other sets of
nodes which we can call the internal and the external states.<br/>
<br/>
15:28
It makes those two sets conditionally independent and the edges are
statistical influence Bleu. What else would you say about Mark
Friston blanket? They say it here beautifully. So the blanket states
act as an informational boundary between internal and external
states. And that's like the simplest way to think about it,
right?<br/>
<br/>
15:49 Bleu:<br/>
Like my skin acts as a barrier
between myself and the world. The blanket access as a barrier. Yes.
Cool. Okay.<br/>
<br/>
16:00 Daniel:<br/>
Leaving FEP land proper, we
can zoom out to some related topics that sometimes get brought up in
discussions of FEP but often don't. So first is the predictive
processing framework. This is drawn from a citation that was in the
bibliography but not sure if it was in the text Hohwy 2020. And this
is a paper, New Directions in Predictive Processing. So predictive
processing asserts that perceptual and cognitive systems engage in
prediction error minimization, enabling approximate Bayesian
perceptual inference.<br/>
<br/>
16:37 And some, but apparently not
all authors emphasize action. So Clark and Howie famously and
recently have emphasized that action is essential to predictive
processing in the form of active inference, where the system infers
its own policies. So really emphasizing that the predictions are not
just about sensory inputs but causes of sensory input, hypotheses
about latent unobserved causes in the world and also one's own action
and policies, what one expects to do. And there's a really awesome
supplemental file for this paper that includes a great literature
analysis and a lot of keywords and unique prediction and lists of
empirical evidence. So this is really awesome work, and it'd be great
to hear from people who study predictive processing or are more
familiar with it.<br/>
<br/>
17:38 How theory see it in relationship
to active inference and FEP, something that's in the overload of
predictive processing Bayesian statistical theories, active
inference's is the idea of a generative model model. So let's recall
from DCM the dynamical causal modeling which we talked about in the
previous weeks in number 35. And here in DCM. It is an appealing to
biologically grounded models and dynamical systems theory to create a
probabilistic generative model of hemo dynamics fluctuations. So what
is a generative model?<br/>
<br/>
18:22 It's basically opposed to a
descriptive model. So why would one use the generative model in
statistics? Because these types of models can be run in both
directions. They can be fit from data, but they can also be used to
generate data and then they can be used in different ways because of
that capacity. Lower dimensional generative models can be very
computationally efficient because they only have to be updating a few
parameters rather than keeping track of every single data parameter
and then a little bit more on the interpretive layer or beyond the
merely statistical generative model.<br/>
<br/>
19:00 Model capture
some of these openended and creative or complex dynamics that are
associated with action and perception and recognition model.
Therefore, there are links to not only the cognitive sciences but
also philosophy and phenomenology. So it's kind of an idea from
statistics that gets connected to some of the fundamentals of
neuroscience and philosophy and anything out of that Bleu. Yes. So
just when I think of the generative model, having listened to so many
people describe it, my favorite description is almost as like the
recognition model is more like the hardware or the state
space.<br/>
<br/>
19:46 Bleu:<br/>
Then the generative model is like
the software, the action between them, or like the dominoes and the
stock dominoes and then the cascading wave. Right. So the dominoes
would be the Recognition model and then the generative model is the
relationship between them, the cascading wave of dominoes. I always
like to use that analogy, just it's clear for me. And here's one more
slide from 26 where the idea of the Mark Cob blanket, which we pulled
from 26 as well is connected to the idea of a generative model in the
section on predictive processing.<br/>
<br/>
20:22 Daniel:<br/>
And
so in this paper so go check out number 26 or the paper on Bayesian
mechanics to learn more. But the idea is that it's possible to use
the Markov blanket partitioning so that there's the blanket states
statistically isolating internal and external states. And then there
might be some systems where those partitioned internal states are
acting as if they are doing inference on external states. So that
would be like if I said I'm going to hold up three fingers and put it
behind my back. And then you had a generative model that was about
what was the state of that unobserved variable.<br/>
<br/>
21:03 And
that's something to look more into from the details on generative
model as with other papers. And that kind of brings us to our last
keyword, which is active inference. So we'll go into a little more
detail here. They describe that active inference agents are
selfevident, which is to say that because minimizing free energy over
time is equivalent to maximizing Bayesian model evidence or evidence
encoding. In longterm active inference, agents seek out or generate
those sensory samples that maximize the lower bound on the evidence
for an implicit model of how their sensory states were
generated.<br/>
<br/>
21:46 As such, active inference agents author
evidence for their own continued existence via free energy minimizing
model minimization. So active inference is using statistics to
operationalize some of the information, thermodynamics formalisms of
the FEP. So it would be a more narrow interpretation that that
carries no or little philosophical baggage or claims to how the world
really is. It would be a more broad or stronger interpretation to
think that this is capturing actual information dynamics or the
actual thermodynamics relationships of systems. But the instrumental
usage is more of a statistical similarity or at least attractability
argument.<br/>
<br/>
22:33 And that is not without precedent, not
even close, because the variational Bayesian methods, which minimize
or optimize this quantity called the evidence lower bound, start
maximizing the lower bound for how good the evidence is. And others
in many places have motivated this fundamental component of modern
Bayesian statistics from multiple different areas. And it's kind of
like equations are true, so equations can be linked to each other.
And it's just kind of cool that these KL divergences as well as free
energy and the information or description length criterion all</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; orphans: 2; widows: 2; margin-bottom: 0in">
 align. And that's not even like an active synthesis.<br/>
<br/>
23:18
Applying that to inference on action is something that is bringing
together a lot of these ideas from variational Bayesian methods with
a lot of ideas from control theory, cybernetics enactivism, etc. And
again, we can explore back and find out which ideas came from where.
But just to keep in mind is Zhat. These pieces were not tied together
by active. Those are excellent relationships in the
literature.<br/>
<br/>
23:46 But active does integrate the free
energy principle and that center meme that they started with, that
things have to resist distinctions with all of this philosophy and
more quantitative area that have to do with action and perception.
And then in the dot one and dot two cell go more into the variational
and expected free energy, but kind of wanted to just give a little
thought on active inference. And if someone has a different thought,
it'd be awesome to hear it as well. But this paper was very precise
and very subtle in how I thought about some of these areas. So I
think it's really good to be clear about what we're talking about in
this case.<br/>
<br/>
24:35 Okay, onto the paper. All right. So this
is going to be a flow role of the introduction. There's a growing
consensus in computational and systems, in neuroscience around the
idea. The brain is a predictive machine which uses internal or
generative models to continuously generate prediction in service of
prediction, action and learning.<br/>
<br/>
24:57 So starting with
the idea of prediction second sentence. One of the ways that people
are studying prediction in the brain is predictive processing. So we
talked about that a few minutes ago, the free free energy principle
extending predictive processing by providing it with a fundamental
principle of adaptive self organization that's the resist dissipation
meme that isn't intrinsically within predictive processing framework
which might describe audio processing in a radar signal. And so that
union of FEP and predictive processing are starting to become
prominent outside of systems neuroscience, which might seem like
their natural niche or origin, but it's also the case that philosophy
in the philosophy of mind are starting to think about it. And despite
that attention, the authors are arguing that some of the implication
for FEP's existence remain widely debated.<br/>
<br/>
26:03 I think
we can agree on that. And they're going to focus on one of the
prominent discussions that they think is the most prominent, which is
whether the FEP is representational or representational and then to
what extent. It is also learning on debates related to internalism
action orientation and activism. So just it's all over the map. It's
a multi dimensional philosophy force base with the FEP and it's not
totally resolved, but that's what they're going to go into in this
parse.<br/>
<br/>
26:37 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
26:42 Bleu:<br/>
Bleu so
they note here that philosophical discussions or representation wars
about the FEP have typically been focused on four aspects of the
notion of representation. So these four aspects are organizational,
structural, content related or functional. And the organizational
aspects have some variable inside a system that's separated from that
which it represents. Outside the system, structural aspects have
representational vehicles that are structurally similar to the state
of affairs in the world. that they stand for contentrelated aspects
have internal models that either encode environmental contingencies
or sensory motor contingencies, specification or description of how
the world is taken to be in turn analyzed in terms of correctness or
truth conditions.<br/>
<br/>
27:35 And then the functional aspects
support vicarious use before or in the absence of external events of
internal variables of a model. Whoa. Yep, bit is kind of a woe, but
this four field distinction is the structure of the paper. So we're
going to do a few fun things to help understand this because it is
the contribution and the structure of the paper. So everyone's going
to interpret all of this in their own way, which is awesome, but we
do really want to be clear about what the author's contributions
are.<br/>
<br/>
28:11 Daniel:<br/>
So in an almost unprecedented
maneuver, we're gain to go to the end of the paper first and then
also have the figures out of order. We're going to start with what we
can learn from this debate. So if you're not sure if you want to
listen to the next like 40 minutes on going into this four Bull
distinction, you get it up front. So they're going to review some of
the most prominent philosophical interpretations of the FEP. They
then summarize those interpretation according to the four different
categories.<br/>
<br/>
28:44 that Bleu just red for each of those
categories, they're going to consider multiple constructs of FEP, so
kind of tools in the FEP toolkit system. And they're going to argue
that depending on which perspective you take on which of these
categories and which constructs, you're going to come to different
conclusions about the representational or representational nature of
the FEP. So it's kind of like a checkerboard that's their first salvo
is we're going to outline a flowchart and a grid and a structure,
like a taxonomy of philosophy, ideas related to this triple
dimensional space of aspects of representation, constructs of the FEP
and then the categorical variable representational or non
representational claims. And then the whole second part is saying
we're going to use that three dimensional phase space to shine a
light on one's own implicit notions of representation. So that's kind
of like the looking in the mirror strange loop part.<br/>
<br/>
30:00
But the first part is more like a philosophical literature analysis.
And their contribution in figure two is to make this awesome flow
chart. So this is going to funnel you from the start in the four
different domains, four aspects, variational, structural content and
function. And then from those four starting points, kind of like
sorry board, you're going to get funneled towards representational or
representational FEP, depending on decisions. And that's what we're
going to unpack in the next sections because again, it's kind of like
trippy and there's a lot to think about.<br/>
<br/>
30:46 This is
going to be our map. So it's going to be at the bottom of all of the
upcoming slides, which of these eight sections were in. It's like a
cube divided in eight little cubes or two tetrahedral or some other
pattern. But basically we're going to see whether we're in like
representation camp or non representation camp and which aspects
we're focused on. And then here's that table, but it's just the tip
of the iceberg.<br/>
<br/>
31:15 So how can we organize our thinking
around philosophy and increase the rigor and the accessibility of
different arguments? Because it can be difficult sometimes to parse
it in long texts. And so the authors clearly thought a lot about
this. So it's a really pleasure to read about it and learn about it.
And the flowchart is a great addition.<br/>
<br/>
31:43 So that is
going to be our map in the coming slides, right? Thanks for making
such a beautiful map. I have to say I had pasted a whole bunch of
these ideas and tried to categorize them and then Daniel constructed
them into this beautiful flowchart. Well, they made the flow chart, I
made the grid. The grid.<br/>
<br/>
32:04 Bleu:<br/>
That's what I
meant, the grid. The grid. Before we see the grid in action now,
let's just recall this action perception loop. And we're not going to
go into it right now, but that's definitely for dot one and dot two.
What are these nodes and edges and which can and can't happen and
what do they representation.<br/>
<br/>
32:24 Daniel:<br/>
So that is
sort of the partitioning that we're going to be working within, which
we brought up a little earlier with the Markov blanket and in a lot
of our other discussions. Okay, so let us start in this top left
square. So this is the organizational aspect, the representational
perspective. So the organizational aspect is describing how variables
inside a system are separated from what it represents outside the
system. So that's like the architectural take on
representations.<br/>
<br/>
33:05 I don't know is it classic
representations but internal representation camp are going to argue
that internal states are segregated from the external world via
Markov blanket. Therefore the brain activity cast as internal states
do represent what it doesn't have access to Bleu, what do you think?
Or anything else to add on it?<br/>
<br/>
33:33 Bleu:<br/>
Nothing I
want to delve into here because I'm going to save it for that one.
Okay. Okay. In contrast, there's other people and other perspectives
who are going to, in the organizational aspect, take a non
representational perspective. And so philosophers of the ecological
and activity persuasion have approached that same Markov blanket
formalism and basically framed it in terms of representational view
of the FEP.<br/>
<br/>
34:07 Daniel:<br/>
Like Yellow Brunerberg's
paper, the anticipating brain is not a scientist free energy
principle from an ecological and active perspective. So they argue in
those papers, in a lot of papers by Yellow and others, that just
because you deploy the Markov blanket formalism it doesn't imply the
behavior of the system is best explained by inferences generated by
an internal model, the structure of which is representing that, which
is a model of. So read the papers for more detail. But it's like,
it's an interesting idea and it was also interesting to read from
this paper that the restatement of this argument that these partially
informationally encapsulated systems like we talked about in 35 are
parsimoniously understood in terms of achieving high relative mutual
information between the non representational process of generalized
synchrony and Huygens 1673, the pendulum clock. So you can get like
oscillating pendulums that synchronize but they don't</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; orphans: 2; widows: 2; margin-bottom: 0in">
 have representations of each other.<br/>
<br/>
35:23 Now maybe you
need representations to do something else but that kind of gets to
that enactivism radical and activist debate. So we'll go more into it
later. Just kind of cool old citation and interesting idea. So based
upon the organization of the system, there area people who say, yeah,
the FEP is representational of course because the internal states are
isolated or no, because you can get high mutual information without
representation. All right, that's like what Dean called nine
o'clocking, it's 09:00.<br/>
<br/>
36:01 Bleu:<br/>
That's general
synchrony. Exactly. There doesn't need to be a representation of
brushing the teeth in the mind or anything of the reader. Okay. Onto
the second aspect, the structural aspects.<br/>
<br/>
36:17
Daniel:<br/>
So the question to be addressed is whether generative
models are structurally similar to their targets or accuracy
descriptions of external reality or whether models needn't be
accurate but merely adequate enough to leverage for adaptive behavior
control. So does. It actually need to representation the thing? Or
can bit be just some other representation that is effective enough?
So here's the pro and the con for representational.<br/>
<br/>
36:52
On one slot, the top structural representationalist view argues that
the generative model has to have some structural resemblance with a
generative process in order to be useful for control purposes that's
really related to the good regulator theorem from Cybernetics.<br/>
<br/>
37:14
And so the argument there is you're gain to need the good
representation about it in order to be on the right page in complex
environments.<br/>
<br/>
37:28 Others disagree. So here's one line of
argument that the formal constructs in active inference and
specifically the generative density G, if it's understood correctly,
according to some authors, it would turn out to internal
representation. Those authors suggested REM sad at all 2019, that
generative models do not meet the requirements of structural
representations where some internal structure replicates some
structure of the generative process. So the generative model is the
organism's model of action. The generative process is the actual
world out there, the niche that's giving rise to observations.<br/>
<br/>
38:05
And so, in other words, you might be I don't know if this might be a
mal example, but like to run, you don't need to have an abstract
representation of your own body. You merely need the action
interactions with your body. And so this is kind of arguing that the
internal generative density G active doesn't have to have any
resemblance structure to even the problem which it's being deployed
to solve. Well, and this always goes to the map and the territory and
active inference between the map and the territory. So structural
similarity, what does that mean?<br/>
<br/>
38:48 Bleu:<br/>
Right.
So how similar? Is there some metric that you're using for structural
similarity? How similar is the map of the United States to the actual
United States? Right?<br/>
<br/>
38:59 And so what does that even
mean? Structure similarity? Sorry, I'm probably poking the fire bit.
Let's hear from Alex Kilner or Maxwell or anyone else who feels
really strongly about this issue because we've had some fun talks on
it before. And it's just I just like seeing the pro and the con laid
out together.<br/>
<br/>
39:26 Daniel:<br/>
And then the authors were
very.<br/>
<br/>
39:31 Bleu:<br/>
I just like arguing what is the
difference between the pro and the con? I want somebody to draw the
line for me what is similar and what is not similar. Enough niche.
Okay, now to the third aspect. So this is the content related
aspects.<br/>
<br/>
39:51 Daniel:<br/>
Whether the generative models
need to explicitly model the ways external states produce sensations,
aka environmental models, or the ways that actions produce sensations
or sensory motor models, this is very closely related to the previous
aspect. So I think it be cool to unpack a little more. But theorem is
a little bit of nuance with sensory motor systems, which we talked
about in several places, like skilled performance. And basically this
is just one subargument within this section, a pro and a Zhang and
they're talking about essentially skilled performance, how sensory
motor models can afford sophisticated cognitive processing. And so
the first agreement here is that here comes that same Jelle
Bruineberg 2016 paper the anticipating brain is not a scientist
saying that, yeah, actually sensory motor loops.<br/>
<br/>
41:00 If
you're going to trust the story for one level of analysis, then why
are more so called complex behavior, not just more complex
combinations of modules which don't appeal to any representational
content? And then the sensory motor dynamics created by those models
may be progressively internalized to support mental operations
detached from the sensory motorcycle. So maybe like walking and
chewing gum or something like that, or maybe think about like an
insect flying or walking and how much of that is just the shape of
its body in motion and just the way that the muscles and the joints
just like flex. And so ascribing the total motion of every joint to
cognition actions just is probably asking too much of cognition.
Unless taking embodied and morphological computation as another type
of computation and then firing back for the representationalism is
coming from the area of schema theory which is where there is a
nucleus of sensory motor models, but then they're extended to include
external causes of selection.<br/>
<br/>
42:16 So that just kind of
like a flavor of one of the subdivates. And it would be good to
discuss, I think, how the structure and organizational and content
related differ because it is like a nuanced debate. And so I
appreciate how clear they did make it given that it's murky waters
because these are like four aspects of a philosophical idea. Oh, then
of course this meme. Okay, so the embodied cognition literature has
shown some practical examples of how good control can be realized
using fast and frugal solutions and very simple models.<br/>
<br/>
42:54
This is an example that Dave described on a live stream just
recently. One popular example is the baseball outfielder problem or
the fact that catching a moving ball may not require a full model of
the ball's position, velocity and direction, allowing for trajectory
prediction, but a simpler control mechanism that only keeps the image
of the ball stationarity on the retina. Alright, so here on the left,
this is like the physics class model of some of the parameters. So
this is already a map of the territory. We're not going into the
temperature of the ball and the wavelength of the grass.<br/>
<br/>
43:30
So this isn't like a world model. This is just the physics reduced
model of the physics of the asymptotic ball in this kind of idealized
settling range. So that's a lot of parameters like as drawn out
there. And here from this Wired article, how do people actually catch
baseballs? Here's the apparent ball position as a function of time
and just showing how if you're in the position to catch the ball,
that there's a simple heuristic line related to the apparent ball's
position.<br/>
<br/>
44:04 Whereas Bull that you're too short or too
long to catch have a very different visual trajectory. So in other
words, an activism is saying this on the left doesn't have to be the
representation. that would be something that might satisfy the most
formal representationalist. But then this is sort of a gray area.
Like what if there is a visual representation of the ball on the
retina?<br/>
<br/>
44:30 So there is something that's featuring
information about the real world in an actionable way, but it is of a
totally different type than the parameters in the physics class. And
so that can get, of course, a little sticky. So here is us on the
Phillies. We're trying to catch the fly Bull here's. Friston hitting
it out of the park with the action perception loop and all the work
in this field.<br/>
<br/>
45:01 So what is the equivalent? Do we need
to have the physics class model or is bit possible for us to have
some other type of understanding? Just a thought. What do you think?
Bleu.<br/>
<br/>
45:19 Bleu:<br/>
So it just really makes me think
about blindness, right? And I know that this seems like a way out
there trajectory bit, we know the physics of our natural environment.
We know it pretty well. What about when we remove ourselves or like
remove one sense, like remove vision? Right now we have like a really
different perception of our environment and we have to completely
retrain through kinesthetic memory where we are in our
environment.<br/>
<br/>
45:49 If like the lights go out. I mean, I
was without power for 4 hours the other day in the middle of the
night and I was like totally freaked out because I live in the
country and there was absolutely no light, like none. So in that you
have to know where all the things are. So like, this is a structural
map in your mind of your reality that's really different from what
you're able to absolutely perceive at that moment. Just makes me
think of that.<br/>
<br/>
46:13 Daniel:<br/>
Nice. That's just a fun
slide. Various slides. This is still on the this is I guess on the
functional aspects. Alright, so here's the functional perspective or
the functional aspects of representation.<br/>
<br/>
46:34 Another
way to address the issue of what a representation is and what it is
not is by asking what functional internal representation play within
a hierarchical architecture. So this is the function, kind of the
pragmatics of the representation. What it does. An idea that dates
back to at least PSA four is the idea that representation should
vicariously stand for something external in its absence and afford
vicarious operating plant mental operations using an internal vehicle
that are executed before acting on the external preference of the
vehicle or even when the external reference is absent. So it is able
to be cause and effect within the mental ecosystem</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; orphans: 2; widows: 2; margin-bottom: 0in">
 like we'll see from these examples.<br/>
<br/>
47:26 Consider
mentally whether one would enjoy eating a pizza with no pizza in
sight. So be like okay, think of a pizza. Do you want to eat that?
Now imagine that type of food that I previously mentioned and then
what type of restaurant it is and what equipment do they have in the
kitchen, like an oven or something like that? So there's something
that's being functionally carried forth in that cognitive
sequence.<br/>
<br/>
47:52 Can that be uniquely explained, predicted,
controlled, designed with just sensory motor loops? This functional
role of representation has been expressed in terms of whether the
agent's internal operations are detached from its action perception
cycle and hence autonomously generated versus determined or sustained
by external stimuli. So if something were just repeatedly causing
visual stimuli and that were causing, like, sort of unaware
movements, that would not be one category of phenomena. But what
about going on a walk and remembering a five digit number by just
chanting it to yourself? Is that sensory motor?<br/>
<br/>
48:36 How
is that playing out? And when cognition is playing a functional role
seemingly uncoupled from the action perception loop, which is
probably not exactly how Piaget framed it, but that's what that
notion is. And so within the functional aspect, the FEP is leading on
to ask, what functional roles do internal models play during free
energy minimization? So just like the memorizing, the number was like
a cause and effect of a cognitive environment. Is it the case that
the FEP is featuring things that are also causes and effects in the
cognition environment?<br/>
<br/>
49:14 And does that resemble
vicarious operations in the classical phase based account of
representation? And again, it's going to be the dot one, the dot two
when we go into the variational and the expected free energy. But
that's like, the big picture on the functional aspect is, do these
variables play functional roles in a way that's uncoupled from the
immediacy of action and perception? I hope I represented that because
I'm also not sure how that one okay. Anything to add?<br/>
<br/>
49:48
Bleu? So I think about it in a different way. Like, you're walking
down a path and remembering a five digit number, but like, I don't
know, something that probably resonates with Sasha or like anybody
else that does extensive that lab research. Zhat, you've done. So it
surprise me that it doesn't bring its mind for you is, like, thinking
about your action.<br/>
<br/>
50:07 Bleu:<br/>
It's like a dry run of
your experiments the next day. Do I have the tubes I need, the
enzymes I need, the reagents I need? Where are all these things
located? When it's a really important experiment, like hit or miss,
it has to be done now or never. Like, which you know that there are
some that are like, that it's important to go through and make sure
that you've got, like, a cognitive representation.<br/>
<br/>
50:27
Like, you build it and so it's fresh in your mind for when you
absolutely, like, execute the experiments. And so that's like,
instead of walking down a path thinking of a five digit number, how
about, like, planning, like, the sensory motor planning of executing
a series of experiments. It brings that to mind for me. Yeah, great.
And that makes me think, like, let's just say it's a 1 hour
experiment that you're thinking about.<br/>
<br/>
50:53 Daniel:<br/>
Now,
does the motor pattern firing associated with pushing your thumb down
on the pipette, does that get engaged during the prospective planning
of that event? Who knows to that extent. But that's kind of what's at
play here. If there's a totally disjoint neural phenomena associated
with the prospective planning, then the inaction we're in one camp of
representationism. I don't even know which side of the line
anymore.<br/>
<br/>
51:25 But then if you do have that thumb neural
firing pattern, like it's just like sped up or just shortened or
something, maybe we're in a different area. So let's return to these
ideas because, again, it's very nuanced and it's just great the
authors laid it out as simply as they did because this is clearly a
lot of literature to go through. So that was the eight, the four
times two. I won't even go Hinton it, but four times two. And that's
the bulk of the paper.<br/>
<br/>
51:58 And then there was this
addendum section on representation as an evolutionary function. So
similar to other cognitive functions like working memory, planning,
cognitive control and attention, or perhaps even to functions like
flying or swimming. Representation here intended in the sense of
affording vicarious operations and detachment from the current action
perception cycle, may be an evolutionary function. So it's kind of
like when people argue that consciousness has an adaptive role and
that the origination of consciousness could be scaffolded or nurtured
or selected for once it arose. This is a little bit less
phenomenological and more cognitiveist or computationalist with
respect to saying how representation might play an evolutionary
role.<br/>
<br/>
52:46 So let's just imagine that there was this
detachment between the action perception role and planning. Like
here's Pokemon and I'm Ants. Imagine if they're able to perceive the
polarization of light or the intensity of the light or the humidity
and then have something like a representation that helps them assess
whether it's appropriate to forage on that day. That is going to be a
more adaptive nest mate for the colony. Does the colony have a
representation?<br/>
<br/>
53:19 What level is the representation
existing at? Is it the direct target of selection or is it arising
from selection on other units? What do you think? Bleu? We were just
talking about this, right?<br/>
<br/>
53:38 Bleu:<br/>
Is the niche
the Internet, right? Is that like the meta representation of
humanity? Like the web? That's it. So I wrote that here and things to
discuss and the dot one or dot two is external representation.<br/>
<br/>
53:53
Like, how do you offload this representationalism into the
niche?<br/>
<br/>
54:00 Daniel:<br/>
Awesome question. And I also, I
think, probably subconsciously was thinking about that. Like the
image on the right is a trail, a truth trail that the Pokemon mermax
use. And so it's like it's not going in every direction in this
colony. It's only going in one direction, it's along a tree.<br/>
<br/>
54:18
So it's kind of accentuating this natural pattern in the generative
process in the niche. But then now that is like an externalized prior
for foragers that's based upon the clearing of grass and then they're
less likely to go like walk order the midden pile and forage in a
different direction. But then it does happen, so the trail does move.
So it's like interesting topics. Yes.<br/>
<br/>
54:43 Thanks for
writing down about the internet. Okay, let's continue through a few
of these last ideas and I'm glad that we're moving briskly through
this long paper. Okay, so let's keep thinking about that detachment
of representation from the action perception loop they write. In
other words, full fledged decoupled representational capacities might
shade off, which I wasn't even sure what the origins were. Maybe it's
used in God for Smith 96 into other cognitive or minimal cognitive
processes, the dynamics of which are increasingly more coupled to the
environment through action sensory perception.<br/>
<br/>
55:23 So
it's like being at a levels of cognitive complexity where you can
spin up other active entities or like the queen as a reproductive ant
is spinning off cognition but not reproductive nest mates. Therefore,
when taking functional role as contextualized by evolutionary
function as a criterion for identifying when recourse to
representation is warranted in explanation, which is a very
complexity linguistic clause. But we're finding out when
representation is warranted, the criteria for that would be evolution
shaping function. So it's a lot like saying nothing in biology makes
sense except in light of evolution. And then under those settings it
is possible to interpret at least some processes, the ones that
involve vicarious variables related to minimizing free energy.<br/>
<br/>
56:24
Under that context, the author suggests that could drive the kind of
self organization that FEP would describe as representational. So
it's layered, but it's very fascinating because it is just like you
had Majid Bleu with our niche, but it's like just stacking rocks on
top of each other. It's resisting disorder, it displays culture, but
those rocks don't have a self modeling capacity. It's like uni
variational multi scale integration the other Sims paper whereas here
we have like a human who is part of their niche, has made another
adaptive active inference entity and now they're engaged in this
reciprocal multi scale integration. And so I think the authors might
be suggesting that there's aspects of this settling point might be
described as or might be warranted to utilize representation in the
exploration.<br/>
<br/>
57:36 What do you think?<br/>
<br/>
57:40
Bleu:<br/>
So I always wonder whether we should talk about multiscale
integration or thinking thought other minds in terms of translating
into the niche. And how do you decide whether we're interactions? As
I Dean, I guess there's always this thinking through other mind
aspects of, you know, we live like stigma jack traces in our niche
environment and then they're picked up by other people or is it
really multiscale integration, like in terms of you and I are
connecting and forming a bigger unit. I always and this is we were
just talking about this like ten minutes before we got here today. So
this is something to me that's like this fundamental paradox.<br/>
<br/>
58:26
Like I don't know how to distinguish these.<br/>
<br/>
58:34 I guess
that shared informational channel always comes through the niche
environment, whether it's the Internet or some knowledge artifacts
like a scientific paper or a computer or something else. But my
relationship with you or any human</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; orphans: 2; widows: 2; margin-bottom: 0in">
 is always through the niche environment. There's always that
filtration and whether it's in real time like we are here now, or
sequentially. Even if it's so called in person, it's mediated by
vibrating air molecules now it's intermediated through routers and
such it's utilization of the niche. And I think this is just raising
a super fascinating question.<br/>
<br/>
59:16 Daniel:<br/>
Cell
yeah, thanks for raising this. We'll discuss that and then this is
like saying it's one thing to talk through the tin cans. That's like
using the direct passive active inference agents even if we could
describe the tin can as perception and action. But now what if
there's a chat bit that's intermediate between the two of us or it's
translating between two different languages. Then where does that put
the status of that entire cognitive system?<br/>
<br/>
59:46 How does
it influence thinking through other minds when the intermediaries are
passive versus adaptive active inference entities? So nice questions.
All right. This is the part which also will unpack more in the one
and two. This is kind of the wormhole strange loop turning the mirror
back on itself part.<br/>
<br/>
1:00:07 So the authors write in much
the same manner as arriving at internal representation or internal
representation interpretation of FEP. So that's the whole sections
that we just spent the whole time on like everything within the realm
of actually using the FEP, not taking it as an unknown, but taking
the FEP as an instrument and then using it to ask whether it is
representation or not on those different aspects. So now we're going
to put that behind us and consider arriving at FEP as a synthesis.
Depends on which representational criteria are assumed when either
considering FEP central constructs or considering specific cognition
phenomena through the lens of a process theory under FEP. Hence, in
the end, the debate about FEP may reveal more about us, our criteria
for representation and our interests in particular facets of
cognition than it does about internal representation status of the
FEP.<br/>
<br/>
1:01:08 So JFK is out there somewhere. Ask not what
the FEP can do for you, it's saying because you can be all over the
map. Maybe all of these sectors are in play and all the perspectives
in each of those aspects. That means that somebody's posterior
confidence in different claims is probably better reflecting of their
prior and update process than some sort of objective stance or
consensus reality about what the FEP is. As if it could be such a
thing independent of how it specifically deployed, as we talked about
with model based science and Majid Beni.<br/>
<br/>
1:01:55 So this
is a very nice point, I think both. Yeah. I mean, fundamentally, the
FEP is a representation. I mean, it is our representation, our model.
I mean, it might be the one that we employ with which to it might be
an instrument, or it might be a real thing, but still we represent
FEP, like, with equations and with ideas and memes and I don't
know.<br/>
<br/>
1:02:26 Bleu:<br/>
I mean, we impute our
representation on it all the time. So whether it is representation
itself or we represent the FEP, but there's some, like there's some,
like, play there. It's integrated with representation all the time,
like linguistically or other or maybe not. Maybe I'm not a radical
enactivism enough, or what was the radical inactivist?
Really?<br/>
<br/>
1:02:53 Daniel:<br/>
Radical? Yeah. Well, I'm sure
we'll talk more about it. So just the conclusion and then a few last
points. So, nine sentences in the conclusion.<br/>
<br/>
1:03:05 One,
they looked at four different aspects of representation. Two,
understanding which side of which line to come down on was
complicated because the FEP appeals to multiple constructs that don't
prior seem to be strongly linked or naturally linked. Like, it's
unclear whether one begets the other or whether they constantiate.
And that's the kind of work that we're really interested in, in the
ontology project and in the knowledge corpus engineering, of course,
in the.edu organizational unit of actinF Lab. So the FEP appeals to
multiple constructs, and those model can be constructed in various
ways.<br/>
<br/>
1:03:48 So it's good to clear up representation into
these fourfold distinctions. However, it's complexity still, because
the FEP is kind of like a plurality in and of itself. Three, they
argue that depending on how you think about things, you're going to
think about things differently. They then turn the mirror back and
suggest that that's an opportunity. It's a challenge, but it's also
an opportunity to reflect upon how we value representation and
different features in our model selection related to the main part of
this paper.<br/>
<br/>
1:04:25 And then they sort of salvage the
utility of FEP, whether heads FEP wins, tails not FEP loses, because
the FEP can be heuristic. So, like, kind of good for functionally or
pragmatically for philosophy of mind, even if not so much to settle
the dispute on internal representation, but to unveil and dissect the
hidden assumptions in the debate. So it's kind of like deploying FEP
into the representation debate. It's not going to be the judge, it's
going to be like some other role. What is the FEP in that
setting?<br/>
<br/>
1:05:03 Six, another lesson learning is that some
traditional polarizations might be attenuated or dissolved under the
FEP. So here we're seeing multiple uses of the free, which is why
there's a bunch of different colors on here. It's a theoretical
plurality. It has also a plurality of applied models. It's a mirror,
it's a bit hedge.<br/>
<br/>
1:05:33 It's a unifier with traditional
polarizations like cognitiveist versus an activism. And then here's a
really fascinating part. that I know many people in the lab will be
excited to talk about the FEP advances a unified view where terms
that traditionally belong to different ontologies can be harmonized.
So it's an ontological unifier. For example, modeling and expectation
is not used in some of the works that talk about autopoeysis and
synchronization.<br/>
<br/>
1:06:02 Eight how does the FEP do this?
It begins with a strong inactivist flavor and a focus on action
that's missing from traditional cognitive theories. So by starting
with 1ft squarely in action, it brings something that a lot of
neurocognitive theories are missing from and then extends the scope
of an activist thinking to territories of, for example,
counterfactual thinking and model selection and abductive logic like
we talked about also with Beni. So it's kind of like coming from
action landia and bringing in inference and then starting from
inference landia and bringing in action. Almost like it's called act
of inference or that's like a related idea or something.<br/>
<br/>
1:06:45
And then the 9th sentence is just saying the space of the possible is
big and we're going to have to reduce our uncertainty by making it
happen. So it's a really great conclusion.<br/>
<br/>
1:07:04 Any
other comments on that Bleu? Just pretty epic paper. I think it ties
together a lot of stuff we've talked about. Stuff we will talk about.
Yep.<br/>
<br/>
1:07:16 Okay, final things and things to discuss in
dot one and two. Okay, so here is a quote from the paper where they
say given the FEP has been implemented in a family of computational
models that are by definition fully observable, that's the first part
to highlight. So in that sense, are computational models fully
observable or what does observation mean for models? What does
explainability mean or transparency mean? Is that
reproducibility?<br/>
<br/>
1:07:49 Is that perturbability? Is the
map fully observable? Is the territory fully observable? Are there
settings where one or the other or neither or both are variable? So
what is this visual metaphor and what are some of the nuances with
like observation and visual perception?<br/>
<br/>
1:08:10 And then
here is FEP as a unifier. So it's less surprising if one considers
FEP unites notions that are generally considered antithetical some
meaning like contrary to each other, most notably the notion of
internal generative model, which is usually associated with
representationalist theorem, and autopoeicis, which is usually
associated internal representation inactive approaches. So I think
just who considers which notions antithetical? Some classic examples
area provided here, like To, Helmholtz and Maturana and Area. But
just who disagrees and why?<br/>
<br/>
1:08:54 And what can we learn
by just hearing different perspectives on some of these debates? And
then how is representation related to autopilotis? So autopoetic
systems are those that are variable of producing and maintaining
themselves by creating their own parts. It's kind of a classic
complexity idea and it made me think about poetic naturalism and then
all these other proposals like the metapoetic naturalism and stuff.
And then there were zero Google hits for autopilotic
naturalism.<br/>
<br/>
1:09:32 But I think it's very related to what
we spoke about with Majeedni and science as modeling in the world and
about, of course, the title of this paper and the representations
questions. So this is just a very provocative paragraph that brings a
lot of ideas. In Bleu it's also just the middle way, right? Is it
this or that or maybe some combination of these two things? Is the
right thing the depth perception, as Dean says?<br/>
<br/>
1:10:09 So
then one more sort of general comment and then we'll go to the
specifics to discuss next time. So this is the FEP as mirror. So one
can use the debate on representation in FEP the other way around, not
as a way to resolve the issue at stake, but as a mirror to look at
one's own implicit notions of representation. So here's a paper that
I wrote with my colleague Eirik Sovik in 2019, where we talked about
scientific theories for consciousness. And so instead of using a
model of consciousness for granted, like integrated information
theory or some other quantitative measure of consciousness, we took
the system as the recognition, which</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; orphans: 2; widows: 2; margin-bottom: 0in">
 was an ant colony, and then reflected back on different scientific
theories of consciousness, what that Majid about, what people value,
about, for example, anatomical versus functional linguistic behavior,
components of systems.<br/>
<br/>
1:11:09 And so we talked about like
forward tests, where you're good with your tests, you've got a
calibrated instrument. And so this is like what the bulk of the
literature review was in the first half of this paper, which was
like, we're just going to go with the FEP as what our framework is,
and then we're going to assess there's still a diversity of
perspectives on representation, even if you think the FEP is totally
the Goto theory. So this does not mean that you eliminate ambiguity.
It just means that you're using your tool in a deployment oriented
way versus the reverse test, which is like taking things that are
known in the world or some sort of internal preference data and then
shining it back as a mirror on the test and comparing amongst tests,
which also does, of course, recurs because it's a test being applied
to do so. But that's where the real revolutionary science
happens.<br/>
<br/>
1:12:09 And so this paper by Pezzulo and Sims
showed both modes in total harmony. And so I think it's an awesome
contribution from velocity of science perspective. So I look forward
to talking about that and about Ford and reverse tests. And then
here's a bunch of other stuff. What are you excited about
here?<br/>
<br/>
1:12:33 Bleu:<br/>
Bleu this is just stuff I wrote
down to talk about, like cell. I was just taking notes while we were
talking today about what might be cool to discuss in the one and two
a lot about the sensory motor loop, mental engagement, mental action.
Does. That trigger the same kind of biological response as an actual
action, and then the idea of thinking through other minds versus
multiscale integration, what might be similar or different there, and
the independent evidence of the FEP? Or is it just a mere we hold
up?<br/>
<br/>
1:13:07 Maybe for ourselves, but I think that this
paper was provocative and great. I have been a big fan of Tesla for a
long time. More recently a Matt Sims fan, but probably I've been
reading Pazilla's papers for ten years and excited to have the chance
to really dissect a paper by him with more than just myself. Great.
Well, glue.<br/>
<br/>
1:13:31 Daniel:<br/>
Thanks a ton for the
awesome work on the dot zero. I think we were trepidacious to jump
into this paper, but then you were prediction no problem. I got it.
I'm processing it's. True.<br/>
<br/>
1:13:48 Bleu:<br/>
That's easy.
Yeah, we got it. One week, sure. Three days for double zero. We got
it.<br/>
<br/>
1:13:53 We're good. I read a long time ago also. Yes.
We just hope that anyone who wants to ask a question can. Even if
it's long past the one two.<br/>
<br/>
1:14:04 Daniel:<br/>
If you're
listening to this in time, then congrats. And you should definitely
get involved conversation and otherwise we'll see you around the lab.
So thanks again, Bleu, and thanks everybody, for watching. See you
later. Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
1:14:17 Bleu:<br/>

Daniel:<br/>
That was just Blue's entry music. Hello and welcome,
everyone, to ActInf Lab livestream number 00:36 one. It's January 19,
2022. Welcome to the ActInf lab. We are a partner participatory
online lab that is communicating, learning, and practicing applied
Active Inference Lab.<br/>
<br/>
00:43 You can find us at the links
here on this slide. This is a recorded and an archived livestream, so
please provide us with feedback so that we can improve our work. All
backgrounds and perspectives are welcome and will be following good
video etiquette. For live streams. You can check Active Inference
Lab.org to learn about how to participate in any active lab events
which go beyond but also support the live streams.<br/>
<br/>
01:08
And also the Coda site at the bottom will give you access to the
table with metadata on the past and ActInf Livestream. All right,
today in Active stream number 36 one, we're going to be discussing
and learning and seeing who joins for the paper. Modeling ourselves.
What the Free Energy Principle reveals about our implicit notions of
representation by Sims and Pazulo. 2021 we went over some of the
background in 360, and today we're just going to introduce ourselves,
say hello, what we were excited about in the paper.<br/>
<br/>
01:48
And then we wrote down some things to discuss. But I'm sure both of
you have other random things you wrote down. And anything that people
write in a live chat, we can also look at. So I'm Daniel. I'm a
researcher in California, and I think I'm excited to just hear Dean's
marginal comments and just see where it goes, because there's just a
lot in this paper and so it'll be a thick one. Dean?<br/>
<br/>
02:22
Dean:<br/>
Well, I'm Dean. I'm here in Calgary, and I really didn't
know if I even had time to even look at this paper. And then I
listened in on Daniel and Blue's conversation in the zero, and it
piqued my interest. And so I read the paper and I was really happy to
read this paper because where Daniel and Bleu kind of took a path to
introducing the material, this is kind of familiar ground, familiar
territory for me, which is very unusual because most of the stuff
that we look at, I'm looking at it for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
03:05
And so I'm really excited, and I don't want to detour anything that
you guys want to sort of look at. At the .1, maybe at the .2 point of
this process, we can look at section five of this paper. What can we
learn from this debate? Because I think that section five of this is
super interesting and not just trippy. You guys use the word trippy,
which I thought was fantastic, quite a good description.<br/>
<br/>
03:32
But I think we can pull parts of this out and look at them and
reassert them and reattach them in our own way and actually come up
with something pretty amazing. I'll pass it down to Bleu.<br/>
<br/>
03:49
Bleu:<br/>
Hi, everyone. I'm Bleu. I'm a researcher in New Mexico.
And this paper was great. Like Dean was saying, it was familiar to
me, but not because of my background.<br/>
<br/>
04:02 I thought it
really explained and summarized a lot of like different points in the
FEP active Inference lab and how we use it to model ourselves. And it
pulled out a lot of really important questions, I think, that I'm
looking forward to discussing with you guys.<br/>
<br/>
04:29
Daniel:<br/>
So we wrote down some things to discuss, but maybe let's
start with just a blank slate. Dean, what do you think would be some
approaches that we can take or some starting points because we
already have other cards up our sleeve. Cell. I don't want to be a
guy holding up the flag and detouring your conversation. One of the
things we might get to near closer to the end, hopefully, is the
authors speak to the possibility of, you know, when you set up your
table.<br/>
<br/>
05:06 Dean:<br/>
Daniel, one of the things that
they potentially talked about in the section five of the paper is the
idea that the lines are a little bit fuzzy here, maybe they're
broken. And the idea of, in some cases our ability to move from
internal representation into the representational. It's kind of a big
deal because you can have the debate that says here's the parts that
would align with a non representational view and here's the parts
that would align with a representational view. But then they insert
this part that says but maybe we slip into and out action action
action action action, action oriented representation into and out of
the cue density. And so maybe at near closer to the end today, we can
tap into that a bit.<br/>
<br/>
05:57 Daniel:<br/>
Let's start with
that grid. Yeah, because this is the structure of the paper and the
elucidating contribution. And also I think Dave left to YouTube
comment or something like there's other dimension. So this is kind of
pointing away towards an interesting approach to making sense of some
philosophical debates, kind of laying them out in tables like this.
So how should we approach it?<br/>
<br/>
06:32 There's the
representational and the nonrepresentational perspectives or stances
or modes or archetypes that is definitely very blurry because of
course it depends on what you mean by representation and that can
have some fundamental ambiguity and then that representational versus
not continuum or dialectic is then separated into a few domain. I
think we could talk about what are the similarities and differences
because some of it was a little nuanced and I wondered if there was
other categories or they were organizational, structural, content
related and functional. So then this is your game board of eight
lower dimensional projections that the thought can be in. Or it's
something like one of these eight octants. And then a lot of the
papers going through some of the literature and rhetoric for and
against each of these, using the FEP as kind of the interpret what is
being interpreted to speak for one of those eight cells.<br/>
<br/>
07:53
Whether either of you want to continue it there. Well, on the Action
D, Maisto that sensory motor stuff and yelly, bloomberg talks a good
argument around the idea that, for example, I could be in a flow
state and there is no model or plan that I'm necessarily following.
And that's true if we're talking about extension and embedded as two
of those four Es, you don't necessarily have to move to that place
that requires something to work off of. You could just be flowing and
working in something, right? That rate of change is you
extended.<br/>
<br/>
08:41 Dean:<br/>
So there are times when you've
you literally don't have to be working off of a plan. You could also
be moving from a blueprint to some kind of outcome that you want to
achieve. And then it's pretty obvious then that the representational
piece has to exist. So maybe the argument isn't that both aren't at
work. It's how we cognition from a density out of a density and then
back into a density, something to at least have a conversation
about.<br/>
<br/>
09:24 Because I think Bleu was touching on this
last time too. She said, I just want somebody to be able to show me
how these lines are in this sort of structured relationship exist.
When I heard her say that, I was kind of like, no, I think that's a
fair question because those lines seem to be blurred.<br/>
<br/>
09:49
Bleu:<br/>
So something that came up yesterday is the idea of free
will. And I just wonder how that might play into these different grid
boxes. Is there free will in all of these or in none of them? Or is
that even relative?<br/>
<br/>
10:17 Daniel:<br/>
Okay, let's write
it down.<br/>
<br/>
10:24 One interesting thing about this is it has
a little bit of that visual illusion with the black grid and the
white dots at the junctions. So it's kind of a interoceptive artifact
just sort of messing with our visual representation. And the visual
representations are when you see it, you believe it that kind of
focus system in a lot of the active literature and vision. Okay, so
let's save free will and the blurriness for later and then come to
some of the things we wrote down for the previous list.<br/>
<br/>
11:13
Okay, so in what sense can or are computational models or any other
kind of models be fully observable?<br/>
<br/>
11:28 Dean:<br/>
Can I
give maybe a possible real life example that maybe speak starts to
speak to that? Sure. Okay, so in the paper, the authors say, however,
these differences matter if one considers structural aspects and the
degree of resemblance between hidden variables and environmental
dynamics. So I was thinking about your question, and so I wrote this
down. If dynamics, then the material I e, the content, the structure,
and the organization is going to have a different change rate than
the function.<br/>
<br/>
12:05 So the first three columns are going
to behave differently than the fourth. For example, the screwdriver
as tool remains very stable, hopefully relative to the spiral effect
or function that it can generate on the screw to the one driving the
screw. There are now two rates to juggle the assumptions that the
tool applying the function as a rule is stable and consistent and the
effect sought will be a form change, meaning action orientation,
where a new representation outcome happens. You quite literally start
an end with a dance between the stabilities and the dynamics
leveraging off of each other. So back and forth.<br/>
<br/>
12:52 So
we need to keep open the possibility that the stable or the
representational and the dynamic, which as Cell points out, can be
nonrepresentational as well, are both in play. And then I wrote here
because I've used the expression when in doubt, zoom in, zoom out.
When Markov blanket zoom in, zoom out. So in terms of the
computation, there's actually two computations. One around what we
think should remain relatively consistent and one which we then apply
that consistency to something that we actually want to see a rate
change expedited.<br/>
<br/>
13:37 So there's actually I think
there's two calculations here to the person that's trying to figure
out how they're going to see what's on the other side of the
blanket.<br/>
<br/>
13:56 Daniel:<br/>
Very interesting. Lorenzo
Laje.<br/>

<p style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; orphans: 2; widows: 2; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font color="#0f0f0f"> <font face="Roboto, Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Bleu:<br/>
I
like this idea of zooming in and out with a markup blanket and I
think it speaks to the way that agent are nested or anything is
nested. I don't want to necessarily ascribe agency or free will to
different levels of organization, but I think when Markov blanket
zoom in different Markov blankets, zoom out different Markov blanket.
So for me it speaks to multi scale systems and how applying markup
blankets is kind of scale friendly or imputed onto the system in
question.<br/>
<br/>
14:53 Daniel:<br/>
One extension or maybe
example of that, we've probably talked before, like the table, it's
in the process biology, it's material that's tabling, but then that
Attial is also process based. So sort of this multiscale process
ontology and the identification of a given system of interest. At
stationarity like an object that can be tracked, but there's objects
that are too fast to be tracked and there's objects that are too slow
to be tracked below the just noticeable difference. And so within a
given measurement or active inference regime, a given entity can have
attention on a given system of interest. It can't have attention on
things that are slower or faster, like out of its frequency
band.<br/>
<br/>
15:42 But that's discarding 99% of the system to not
consider outside of the frequency bands. It's like the observables
are just one, they're very boundary and so the slower things are, the
larger things and the faster things are, the smaller things. So
that's kind of a nice.<br/>
<br/>
16:09 Bleu:<br/>
And. Let me just
piggyback on that. And if we're talking about specificity or scale
friendly versus cosmic and scale free, that's also part of that zoom
in, zoom out exercise because there are quite literally elements of
this that are still scale free. Again, as they said, modeling
ourselves. We can start from that position of scale free and then
find the specifics, or we can find the specifics and ask ourselves
how far out can we extend our confidence that the stability will
hold?<br/>
<br/>
16:55 Dean:<br/>
So that's, again, piggyback on what
you just said, Daniel. There are all kinds of ways of interpretation
zoom in and zoom out. And I think that's maybe that's one of the
insights that we get when we don't get ourselves hung up on being a
really radical enactivism. Even though I'm of the camp that says we
start out internal representation, an activity leaning side, and then
the plans and the representations and the effects of that are
representational. All right, I'll think of an example that a wet lab
example.<br/>
<br/>
17:37 Daniel:<br/>
So I'm thinking of doing PCR
or a wet lab technique where you're not observing perhaps the
outcomes of what's happening for multiple steps. And even then it
might be a color change or a number on a screen. And so then you get
limited observables. Those are sometimes your degrees of
manipulation, like in a thermocycler that's changing the temperature.
The only thing you're measuring during the reaction is the
temperature.<br/>
<br/>
18:03 Sometimes you might also look at like
the optical property, but usually just changing the temperature. And
then it's very representation like to have a mental or cognitive
representation, which can include extended phenotype like the
notebook and the computer. But that's pretty representational to have
counterfactuals about what molecules would do that have never been
visually observed. And so science becomes representational. And I
think how far does that reach back?<br/>
<br/>
18:43 And it kind of
blurs off into increasingly internal representation forms. Not saying
that science is the most representational thing, but what are the
most representational things? Back and forth on that is what I'm
seeing with the 2ft in, 2ft out. But you just hit on a really
important point because you said science becomes so what makes up the
becomes like, what exists in that space prior to it us all agreeing
that it's now science. And I think that's what this I think that's
what this modeling as opposed to us as model asks us to
consider.<br/>
<br/>
19:31 Dean:<br/>
You touched on the big deal
here, Abductively. So what makes up that? What has to be present for
us to be able to say, okay, now you've crossed a threshold and now
we're talking science? Yes. It reminds me of the paper of Brunberg
anticipating brain is not a scientist.<br/>
<br/>
19:55 Daniel:<br/>
And
we can just take the always prescient titles and content of these
papers to be targeting attention point like is the Markov blanket a
valid or useful construct? More recently, but back several years ago,
identifying some similarities or at least an area of interaction with
the anticipatory and cybernetics of systems, which is pretty system
agnostic, can apply to very abstract representations as well as
perhaps real systems. And then the physical brain hypotheses and the
inactivist and ecological perspectives on cognition with this
activity called science and the role of a scientist. And so a few
ways to parse science. One is, as we heard from Majid Beni recently
with model based science.<br/>
<br/>
21:01 So that's one relevant way
that we learned about it and talked about this recently, like science
being the application of models, but then other systems are perhaps
doing something different. Well, what is science? Anyone in the live
chat should definitely respond, what is science? And also, I would
like to hear what both of you think and how that relates to anything
we're talking about here or ever. So I always think about science as
the implication of the scientific method to anything, right?<br/>
<br/>
21:35
Bleu:<br/>
So observations, hypothesis, experiment, etc. Force. And
because I think of science like this, science itself is just a model
also, right? So we use science. We build a model of whatever
phenomenon it is that we're trying to replicate or observe or test or
whatever.<br/>
<br/>
21:59 And we do. We experiment with our model,
essentially. So the scientific method itself is a model for doing
science, and then the process of doing it is creating a model of the
world. So it's like nested models all the way down in science in my
world. So, Bleu, can I ask you a quick question?<br/>
<br/>
22:21
Dean:<br/>
What do you think precedes the engagement with what you're
describing?<br/>
<br/>
22:30 Because the authors always say
assumptions matter. What assumptions do you think goes into a person
saying, okay, well, now I'm going to use scientific method? Are there
things priors that we should sort of pull out and examine that are
consistent when a person gets to a place where they say, okay, I'm
going to do that? Yeah. So there's a lot of stuff that's in the
scientific method.<br/>
<br/>
23:00 Bleu:<br/>
When I say the
scientific method, it encompasses things like scientific bias and
positive control and a negative control. And so all of these things
are kind of this in this umbrella category. When I say scientific
method and experimental design is not always simple, but definitely
what precedes any science happening is simply observation. You have
to be observant and to have conversation. You have to have some
instrument with which to measure or gauge the phenomena which you're
trying to examine, right, even if it's just your brain, which is
probably the most powerful instrument of all of the instruments,
because it's fundamental to any testable instrument that tests
anything in the world like that.<br/>
<br/>
23:57 So that's a lot of
priors, I think. So is it fair to say then, that to get to a place of
adopting a scientific method, one might first possess before they can
actually get into the formalities of that, a field seeking curiosity
and a way finding bias? And those are two different things, right?
One is, I can be a spectator. The other one is, I've got to get in
the boat.<br/>
<br/>
24:31 Dean:<br/>
I've got to get my skin in the
game. Do you think that those two things are necessary to adopt
scientific method or to commit to scientific method.<br/>
<br/>
24:46
Bleu:<br/>
So I'd like for you to unpack those a little bit more. Can
you just describe what you mean about, like those two, the way
finding and the curiosity? Yeah, the field seeking curiosity. Well,
curiosity, I mean, it's kind of got four parts. There's an epistemic
piece, there's a sensing piece.<br/>
<br/>
25:09 Dean:<br/>
I can't
remember what the other two are right off the top of my head. But
bottom line is the curiosity, it's not sort of a monolith part of
that determination because you don't know, but you're prepared to put
in some time and effort to get past. Not knowing means that you can
take one of two essential paths you can find out. Right. You can go
to a source that already knows where you can figure out based on sort
of collecting and curating evidence.<br/>
<br/>
25:51 So that's the
field seeking piece wait. What'S the difference between finding out
and figuring out? Like, to me those are the same. So like, whether
you're collecting evidence from Google or from that's epistemic.
Right?<br/>
<br/>
26:05 But to figure out is to not have a source
already, not a single source of truth. That would be the difference.
So one, you can find a truth source and then either believe it or
not. And the other is you have to develop your own truth through it
takes a lot more time because you have to go around and gather a
whole bunch of other bits of information that aren't necessarily
prepackaged for you. Does that make sense?<br/>
<br/>
26:40
Bleu:<br/>
Yes. And also, like, what is truth? Right? I mean, you
ultimately have to be the one that decides that, right? Whether to
trust and have confidence in something or not.<br/>
<br/>
26:53
Dean:<br/>
Cool. Lots of really go for it. No. Go ahead, Daniel. So
let's pull one level back or two from one and a half fractal
dimension.<br/>
<br/>
27:07 Daniel:<br/>
From the curiosity fourfold
distinction, there was like the personal factors. So the question was
what precedes the type of engagement that might be called scientific?
And there's some personal factors that are basically psychodynamic or
like situational behavioral archetypes, but there are things about
individual people, humans.</font></font></font></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; orphans: 2; widows: 2; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font color="#0f0f0f"> <font face="Roboto, Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">What
other kind of factors, even if the individual is the nexus of agency,
what other factors come into play? And like, what precedes the kind
of engagement that might be called scientific?<br/>
<br/>
27:39 If
the person is our system of interest, how do we zoom in and out from
there?<br/>
<br/>
27:46 Dean:<br/>
Cell that's my question. My
question isn't I don't have an answer necessarily, but what I leave
it to before the big bang kind of thinking, we don't know. But is it
possible that there actually is something that we can put our finger
on that leads someone to have confidence in a scientific method and
not just sort of remain kind of in a place of stasis and not be
curious? Right? Because there's lots and lots of people who are kind
of quite comfortable just going along with whatever is happening
around them but then there's others that appear to have a potential
for a deeper commitment.<br/>
<br/>
28:31 So for example when we were
talking prior to magic coming with us on with us, Bleu raised the
specter that genes don't necessarily have to have time in order to be
considered prediction matter expertise because it has both the cause
and the effect included in the structure. So that got me curious,
right? For some people just making that statement or asking that
question blow right by them, they wouldn't even give it a second
thought. But then for some people just making that claim arrests
them, slows them down and gets them asking questions on their own.
Now so that's why I'm asking this in the context of so why would
somebody now go from I don't care, I don't give a rats backside about
science to I'm very passionate about science and I'm very interested
in learning this method.<br/>
<br/>
29:38 Bleu:<br/>
So I think
science really is seen by many as a kind of truth finding endeavor
because whether it's through mining previous knowledge or generating
new information, maybe knowledge, either one of those is definitely
like a speaking of the truth. And in that way aren't we all just
looking to minimize our uncertainty, reduce our uncertainty? So I
look at science, it is an uncertainty reduction task. I mean that's
the point of it perhaps. So I don't know what factors other than the
fact that maybe we're in a simulation like we could go there because
that would precede the scientific endeavors that we undertake in our
truth finding efforts.<br/>
<br/>
30:41 But really the knowledge of
science as a way to determine truth I think might be part of it and
maybe not everyone has taught that I think about like, you know, in
western culture we're all like indoctrinated with the scientific
method from I don't know, fourth grade on or something like that,
right, indoctrination.<br/>
<br/>
31:06 Daniel:<br/>
And then they
give you the PhD at the end when you're fully indoctrinated. But
here's the thing Bleu and this is but you bring up a really cool
point in fourth grade indoctrination. And I think one of the things
you and I have kind of gone revolving back and forth is so, yes,
science. And so somebody has said this has got some practical things
and some truth finding things. But I've always come back with great
science plan.<br/>
<br/>
31:35 Dean:<br/>
These are material things.
My question has always been when? And you bring up the well we've
decided when it's grade four but I'm not sure that someone who's
graph four least me see that'd be about 910 years of age. It's the
same sciences for somebody who's 29 30 or 39 40, right. So we can
save clients now but what I'm suggesting is that before the plan or
the science there's something before that some really important
things that we're just assuming or willfully ignoring because now
we're onto the plan, right?<br/>
<br/>
32:19 Because that's what has
been reified and given the holy blessing sort of thing. So I think
you're hitting something that's critical and it's why I'm disagreeing
with you. So I don't think that the science that you're doing when
you're nine is that different from the science that you're doing when
you're 39. And the perfect example of that is Feynman I was reading I
don't remember, maybe it's in the meaning of it all, like, maybe it's
in that book, but he talks about how, like, for him, he just plays,
right? And so a lot of his science is like, oh, I get to make this
toy and play with it and try to look at it.<br/>
<br/>
32:59
Bleu:<br/>
And I keep playing with it and I keep playing with it. And
so this is something, I think, that's innate in us to just the
figuring out part, like the truth finding part. So even as a baby,
like, from the time you can sit up, like, what is this block? Like,
what is this shape, what is this flinky? Right?<br/>
<br/>
33:15 It's
finding out and figuring out what are the affordance of the objects.
Some of them are imposed by the outside. Like, don't stand on the
chair because kids will use chairs as tents and step tools. Some of
it we impose some structure on. You can't use this toy in that way,
but really, like, kids will they don't know they'll use anything
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
33:40 Like they do all kinds of crazy things, like
they'll slide down a mountain on a trash bag or something, right? So
they don't know what the limits are and so they'll explore new
limits. And I think that scientists, at least the ones that really
leave to do science, play a lot also. So, again, the trial and error
piece can be like the triangles piece. It can be scale free.<br/>
<br/>
34:12
Dean:<br/>
And I would never push back on that piece. The Epistemic
and the specific is what you just described. The other two parts of
curiosity are the distributed and the sensing. And that's kind of the
sort of the more active part where you have to kind of go out and do
the skin in the game. You have to get in, get in the boat across the
South Pacific.<br/>
<br/>
34:35 You can be doing the epistemic, value
the specific as well because you can be taking samples, but you can
kind of see that there's another side to this. So my question around
the when isn't around the ability to see the scale free part of it.
My question is, if I'm a ten year old and there's something before
the plan, how sophisticated is that something relative to the
something before the plan? As a 40 year old, I just don't think that
the experiences that a ten year old has and the resources that they
necessarily draw upon are the same. So I do think there's also a
specific and a scale friendly part to this.<br/>
<br/>
35:25 Would
you push back on that?<br/>
<br/>
35:31 Bleu:<br/>
I mean, I think
that we all kind of just operate on whatever level. I do agree that
the knowledge of a ten year old isn't the same as the knowledge of a
40 year old, but I think we just operate at whatever level that we're
at. Similarly, like a baby, you know, like they're just doing their
own kind of truth finding. But so the process is the same. Like even
though a priori may differ, I think the process is similar.<br/>
<br/>
35:58
Daniel:<br/>
This reminds me of indeed linguistics guest stream with
Elliott Murphy, how there's the view of language as the construct,
like subject, verb, object, and then there's the language as learned
by each learner. And so I'm almost hearing like Bleu saying it's the
same process. Everyone's on the same trip, but of course recognizes
that each learner is going to have individual factors, including
like, what they specifically know maybe has some correlations or
whatever with age or with other features. And then that's I feel like
maybe partially reflected with the specific of the curiosity is the
nine year old and a four year old learning the same science. It's
either like pansy's or unisollopism scientism.<br/>
<br/>
36:52
Everybody's in their own scientific niche. And so it's just a million
different granules. And then the other hand, the other end of that
extreme debate would be it's all one integrated, extended cognitive
process, which I wrote some notes on. So Dean go for that and then
we'll think about it as more of an extended continuum process. Yeah,
and again, I'm not trying to I don't want to sort of shoehorn
something in here.<br/>
<br/>
37:20 Dean:<br/>
So I would always hear
from people in my history the expression, well, I know that's a
problem there. I guess you're just going to have to get creative.
You're going to have to think outside the box. And being the
insurgent and the non compliant person that I am, I would say I would
come back with and I was reporting to people I would come back with,
so tell me about this box. What makes up the box, what makes up the
process?<br/>
<br/>
37:51 And of course, that didn't make me very
popular because nobody could get specific about what's inside or what
makes up that three dimension space. And I think it's the same thing
with we can say, well, there's a process. Well, tell me then why a
ten year old thinks in the same way as a 40 year old Dutch. What
evidence? What are you hooking that assumption on?<br/>
<br/>
38:23
And again, I'm I'm not, not trying to be a pill here. I'm really
curious. What would make a ten year old think the same way as
somebody with an additional 30 years of experience? They want
uncertainty reduction. That's a generalization that I can agree
with.<br/>
<br/>
38:44 But what about the specifics? I'll give a
specific in general. I think that for disciplinary education, some of
the questions might be very. Similar. Like why is this leaving group
superior to that one in organic chemistry?<br/>
<br/>
38:58 Daniel:<br/>
I
think if somebody were very precocious in ten and learning about the
halodes as leaving groups or if they were learning about it in adult
education, they would ask that question and then once they got the
answer, they would have moved on in their learning in that
disciplinary finding out way. Like here's the periodic table, here's
why the trend is this way. So that's not the whole of education, but
in that mode which many of us have come from and exist within, that
was the education, that's educational instruction. So that's the
instructionism component and then I think it becomes different as you
move away from that spotlight. So then a few other</font></font></font></p>

<font color="#0f0f0f"> <font face="Roboto, Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">comments
about the specifics of how the different age would be
different.<br/>
<br/>
39:50 There's the biology of how the
individuals would be different, like in some of their cognitive
features, whatever it meant for that person, from working memory to
the specific long term memories and other capabilities, they have
perspectives they've learned about.<br/>
<br/>
40:12 They're a
different, complex system, but they can be a complimentary part of
the system. Like older people providing mentorship for younger
people. But I think that's what kind of comes to some of these notes
on science as an extended cognitive phenomena, which is partly what
has been got at. So science has many different possible goals and
sometimes scientists in an ad hoc way will appeal to different
components. Like science is correct because there's technology, like
it's demonstrable or it's useful, not always providing a Bull
hypothesis for what we would have if we had done something
different.<br/>
<br/>
40:53 But there are all kinds of different ways
to look at it. But it deals with individual cognition features and
learning in action in their niche. But it also refers to broader
phenomena. Like maybe a differentiating question is can one person on
an island by themselves do science? And if the answer is like yes,
they could explore a hypothesis test, then that's one
perspective.<br/>
<br/>
41:19 Another perspective would be you're
only doing science when you're using this interpretation of the
scientific method and you're using science as a body of knowledge,
like you're using the literature with the dos. And some people go as
far to say that you need to have a career in a certain specific
institution or a specific degree or a specific training or approach.
So that is clearly not applicable to the one person on the island.
And not that one of them is better, but that whole apparatus, that's
part of the extended niche. And then also there's at least in our
case, the emphasis on the digital or at least informational stigma
g.<br/>
<br/>
42:00 There's a cognition in science in a different way
than there's many books you could read on tying knots, probably a lot
of YouTube channels. Is there a DOI for information on knots?
Probably not, but that in science is a big emphasis. Reading and
writing the literature, at least in the way that we know it today.
But again, that could also perhaps not be as much of a core component
anyway, just like if you point it maybe now we'll bring it back to
this paper.<br/>
<br/>
42:35 But science is kind of the
representational paradigm and I think Dean's question is getting at
what is before? What's the before and the after or the subconscious
or the submerged of science. And when we're talking about that
representational piece and when we're talking about science, we
typically talk in terms of isms what is where is how is when we set
up our hypothesis. And I think, what this paper if we're bringing it
back to the paper, I think what section five of the paper speaks to,
especially when we're talking about the functional dimension, is the
if, the counterfactual, and how they talk in there about how I'm not
sure if it was Clark or Hohwy or one of them talks about the fact
that so a bacteria doesn't typically ask the question what if?<br/>
<br/>
43:32
Dean:<br/>
When it's sampling its environment. So that's pretty
science. Yes. And I think that relates a lot to Martin Boots's guest
stream, I think twelve on the event based cognition and how if there
is an event based structure to cognitive events then for any given
parameter in that model it can be otherwise you could say like the
ball is rolling off a table. The ball is not rolling off the table,
the cup is rolling off the table.<br/>
<br/>
44:04 Daniel:<br/>
Like
you can start to just do single mutations, especially the important
counterfactuals for linguistic structures. And then that might be
closer to what we've seen discussed in other Sims papers as the
adaptive active inference agent. Going back to earlier paper citing
that but just that was our previous discussion with Sims. This paper
has sims, like the pendulum, does not have a counterfactuals about
whether it could go on a different axis. It's mechanically
constrained whereas cognitive structures can engage in
counterfactuals play in a way that the pinball machine can't.<br/>
<br/>
44:51
Even if the pinball machine has chaotic or other types of seemingly
agency behavior.<br/>
<br/>
45:02 Dean:<br/>
In that space, I can be
at the top of the ski hill prior to a gradient descent and I can be
adaptive, meaning I can close my eyes and do a visualization. And I
can also be variational, meaning that I can try to recreate through
my interoceptive sensors a sensation of floating pre, pushing off and
engaging with that process. Right. So again, the win of this, I think
is something that really matters. I think we gloss over it or we
don't even pay any attention to it typically because we want to get
to in the paper it's figure two.<br/>
<br/>
45:46 We want to get to
figure two. But I think before there was a figure two, before there
was a plan or a representation, we might want to ask when plan if I'm
engaging in counterfactual inference prior then doesn't everything in
the diagram depend on prospecting up the nodes in that
representation? All right, do I not have to provision up a format
that will be potentially something that others can comprehend as now
organized? And don't I have to propose alternative paths? As Ines,
like, all of those things are pre planned, all of those things have
to be present prescience.<br/>
<br/>
46:36 So we can say, well, I'm
not paying attention to that now because I'm busy putting processing
something that I can now transfer to other readers and viewers of
this diagram. But I think to ignore those things is to ignore the
difference between a ten year old doing a science experiment and a 40
year old doing a science experiment. Let me give one thought on that.
It actually speaks to this question of whether science is the same
for everybody or different for everybody. Is this the board exactly
as laid out that everybody has to play by that's like the game of
life, the board game, not the cellular automata simulator, but the
board game.<br/>
<br/>
47:25 Daniel:<br/>
There's one path or there's
limited points of agency and then everybody on the board on that
layer, one is moving through life on the same or on a constrained set
of trajectories. So it's like are these the immutable railroads of
decision making and thought? Or might other people have different
connections or different decisions or totally different railroad
stops or different dimension or just represented in a different
format? Is it like, well, here are the battle lines that are always
going to be the case for philosophy and there's going to be some
people whose situation and neurodiversity leads them to be on this
side or this quadrant or emphasize this component, the regime of
attention? Or is even that layer shifting because there isn't any
stability to be found in counterfactuals?<br/>
<br/>
48:26
Dean:<br/>
There you go.<br/>
<br/>
48:30 Daniel:<br/>
Back to the
questions.<br/>
<br/>
48:37 It was a great early point about the
rates of change being different because also that does at least
talking about rates of change kind of evoke numbers gets the
scientists excited because could there be like a number? Could there
be a sentiment score? Or could it be like, this sentence is totally
consistent with both, or it's inconsistent with this? Could we
annotate the literature and measure or do surveys or actually measure
those rates of change in individuals on their learning trajectory or
in fields? How could it go from just being a really insightful
philosophy paper with a lot of scholarship into being something where
we can use some numbers or something?<br/>
<br/>
49:23 Dean:<br/>
So
I see the first three columns, organization, structure and content as
the more stable. I think you had another diagram where you were
showing that going out over longer periods of time, right? So which
one do you think is the most rapidly changing function?<br/>
<br/>
49:48
Daniel:<br/>
Okay, so let's kind of recap them. So organizational
seems to be related to the encapsulation the organization like brain
architectures features of the world such that the representation is
separated from what is represented. So like you could have
representation of the sun but then that's very far physically from
the sun. The structural aspect is related to representational
vehicles toot toot that are structurally similar to the state of
affairs in the world they stand for. So that is the abstract
structure of the representation having some congruence or isomorphism
or similarity to what is being represented.<br/>
<br/>
50:37 This one
is super dependent on the definition of representation because
someone go well, you can't represent a car in your head because your
head is not a car.<br/>
<br/>
50:47 Content related having internal
model models that either encode environmental contingencies or
sensory motor contingencies, specification or description of how the
world is taken to be turned analyzed in terms of correctness or
truth. So that seems to be more consistent with the car content. You
know, it's like the YouTube content, the car content can be
represented if it stands for something. The content of that message
was an invitation to the birthday party. So that is related to the
information like the memetics, especially in an actionable way and
then the functional role.<br/>
<br/>
51:33 This is where we're going
to highlight and hopefully Dean, I want to hear a little more about
why this one is different. Supports vicarious use before or in the
absence of external events, internal variables of model that was
discussed in the paper a lot in the context of sensory motor
detachment and there have been some blurry lines down there for sure,
like motor replay and preplay. So we know that it is on the spectrum
of existing that neural dynamics but cognitive dynamics involved
during are involved echoes or anticipations</font></font></font></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; orphans: 2; widows: 2; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font color="#0f0f0f"> <font face="Roboto, Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">of
them are involved in the before and in the after as well as
counterfactuals before and after. So what is happening with internal
representation and then maybe how does it relate to active and FEP?
Yeah, so I know enough about dreams and subconsciousness just us to
get me into trouble.<br/>
<br/>
52:28 Dean:<br/>
But the first three
when we reorganize through our dreaming and whatever those
representations are or internal representation spending on your wish,
those are all backwards looking typically and then the functional
that's what segregates it out is it's forward and backwards. So
that's to me a huge differentiator right there in terms of how much
or how long we expect something to stabilize versus how much we want
to act on something and generate that change or outcome that we're
seeking. That's why I get back to that search field being different
than a framework.<br/>
<br/>
53:24 Daniel:<br/>
Okay, it's a lot to
think about but it's interesting. The organizational maybe there's
some dissenting view from this but this is related to how the system
is arranged. So this one can be thought to be slowly changing because
we're talking about things which means we're talking something that
has persistence and so the organizational aspects of systems tend to
be the slowest changing perhaps like the organization of the servers
changes on a very slow timescale relative to the processor. Then the
structural aspect also it's very important that it has persistent
like storing a variable in memory. Like you want things to stand for
each other for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
54:13 You kant the DOI to be a
representation of that paper for a long time. Those are also related
to like it's sort of the functional side of organization like form
and function a little bit. But I know function is used later. So not
to confuse the term function, but this is related to some of the
performative aspects of organization and infrastructure and
architecture. So that's also like you don't want the screwdriver to
be a different thing in your hands that's too slow.<br/>
<br/>
54:44
But maybe it'd be cool if you could modify or tweak the tool or like,
you know, unscrew it and bolt something in a little slower to make it
different. But usually you don't want to change too fast then.<br/>
<br/>
54:56
But what about the content related? This seems to be also changing
somewhat faster because environmental or sensory motor contingencies
that seems like that could change on the fly and then I agree that
the functional role as defined here like vicarious detachment,
including counterfactual and self modeling counterfactuals, this is
like some of the most rapidly mutating. But what do you think about
content also changing fast? Well, I think whenever image a mistake
and I accidentally hit the Deneve button on my notes, how upset I get
because the stability of the content is lost. So I actually see it is
still relatively stable as opposed to something that's changing
rapidly.<br/>
<br/>
55:51 So these four columns here, there is a
different temporal aspect which relates to what you asked earlier
about when representation. So instead of the possessive do organisms
have representations or the identitarian action, action oriented
representation, the definitional, what are representations? This is
the temporal or the dynamical when our representations well, that's
not complete. You have to say what it is. You can't just say when it
is well, couldn't you just flip the words?<br/>
<br/>
56:30 Wouldn't
it be just the other person's perspective? You can't talk about is
without when, so why is that one okay? Why are there papers about
what is a representation? What is it like to be a bat rather than
when is it like. I don't think it has to be or I think it's
both.<br/>
<br/>
56:50 Dean:<br/>
The other thing that I think we
need to maybe think about is the first three tend to be on a
continuum that's orthogonal to the fourth. I can organize, I can
structure and I can content build. Function now is orthogonal stat I
will because it's going it's used before. So again, back to that
temporal aspect, it's both. And I wouldn't drop any of the four
columns.<br/>
<br/>
57:27 I'm just saying that I think that the
fourth column is maybe on a Y axis relative to the first three that
are on the X plane. Okay, a few notes here. So before or in the
absence of right now, isn't it the case that usually anticipation
entails something being both before and in the absence of I wonder
what it will be like when my friend comes over. That's in the absence
of the event and it's a counterfactuals before, but it may happen.
It's a prediction, it's an expectation and maybe even active
inference lab.<br/>
<br/>
58:02 Daniel:<br/>
It's a preference. So I
agree, like even the way that the authors have written it, these are
related to architectural and performative features of like basically
functional or structural definitions of representations, what they
are, what they do. And then this is even uses temporal words as well
as counterfactual words, though and those are probably like used
elsewhere in the paper. But that's a very interesting distinctions.
And so it's like there's our map, but how easy is it to just lay out
the map and go, all right, here's Northern California, here's a map
instead of the temporal aspect.<br/>
<br/>
58:44 And I think that
also shines a light actually on another feature of what people would
call science, which is like science the metric system. And then,
okay, you've gone too far with the metric dime, but then pretty much
on a lot of the other fronts, except in the United States, the metric
system has hold as how people are sense making in terms of like
distance and time and other units and that's chronos like chronology
and time in the decimal time. And then kyros is like the timeliness
and there's other ways to think about time. So we kind of open it up
and it just makes me wonder, okay, what else is handed with the map?
Is there a time object?<br/>
<br/>
59:28 How do we share time along
with the map? Is that attention is focus times, time Ines all these
other things? So how do we convey the temporal aspect instead of just
this gene regulatory network or this is the map here or the map and
the math and the territory, how do we bring the temporal
along?<br/>
<br/>
59:55 Bleu:<br/>
I wonder about the temporal also
and especially now that we're kind of delving into like quantum
aspects because the simultaneous existence of more than one state
right, is possible. And so is it possible to be like building and
executing your model at the same time? Is it input then output? Is it
always sequential or is there some kind of like simultaneous
happening that's going on there? I don't know.<br/>
<br/>
1:00:36
Dean:<br/>
Oh, Bleu. That's perfect. For the next question I wanted
to ask. So is one of the assumptions here that there's a continuum,
like if then between I can and I will, because this was a debate that
I got into with people forever when I was in education, that there's
some sort of an assumption that because I can, therefore I will.
Well, I wouldn't jump off a cliff even with a parachute on.<br/>
<br/>
1:01:02
There's no will for me to do that because that's just not my jam. But
orthogonally speaking, if organization is on the X and structural is
on the X and content is on the X, but functional is on the Y, now I
can separate the two things out. And as you said, if I go back to the
quantum level now, I'm predecision branched in that diagram, do you
notice that the diagram is basically unidirectional? It's always
heading to a particular outcome. It's always I can make this decision
branch moment, therefore I will arrive at representational or
nonrepresentational and I'm with you.<br/>
<br/>
1:01:50 I'm not so
sure that previous to this that it isn't bidirectional, it isn't
function, it isn't orthogonal. I think it could be all three of those
things.<br/>
<br/>
1:02:03 Daniel:<br/>
Hello. Would you like to say
anything or can I? All right. Two points I would be remiss not to
make. First, the Tetrahedron and fuller synergetics gives us a
mnemonic to have four spatial dimensions.<br/>
<br/>
1:02:16 So this
four column scheme, all of them can be four intersecting spatial
dimensions. They're coordinated at 60 degrees, not 90 degrees. And
then the second point is like this onedirectional maze reminded me a
lot of the way that people study decision making and path finding or
figuring, whichever 1 may be in ants, which is there some laboratory
maze, like a Y maze or T maze or maybe some branch on a tree in
nature. And then for the purposes of the science, so called the
paper, it's going to be like we counted them as going down a certain
branch, making a decision at the node when they went 5 branch point
and didn't return. So it's like this is the line that you trip when
it goes from zero to one on that number.<br/>
<br/>
1:03:08 And
that's what gets fed into the scientific process and the method and
observations of the literature and the statistics and all of that.
But then if you're watching the ant or if you look at the video,
maybe they dwell at the node or they turn around or they walk down
one and then they come back. Or like even they go far down one and
they come back. So it is very interesting and it's a subtle graphical
point, but one that would be almost seen as like, what do you mean?
How could these be undirected edges?<br/>
<br/>
1:03:37 Well, what if
we say, hey, let's start at representational FEP, it's just where
we're going to start today, and then let's pull back to the vicarious
use of variables. Now where can we go from there to sensory motor
detachment? Or we can take no and all of a sudden we're a internal
representation FEP because they're only one step away, because
they're both outcomes of the decision about the vicarious use of
variables. So I hope those are some interesting points and I think
that relates a lot to the discussions that we've been having in.edu
about cyclic curriculum. And you touched on it I'm going to just
bring it I'm gain to reduce it.<br/>
<br/>
1:04:17 Dean:<br/>
Not</font></font></font></p>

reduce it. I'm going to reduce it. To your point, Daniel, there can
be a yes, there can be a no, and there can be a maybe. The maybe part
is what's being left to out of this. Cool.<br/>
<br/>
1:04:32
Daniel:<br/>
I'll read a comment from Serval in the chat, who I was
also thinking of when we talked about like, science as a human
phenomena and all of that. I think she'll have a lot to say on that.
Serval wrote, considering many world hey, Dee, I'm going to read
Serval's comment. Considering many world type theories, is it
possible that can entails will? It would be a distinctions property,
though, not a trajectory property.<br/>
<br/>
1:05:06 Dean:<br/>
Okay.
I have to think of that in terms of how I set up entailment.<br/>
<br/>
1:05:15
Maybe I'm not trying to duck. I think there will be times when my
confidence, through my ability to say that I've done something
before, leads me to a lower threshold around will. But then sometimes
it doesn't. So I'm not trying to be evasive, but I can think of times
when it can entail, and I can also think of times when it very much
does not. So will, it's a short English word.<br/>
<br/>
1:05:49
Daniel:<br/>
It could refer to something that will happen, like the
ball will go to the bottom of the bowl unless anything else stops it
from doing that, or it can refer to sort of that motivational
ecological energy, which is related to agency. And so it's kind of an
interesting congealed word because agency and will are very related.
And I'm just trying to think if they're positively related, like, to
feel that you have the choice is to have the agency. And that can be
seen as willpower. Whereas willpower doesn't come into play in
situations where there's no agency.<br/>
<br/>
1:06:32 If you just
need to sit in the seat on the airplane, it doesn't require any
willpower agency for that action to occur. So I'm just thinking about
learning the distributional property, like counterfactuals, do we
engage with them as a possible cosmological reality, like in the many
world type theories or just cognitive possibilities so they can be
engaged with without taking on like a cosmological meaning? And then
what does that mean about RN equals one trajectory, the specifics of
our kind of entity in motion, and then the distinctions of perhaps
different types of counterfactuals or different kinds of possible
stochastic rollouts of the system given really similar starting
conditions. And that's where the will can entail. The can.<br/>
<br/>
1:07:33
Dean:<br/>
I can start out by asking what if? But I still have to
select the can the which if again, at some point we can see a
relationship of entailment. But I think as a quantum question,
they're orthogonal. Can and will are dot. One leads necessarily to
the other.<br/>
<br/>
1:08:02 Bleu:<br/>
So just to kind of play on
words and loop back around to what I was talking about earlier, can
is an affordance. Right. So if you have an affordance, that doesn't
mean that you'll use it. Right. And will I will choose or implies
that you have some agency.<br/>
<br/>
1:08:23 Right. I choose to not
start a fight with a flight attendant while I'm sitting in my seat on
the airplane or whatever, because you can do all kinds of things. You
get many affordance. And I just wonder how this ties into these
representational and non representational aspects of the FEP. Like,
really, when I was talking about free will earlier, if interface
states are a direct representation of external states, it seems to me
like I kind of feel like there's less options there, whereas internal
and external states have coupled dynamics.<br/>
<br/>
1:09:05 That
kind of leaves some mystical fluff outside that I can essentially
leverage with my own choice or something like that. I mean, I don't
know what to call it. Mystical fluff. But it leaves something unfed.
Right.<br/>
<br/>
1:09:21 Like there's a coupling. It's like a hidden
there's a hidden states there that are only that. That's where I can
impose my will cell. I'm going to put that fluff on a pedestal. I'm
going to honor the fluff because I do think that there are actual
times when the ability not to be captured by our observations is
actually an advantage.<br/>
<br/>
1:09:46 Dean:<br/>
So mystical meh
may be uncertain. Yes. And are there advantages to that at times?
Yes. So we can call it fluff, but I think sometimes we don't pay it
enough respect.<br/>
<br/>
1:10:04 Daniel:<br/>
I think that relates
to the cloud of unknowing, which is perhaps a text if somebody wants
to go into a more esoteric avenue. But I'd like to return to the
figure and ask what either of you thought about figure one. How does
that play into this conversation we've been having? Like, what does
this entity and action partitioning have to do with science? Is this
partitioning unique to active inference or other partitioning as
possible?<br/>
<br/>
1:10:36 Does it could it be another
way?<br/>
<br/>
1:10:44 Dean:<br/>
I think this is a pretty stable
representation, and I think it does honor to the scale free aspects
of what the free energy principle is pointing to in terms of a
statistical pathway.<br/>
<br/>
1:11:05 Daniel:<br/>
Yeah. I mean,
how many debates and uncertainties could be prevented by saying this
is a representation of an entity and having people know what was
meant by representation. Right. Because it's like, I made this
representation of an entity. I think it does this useful
thing.<br/>
<br/>
1:11:26 Those points cannot be false. They're
assumptions by a person. And what would be disagreed with that? It's
not a representation. Someone would say there's a more useful
representation or more good, true, beautiful, simple, but then let's
see it and then we can use science to compare representations because
that would be okay.<br/>
<br/>
1:11:51 Dean:<br/>
Right. And then you
said it does honor to the scale free. So the only thing that kind of
hints otherwise is the person. And the world kind of gives a scale
indicator for this model, but without that iconography, it would be
and also adding in perhaps a legend or description of what the edges
mean because it does say schematic of reciprocal exchanges. And it
uses statistical vocabulary, but it also uses actual, like,
ontological vocabulary in the terms of actuators.<br/>
<br/>
1:12:33
Daniel:<br/>
So are these the physical things that are doing the
actuating, or are they the statistical or informational exchanges? Or
is this the representation, the form of a scientist model? So we're
only ever talking about scientists using these models so we're only
ever talking about that kind of nexus where we're referring to both
loosely and so it shouldn't be interpreted as either of them
specifically it's just dialogue. There's a lot of ways to interpret
what the edges are and they might have similar different labelings
and different schemes. But it is statistical, it is
quantifiable.<br/>
<br/>
1:13:16 It'S amenable, it's a qualitative
topological partitioning that is amenable and beyond to certain
quantitative analysis. Like if you can draw it like that, you might
be able to do a Bayesian graph and then there's software toolkits and
there's implementable algorithms and then there might be some quite
interesting guarantees or tendencies with brain architectures. For
example, to perform predictive processing or to have learning
anticipation of memory or to engage in control or anticipatory
control.<br/>
<br/>
1:13:53 But that's definitely some of the most
core iconography that we've seen. I mean, 50% of papers or what cell
find out Bleu have the action loop. Because what's a little side
hustle of you Bleu got going here?<br/>
<br/>
1:14:14 We're trying to
read more papers together and learn about them. Okay, but it's
interesting how often this has come up. And sometimes authors draw on
the same image, other times they do different. And sometimes the
arrows are just the clock, like just a unidirectional flow. Other
times there are some bi directional arrows and there are several
guest rooms on the more technical aspects there.<br/>
<br/>
1:14:46
But let's return to the general questions. Anyways, anything else to
say on figure one, though? Like just on this? Like what is this and
how is it? I think it represents better the Pyfixating on the pot fly
than it does on the physics model.<br/>
<br/>
1:15:07 Dean:<br/>
And
so I think it's until somebody, as you said, until somebody comes
along with a better representation, one that seems to give us the
maximum amount of information that we need versus the maximum that we
can handle. I think this is a good rep. Great and very satisfying
conclusion.<br/>
<br/>
1:15:33 Bleu:<br/>
Sorry I really think that
what's not shown in this representation and what I feel like is
always left out is the fact that some states are hidden, right? And
so where is the hiding here? What is hidden from what in this? And so
like the sensory states we don't even know if we perceive I mean we
know that we all perceive temperature differently some people I'm
cold in this room but many people would be comfortable and some
people like. My favorite colors purple.<br/>
<br/>
1:16:08 My
daughter's favorite color is yellow. So like we don't perceive things
in the same way. And so there's always something hidden from everyone
else. And I think that this schematic kind of leaves that out. I've
seen the hidden states represented well in other action perception
loops, but I think that it's important to recognize what's obvious
and what's not.<br/>
<br/>
1:16:35 Daniel:<br/>
If I could give one
thought there, then Dean. So I think there's two levels of like what
are the hidden states from the perspective of the internal states,
the system of interest, the external states are hidden states
implicitly or explicitly modeled, but they're the ones that are never
directly observable. They're only observed through their proxy
sensory states and enacted or the transition frequencies are modified
through policy selection, through action. So within the model, within
the Tetrahedral, the hidden states are relative to the internal
states on the other side of the Markov blanket. And then there's like
the implicit Tetrahedral, which is like</font></font></font></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; orphans: 2; widows: 2; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font color="#0f0f0f"> <font face="Roboto, Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">us
modeling this four field partitioning and then everything that's not
included as a variable in that statistical model is like implicitly a
hidden state.<br/>
<br/>
1:17:26 But then what is that? But then we'd
have a different model if it wasn't a hidden states.<br/>
<br/>
1:17:33
Dean:<br/>
And the other thing I think is that the vertical line
between sensory states and active states, if you tip that 90 degrees,
it would look like a blank, even though it has two points on the end
of it. And I think that blank is by definition hidden states. It's to
be filled in. So I think again, you can fill in the blank or you can
leave it blank and say because it's blank, that is by definition
hidden. So another related point, thanks for bringing that up, Dean,
is there's one edge that's not shown here but has featured very
importantly in recent discussions on active and that's the sigma or
the mapping function from number 26 and number 32, a mapping function
of internal states to external states.<br/>
<br/>
1:18:29 Daniel:<br/>
Now
look at Axel Constant and Yellow Bernard's work to think about how
the niche is also doing like anticipatory modeling of the individual.
So the other way, but let's just focus on the entity and its mapping
to external states. It's predicting external states or at least
acting as if, or can be modeled as if. So there is an edge there that
we've seen in modern work, it's not drawn here, which actually might
suggest either the inheritance of a legacy graphical pattern or some
preferences or conclusions about what these edges do represent,
again, even though they're unlabeled. So that's one edge that we've
been hearing more about.<br/>
<br/>
1:19:09 And then I think another
edge that Dean just highlighted is this one directly between sensory
and active states. And again, the clock flow doesn't have this, the
one that's just internal action, external sense, that doesn't have
the sense action bridge. And it depends a lot on what these things
mean. But it'd be cool to understand what is meant by the backwards
connections as well as by the vertical connections. And why are there
not backwards connections between action and internal and sensory and
external?<br/>
<br/>
1:19:51 It's like it's really a four by four
matrix with some connections. And that's how we've seen it
represented as the sparse connectivity matrix in number 32. And
thinking about the way that we model complex systems and generate
approximations that sometimes can also retain some other features,
like the highly optimistic exponent. So some thoughts there, Bleu. So
we've definitely seen internal states and sensory states like that
reciprocality happen, but I always wonder why, especially since we
did the mental action paper, how action states don't influence
internal states.<br/>
<br/>
1:20:34 Bleu:<br/>
And so for me, when
you take action, like when you practice playing the piano, that
affects your internal states totally, not just through external
states or even mental action like where you're doing nothing with
external states, it's entirely internal. And so I always wonder why
that action and internal is there, but I less so wonder why there's
not a reciprocal loop between external states and sensory states.
Like I never want the sensory states to go back to the external
states. For me, that doesn't make sense. And maybe you guys have an
example where it does make sense, but I always want the action and
internal states to loop together to have it bi directional.<br/>
<br/>
1:21:19
Daniel:<br/>
Here's one possibility on the sense back to external,
but it depends of course, on a specific interpretation of those. A
photon. Let's just assume it's out there. It hits the retina. If we
talk about the retina as a sense state, using it very loosely, not
the statistical variable correlating to the sense state, but the
actual retina, it's the absorption of the photon that changes the
niche to be sensed.<br/>
<br/>
1:21:47 Like if you're going to be
sensing molecules from the ants cuticle, you have to take some you
could sense from the ground the Ines that have already been
deposited. But if you want some from the thing, you have to take a
sample. And so that may whether that would be better understood as
being an action in the niche is another question. But like you do
have to change the external state to be have skin in the game. No,
and I just thought of it as you're saying that like the observer
phenomenon, right?<br/>
<br/>
1:22:18 Bleu:<br/>
So there's that too,
right? Just the act of sensing it chang. Kim or is the observer
phenomena, does that come from sense? Does that come from internal
states? Does it come from action states?<br/>
<br/>
1:22:33
Daniel:<br/>
Are the observers just acting in a way that might fit in
within an action state? But those are really interesting questions.
Dean. No, I just think you're right. I think both of you we're
getting closer.<br/>
<br/>
1:22:50 Dean:<br/>
I don't think we'll
ever fly directly into the sun, but we're getting warmer. Yeah. Cell
have another few minutes to talk. This has been a really great
discussion that I look forward to relistening to it and discussing
more. Then, of course, feel so appreciative that we have a dot two as
well, so we can return to some of our early ones free will.<br/>
<br/>
1:23:14
Daniel:<br/>
Maybe save it for the dot two. Or if we want to talk
about it now, I think we've blurred and fuzzed some of these lines a
little bit, so we did kind of get there. Let's see what else we had
down. And of course, if anyone in the last 30 minutes has any
questions, they want to write. So Stephen wrote, I like your method
to work backwards in the flow diagram.<br/>
<br/>
1:23:35 Start at
representative or nonrepresentative assumptions, or perhaps
conclusions like starting at those endpoints as assumptions, then
looking for prediction errors in our action perception. This
maintains uncertainty in ways that does not happen when following the
causal effective correlations.<br/>
<br/>
1:23:56 That's sort of like
20 Questions is framed as a game of, oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know
that mentioning common children's games was funny. That's framed as a
game of going from the most uncertain towards more certainty. Like if
you were asking uninformative questions, what are you doing? If
you're just getting and that's information theory kind of exemplified
you're reducing the set of what you can be guessing with the
preference to win within 20 questions. And then this is, as Steven is
pointing out, kind of the other dimension.<br/>
<br/>
1:24:37 But
then what does that look like? And that is almost inflating
uncertainty, at least in the information theory sense. So here's
Stephen's question and then either of you, if you have a thought on
this, do we model the temporal DAGs in dynamical change between
sensory state in relation to changes in action state?<br/>
<br/>
1:25:01
So maybe a related question would be how do active states and
temporal lags play into our modeling of action exteroception and
cognition?<br/>
<br/>
1:25:15 Dean:<br/>
That's why I kept saying,
young people, when in doubt, zoom in, zoom out. And it wasn't just
zoom in, zoom out in a sort of in a visual sense. You have to zoom in
and zoom out on a temporal sense as well.<br/>
<br/>
1:25:32 You have
to think about the unit of analysis both as an object, but also as
the length of time if something can remain stable or not.<br/>
<br/>
1:25:50
I don't think we're naturally inclined to include the time frame as
much as we're inclined to include the did it chang kim, it float, did
it burn? Whatever it is that we're waiting to see what happens next,
we don't tend to give as much attention over to how long did it
take?<br/>
<br/>
1:26:13 Daniel:<br/>
I'll give a complimentary
thought, which is more related to the kinds of models that we've
specifically seen in ActInf Lab, the deep temporal models or
sophisticated active inference in, for example, a three time step
model. At timestep one, it's doing inference. On one, two, and three,
that's learning as inference in anticipation. At timestep three, it
can still be calculating the model in light of incoming evidence
about time step one, two, and three, which is related to memory and
learning and all these other sorts of socalled, backwards looking
types of inference. So there's like, anticipation, there's now
casting, and then there's reconstruction of your recent and long term
past and how that's related to identity.<br/>
<br/>
1:27:01 So I
think the question do we or how do we model the temporal or just the
temporality of sense and action states? The answer from model based
science is, what's the time horizon parameter on the model that we
ran? Oh, it was 15 days. Okay, well, then we modeled the temporal lag
up to 15 days, and that is what we modeled. And that is sort of where
the scale free becomes the scale friendly, becomes the scale
specific, and then that's the most that it contracts down to is that
one specific model as deployed by those researchers.<br/>
<br/>
1:27:48
Here's another question from Stephen. When do we sense and when do we
act? When do our sense states update? When does our generative models
update, and when do our action states update? I'll start with the
model based science one, which is again, it would just be the
specifics of how the pseudocode and the actual computer code were
written.<br/>
<br/>
1:28:08 Which line of code updates first? That's
the narrow answer. But what about a more broader answer?<br/>
<br/>
1:28:17
Dean:<br/>
Does it depend on how open we are, how confident we are in
staying in an uncertain, nonspecific space? And can we necessarily
know going in how long that will be? I don't know. I don't know how
long. And what about cognition, right?<br/>
<br/>
1:28:44 Bleu:<br/>
Like,
if we expand to that possibility, I knew that was going to happen. I
mean, that happens to all of us. We all emergence. That like, oh, I
knew that was going to happen. Like, if I step on this ice cube, it's
going to like this ice pile, it's going to crack through to water or
whatever.<br/>
<br/>
1:29:00 I knew that was going to happen. So
we're able to kind of perceive things before they</font></font></font></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; orphans: 2; widows: 2; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font color="#0f0f0f"> <font face="Roboto, Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">happen.
And so I don't know, is there not necessarily the temporal
separation? This makes me think back to, like, Shannon Dobson and
like, the flattening of the time diamond, right? So really, like, is
it necessary that there is sequence here or can it just all be
happening simultaneously?<br/>
<br/>
1:29:27 That kind of relates to
what I was asking earlier to you. Is there some kind of simultaneous
update sensing action possibility? And I think that there is. I mean,
I don't think that not in a computational model because code just
runs like it is, but I think in our model it's possible.
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
1:29:49 Daniel:<br/>
Okay, one more general and then
more specific comment. The 4D spatial model tetrahedral cybernetics
geometry. You have space and time, four dimensions spatially
represented rather than the XYZ. You have three spatial dimensions.
And then there's like, the special question of how does t come into
play.<br/>
<br/>
1:30:06 So some is known there and some is not known
there, but when and where and how are of course very linked. And if
we take model based science seriously, then they're also very enabled
and constrained by the kinds of models we have. So maybe it's related
to how we think about geometry and then the sense and action. Are
they continuous or are they discrete? We've Dean Decety Costa at all
like the synthesis of active inference on discrete state spaces and
then we've also seen some of Alex Shance's work on the continuous
control settings with like the mountain car, which is not just the
discrete case.<br/>
<br/>
1:30:52 So it's just interesting to see how
some of the theory goes out in front and then there's parallel Ines
of mathematical development with continuous and discrete modeling
like digital and analog modeling. And sometimes those types of
modeling scientifically are very well reconciled and other times they
result in pretty fundamentally different patterns. Like there are
certain equations where the discretized form or the version that's
computed without really high precision numbers on a computer has
really different behavior than the other kinds of models, which gets
at the importance of thinking about how the model is framed and then
also applied. Because, like if the precision of the processor matters
for what the paper discovers, then shouldn't that be a part of the
consideration?<br/>
<br/>
1:31:44 Dean:<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
1:31:48
Daniel:<br/>
Okay, here's a few of the other comments for by the way
we'll write down any other questions. So if anyone in the last few
minutes has some questions they can ask and we'll be just writing
things down, getting excited for dot two and if anybody wants to join
who wasn't here today, they're also very welcome too.<br/>
<br/>
1:32:12
How is representation related to autopoeysis? So refresher autopoetic
system is capable of producing and maintaining itself by creating its
own parts. So how does representation differ? Or does it differ for a
system that is just engineered and secreted into the niche like a
computer versus potentially something that is reassembling its parts
continually? Why does that matter if it does?<br/>
<br/>
1:32:50
Dean:<br/>
Is that a thing to look at in .2? Daniel, that sounds
good. I'm not trying to push it on, but I mean, the reality is that
we can take each of the different segments, the organizational, the
structural, the content related, and then put them through the auto
poetic grinder and see what pops out the other side. Okay, great
suggestion. Apply this to the four columns.<br/>
<br/>
1:33:18
Daniel:<br/>
What other things would be fun to discuss in dot two or
what else can go through the four column grinder? Or what would be
any other question that any of you have.<br/>
<br/>
1:33:37 Dean:<br/>
In
the .2? Also we can spend a little bit of time on some of the
comments that were in the action five of the paper, specifically
around how we face state from potentially they didn't say that this
is true, but they said if this claim is true. We could be faced from
non representational, internal representation, maybe. Could we spend
a little bit of time not just looking at the autopoesis aspect of
that, but how does that density form in relationship to this idea of
modeling ourselves? Great question.<br/>
<br/>
1:34:19 Daniel:<br/>
Here's
a question that Steven wrote. So feel free to give a thought on it.
Or we can push it. It was will robotics or neuro phenomenology help
most in testing these complex temporal dynamics in a realist
way?<br/>
<br/>
1:34:42 Dean:<br/>
I'm just going to say that's a
great question and I think we need the person who asked the question
to come on and chat with us about that a little bit.<br/>
<br/>
1:34:52
Daniel:<br/>
We're just delegating so hard here. Bleu, go ahead. So
something that I've brought up, I think in the dot zero is like I
would really like to tease apart the similarities and differences
between structural aspects and content related aspects. I'm not
entirely certain, like, that's a fuzzy, blurred line for me there. So
maybe we could get into that a little bit more.<br/>
<br/>
1:35:22
Dean:<br/>
I agree. It's fuzzy for me too. These are awesome
questions too. Thanks for learning it's all. Bleu cell.<br/>
<br/>
1:35:30
Daniel:<br/>
We have multiple pages. We have auto policies from non
rep to rep and back and forth, whatever else. How does that form in
the concept of self representation? I think there's a few Hamlet
quotes that will come into play there. Then Stevens question about
technology and realism, structural and content action, action
oriented representation.<br/>
<br/>
1:35:57 The neurobehavioral
systems in the sensory motor loop, niche modification, stigma g and
the digital case, extended cognitive systems that include digital and
mirror active klaas. Stephan singing 80 songs in the chat, I believe.
Thinking through other minds and multi scale integration. One of
Simpsons other papers. How are they related?<br/>
<br/>
1:36:27 Does
the FEP exist independently or only in the mirror? Lot of ways to
answer that one.<br/>
<br/>
1:36:37 One part we could look into now
or maybe in the dot two would be the free expected free energy and
variational. Free energy and how they play different roles in the
FEP. These are also some things, like if people are watching live or
in the next few DAGs, then they can write a comment on it or get in
touch with us. Like if they want to submit a question or they can
come on and discuss it in the dot two too. Variational and expected
free energy.<br/>
<br/>
1:37:13 There's a lot of parts to the paper
and action oriented representation, we didn't get to that slide in
the dot zero, but just what is action oriented representation? We've
talked internal representation today, but then did we talk about
where we implicitly talking about action oriented representations?
Are those a sub class? How are they different.<br/>
<br/>
1:37:48
Bleu:<br/>
In our system? In human cognition, there are some hard
coded representations that we have, like actionoriented, maybe one of
them like kinesthetic memory and also like visual recognition
systems. And it's really interesting that and perhaps easy to apply
the FEP to specific cognitive systems like subsystems. But it's
really much more difficult when we have multiple competing processes.
Like we're not just playing the piano and we're not just looking at
the piano keys.<br/>
<br/>
1:38:32 We're doing both of those things
at the same time and lots of other things. Like we might be, you
know, having some memory of one time that we heard the song that
we're playing or something like that. So it's really interesting to
think about representation and all the ways that it exists also even
in memory, right? Like the memory representation not a hard coded
thing. It's really squishy and it's subject to change through
time.<br/>
<br/>
1:39:01 And we might remember a situation like you
can tell me your phone number right now and I'll remember it in five
minutes, but in five days, no, or something like that. So I don't
know. It's really interesting to think about the FEP and how it can
apply in this overarching way where there are multiple computing
goals and priorities.<br/>
<br/>
1:39:28 Daniel:<br/>
One thought I
hope I'm not misrepresenting an empirical result was in fruit fly the
Drosophila. They found that shortterm memories didn't require protein
synthesis like just second to seconds. Some sound or some symbol
could be associated with a preferred or repulsive outcome. But
preventing protein synthesis block the consolidation of memory and
perhaps that's similar to other systems. And so there's kind of like
the resonant neural structures that are just using the system's
connections as they are.<br/>
<br/>
1:40:07 That's sort of one
perhaps faster mode of cognition that's like running around figure
two. And then there's a restructuring that requires changing the
model like structure learning. But that also connects to realism
because we're talking about the synapses and the neurogenesis like of
specific cells that could be maybe measured and then the
neurophysiology and the behavior can be observed as well. If we have
interoceptive framework like Active, it also relates to Dean's
comment about the scales the Timescales will Chang Kim neural
circuits cannot be changing at a time scale faster than neural
firing. So how does the spiking component or the other sensory
transduction or other chemical components, how do those overlapping
active states coordinate?<br/>
<br/>
1:41:02 Bleu:<br/>
This reminds
me to Daniel of something that we talked about, like the very first
time we met because it was a recent experiment at that time about the
memory transfer between snails via interactions of RNA. So that was
like an interesting possible memory storage and I'm not sure what
else has developed from that. But also we've talked about ants and
how they leave. Like, you told me that they're just throwing up RNA,
like they're throwing up all the time all over the place and maybe
leaving chemical RNA traces for each other. We talked about that
too.<br/>
<br/>
1:41:39 So maybe I don't know if you want to expand
on that or does that tie into</font></font></font></p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; orphans: 2; widows: 2; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font color="#0f0f0f"> <font face="Roboto, Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">this
protein synthesis thing. One, I found that it was a recent ant paper
where basically the act of mating, which we won't describe on this
familyfriendly discussion directly, infuses neurotransmitters into
the recipient, and that changes their behavior and induces all these
other hormonal changes. And so the realism of cognition, like the
embodiment and the physicality of these systems, it is perturbable by
infusions of neurotransmitters in other neural systems and in us. So
that's sort of where realism can't be eradicated amidst all of these
representations because things do hit our head and molecules do
diffuse it's, kind of like grounding it. And that's, I think, why
it's such an interesting and integrative area with a lot of
contention, because the four E side is holding down that real side
and then the science side, socalled, is holding down the abstractions
and the representations.<br/>
<br/>
1:42:54 Daniel:<br/>
And then
cognitive science especially is applied to humans is kind of where it
meets in the middle. It's like, well, yeah, you're talking about
embedded cognition and active cognition, but that's your cognition
that's modeling. And so then you get all kinds of fun viewpoints and
ideas because of how mixed and complex that area is.<br/>
<br/>
1:43:27
Thanks Bleu and Dean and those who participated in Chat for this
really great discussion. I hope you can digest it and learn in the
next week and reflect on some of these questions. And anyone can ask
more questions or start to prepare some thoughts so that they can
also be involved, because this is really fun. All right, one
question. Yes.<br/>
<br/>
1:43:52 Dean:<br/>
Statement.<br/>
<br/>
1:43:55
Every one of these live streams. I don't know ultimately how it's
decided which order that we do them in, but the fact that we've gone
from Connor's paper to Madiz paper to this one, whether it was done
with some sort of intent and looking back to the future or it was
just, okay, well, I think we'll do this one next and see what
happens. I think the order of these last free papers in particular
has been pretty just. The order in which we've looked at them has
generated a whole bunch of interesting ideas, including sort of the
idea of intransitivity in the last paper now potentially influencing
how we've discussed this paper. So, again, I don't know how much
prethought goes into that, but if there was some prethought that went
into putting these papers in this particular order, it's been very
helpful.<br/>
<br/>
1:44:51 And one other thing. If I find something
happy because it's true, I'm going to laugh. And if I find something
happy because it's playing a game like 20 Questions or any game, I'm
going to laugh. So if I can't be if I can't enjoy and really
appreciate the sophistication of the conversation here, I probably
wouldn't show up. So thanks to both of you.<br/>
<br/>
1:45:21
Daniel:<br/>
You can make me read academic papers, but you can't make
me have fun. But just to give it one closing answer information for
anybody who wants to get involved with the discussions, here's our
Coda for the.com unit. And so here's the live stream table, the one
that gets represented on The Viewable, public one. So we have all the
papers planned, like in this case up till 373-8394 up through the end
of March. So we try to plan the papers in advance so that people can
have time to read them and commit to collaborating on the Dot zero
background video.<br/>
<br/>
1:45:55 And then we have papers to
potentially discuss. And so here people add papers and then they
click a heart. And Dean, we just sorted by hearts and then we picked
the papers that were on the four top papers and we said, okay, we're
going to read these four for 36, seven, eight, nine, those. And then
we emailed the authors and so we have different papers and we said
Cell, what dates might work, because we always will prefer to
schedule a paper that we want to read when the authors want to join.
And so that's kind of our first, like the way that we pull papers
out, like we set the dates for the Quantum Free Energy discussions in
March and then we work backwards from there.<br/>
<br/>
1:46:43 And
then just try to not do two, not even overlapping papers, just try to
provide rhythm and novelty and philosophy and technical details. So
it's sort of a local decision making based upon the votes that people
provide who are participating in the.com unit. And pretty random.
Yeah. And just what people surface?<br/>
<br/>
1:47:09 Dean:<br/>
I
was going to say that's a pretty serendipitous order then that's
fantastic. It's fine. And if anybody watching or listening wants to
suggest a paper for the Livestream, please do so. Yeah, alright.
Thank you, Dean.<br/>
<br/>
1:47:25 Daniel:<br/>
And Bleu. So see you
all next week for the Dot two. Bye.<br/>

Daniel:<br/>
Hello and welcome everyone. This is ActInf Lab
Livestream number 36 Dot Two. It's January 26, 2022. Welcome to
active inference lab. We are a participatory online lab that is
communicating, learning and practicing applied active
inference.<br/>
<br/>
00:46 You can find us at the links here on this
page. This is a recorded and an archived livestream, so please
provide us with feedback so we can improve our work. All backgrounds
and perspectives are welcome and we'll be following good video
etiquette for live streams. Check Active Inference.org if you want to
learn more about what Active Lab is up to or if you want to
participate in any of the activities which include live streams in
the Communications organizational unit. But a ton of other stuff is
happening today in 36.2, our third discussion on 36, we're going to
continue to learn and discuss this paper by Sims and Pezzulo 2021,
modeling Ourselves What the Free Energy Principle Reveals about Our
Implicit Notions of Representation.<br/>
<br/>
01:39 And we're going
to have a nice jumping off dot two as we do and have some questions
written down and prepared, other things will spontaneously arise. And
if anyone watching Live wants to just write a question in a live
chat, we can also address that. We'll start with an introduction. So
we'll go around and introduce ourselves. People can say anything they
want and they can also add just what got them excited about the paper
in general or for this dot two discussion specifically.<br/>
<br/>
02:15
So I'm Daniel, I'm a researcher in California and just excited to see
how this representation discussion influences our own self
representation and that at the individual and the lab scale. Moving
forward. I'll pass it to Bleu.<br/>
<br/>
02:40 Bleu:<br/>
Hi. I'm
Bleu. I'm an independent research consultant in New Mexico, and I am
excited by this paper because in our previous discussions, we're as
usual, left with more questions than answers. And also I kind of am
finding myself like, swayed by the different internal representation,
structural contentdriven, internal representation, like these
different arguments, and I just find them very interesting. And I
just want to know if at the end of this, if I'll be swayed more or
less in certain directions or maybe just be more open to other
interpretations of SAP.<br/>
<br/>
03:17 And I will pass it to
Danielle.<br/>
<br/>
03:22 Danielle:<br/>
Hello, I'm Danielle. I'm a
cognitive scientist at Google with a background in language
evolution, language development. I'm really interested in thinking
about how humans evolve, the ability to model other minds. So
interested in how this discussion can contribute to that and
generally interested in how really good frameworks like the FEP can
help kind of encompass other frameworks and revise them.
Awesome.<br/>
<br/>
03:51 Daniel:<br/>
Dean.<br/>
<br/>
03:54
Dean:<br/>
Hi, I'm Dean. I'm up here in Calgary in Canada, and a
little bit of recency effect. I started watching Ozark the plant
season. And so I'm trying to plug this paper into what would Marty
bird do? So that's kind of my little twist on modeling.<br/>
<br/>
04:13
So back to you, Daniel, who is. Marty Bird and what would he do?
Right? Exactly.<br/>
<br/>
04:25 Daniel:<br/>
Great question. Well,
that's all we prepared for today. So we'll go into the discussion,
but we have some things written down. Is there anything just off the
bat that anybody wants to just ask or jump into or like a figure or a
quotation to begin with? Or we can look at some of the things that we
had written down.<br/>
<br/>
04:50 Okay, let's just start with what
we've written down and then of course, at any point we can branch
off.<br/>
<br/>
04:58 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
05:01 I think a big theme that
we will probably return to again and again is this idea of moving
back and forth from representational forms to representational forms.
In the paper they introduce four different facets of representation
and then how each of those facets can be approached in a
representational or non representational way. And although the image
here shows some solid black lines, that was kind of the discussion
was is there movement across these area or blurriness? So maybe Dean,
what is theorem to say or start to explore with representations
emerging like almost precipitating or crystallizing out of something
non representational and then the reverse process of something that
is more representational submerging back into something that's less?
Well, one of the things the authors did talk quite a bit about in
terms of the functional aspect of this was the vicarious
nature.<br/>
<br/>
06:12 Dean:<br/>
And then they also talked quite a
bit about whether or not somebody who's story of moving in that
radical enactivism space still has to be able to differentiate and
get some include some of the temporal aspects of what might pop up
and become something that we can stabilize in model representation
form. But then it has to also be able to disappear. Right. It also
has to not necessarily consume everything in terms of our attentional
field. So I'm not really sure exactly how that works itself
through.<br/>
<br/>
06:55 But I would think that it's difficult to
say that even if we're in a flow state that there isn't some moment
when we do reflect in that mirror. So that's kind of where I'm at. I
don't have any answers per se, but I don't want to get stuck in the
idea that it's just an on off switch. I think that there's a bit of a
moment of dimming and then rerelighting.<br/>
<br/>
07:29
Daniel:<br/>
That makes me think about certain paths that our thought
takes over these eight cells. Like when we're in the representational
side, when we're dealing with the representation, how do we take that
tetrahedra and look at the four different sides? And then how do we
stay within a column looking at just the organizational aspects of a
system and then move north and south on that?<br/>
<br/>
08:02 Do
these kinds of knowledge or cognitive transitions happen all the
time? Do they have other names that might be more familiar than using
some of this philosophical language? Like what is it? Are there any
times in our days where we're dealing with something
representationally and we shift to a non representational version
within one of these categories or across categories.<br/>
<br/>
08:39
Bleu:<br/>
So I was just thinking of that actually.<br/>
<br/>
08:43
What does variational an organizational representation look like?
That is like a map, like a structural representation, a content
related representation and a functional representation. And like what
do internal representation look like and how are they different? I
was thinking about that.<br/>
<br/>
09:08 Daniel:<br/>
Let's go to
the definition of the organizational representation just to kind of
remember the fact that FEP requires internal states, states that
encode the recognition model that are statistically separated from
the external reality. So the organizational area is about how
variables inside of systems are separated from variables outside of
the system. The pro representation take is there's an evidentiary
boundary, the Markov blanket and there's something on the inside that
is doing something like a representation on what's outside. So that's
the internal representation take. Then the internal representation
take is where we get into the biological and the inactivist
perturbation.<br/>
<br/>
10:22 And that's where the authors say that
some have approached this Markov blanket structure formalism, even
though we're talking about it in the organizational, not the
structural facet in a manner that suggests a representational
view.<br/>
<br/>
10:39 And they argue that just partitioning two
coupled systems like agent and environment with a Markov blanket
doesn't imply that the behavior of the agent is explained by anything
related to an internal model that's doing anything like capturing the
structure of the outside world.<br/>
<br/>
11:05 Bleu:<br/>
So you
just use organizational and structure in this big hot knob. My
question was really what does an organizational representation look
like? And so I'm hearing that you answered that there are clearly
defined boundaries in organizational representation or partitions
between internal and external states. So like I have a clearly when I
have a representation in my mind that's organizational it is like
your boundary different from like is it only your own boundary or is
it like the boundaries of each individual agent? Are organizationally
represented in your mind or is it just the boundary between you and
the outside world?<br/>
<br/>
11:50 And how might that differ from
structure and content related? Like what do these different
representations look like? That's what I'm trying to see. Would they
be mass and how would the math be different?<br/>
<br/>
12:04
Daniel:<br/>
The structure which does come up several times in the
organizational definition, so we see structure coming up, the
structure of the system in how it's organized. But what is the
structural specifically? Okay, internal representation vehicles that
are structurally similar to the state of affairs in the world that
they stand for.<br/>
<br/>
12:37 The internal representation
structural side is kind of like the good regulator theorem of
cybernetics. So the organizational side is highlighting that there is
some sort of informational encapsulation, we might even say like our
previous discussions, but some sort of organization of variables such
that there's an inside and an outside that area separated. And the
structural side is saying that it's like if there's three things that
are connected in the outside world then not just that there are
variables that area organizationally separated in the internal
states, but that the structure of those isolated variables is going
to do something like recapitulate or have a structural resemblance to
the generative process. Generative process, that's like the niche,
that's what's outside generative model, that's what the agent has on
board. And so if it's to be useful for control purposes,</span></span></span></font></font></font></span></p>

<font face="Roboto, Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">then
it may have to have some sort of structure resemblance to the actual
connectivity of the generative process.<br/>
<br/>
13:50 So
generative model and generative process being separated is what's
captured in the organizational side. Them having similar resemblances
or similar structures is what the structural side is. The structural
non representationalism are suggesting. This is I think, tail of two
densities with Ramsette at all or modeling ourself. The authors
suggests that generative model do not meet the requirements of
internal representation because the process of exploitable structural
representations so posterior beliefs in the entity is enacted and so
it doesn't necessarily have to recapitulate the force of the
generative process.<br/>
<br/>
14:42 So maybe one could be skilled in
the performance of driving without having variable connected in the
way that a car pieces are connected.<br/>
<br/>
15:07 It comes back
to a theme that active presents to us perhaps more as a question than
an answer, which is how much do we have to know in order to act? Do
we have to have an internal model that is very similar to the
process, uncorrelated in how similar it is, anticorrelated in how
similar it is? And can we have a framework as researchers that helps
us compare the structure and organization of generative processing
processing and generative models of those process?<br/>
<br/>
15:52
Noise go 14. So I'll put this out there and then people push back or
say it doesn't make any sense from what I read in the paper now
because I had to go back over and look at it again. If I were to try
to draw a simple comparison between organization and structure
organization, you could see it as being something, as being either in
or out. So you could be inside a cell or outside of a cell. Then in
our mind we can tell.<br/>
<br/>
16:26 Dean:<br/>
We will draw those
partitions and then we'll decide what's in or out. Structural I think
takes on more of the entailing questions. Something that's all
brought up in the That. Which is so once you've decided whether
something is in or not. Is there something else that now can be seen
as being superordinate to that from the perspective of sort of what's
wrapped around now the thing that's in or what can sit upon
theoretically the thing That you've now decided is foundational to
whatever it is you're looking at and what can be set aside as not
being important to what you're looking at.<br/>
<br/>
17:08 So again,
pull that apart and say that that's wrong, but that's kind of what I
try to read into what the readers or what the writers were saying. So
it's just my interpretation. Thanks Bleu. So I just wonder in this
organizational representation is if you draw a distinction between I
mean, clearly there's one between what's internal and external to
yourself. But are you also trying to draw distinctions between what's
internal and external to your computer or your refrigerator or your
best friend or your child?<br/>
<br/>
17:46 Bleu:<br/>
Are you making
a representation of everything that's internal and external to every
other thing or is it only with respect to your own self versus
environment? I would think it's when you do that, I don't know that
it's implied that you do it all the time, but if you choose to do
that, I think that that's something that's pretty easy to tell the
difference around. So again, I'm not sure that they were saying that
we do this, we do always constantly doing this. But I think what they
were trying to do is show the difference between knowing when
something's in or out versus knowing when something's first or second
from a structural standpoint. Again, I don't want to put words in the
office truth, but I did hear that in the words that they were doing
to try to parse those two things and give each their due as opposed
to saying they're just the same thing overlapping.<br/>
<br/>
18:51
Daniel:<br/>
Let's try one little thought loop. So let's start switch
blue's question of what does an variational representation look like?
So we'll start in that very top left cell and then shift the focus
towards the structural components and then challenge the structural
representation but stay within the structural domain and then see if
that can result to us making it back to a internal representation
organizational framing. So what's something that is classic vanilla
organizational representation? Well, that's something that is well
separated in terms of variables inside and outside the system.<br/>
<br/>
19:41
So we're not worried about the structure of the variables inside or
outside, just that they are separated. So computers seem like pretty
clear cases where within a program you could have variables that by
design are separated through an intermediate variable. Or computers
and hardware like two computer systems could be totally separated
except for an interface like a USB port or something. But of course
this paper is about that strange loop when it's a cognizing agent, an
adaptive active inference agent doing that representing not
necessarily a mere active agent, but should we use a computational
example or some sort of active human example? You got a good example
right here on the page.<br/>
<br/>
20:46 Dean:<br/>
So how would we
shift across the y axis between organizational representational?
Because I'm assuming we're going clockwise from two representational
structure. That's not a hard example to make. Yes.<br/>
<br/>
21:07
Daniel:<br/>
So in the human case, this would be like two humans in a
conversation. They are in a conversation. Yes. Perfect. Outside of
the conversation.<br/>
<br/>
21:23 Yes. When two humans are in
conversation there is separation in terms of their sensory motor
system. So we have check the box for organizational representational
starting in the top left cell. Alright. Now the question would be is
there structure representation?<br/>
<br/>
21:48 So that would be
like maybe if one person thought of a sentence and then said it and
then the other person thought of that sentence too, would that
qualify as a structural representation because there's a structural
resemblance in the model of the two conversions.<br/>
<br/>
22:11
Dean:<br/>
Yeah, we could also find out if both of us were talking at
the same time and suddenly stopped turntaking that the structure of
that model would now fundamentally change it's internal
representation and two people arguing over top of one another to the
third party isn't necessarily something comprehendible, never mind to
the two people that area inside the conversation. Right.<br/>
<br/>
22:41
Daniel:<br/>
Bleu. So when I think about conversation, something
comes to mind recently, like really you need to have like the order
of the language specified. Like my son is reading now and he's five,
he's taken the book like pop on top, the doctor sees book and he'll
turn it upside down and he'll say dodge no doe and Cell read it that
way. And then he wants to read every sentence backwards, like from
the end to the beginning. Which I'm like, I don't care as long as
you're reading because Bit gets a practicing reading.<br/>
<br/>
23:10
Bleu:<br/>
But it's completely the context is completely different
when you're reading each word in the opposite order. So when you're
talking about a structure representation of a conversation, I think
that there needs to be a literal representation or at least like a
course grained representation of in what order things are said in
order to glean some kind of learning. But then are we bleeding into
the content related?<br/>
<br/>
23:37 That's why I really feel like
what are these different maps look like? And trying to maybe
elucidate what the representations are is valuable because I think
when you have organization inside, outside, like this is the sentence
or he said this and she said that or whatever and then you story to
put structure on it, that gives it them content or context and so on
and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
24:03 Dean:<br/>
Dean no, I don't have much
to add to that other than I just don't think that this loop that
we've just selected, this we said there was going to be a certain
amount of randomness in the last livestream and we've chosen this.
Now let's walk, let's walk through it. I don't see it being difficult
to follow that path and find examples. So we have a superordinate
right now structurally we want to carry out this directionality from
the representational side of things to the internal representation
side. And Bleu if your kid wants to turn the book upside down, that's
actually a feature, right?<br/>
<br/>
24:48 Because they're not
already stuck in this only one way of doing it thing. Yeah. Let'S
complete the red loop and then the green and orange will come to
play. Okay, so we started with two people in conversation that's
organizational separation of cognition. This brings us to the
structural facet which is where there's a structural resemblance
action, action, action oriented representation conversants.<br/>
<br/>
25:19
Daniel:<br/>
So maybe it is the case where they're both thinking
about a similar topology of variables. So there's some structural
representation but now let's stay within the structure column, go
from B to C. Okay, so the two people are in a conversation, it's kind
of like a dance. So what if those two people's representation is so
different that it's actually not structurally resembling. So maybe
one person is the more experienced in the discipline and the other is
less emergence.<br/>
<br/>
25:56 Like one person is super good at
fixing motors, the other person just has no idea. So the
representationalism take would be like cell they're both thinking
about the motor. But then when we start to see a cognitive asymmetry
all of a sudden we fall out of internal representation between these
two system because their cognitive models don't necessarily have
similar structure. Yes, Danielle unmute then go for it. So I might be
missing something here but I thought that we can only start to talk
about the structural dimension here once.<br/>
<br/>
26:40
Danielle:<br/>
In this example the two people in the conversation are
representing</span></span></span></font></font></font></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; orphans: 2; widows: 2; margin-bottom: 0in">
<span style="font-variant: normal"><font color="#0f0f0f"><span style="letter-spacing: normal">
<font face="Roboto, Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">the
same thing and then the question is how much information or how does
each of internal representation do each of internal representation
have to look similar to one another but like parse of it has to be
that they area representing the same thing. Is that sort of necessary
component? If they're not representing the same thing then we're
having a different conversation.<br/>
<br/>
27:09 Daniel:<br/>
Well,
that may come to the functional, that might come to the content
related like the novice and the expert, the representations are both
about the online but they're so structurally different in their
representation of the engine. So that although the content in the
aboutness of the representation is similar so still qualifying as a
representation in that sense there is a structural non resemblance
such that by that criteria in that saturation value fallen out of the
representational cell B into something internal representation
potentially Bleu. What do you think? So I think two people in this
conversation can be trying to represent the same thing. Yes, they
both need to be trying to represent have the same
representation.<br/>
<br/>
28:11 Bleu:<br/>
Like they're trying to
converge on a conversation, a meaningful conversation presumably, but
they don't always converge and then that's where you get like
understanding or we both think that we think the same, we both agree
that we're thinking that we have the same structural representation
but perhaps they're different and then the communication breaks
down.<br/>
<br/>
28:36 Daniel:<br/>
Okay, so the structures are so
different that we're recognizing it as a continuum from total overlap
of structural resemblance to total nonoverlap. But it would be
important to specify that null hypothesis. So we've kind of scooted
into C how do we stay in that space of, like, the novice and the
expert who have different cognitive representations and then use that
to challenge even organizational representationalism first and then
Bleu go ahead. All right. I want to just go back to Daniel's
point.<br/>
<br/>
29:22 Dean:<br/>
So if we're structure a
conversation, normally we turntake, but if we're playing in a band,
we're all playing at once and then we stopped playing. So I think we
can start with structure, too. It's just deciding how we want to
signal. Right. So I don't think there's necessarily an order that we
have to start with organization first.<br/>
<br/>
29:46 We can
actually start with structure first as well. Yeah. And I think a
conversation is a particularly challenging example because we're
representing two things. Bit we're representing what the other person
is trying to say and then presumably what the conversation is about
is something else in the world. That we could be representing.<br/>
<br/>
30:03
Exactly. Yeah. Bleu so I think we're representations a degree of
information sharing, and I think that this is going to lump into
autopolysis, which I've been really wanting to kind of get into. Bit
when we have, like, I'm my own person and I'm communicating with
Daniel from 50 0 mile away, we both feel like we're getting on the
same page. When we actually do get on the same page, like, do we form
some kind of, like, separate cognitive unit?<br/>
<br/>
30:36
Bleu:<br/>
At what degree of model overlap? Is the degree of
information sharing so high that then we are worthy of our own?
Markov like it we're sure that we understand that we are the same
unit. Right. And I think that this idea of self ensemble and
information sharing and model overlap, I think that there's an
important path to traverse down this way.<br/>
<br/>
31:02 Because if
you don't have full overlap of the model or do you need full overlap
to form a self assembling system to form a higher level? It's just an
interesting thought.<br/>
<br/>
31:16 Daniel:<br/>
That'S kind of
where the C to D transition takes us, which would be like so we have
the drummers waiting for this and has a model resembling this, and
then the singer has a totally different structure. And then when we
think about the whole cognitive system, it doesn't deny what we
recognize in A that there still is, like, the sensory motor
separation, but we've teacher that point by those people or roles
being part of a larger, nonseparable extended cognitive system. So
almost by recognizing the interactions. So here we focused on the
separation in A, and that's what granted us the representational
cell, but we've returned to seeing that partial information
encapsulation within some type of broader structure where none of the
entities have, like, the band levels representation. So hopefully
other people can think of other, like, ABCD examples, but when we
were at B, we kind of started branching off into, like, about the
content related things.<br/>
<br/>
32:44 The aboutness. So here two
people do have a structure resemblance in their internal model and
it's about the same thing. But then what if one person sees the about
us in such a different way that again we fall out of the content
related representation and then how would we move from there back to
C where all of a sudden the recognition model in a sense don't have
structural representations resemblance because they're about
different things now.<br/>
<br/>
33:32 Danielle. So would this be
like in the case of two things that are so analogous that they share
a lot of structural similarities and things of like dedicator's work
that you can actually draw lines between the individual aspects of
the concepts but they could be about totally different things. But
two people talking about these things can form some sort of
structural similarity in the representation and it's just like an
entry point into being able to think about all other things. But the
about this really has nothing to do with it.<br/>
<br/>
34:12 Dean I
might want to ask me on that. Yeah, I don't know if this answers
that, Daniel, but from my space I'm thinking active inference
between, say, a distracted driver who's looking down at their phone
between the seats and somebody who's got that information in a
HeadsUp display on their windshield, right? So content twice, but
structurally presented one as one as a distracted state and one as a
contiguous state. So I don't know if that answers your point, but I
think we know the difference, right, in terms of where the content is
structure and how we're trying to contextualize each matter.<br/>
<br/>
35:02
Again, staying with a sort of educational setting, what is it
important to see a transference or a new emergence of is it that the
structural model of the learner is moving into more resemblance with
the teacher? Is it that the aboutness of the learner is moving
towards the same aboutness of the teacher? Or let's just remind about
what the functional is supporting vicarious use before or in the
absence of external events. So does the teaching conversation. Will
it be a functional representation when vicariously without the
teacher, the student can carry out what the teacher could do, which
might be having aboutness or not.<br/>
<br/>
36:09 It might be with a
structure cocktail of resemblance or not. It might involve total
informational isolation putting a squarely in a or it might involve
some type of challenging of that in D.<br/>
<br/>
36:31 The reason
why there's not going to be, I think, a precise answer because as the
paper lays out, even for the same scenario, people do have different
perspective. So it's not like we're trying to take a scenario then
classify it into cell that one's like an abeg or an ace. That is
probably not what one of the outcomes could be. But these are all
perspectives that we could take on a given scenario and they do
reveal interesting things about the systems of studies.<br/>
<br/>
37:11
Anything else to add on this? Sort of like looping around the cells
or should we push on?<br/>
<br/>
37:25 Dean:<br/>
Push, push. Okay,
Bleu. What were you thinking here? I was just taking notes. So maybe
we should talk about concept related and function.<br/>
<br/>
37:41
Bleu:<br/>
So I was just taking notes on what the organizational,
like, how are the representations and I was trying to draw a picture.
So I will draw my picture if you will talk about maybe functional
representation, what does the functional representation look like or
content related, what's inside of those? And then I will draw my
picture and then you can show it. I'll draw bit while you area
talking. Sure.<br/>
<br/>
38:05 Daniel:<br/>
So the content related
is whether the generative model need to explicitly model the ways
external states produce operations, environmental models, or the ways
actions produce sensations. Is it really important that internal
states resemble external states or is it sufficient that they afford
accurate action control?<br/>
<br/>
38:42 So let's just say there's a
spotlight that's shining photons onto the eye. The content of the
cognition representation would put us more we'd be more internal
representation camp if the recognition model were truly explicitly
modeling the ways in which the photons hit the retina. Maybe, but
this ore is a bit challenging because the ways actions produce
sensations, that could be a model of like well, if I blink it becomes
darker and when I open my eyes it's lighter. But that's a totally
disjoint question from understanding how a spotlight works.<br/>
<br/>
39:39
But those two scenarios of the spotlight's, cognitive explicit
modeling, the environmental model or the sensory motor model of
blinking and becoming darker, those are both content related and Dean
cell. I don't know if this helps or not, but one of the things that I
used to bring up around this idea was the puzzle concept. So you got
a box and it says 1000 piece puzzle and when you open up the box is
internal representation or is it not representational until you
figure out whether all thousand pieces have now been duly assembled.
Right. So from a content perspective, do you have what you need in
order to be able to tell the difference between something which
internal representation and that which is not?<br/>
<br/>
40:44
Dean:<br/>
So again, I don't</span></span></span></font></font></font></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; orphans: 2; widows: 2; margin-bottom: 0in">
<span style="font-variant: normal"><font color="#0f0f0f"><span style="letter-spacing: normal">
<font face="Roboto, Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">know
if that's helpful in terms of sort of trying to see a difference
between that, say, instructor like where it's placed relative to the
context or not. But that was the way I tried to surface. It. One
evolution or handshake that hinges on that or of the environmental
models and the sensory motor models, they do unpack a little bit. So
one approach consists in starting from the sensory motor
models.<br/>
<br/>
41:21 Daniel:<br/>
So that would be when I blink
it becomes darker. When my eyes are open, it's lighter, but
progressively extends them to incorporate extra variables that
describe external causes of sensation. So like if there's a light on
one side but not on the other side, then it can be the case that that
blinking is true no matter how. You're turned. But then that could be
enriched or augmented with a model of parameters that describes
external causes of sensation.<br/>
<br/>
41:55 Like there's a light
over there and not over there. And so actually that little loop that
we just took was from the sensory motor B, the sensory motor model in
B moving to internal representation model of the content. Like
there's a light over there and then does That cell at least that was
the BTE move, but then maybe that could do something else. So maybe
cell clarify there. But let's go back to just review functional, like
what is the functional and it's good to revisit these in the 01234
five because it's the contribution of the paper and maybe there are
other facets, other columns to add and there's just a lot of
complexity even as this is so the functional one is about supporting
vicarious use before or in the absence of external events.<br/>
<br/>
43:05
So in that story with the lights and the blinking, that model only
has to be instantiated while in that room with the photons hitting
the eye and the blinking happening. However, we can imagine a
situation that's vicariously detached or before That setting like
what would happen if there were a light over here and a light over
here and it was the case that blinking made it darker.<br/>
<br/>
43:39
And this is where they trace back to PSA that representations should
vicariously stand for something external in their absence and afford
vicarious operations.<br/>
<br/>
43:56 So there's a light over on the
left side, you reach over and you unscrew it. What is in your hands
now that is seeming to be in the functional facet? Because we're
talking about the role the representation is playing and the fact
that it is standing for something external in the absence. There's no
physical light that we're talking about. It's not like we're
unscrewing it and then verifying that it's in our hands who's for and
against that?<br/>
<br/>
44:49 What functional roles do internal
model models play during free energy minimization? And does
minimization require the internal manipulation of variable in ways
that resemble vicarious operating point? The classical PSA account of
representation?<br/>
<br/>
45:13 Yes, Bleu. So this might be like, I
don't know, maybe it's the easiest and also like the hardest to get a
grip on. So I think about if we have a representation of internal
variables that are functional, like a functional representation of a
functional internal representation, is this like doing like you
manipulate the variables internally and then manipulate them
externally. Like you plan to reach for the cup to take a drink of
water and then you reach for the cup to take a drink of water. But
you have to have like the internal expectation prior to or maybe
simultaneous with the external expectation.<br/>
<br/>
45:59 Bleu:<br/>
Is
that like functional representation? Like do you plan the action and
do the action maybe separate or maybe together? Is that what
functional representation looks like? Let's go with a reaching for
the cup because as Daniel noted, like conversation, improvised,
spontaneous conversation of reflexive entities is one of the hardest
cases but it's the one that we have. So that's awesome.<br/>
<br/>
46:31
Daniel:<br/>
But we're going to be talking about an adaptive active
inference agent reaching for a mere active inference agent. So in the
Sims other paper we discussed now we're talking about the case of
unidirectional integration rather than the multi scale reciprocal
integration. So the person is separated from the cup. There's a
separation of the cognitive model of the agent from the cup. The
structural side, if the internal model is cuplike or it features a
cup variable touching a table variable and then another edge that is
engaged of the hand touching the cup for example, that might be a
structure similarity.<br/>
<br/>
47:16 But I think that's part of the
debate is how could there be a structural similarity when it's not a
cup in your brain which we mind of talked about last time? Like how
could you have something that structurally resembles a car if it's
your brain and body? The concepts related encoding, environmental
contingencies or sensory motor contingencies. So it could be the case
that a certain sensory motor action will result in picking up and
grasping the cup whereas another sensory motor action is going to
result in the shattering of the cup. And that could be analyzed in
terms of correctness.<br/>
<br/>
47:55 The functional
representational question would be like the vicarious detachments of
the sensory motor loop from the cognition. So then it would be like
if you were to pick up that cup, then you dumped it, what would
happen? And then someone says like water would fall out. So in that
case it is like there's a functional representation whether or not it
resembles the structure of the cup. There's a functional
representation because That idea of grasping the cup it's able to be
operated on internally vicariously in the salience of direct stimuli
related to the cup.<br/>
<br/>
48:42 Dean. Do you mind if I just read
right from the paper for a second because I think it helps in terms
of this difference between the sort of the automaticity and
reflective aspects of this action. Okay. One important implication
falling out of this diagnosis is that when considering functional
rural aspects it's often how the details of our chosen process theory
are fleshed out and contextualized by the kinds of cognitive
phenomena that we are attention to account for that skew our
interpretation of FEP in one direction or another. For
examples.<br/>
<br/>
49:30 Dean:<br/>
1 may consider that there are
core aspects of FEP such as the possession of a Markov blanket and
more ancillary acts aspects and I think ancillary is the key here.
Such as the possibility but not the necessity to engage in
counterfactual inference which is only required for planning and it
is only the latter more ancillary aspects that call for internal
representation interpretation under a given process theory. This
would imply that when using functional role as the sole criterion for
representational processes. Only some FEP agents, namely those that
can engage in counterfactuals forms of inference, would meet the
criteria for representation. It is only this subset of FEP agents
that would be equated to fullfledged predictive processing
agents.<br/>
<br/>
50:20 So there is an automaticity part to this
where it's really not a Markov blanket. You just do it almost
subconsciously. And that's again, the authors are trying to point
this out. Yes, if we fail, I dropped the cup and now I reflect on
that. That's the representational piece.<br/>
<br/>
50:39 But prior
to That, I was just going through the motions. I didn't need a set of
interactions telling me to reach out for the cue. So that's just in
the author's words. Thanks a lot for clarifying that. It's like, yes,
if one is reflexively grasping at it or accidentally then grasping
the cup, like if you're groping around in a dark room and then you
Kappel to graph the cup, it doesn't have to internal representation
because there isn't a counterfactuals.<br/>
<br/>
51:25 Daniel:<br/>
And
that's very interesting how they say that it is ancillary. So that's
kind of like a secondary or not essential to it because we can
imagine an active inference entity that's taking insensary
observation updating its generative model, engaging in policy
selection and then resulting in some action output impacting the
niche, and the cycle begins again, that can be just like a single
layer model that doesn't engage in counterfactuals. But they raise
that notion that it's only the counterfactuals in cognition that
actually give us the space to have a functional representation. It's
like if the shell just represents the shell can't be anything else.
But then there's another kind of entity who can see the shell as
financial or can see it in a different way.<br/>
<br/>
52:28 And then
it's those counterfactuals that enable the shell to play a functional
representational role in that it stands for something else. Bleu.
What is this imagery on the bottom? So I just was like trying to
really look at or try to visualize what would these different
representations really look like? If we take the idea of two, a
person and a cup, even right on the first one, we have
variational.<br/>
<br/>
53:02 Bleu:<br/>
So, like, I am a thirsty
body. I'm contained within me there is a cup that contains water over
there. Like, I know my boundary. I know the boundary of the cue. And
the representation looks like this.<br/>
<br/>
53:15 And then a
structural representation is just me and the cup and my relationship
between me and the cup. So do I have to also have my real question
here is do these perhaps build on one another? So here you have the
structural and then the next one would be content related. Do I also
have to have this connecting line in the content related? Is that
required?<br/>
<br/>
53:47 Like, do I have to have an idea of the
structure to understand the content? And then in the functional,
like, do you need to know the content and the structure and the
organizational to have to have an understanding of the function, do I
need to know like the content related? Like I know that there's water
in the cup, right?</span></span></span></font></font></font></span></p>

<font face="Roboto, Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">I
assume that there's water in the cup. To find out, I have to realize
that there's an inside of me and outside of me and inside of the cup
and outside of the cup I have to realize my relationship between me
and the cup.<br/>
<br/>
54:19 And then to find out the content. Like
I have to go sample the cup to see what's inside of bit and I just
know what's inside of me and then the function. I wonder if there's
water in that cup and then if I go to drink it and there's like
whiskey in it or something. Like I'm not going to understand the
function until I have all those things layered on top of each other.
And so that's kind of really my question here and Daniel's drawing
all my drawings.<br/>
<br/>
54:45 But really I just wonder if there's
levels of increasing complexity between these different kinds
internal representation or if it's just merely the structure, the
organizational and I don't need these boundaries between self and cup
in these other models. Maybe it's just the line without the circles
in the structure or the no external circles and content related. So I
just want to know like what you guys maybe think of that, if there is
a layering here because I was kind of layering them up, but I don't
know if that's really the right mental representation. Thanks, Bleu.
Dean.<br/>
<br/>
55:28 Dean:<br/>
I'm not muted good. A few I think
there's two parts to this. One is that we are able to differentiate
which is what the table allows for. And I think That, the second part
is the curved arrow that Daniel drew which essentially represents
boundary crossing number one. So the difference between something
that's static and something that is translatable and then the second
part of it, I think without going back down the rabbit hole that we
almost fell into in the .1 of this when we started talking about free
will and can and will and the orthogonal piece of that.<br/>
<br/>
56:09
I think what it speaks to maybe is that it's not a question of free
or encapsulated, it's a degree of independent question when you throw
that curved online on this sort of tiled representation and start
moving across a boundary. So I don't want to call it degrees of
dependency will up to a point of passing through zero. But I'd like
to because I think there is an aspect of that and that's why I think
it's kind of crazy if we just focus on the static things instead of
the moving around the moving through four squares is what I really
think gives our minds a good workout. Yes. So here's another little
workout.<br/>
<br/>
57:02 Daniel:<br/>
So Bleu had two circles in
relationship. So here the circle is going to reflect in adaptive
active inference agents or the fullfledged predictive processing
agent, one that can engage in counterfactuals. So the top is two
adaptive entities in relationship and the triangle is going to
reflect a active reference distinctions like a cup or just something
that doesn't engage in counterfactuals. So organizational is the
separation of the systems. So that's very similar because it's just
describing there being a Markov blanket separating the
systems.<br/>
<br/>
57:42 The structural representation is having
vehicles that area structurally similar. So it's simple. Er in the
lower case triangle out there in the world, is there a structural
resemblance that would be very representational, whereas if they were
cognitively imagining something different than a triangle, that would
have less resemblance. But that gets challenging with adaptive,
adaptive because we're modeling ourselves, modeling each other, blah,
blah, blah. So here's them modeling the conversation and that's where
there's sort of like very complex dynamics, which is how can we have
a structural similarity about a conversation with another
person.<br/>
<br/>
58:24 But it's simpler. In the adaptive mirror
case, the action oriented representation encode environmental
contingencies or sensory motor contingencies. So like in this case,
the triangle, it is the case that it can rotate clockwise. And so
this entity does have a good content related representation if it can
actually turn the dial to that way. And again, that's a little bit
more complex in the reciprocal case.<br/>
<br/>
58:58 But in the
unidirectional case, this red arrow is a contentrelated
representation of the actual motion in the world. And then this last
case is the functional representation and here it could be more
structural. So like more about the actual structure of a cognitive
model or it could be more about the encoding of the contingencies.
But the key piece is this isolation, which isn't a Markov isolation.
This is actually the true vicarious separation of so here the person
or the entity is able to engage in either structural pondering of the
triangle or functional pondering of the triangle in the absence of
seeing the triangle or grasping the triangle.<br/>
<br/>
59:50 And
again, though that's a little bit complex when you have multiple
counterfactual cognizers asking each other questions. I decided to
counterfactuals.<br/>
<br/>
1:00:06 Yeah, exactly. The red one is
then there's the Bleu one. It could go a different way and then this
is how we know that it's a true cognizer and a true functional
representation. Yes, great call. Thanks a lot.<br/>
<br/>
1:00:21
Bleu because it has to do with the vicarious nature, with not
directly seeing it, but it also has to do with that representation,
whether more structural, triangular or more functional. Red arrow
could be different. So there's them having a counterfactuals action
contingency and here they're also imagining a counterfactuals
structural position.<br/>
<br/>
1:00:51 Okay, I'm going to go to a
question from Stephen. In the chat, Steven asked how do we resolve
the use of a term functional as used in correlational dynamics? So
that's referring to some of our earlier discussions on like
functional and effective connectivity in neuroimaging and the term
functional in use and the term functional in terms of having
cognition counterfactuals. So how is the functional here related to
effective and functional connectivity in neuroimaging and time series
statistics?<br/>
<br/>
1:01:39 I'll give a first thought. It's not
that it can't be linked or connected, but they are different
namespaces and they're totally different. The functional connectivity
in the time series is about how changes in one variable through
active inference, another variable through time, or are associated
with changes in the other one through time. So it's not a mechanistic
causal relationship per se, but it's just that changes in one
variable have an edge reflecting how changes in some other variable
change that does not engage either of the pieces that we're
highlighting here, which is the vicarious or standing for nature, nor
the counterfactuals nature. So it is a different use of the term
functional.<br/>
<br/>
1:02:32 Functional is an overloaded word. And
so yeah, it's not that you couldn't have a paper that was looking at
functional representation and using neuroimaging and using functional
and effective connectivity of brain regions while individuals were
engaged in functional representation, but that would a little bit be
like the star was the star of the movie. It's just using a word in
multiple senses in a way that may give some ambiguity to those who
don't parse out the different senses extremely clearly. Is that fair
to say or does anyone have a different thought?<br/>
<br/>
1:03:18
Functional can also mean teleological, like the function of
something, essentially. So there's many uses of function and I think
it's interesting that it has come up in these different spaces Bleu.
So I do agree that they're disconnected, but I am able to perhaps see
a relationship in functional connectivity and also in
counterfactuals. So when things are functionally connected, like one
drives the other, right? And then the counterfactuals is like when
things are not functionally connected, there's no corresponding
correlation, right?<br/>
<br/>
1:04:04 Bleu:<br/>
So in the
exploration of functional connectivity you have to have all of the
data points, like over a time series. So you have to like you
understand functional connectivity through the exploration of
counterfactuals. Does that make sense? Okay, how about this?
Functional connectivity, the term it is a function representation
that cognitive scientists use because it could be otherwise they're
engaging in the Lamme region A and B have functional connectivity
because I did the time series statistics in SPM and we got this value
and so that functional connectivity value is able to be used in
subsequent internal cognitive representations.<br/>
<br/>
1:04:56
Daniel:<br/>
It stands for something and it can be engaged with in a
counterfactuals way. Like what if it would have been stronger, then
what would our conclusion have been? Or what if it would have been
weaker? What would it have been?<br/>
<br/>
1:05:09 And then Steven
wrote these are definitions and ways to name could be where the
ontology Working group could have a future role. Yes, ontology
development in active inference and how will we even make the
decisions of what terms to use and what senses disambiguate the uses
and the different corpuses that we are looking at? So pretty
interesting, this graphic actually. I hope any of the authors or
anyone who is like interested in this topic, what do you think about
these doodles? Do you agree?<br/>
<br/>
1:05:49 Disagree?<br/>
<br/>
1:05:52
Let's go to Blue's question about autopuices. What is interesting or
that about.<br/>
<br/>
1:06:03 Bleu:<br/>
Just really where it comes
in. And I think we kind of brought it up earlier in the sharing of a
model. So is sharing of a generative model necessary for self
assembly or even the attempt to share a generative model? Is that a
necessary component of auto poetics? And at what levels?<br/>
<br/>
1:06:28
Like organizationally, structurally, content related, functionally at
all the levels. I just wonder how these things are related. And when
we were talking earlier about having a conversation and trying to
make your</span></span></span></font></font></font></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; orphans: 2; widows: 2; margin-bottom: 0in">
<span style="font-variant: normal"><font color="#0f0f0f"><span style="letter-spacing: normal">
<font face="Roboto, Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">models
align with one another through information sharing and like we saw
with the computational boundary of itself about selfassembly and
autopilotis via Mike Levin, just about the informational sharing
between subunits leads to the formation of a larger cognitive unit.
And so I was just wondering about model relationships and forming a
larger cognitive unit like we're talking about the conversation and
then we form switch complete overlap of yes, we get it, we group,
we're there and then we form a larger cognitive unit. And is that on
all aspects?<br/>
<br/>
1:07:21 Is it just related to content
structure, organization or function or all of the above? Just that
anybody thinks about that? Alright.<br/>
<br/>
1:07:33 And we saw
this actually in Matt Sims earlier paper, the Biological Symbiosis,
right? Yes.<br/>
<br/>
1:07:43 Daniel:<br/>
The autopilotic system is
capable of producing and maintaining itself by creating its own
parts. So it's kind of like the ship of theseus plus crew. They're
able to be modifying and reconstructing the material basis of the
system.<br/>
<br/>
1:08:04 On one hand that maintains an
organizational separation of like the cell and the surrounding in
terms of the realist interpretation of a Markov blanket. At the same
time, the autopoetic process does not need to have it involves
ingressing and outgrassing material. So that does blur the boundary
and structurally bit doesn't need to be the case that the autopoetic
process of the cell has like a blueprint or a structural resemblance
of the cell. It could just be subunits that are non representational
theory cannot engage.<br/>
<br/>
1:08:54 It doesn't even make sense
to ask whether the cognitive model has structural similarity with the
target because it's a non cognition entity. And similarly on the
function side, the enzymes can't engage in counterfactuals that, you
know, synthesize the lipids and add them to the membrane. So is
information a representation?<br/>
<br/>
1:09:31 Bleu:<br/>
I don't
know. I mean, we're getting into the quantum now.<br/>
<br/>
1:09:39
Daniel:<br/>
Where's information in this it comes up in the paper
1817 times based on local information. Information comprises the
generative model. Past and present information, future information,
information gain no additional information about internal states
that's the Markov definition high mutual information can be in the
context of a non representational generalized synchrony like the
pendulums that synchronize. Where is information in this eight volt
distinction? So the author talks about here.<br/>
<br/>
1:10:25
Bleu:<br/>
If I can read a quote quickly if one only appeals to the
organizational aspect of representation the presence of environment
or sensory motor or complex or frugal model does not matter insofar
as the internal variables of the model are understood to be separated
from external reality by a markup blanket and the generative model is
leveraged to infer the causal structure of external reality via
selfevident. However, these differences matter if one considers
structural aspects and the degree of resemblance between hidden
variables and environmental dynamics as opposed to action or
information gathering dynamics. So I don't know here the content of
representations is used to draw a further distinctions within
internal representation view between an internalist, sometimes called
intellectualist or encoding versus an action oriented
perspective.<br/>
<br/>
1:11:23 Daniel:<br/>
Probably one of the most
thrilling academic debates. Dean.<br/>
<br/>
1:11:31 Dean:<br/>
Please
don't judge what I'm about to say next. Just bear with me. Be kind.
So in this representation. For example.<br/>
<br/>
1:11:40 Where
we've got this table if we were to look at those lines. Each one of
those horizontal lines because there's three IC and each one of those
vertical ines because there's four IC and we realized. And we
realized them as a standard XY graph we know that there's a
relationship between X and Y. That every one of those horizontal
lines relative to Y has a zero component to it. And we know that
every one of those vertical lines relative to X has a zero component
to it.<br/>
<br/>
1:12:17 So most people will look at the blackness
of that relative to the white background and they'll just see
something material separating. But if we actually look at it
graphically and we take Daniel's idea of the tetrahedron every time
we round an edge and change direction on that tetrahedron there is a
zero element that allows for that boundary crossing that we again
don't pay as much attention to. And so from an autopoetic standpoint
you can actually see where something like a Markov blanket both
separates and levels the potential open for that transfer or that
process theory, that transition. So when we're model ourselves the
last paragraph of the section five of the paper they wrote arriving
at an FPP as synthesis so some nonzero number and zero view depends
upon which representational criterion we are assuming when either
considering FPP's central constructs or considering specific
cognitive phenomena through the lens of a process theory. Under FP,
do we include the zero piece of this or not, tentatively,
fully?<br/>
<br/>
1:13:44 Or do we willfully ignore it? Hence, in the
end, the debate about FEP may reveal more about us, our criteria,
whether we want this to be a material thing and not include the zero
aspect of it and our interest in particular facets of cognition than
does about the representational status of FEP. So I just want to kind
of bring that. Again, don't judge me because I could be way wrong
here and I may be overfitting, but I think that the autopilotic part
of it. We can see both the separation and we can see the portal in a
line if we choose to include both.<br/>
<br/>
1:14:26 That's kind of
what I wanted to bring up.<br/>
<br/>
1:14:31 Daniel:<br/>
Okay. Very
interesting, Dean. Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
1:14:36 Here's the unfolded
tetrahedra. There's a few shapes of paper that can be folded into a
tetrahedra. One looks more like a parallelogram and one looks more
like an equilateral triangle. We're just kind of like, folds up like
the petals of a flow. So these zero lines so there's the zero point
of within a facet representational and non representational.<br/>
<br/>
1:15:07
That's almost like the two sides of the paper. Like, how many
triangles are here? Oh, four. How about eight units? How many
triangle units of paint do you need to paint this?<br/>
<br/>
1:15:17
Four. No, eight. Two sides. So the zero is like the thickness of the
paper. And that's also when you fold it up, that's like inside versus
outside of the state.<br/>
<br/>
1:15:26 And then these zero y ines
are like the movements from one face to another force, where it's
also thin enough as to be imperceptible, especially when it's laid
flat. But bit makes all the difference to move from one side to
another.<br/>
<br/>
1:15:51 How do we use moving through zero in this
eight fold or other recognition model? How do we use that to increase
the efficacy or the fluidity or the accessibility of models?<br/>
<br/>
1:16:14
Dean:<br/>
Does it help us in explaining that we're not locked out of
that self organization loop that we can actually participate in bit?
Is that the first thing that it tells us, that we're not locked out
of that ability to selfgenerate?<br/>
<br/>
1:16:41 That was a
question I wasn't questioning. Bit wasn't like an honest, sincere
question.<br/>
<br/>
1:16:51 Daniel:<br/>
I think. So one supportive
or complexity component would be this is sort of a map. This is like
a cognitive map. And someone could say, this side of the paper is
better than the other side. And this is my favorite face, but it's
presented as part of a larger knowledge structure such that the
learner could engage in counterfactuals.<br/>
<br/>
1:17:18 Like,
what if we were on the other side of the paper? Or what if we were on
a different face? So this allows, for example, individuals to reflect
their understanding of the lay of the land, but also communicate
their preferences. And as the paper shows, different individuals do
have different outcomes in terms of their cognition, conclusions. And
that's what reveals the super fascinating thing about us.<br/>
<br/>
1:17:45
And that's why the paper is model ourselves. What the free energy
reveals about our implicit notions of representation. Not free energy
principle modeling representation. What the free energy principle
reveals about representation, which would be a slightly different
paper and title. So just the scholarship and the sense making phase
that only very few have to engage in, like Samsung, Pazilla have, is
to make these maps and then bring the perspectives that were not
integrated to be shown as just different locations in a phase
space.<br/>
<br/>
1:18:39 Like we put four zeros bit. It's not as
simple as just like two numbers, but if it was just two topics being
against each other, every perspective could have like a position in
that face space. And then what do we do? Switch that?<br/>
<br/>
1:19:02
Yes. I'm thinking about that ourselves, part of modeling ourselves.
I'm not really thinking about all humans and the way that our minds
work. It's more of the academic conversations that have been
happening around the sort of intellectual tradition that's been
happening around representation. And so the contribution of this
paper, as I see it is that, look, we've got this framework that does
a lot of work for us in a lot of different disciplines. Yes,
Danielle.<br/>
<br/>
1:19:30 Danielle:<br/>
And if we apply it to
this conversation, this intellectual debate that's been happening, we
can reveal implicit assumptions of the debate itself. And what
emergence is that perhaps as an artifact of particular examples that
have been used to understand representation, we see one side of the
coin or another. We can see these we pull on these different
dimensions that are laid out in this paper. So I guess it's just
important to think about and disagree. If you disagree, but be
ourselves is really just about the way that philosophers and
cognitive scientists have been thinking about this.<br/>
<br/>
1:20:10
Nothing</span></span></span></font></font></font></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; orphans: 2; widows: 2; margin-bottom: 0in">
<span style="font-variant: normal"><font color="#0f0f0f"><span style="letter-spacing: normal">
<font face="Roboto, Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">is
true. This is not revealing something about cognition per se. It's
more about the implicit assumptions that have been kind of unfolding
and how we're thinking about the discipline. Thanks for that. Just
like there was a sort of hinge on the functional being used in two
different ways.<br/>
<br/>
1:20:33 Daniel:<br/>
Another sense of
representation, one that might be more commonly used outside of
cognitive science, would be like representation in terms of different
perspectives or identities in a group. And then that made me think of
Nothing about us without US which is used in different contexts, but
basically has to do with participatory decisionmaking that decisions
are not being made in a way removed from the people who it influence.
And that has to do with representation. No taxation without
representation, for example. And so cognitive science is actually in
a nothing about us without US because if there's just an academic
discussion.<br/>
<br/>
1:21:22 Especially an unexamined one with a
lot of implicit baggage about a hyperintellectualized. Hyperabtracted
scenario. Or like we like to study representational organizational
cases where it's super clean. These are the ones that we study. These
are the model systems.<br/>
<br/>
1:21:39 These are the kind of
careers that have been built in academia. For example. But it's about
us in the broader sense, like humans and then even us as cognition
entities. And so it is the philosophers and the literature that is in
this paper as Danielle kind of. Highlighted that's the modeling
ourselves, the selves there are the participants in the discussion
around representation, which of course has been textual abstract,
English speaking, qualitative, other adjectives.<br/>
<br/>
1:22:25
So it's another interesting connection there. Bleu. So definitely the
subjectivity that Daniel highlighted is a big part of perhaps why we
have these organizational structure, these different viewpoints. But
maybe something that I don't think is really emphasized too much in
this paper is kind of the realist versus instrumentalist viewpoint of
active inference. And so there's a pretty big argument in the
literature and I think probably the math is not the territory maybe
gets into it the best maybe in the most detail of the
papers.<br/>
<br/>
1:23:11 Bleu:<br/>
that we've studied here on this
stream. But theorem area, people that say like, active inference is a
way to model the cognition process or the action perception process
that we all undergo. And then there are people who say that this is
actually happening in a computational way in the brain. It's not a
model of it is how it works. And so there's this ongoing like vision
fusion feud happening in the active inference community
also.<br/>
<br/>
1:23:44 And I just wanted to highlight that because.
You may not thanks a lot. Bleu I pulled out a few quotes because I
also noticed that bit was one of the earlier quotes when we were
talking about the, I think, organizational element. So look at how
often reality comes into play in these discussions. So internal
variables of a model, okay, so we're talking about instrumentalism,
right?<br/>
<br/>
1:24:16 Daniel:<br/>
Like models area understood to
be separated from external reality by a Markov blanket wait reality.
And the generative model is leveraged to infer the causal structure
of material reality. So it flips four times in that sentence from
reality from model to reality back to model back to reality.<br/>
<br/>
1:24:55
It's a very it doesn't make it right or wrong. It's just a very
interesting epistemic artifact because within the reality of the
model, like the reality of the map bit is the case that the internal
variables are separated. And if the model is trying to do
determination on that level of reality, like maps trying to infer
maps, that is reality, but then that's not the sort of layer one
external reality in the sense that many people often mean or use it.
Dean yeah, I think, Danny, if you take the words reality and model
and push them out into even more extreme tales, you could see the
model, you could see people who area pushing back against the model
idea and they're arguing, you're just too rigid, right? You're just
too stock.<br/>
<br/>
1:26:01 Dean:<br/>
And you can see people that
are taking the non representational sort of reality view, the
variance maintained or retained view. You can see the people that are
on the model end of the continuum saying that's just chaos. There's
nothing about that that we can actually make sense of because the
cognitive overload right now is just swamping me right and so I think
what these authors were trying to do is say, well, can we move back
and forth instead of getting stuck on those really far out positions
in terms of this way of being able to see when we have these
densities, right? And then out of those densities re set back to some
sort of invariance and then rereform, right? So I hope that kind of
speaks to what Daniel was saying too, because sure, we can point out
the most extreme example at the very end of the continuum or we can
actually talk about how we're going to draw these unidirectional or
bidirectional lines and boundary cross.<br/>
<br/>
1:27:19 And I
think that's what they were trying to open us, our thinking up to.
But maybe I'm just being Pollyanna here because I really like the
paper. I don't know.<br/>
<br/>
1:27:32 Daniel:<br/>
Interesting
point. Realism is also used in another way, which is kind of like
it's a school of literature or a thread of literature. And so then I
found this paper, affect of realism evoke reality beyond
representation. And so this is in the case of literary expression. So
that's an activity that cognition entities are engaged in.<br/>
<br/>
1:27:58
And we just see a lot of terms that we talk about in active, like
agency, affect, process. And here it's not about reality, realism
territory. It's like realization. And realization is an interesting
word. And I know verveki and others use it as well because
realization, it is about the model.<br/>
<br/>
1:28:26 But when
something is realized, it becomes real in the model. But usually we
wouldn't say that something is realized like, oh, I just realized
that zebras have nine legs. It's like you engaged in a
counterfactual. But is it a implication if the model is updated in a
way that isn't concordant with reality? And I agree that the paper
gives us a lot of nuance to talk about these areas because we can
talk about how well the evolution of the variables doesn't change or
the structure of the legs and the zebra doesn't change or it can
still run, right?<br/>
<br/>
1:29:13 So why not nine legs? Is it
still a zebra?<br/>
<br/>
1:29:20 There's a lot of open threads, but
the way that they use model and reality in light of a lot of the
other discussions we've had is really illustrative Bleu. So one of my
favorite things to think about in terms of like the realism versus
the instrumentalism is the Markov blanket. So I was looking for the
picture about like of the person sleeping under the mark up blanket
really as a position for a system. Do systems have Markov blankets or
can they be modeled with Markov blanket? And I always just like think
of that cute little picture with the little person sleeping under the
Markov blanket.<br/>
<br/>
1:30:12 Bleu:<br/>
Like, do I have a
Markov blanket up around me? Because that's really where it tends to
Brea down in my mind. Like, yes, there's a boundary, but I'm not sure
that it's karl Friston blanket or a pearl blanket or a markup
blanket. Maybe it's just skin.<br/>
<br/>
1:30:34 Daniel:<br/>
Yes.
Dean?<br/>
<br/>
1:30:38 Dean:<br/>
I hate answering a question with
another question, but in the conclusion of the paper, the authors
speak specifically to the free energy principle can be very
heuristic. And so I'm wondering in the instrumentalist versus versus
realist debate whether it has to necessarily get up to that abstract
level of Markov like it, or whether we can just say that sandwiched
between those two are rules that we demarcate, that we lay down and
that we have act as a parsing mechanism. I don't know, what do you
think, Bleu like our rules area rules, things that we can just get
our hands on right today instead of having to go all the way up to
figuring out what a Markov like it is under this set of
circumstances. No, I can. Definitely rules.<br/>
<br/>
1:31:26
Bleu:<br/>
Right. So I mean, we all agree that there are laws in
physics. Like if you drop an apple it will fall to the flow. We all
abide by these rules. They might not apply at every scale, but I
definitely think that a rule based construction or
understanding.<br/>
<br/>
1:31:42 Does that then bridge the realism
versus instrumentalism debate? Perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
1:31:52
Daniel:<br/>
Building on the point that the ourselves in the title is
the people reading the paper. So not just like people in the psych
department, but it's the ourselves, the people who are in that
epistemic commons so using that, but also the content related
representations in terms of correctness or truth. So if that if the
ourselves are those who are pondering FEP, then the heuristic that
they refer to, we conclude by highlighting the heuristic power of the
FEP to advance our understanding of the notion of internal
representation. It is pretty meta because we're representing the
debate about people representing the debate about representation.
However, the fact that it has a heuristic utility within the content
related aspect, at the very least it does have representational
impact.<br/>
<br/>
1:33:09 I'm not sure where that takes us. There's
probably other ways to take it, but I think something about the
diversity of conclusions that people have and how that shines a light
back on us or is a mirror and how the FEP has been applied here in
this paper as a heuristic for sense making in this meta debate says
something. I hope, Danielle.<br/>
<br/>
1:33:44 Danielle:<br/>
I hope
I'm addressing what you're saying and not taking this in another
direction, but. Stepping back. I'm thinking of FEP as just one of
many different tools of thought that we have that</span></span></span></font></font></font></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; orphans: 2; widows: 2; margin-bottom: 0in">
<span style="font-variant: normal"><font color="#0f0f0f"><span style="letter-spacing: normal">
<font face="Roboto, Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">allow
us to align our representations. And if it is an effective tool, we
all start having a conversation that makes sense to each other,
that's mutually intelligible.<br/>
<br/>
1:34:09 In this case it is
kind of meta because it's about how the academics, the intellectual
conversation about representations have failed to converge on
something. There is this debate theorem area, many layers of the
debate. And so what it reveals is that we haven't yet converged, the
community hasn't converged. And so FEP is this thing that we can use
that reveals those things and allows us to then better because it's
revealing these things. We can all attend to those things that were
implicit and are now made explicit.<br/>
<br/>
1:34:40 We're
converging internal representation. So I think That kind of addresses
what you're saying. It's about representations, but it's also this
tool. Like there are many other types of tools that allow us to
realize what we've been taking for granted and action oriented
representation. Thanks a lot, Dean.<br/>
<br/>
1:35:01 Dean:<br/>
Yeah.
Just to add on to that, if you're like me, you think rules and tools,
area interchangeable. And the other thing you think is that if it's a
heuristic, it speaks mind of to that vicarious function in terms of
content. So I just want to throw that on top because I think there's
some agreement around that we use the rules to make that next very
vicarious play before we make the next move. Anybody that doesn't is
kind of kidding themselves, I think, but maybe I'm wrong.<br/>
<br/>
1:35:47
Daniel:<br/>
Okay, here's a little bit of FEP in a heuristic case. So
we talked about the Helmholtz decomposition of vector fields, like in
stream number 32, about how there's this pragmatics or sort of hill
climbing or gradient descending component. Whether you take the
optimistic biology climbing mountains, improbable, go straight up the
mountain of fitness or the physicists gradient descent into the
bottom of the well. In either case there's that variational component
that's associated with pragmatism and then there's this epistemic
component that's associated with the solenoidal isocontour. So we've
talked about that Helmholtz decomposition.<br/>
<br/>
1:36:32 So
here's one way in which the FEP is being heuristic applied. So Daniel
said the academic conversation on representation has not converged
and it has not converged and it has also not even coherent. Like
there isn't a shared ontology, there's not a shared narrative,
there's not shared words or regime of attention or what people are
even focused on. And so what the FEP is doing literally like they did
here with this distinction, it does a few things. It holds space for
not overfitting.<br/>
<br/>
1:37:13 Like, let's just say in 2055, all
the people in the world or all the cognitive scientists, they all
agreed, oh great, we converged, let's lock that in. But FEP even then
will remind us, like, not to overfit and also not to center one side
of the tetrahedral. We could say this is the side that has these
attributes, or we focus on this side for these reasons and no one
goes there to this other side, or there's a reason why we don't go
there, or we take a journey, we travel through there, but we don't
live there, or something like that. It brings a level of coherence to
the discussion that doesn't necessarily have the goal of perfect
static conversation. But still, there'll be solenoidal flow and
differences in opinion even then, who said the FEP wasn't
useful.<br/>
<br/>
1:38:23 Danielle:<br/>
Cell, and maybe this is
obvious, but is that not what any goods theory does? Like Bleu said,
cell gravity is true because if I drop an apple it will fall. Yes. So
the theory of gravity does the same thing. It allows us to action
oriented representation.<br/>
<br/>
1:38:38 It's just that the theory
of gravity is not itself about representation.<br/>
<br/>
1:38:45
Daniel:<br/>
Yes, this is like the hall of Mirrors, this paper and
conversation because it's the group of people in the hall of Years
and they're all wearing mirror suits in a weird way. But it is our
gym for building the kind of framework that then can reduce our
uncertainty a ton, potentially in similar cases. And the strange loop
of reflexive cognitive entities is going to be this open ended bounce
for a long time to come. But just like how we started here with a
really complex reciprocal case of two adaptive entities but then it
was a lot less ambiguous here. And I wonder if active informed system
design will frame an increase amount of pieces, especially in a
digital world, into this bottom tier offloading some of the
repetitive tasks, attention consuming tasks, anxiety producing
stimuli into these type of interactions which opens up new spaces for
these kinds of interactions with the two adaptive entities.<br/>
<br/>
1:40:20
To return to that having or possessing a Markov blanket, just one
quick point, which we already even read the quote, which was a core
aspect of FEP such as the possession of a Markov blanket. So is the
Markov blanket the system or does it have one? Those are both reality
or is it modeled as having? Is it model as being those area
instrumentalist ways of similar framings? And how do we know what the
force aspects are?<br/>
<br/>
1:40:48 What does that stem from? So
there's a ton to learn and discuss there. And then let's look at in
just our last few minutes any of the other topics and if anybody
wants to highlight one of these or also maybe as we jump off from
36.2 to 37 and beyond when we discuss Free Energy a user's guide, but
also we just continue on our paths, like why does it matter? Not all
these papers maybe make the argument for why this whole
representation debate matters. So what is the pragmatics that make
this meaningful, make it important to fund people working on it or
the way that influences the technologies that we're developing rather
than just a pure infogain prediction of uncertainty
question?<br/>
<br/>
1:41:55 So any topics here or any like thoughts
on how this will or could or should influence our action selection
going forward?<br/>
<br/>
1:42:20 Dean:<br/>
I'm comfortable with
long silences, but I'm going to throw this out there.<br/>
<br/>
1:42:29
I think people will be able to use this tool to become more creative,
not just be able to reduce and minimize their prediction error, but
actually have the confidence to come up with new and different ways
of looking at problems that we probably didn't have in our toolkit
before in terms of being able to come up with something different.
And so I think the first thing that it does is bit allows for a
boundary crossing that maybe we constructed in our minds before, but
we're seeing less and less of it as being a hard stop. And there's
now maybe a little bit more say in whether to go or don't go. So
that's what I would think that this kind of work is maybe opening up
unless somebody comes and shuts it down. And I can't speak to what
outside forces would find terribly threatening.<br/>
<br/>
1:43:34
But I'm sure there are some out there.<br/>
<br/>
1:43:39
Daniel:<br/>
Outside Bleu. So I'm not sure if this has any pragmatic
value, but I'm certainly interested in kind of really exploring like
sensory motor engagement and structural representation and maybe like
synesthesia. I know Daniel Chaos been to meow, but when you're
playing these invisible harp and could you structure a room? Like
draw a map in a room and your goal is to like kind of like an scale
room, but your goal is to find navigate your way through based on
sound, right? Like you ting the things and you have to find the right
sound.<br/>
<br/>
1:44:15 Bleu:<br/>
You play Mary Had a Little Am
and then you get to your prize at the end or you get to get out of
the room. So I wonder creatively, like Dean was saying, really, these
maps, these representations, can we get literally out of our own
representation and into the feeling of an alternate representation
and what would that feel like or be like? And that's also why I
brought up like, blindness. If you ever wake up and totally like my
power went out the other night. It's like black.<br/>
<br/>
1:44:43 I
mean, no moon, nothing. Bit was just like, whoa, total darkness,
right? Like no little Bleu light from the plug or nothing. And so in
these total darkness situations, you have this representation of what
is my house look like? Where's my flashlight?<br/>
<br/>
1:45:00 You
phase to be able to navigate yourself in a totally dark situation
which is very foreign to go find a flashlight. And so I like these
kind of boundary pushing experiences because they really force us to
examine our own model and perhaps allow us to explore the kind of
models that other people use.<br/>
<br/>
1:45:23 Daniel:<br/>
Thinking
through other minds is this case with adaptive agent in dialogue. And
it's like thinking through other representations. And this paper and
discussion opens up not to then simply converge, but opens up and
holds ways to think and act through other types of representations.
Not just the same type, but in a different cognitive entity.<br/>
<br/>
1:46:03
It comes up a lot. And it would be awesome to see how just as so many
other themes that we've had raised by very prescient papers like 14
Math is not the Territory, 20 Emperor's New Markov Blanket and some
of the further nuancing about the Markovian assumptions. This
representational and non representational and these words like
organization, structure, content and function, they will come up
again. And maybe they'll be citing this paper, maybe they won't, but
like, it's almost like when we see in a future paper just one facet
of the set and they'll say, here's how it is, it's this one side. And
it's like, well, no, there's other sides and we could be inside or we
could be outside and someone could still say, I prefer this one, but
we know there's a bigger system that we can at least come to the
table around.<br/>
<br/>
1:47:11 Dean.<br/>
<br/>
1:47:15 Dean:<br/>
I'm
not marketing, but it's going to come up in 37. It's going to come up
a bunch of times in 37. So that's just the next paper anyway. Hold</span></span></span></font></font></font></span></p>

again, it's going to come up again next week. Don't touch that
dial.<br/>
<br/>
1:47:40 Daniel:<br/>
Thanks a lot for the awesome
sequence. This was a somewhat complex or intellectual paper. I mean,
they're all written, but this one was like challenging topics, a lot
of different perspectives. And then not only did they hold it open
for all of the different perspectives, but then rather than pick a
winner, they flipped the table in the end and posed it not as an
answered competition for us to then have like domain specific clarity
of action within, but really a challenge on multiple levels. For
researchers who are familiar with FEP and not, the big question we
asked was can the free energy principle help us advance or even
resolve the long lasting debate on internal representation in
philosophy of mind?<br/>
<br/>
1:48:54 We certainly asked.<br/>
<br/>
1:48:58
So if anybody has any last concepts they want to make on anything,
they're welcome to.<br/>
<br/>
1:49:13 Dean:<br/>
Last words. So I'll
get this in real quick. I think that we're still arguing about
whether or not representation and modeling is heavily dependent.
Like, that there is a dependency. I think that the more philosophical
views that we see come up around FEP and active inference.<br/>
<br/>
1:49:36
The harder and harder it is to make the case that we can remove that
dependency or somehow just see the scale three aspects of this tool
that there's actually a heavy dependency on what we're going to get
out of representation or non representation based on our awareness or
our realization that every time we cross a boundary. That is just an
independent act. That's a highly dependent act. So that'll be my last
word.<br/>
<br/>
1:50:11 Bleu:<br/>
So I just want to give a final
comment. You know, we talk about instrumentalism and realism and then
there's the third axis of utility. And I really think that this paper
was super useful in prompting new questions, in holding up these
different views of representation and non representation and in these
different categories and allowing us to really kind of view them
through a partitioned framework that I think will drive future
questions and really be useful in helping researchers formulate their
theorem area.<br/>
<br/>
1:50:56 Daniel:<br/>
Danielle, you're still
here. Thanks for joining for your first stream. Do you have any last
comments? This was a wonderful introduction. I'm curious how
representative it is of other conversations.<br/>
<br/>
1:51:11
Danielle:<br/>
It was super heady in a really pleasant way. It was
not representative or representational of other conversations. No.
Thanks a lot. Awesome combo.<br/>
<br/>
1:51:23 Daniel:<br/>
Everyone's
always welcome to join these discussions or other lab activities. So
thanks again to the authors and all the participants here. See you.<br/>
