0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:29.080
Hello and welcome everyone.

2
0:00:29.080 --> 0:00:33.280
This is Actinflab Livestream number 36.2.

3
0:00:33.280 --> 0:00:37.720
It's January 26, 2022.

4
0:00:37.720 --> 0:00:40.000
Welcome to Active Inference Lab.

5
0:00:40.000 --> 0:00:45.360
We are a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning, and practicing applied

6
0:00:45.360 --> 0:00:46.720
active inference.

7
0:00:46.720 --> 0:00:49.940
You can find us at the links here on this page.

8
0:00:49.940 --> 0:00:54.240
This is a recorded and an archived livestream, so please provide us with feedback so we can

9
0:00:54.240 --> 0:00:56.360
improve our work.

10
0:00:56.360 --> 0:01:01.320
All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome, and we'll be following good video etiquette

11
0:01:01.320 --> 0:01:03.600
for livestreams.

12
0:01:03.600 --> 0:01:09.120
Check out ActiveInference.org if you want to learn more about what Actinflab is up to,

13
0:01:09.120 --> 0:01:14.320
or if you want to participate in any of the activities which include livestreams in the

14
0:01:14.320 --> 0:01:19.840
communications organizational unit, but a ton of other stuff is happening.

15
0:01:19.840 --> 0:01:25.200
Today in 36.2, our third discussion on 36.

16
0:01:25.200 --> 0:01:33.440
We're going to continue to learn and discuss this paper by Sims and Pazulo 2021, Modeling

17
0:01:33.440 --> 0:01:39.880
Ourselves, What the Free Energy Principle Reveals About Our Implicit Notions of Representation,

18
0:01:39.880 --> 0:01:47.640
and we're going to have a nice jumping off dot two as we do, and have some questions

19
0:01:47.640 --> 0:01:49.920
written down and prepared.

20
0:01:49.920 --> 0:01:54.880
Other things will spontaneously arise, and if anyone watching live wants to just write

21
0:01:54.880 --> 0:01:59.280
a question in a live chat, we can also address that.

22
0:01:59.280 --> 0:02:05.000
We'll start with an introduction, so we'll go around and introduce ourselves.

23
0:02:05.000 --> 0:02:10.760
People can say anything they want, and they can also add just what got them excited about

24
0:02:10.760 --> 0:02:16.120
the paper in general, or for this dot two discussion specifically.

25
0:02:16.120 --> 0:02:24.640
So I'm Daniel, I'm a researcher in California, and just excited to see how this representation

26
0:02:24.640 --> 0:02:35.040
in discussion influences our own self representation, and that at the individual and the lab scale.

27
0:02:35.040 --> 0:02:38.720
Moving forward, I'll pass it to Blue.

28
0:02:38.720 --> 0:02:47.280
Hi, I'm Blue, I'm an independent research consultant in New Mexico, and I am excited

29
0:02:47.280 --> 0:02:53.120
by this paper because in our previous discussions, we're, as usual, left with more questions

30
0:02:53.120 --> 0:03:01.080
than answers, and also I kind of am finding myself swayed by the different representational

31
0:03:01.080 --> 0:03:06.400
structural, content driven, non-representational, these different arguments, and I just find

32
0:03:06.400 --> 0:03:11.280
them very interesting, and I just want to know if at the end of this, if I'll be swayed

33
0:03:11.280 --> 0:03:16.280
more or less in certain directions, or maybe just be more open to other interpretations

34
0:03:16.280 --> 0:03:20.320
of FEP, and I will pass it to Danielle.

35
0:03:20.320 --> 0:03:27.200
Hello, I'm Danielle, I'm a cognitive scientist at Google with a background in language evolution,

36
0:03:27.200 --> 0:03:28.200
language development.

37
0:03:28.200 --> 0:03:33.760
I'm really interested in thinking about how humans evolve the ability to model other

38
0:03:33.760 --> 0:03:38.880
minds, so interested in how this discussion can contribute to that, and generally interested

39
0:03:38.880 --> 0:03:47.120
in how really good frameworks like the FEP can help kind of encompass other frameworks

40
0:03:47.120 --> 0:03:51.000
and revise them.

41
0:03:51.000 --> 0:03:52.000
Awesome.

42
0:03:52.000 --> 0:03:53.000
Dean?

43
0:03:53.000 --> 0:04:03.280
Hi, I'm Dean, I'm up here in Calgary, in Canada, and a little bit of recency effect,

44
0:04:03.280 --> 0:04:08.880
I started watching Ozark the last season, and so I'm trying to plug this paper in through

45
0:04:08.880 --> 0:04:13.920
what would Marty Bird do, so that's kind of my little twist on modeling.

46
0:04:13.920 --> 0:04:16.520
So back to you, Daniel.

47
0:04:16.520 --> 0:04:20.560
Who is Marty Bird, and what would he do?

48
0:04:20.560 --> 0:04:23.040
Right, exactly.

49
0:04:23.040 --> 0:04:32.480
Great question, well, that's all we prepared for today, so we'll go into the discussion.

50
0:04:32.480 --> 0:04:38.760
But we have some things written down, is there anything just off the bat that anybody wants

51
0:04:38.760 --> 0:04:44.200
to just ask or jump into, or like a figure, or a quotation to begin with, or we can look

52
0:04:44.200 --> 0:04:47.720
at some of the things that we had written down.

53
0:04:47.720 --> 0:04:55.720
Okay, let's just start with what we've written down, and then of course at any point we can

54
0:04:55.720 --> 0:04:57.720
branch off.

55
0:04:57.720 --> 0:05:09.000
Okay, I think a big theme that we'll probably return to again and again, is this idea of

56
0:05:09.000 --> 0:05:17.240
moving back and forth from non-representational forms to representational forms.

57
0:05:17.240 --> 0:05:26.520
In the paper, they introduce four different facets of representation, and then how each

58
0:05:26.520 --> 0:05:31.360
of those facets can be approached in a representational or non-representational way.

59
0:05:31.360 --> 0:05:37.160
And although the image here shows some solid black lines, that was kind of the discussion

60
0:05:37.160 --> 0:05:42.520
was, is there movement across these areas or blurriness?

61
0:05:42.520 --> 0:05:52.480
So maybe Dean, what is there to say or start to explore with representations emerging, like

62
0:05:52.480 --> 0:05:57.200
almost precipitating or crystallizing out of something non-representational, and then

63
0:05:57.200 --> 0:06:02.440
the reverse process of something that is more representational, submerging back into something

64
0:06:02.440 --> 0:06:03.440
that's less?

65
0:06:03.440 --> 0:06:09.000
Well, one of the things the authors did talk quite a bit about in terms of the functional

66
0:06:09.000 --> 0:06:15.720
aspect of this was the vicarious nature, and then they also talked quite a bit about whether

67
0:06:15.720 --> 0:06:24.680
or not somebody who's sort of moving in that radical inactivism space still has to be able

68
0:06:24.680 --> 0:06:32.080
to differentiate and get some, include some of the temporal aspects of what might pop

69
0:06:32.080 --> 0:06:39.640
up and become something that we can stabilize in model or representation form.

70
0:06:39.640 --> 0:06:42.040
But then it has to also be able to disappear, right?

71
0:06:42.040 --> 0:06:47.920
It also has to not necessarily consume everything in terms of our attentional field.

72
0:06:47.920 --> 0:06:58.640
So I'm not really sure exactly how that works itself through, but I would think that it's

73
0:06:58.640 --> 0:07:06.480
difficult to say that even if we're in a flow state, that there isn't some moment when we

74
0:07:06.480 --> 0:07:08.760
do reflect in that mirror.

75
0:07:08.760 --> 0:07:10.800
So that's kind of where I'm at.

76
0:07:10.800 --> 0:07:15.920
I don't have any answers per se, but I don't want to get stuck in the idea that it's just

77
0:07:15.920 --> 0:07:18.040
an on-off switch.

78
0:07:18.040 --> 0:07:25.720
I think that there's a bit of a moment of dimming and then re-lighting.

79
0:07:25.720 --> 0:07:38.840
So that makes me think about certain paths that our thought takes over these eight cells.

80
0:07:38.840 --> 0:07:43.200
Like when we're in the representational side, when we're dealing with the representation,

81
0:07:43.200 --> 0:07:48.720
how do we take that tetrahedra and look at the four different sides?

82
0:07:48.720 --> 0:07:54.760
And then how do we stay within a column looking at just the organizational aspects of a system

83
0:07:54.760 --> 0:08:02.880
and then move north and south on that?

84
0:08:02.880 --> 0:08:10.560
Do these kinds of knowledge or cognitive transitions happen all the time?

85
0:08:10.560 --> 0:08:16.680
Do they have other names that might be more familiar than using some of this philosophical

86
0:08:16.680 --> 0:08:18.480
language?

87
0:08:18.480 --> 0:08:19.480
What is it?

88
0:08:19.480 --> 0:08:24.040
Are there any times in our days where we're dealing with something representationally

89
0:08:24.040 --> 0:08:39.440
and we shift to a non-representational version within one of these categories or across categories?

90
0:08:39.440 --> 0:08:44.320
So I was just thinking of that actually.

91
0:08:44.320 --> 0:08:50.240
What does an organizational representation look like?

92
0:08:50.240 --> 0:08:56.360
That is like a map, like a structural representation, a content-related representation, and a functional

93
0:08:56.360 --> 0:08:57.360
representation.

94
0:08:57.360 --> 0:09:03.000
And what do these representations look like?

95
0:09:03.000 --> 0:09:04.800
And how are they different?

96
0:09:04.800 --> 0:09:08.880
I was just thinking about that.

97
0:09:08.880 --> 0:09:22.920
Let's go to the definition of the organizational representation, just to kind of remember.

98
0:09:22.920 --> 0:09:29.440
The fact that FEP requires internal states, states that encode the recognition model,

99
0:09:29.440 --> 0:09:34.320
that are statistically separated from the external reality.

100
0:09:34.320 --> 0:09:45.520
So the organizational area is about how variables inside of systems are separated from variables

101
0:09:45.520 --> 0:09:48.600
outside of the system.

102
0:09:48.600 --> 0:10:01.440
The pro-representation take is there's an evidentiary boundary, the Markov blanket,

103
0:10:01.440 --> 0:10:06.780
and there's something on the inside that is doing something like a representation on

104
0:10:06.780 --> 0:10:09.280
what's outside.

105
0:10:09.280 --> 0:10:13.280
So that's the pro-representational take.

106
0:10:13.280 --> 0:10:20.680
Then the non-representational take is where we get into the ecological and the inactivist

107
0:10:20.680 --> 0:10:23.320
persuasion.

108
0:10:23.320 --> 0:10:27.200
And that's where the authors say that some have approached this Markov blanket structural

109
0:10:27.200 --> 0:10:32.760
formalism, even though we're talking about it in the organizational, not the structural

110
0:10:32.760 --> 0:10:40.000
facet, in a manner that suggests a non-representational view.

111
0:10:40.000 --> 0:10:45.280
And they argue that just partitioning two coupled systems, like agent and environment,

112
0:10:45.280 --> 0:10:54.120
with a Markov blanket doesn't imply that the behavior of the agent is explained by anything

113
0:10:54.120 --> 0:11:01.040
related to an internal model that's doing anything like capturing the structure of the

114
0:11:01.040 --> 0:11:05.960
outside world.

115
0:11:05.960 --> 0:11:14.120
So you just used organizational and structural in this big hobnob, but my question was really,

116
0:11:14.120 --> 0:11:17.120
what does an organizational representation look like?

117
0:11:17.120 --> 0:11:23.200
And so I'm hearing that you answered that there are clearly defined boundaries in organizational

118
0:11:23.200 --> 0:11:27.880
representation or partitions between internal and external states.

119
0:11:27.880 --> 0:11:36.640
So when I have a representation in my mind that's organizational, it is like your boundary

120
0:11:36.640 --> 0:11:41.800
is different from like, is it only your own boundary or is it like the boundaries of each

121
0:11:41.800 --> 0:11:45.840
individual agent are organizationally represented in your mind?

122
0:11:45.840 --> 0:11:50.840
Or is it just the boundary between you and the outside world?

123
0:11:50.840 --> 0:11:54.320
And how might that differ from structural and content related, like what do these different

124
0:11:54.320 --> 0:11:55.320
representations look like?

125
0:11:55.320 --> 0:12:05.200
That's what I'm trying to see, like, would they be maps and how would the maps be different?

126
0:12:05.200 --> 0:12:13.280
The structural, which does come up several times in the organizational definition.

127
0:12:13.280 --> 0:12:18.000
So we see structure coming up, the structure of the system in how it's organized, but what

128
0:12:18.000 --> 0:12:24.360
is the structural specifically, okay, having representational vehicles that are structurally

129
0:12:24.360 --> 0:12:37.400
similar to the state of affairs in the world that they stand for.

130
0:12:37.400 --> 0:12:45.240
The pro representational structural side is kind of like the good regulator theorem of

131
0:12:45.240 --> 0:12:47.320
cybernetics.

132
0:12:47.320 --> 0:12:52.360
So the organizational side is highlighting that there is some sort of informational encapsulation,

133
0:12:52.360 --> 0:12:58.200
we might even say, like our previous discussions, but some sort of organization of variables

134
0:12:58.200 --> 0:13:02.800
such that there's an inside and an outside that are separated.

135
0:13:02.800 --> 0:13:10.520
And the structural side is saying that it's like if there's three things that are connected

136
0:13:10.520 --> 0:13:16.360
in the outside world, then not just that there are variables that are organizationally

137
0:13:16.360 --> 0:13:24.000
separated in the internal states, but that the structure of those isolated variables

138
0:13:24.000 --> 0:13:30.680
is going to do something like recapitulate or have a structural resemblance to the generative

139
0:13:30.680 --> 0:13:32.180
process.

140
0:13:32.180 --> 0:13:36.440
Generative process, that's like the niche, that's what's outside generative model, that's

141
0:13:36.440 --> 0:13:38.720
what the agent has on board.

142
0:13:38.720 --> 0:13:45.680
And so if it's to be useful for control purposes, then it may have to have some sort of structural

143
0:13:45.680 --> 0:13:50.880
resemblance to the actual connectivity of the generative process.

144
0:13:50.880 --> 0:13:55.560
So generative model and generative process being separated is what's captured in the

145
0:13:55.560 --> 0:14:01.560
organizational side, them having similar resemblances or similar structures is what the structural

146
0:14:01.560 --> 0:14:04.120
side is.

147
0:14:04.120 --> 0:14:11.720
The structural non representationalists are suggesting, this is I think tale of two densities

148
0:14:11.720 --> 0:14:16.080
with Ramsted et al., or modeling ourselves.

149
0:14:16.080 --> 0:14:19.680
The author suggests that generative models do not meet the requirements of structural

150
0:14:19.680 --> 0:14:30.320
representations because the process of exploitable structural representations, so posterior beliefs

151
0:14:30.320 --> 0:14:37.080
in the entity is enacted.

152
0:14:37.080 --> 0:14:43.400
And so it doesn't necessarily have to recapitulate the form of the generative process, so maybe

153
0:14:43.400 --> 0:14:49.320
one could be skilled in the performance of driving without having variables connected

154
0:14:49.320 --> 0:15:07.720
in the way that a car pieces are connected.

155
0:15:07.720 --> 0:15:15.560
It comes back to a theme that Active presents to us, perhaps more as a question than an answer,

156
0:15:15.560 --> 0:15:20.800
which is how much do we have to know in order to act?

157
0:15:20.800 --> 0:15:31.080
Do we have to have an internal model that is very similar to the process, uncorrelated

158
0:15:31.080 --> 0:15:37.520
in how similar it is, anti correlated in how similar it is, and can we have a framework

159
0:15:37.520 --> 0:15:44.680
as researchers that helps us compare the structure and organization of generative processes and

160
0:15:44.680 --> 0:15:49.280
generative models of those processes?

161
0:15:49.280 --> 0:15:58.040
Yes, go 14.

162
0:15:58.040 --> 0:16:02.720
So I'll put this out there and then people push back or say it doesn't make any sense.

163
0:16:02.720 --> 0:16:07.160
From what I read in the paper now, because I had to go back over and look at it again,

164
0:16:07.160 --> 0:16:13.200
if I were to try to draw a simple comparison between organization and structure, organization

165
0:16:13.200 --> 0:16:18.600
would you could see it as being something as being either in or out.

166
0:16:18.600 --> 0:16:24.880
So you could be inside, you could be inside a cell or outside of a cell, then in our minds

167
0:16:24.880 --> 0:16:31.400
we can tell we will draw those partitions and then we'll decide what's in or out.

168
0:16:31.400 --> 0:16:35.440
Structural I think takes on more of the entailing question, something that Sir Wal brought up

169
0:16:35.440 --> 0:16:41.600
in the chat, which is so once you've decided whether something's in or not, is there something

170
0:16:41.600 --> 0:16:50.960
else that now can be seen as being superordinate to that from the perspective of sort of what's

171
0:16:50.960 --> 0:16:58.760
wrapped around now the thing that's in or what can sit upon theoretically the thing

172
0:16:58.760 --> 0:17:04.520
that you've now decided is foundational to whatever it is you're looking at and what

173
0:17:04.520 --> 0:17:09.080
can be set aside as not being important to what you're looking at.

174
0:17:09.080 --> 0:17:14.800
So again, pull that apart and say that that's wrong, but that's kind of what I try to read

175
0:17:14.800 --> 0:17:17.600
into what the readers or what the writers were saying.

176
0:17:17.600 --> 0:17:21.360
So it's just my interpretation.

177
0:17:21.360 --> 0:17:22.360
Thanks Blue.

178
0:17:22.360 --> 0:17:31.560
So I just wonder in this organizational representation, if you draw a distinction between, I mean

179
0:17:31.560 --> 0:17:36.480
clearly there's one between like what's internal and external to yourself, but are you also

180
0:17:36.480 --> 0:17:42.320
trying to like draw distinctions between what's internal and external to your computer or

181
0:17:42.320 --> 0:17:48.760
your refrigerator or your best friend or your child, like are you making a representation

182
0:17:48.760 --> 0:17:53.400
of everything that's internal and external to every other thing or is it only with respect

183
0:17:53.400 --> 0:17:58.120
to your own self versus environment?

184
0:17:58.120 --> 0:18:00.400
I would think it's when you do that.

185
0:18:00.400 --> 0:18:04.640
I don't know that it's implied that you do it all the time.

186
0:18:04.640 --> 0:18:10.480
But if you choose to do that, I think that that's something that's pretty easy to tell

187
0:18:10.480 --> 0:18:12.920
the difference around.

188
0:18:12.920 --> 0:18:18.400
So again, I'm not sure that they were saying that we do this, we're do always constantly

189
0:18:18.400 --> 0:18:23.940
doing this, but I think what they were trying to do is show the difference between knowing

190
0:18:23.940 --> 0:18:30.680
when something's in or out versus knowing when something's first or second from a structural

191
0:18:30.680 --> 0:18:31.680
standpoint.

192
0:18:31.680 --> 0:18:39.440
Again, I don't want to put words in the author's mouth, but I did hear that in the words that

193
0:18:39.440 --> 0:18:45.200
they were doing to try to parse those two things and give each their due, as opposed

194
0:18:45.200 --> 0:18:52.200
to saying they're just the same thing overlapping.

195
0:18:52.200 --> 0:18:55.280
Let's try one little thought loop.

196
0:18:55.280 --> 0:19:01.080
So let's start with Blue's question of what does an organizational representation look

197
0:19:01.080 --> 0:19:02.200
like?

198
0:19:02.200 --> 0:19:09.760
So we'll start in that very top left cell and then shift the focus towards the structural

199
0:19:09.760 --> 0:19:15.480
components and then challenge the structural representation, but stay within the structural

200
0:19:15.480 --> 0:19:21.680
domain and then see if that can result to us making it back to a non-representational

201
0:19:21.680 --> 0:19:25.880
organizational framing.

202
0:19:25.880 --> 0:19:28.640
So what is a good organizational?

203
0:19:28.640 --> 0:19:36.560
Well, something that is classic vanilla organizational representation, well, that's something that

204
0:19:36.560 --> 0:19:41.640
is well separated in terms of variables inside and outside the system.

205
0:19:41.640 --> 0:19:45.560
So we're not worried about the structure of the variables inside or outside, just that

206
0:19:45.560 --> 0:19:48.120
they are separated.

207
0:19:48.120 --> 0:19:56.280
So computers seem like pretty clear cases where within a program, you could have variables

208
0:19:56.280 --> 0:20:05.360
that by design are separated through like an intermediate variable or computers and hardware,

209
0:20:05.360 --> 0:20:10.840
like two computer systems could be totally separated except for an interface like a USB

210
0:20:10.840 --> 0:20:13.080
port or something.

211
0:20:13.080 --> 0:20:21.880
But of course, this paper is about that strange loop when it's a cognizing agent, an adaptive

212
0:20:21.880 --> 0:20:33.640
active inference agent doing that, representing not necessarily a mere active agent, but should

213
0:20:33.640 --> 0:20:44.000
we use a computational example or some sort of enacted human example?

214
0:20:44.000 --> 0:20:46.680
You got a good example right here on the page.

215
0:20:46.680 --> 0:20:53.000
So how would we shift across the y-axis between organizational, representational, because I'm

216
0:20:53.000 --> 0:20:58.360
assuming we're going clockwise, to representational structural.

217
0:20:58.360 --> 0:21:04.320
That's not a hard example to make.

218
0:21:04.320 --> 0:21:16.360
Yes, so in the human case, this would be like two humans in a conversation.

219
0:21:16.360 --> 0:21:30.840
Outside of the conversation, when two humans are in conversation, there is separation in

220
0:21:30.840 --> 0:21:35.440
terms of their sensory motor systems.

221
0:21:35.440 --> 0:21:42.360
So we have checked the box for organizational, representational, starting in the top left

222
0:21:42.360 --> 0:21:43.360
cell.

223
0:21:43.360 --> 0:21:49.120
All right, now the question would be, is there structural representation?

224
0:21:49.120 --> 0:21:53.800
So that would be like maybe if one person thought of a sentence and then said it, and

225
0:21:53.800 --> 0:21:59.280
then the other person thought of that sentence too.

226
0:21:59.280 --> 0:22:02.160
Would that qualify as a structural representation?

227
0:22:02.160 --> 0:22:09.160
Because there's a structural resemblance in the model of the two conversions?

228
0:22:09.160 --> 0:22:10.160
Yeah.

229
0:22:10.160 --> 0:22:17.360
We could also find out if both of us were talking at the same time and suddenly stopped

230
0:22:17.360 --> 0:22:26.440
turn taking, that the structure of that model would now fundamentally change.

231
0:22:26.440 --> 0:22:32.120
It's still representational, and two people arguing over top of one another to the third

232
0:22:32.120 --> 0:22:35.560
party isn't necessarily something comprehensible.

233
0:22:35.560 --> 0:22:43.840
They're mine to the two people that are inside the conversation.

234
0:22:43.840 --> 0:22:49.120
So when I think about conversation, something comes to mind recently, like really you need

235
0:22:49.120 --> 0:22:55.880
to have the order of the language specified, like my son is reading now and he's five,

236
0:22:55.880 --> 0:22:59.600
and he's taken the book like pop on pop, the doctor sees the book and he'll turn it upside

237
0:22:59.600 --> 0:23:04.400
down and he'll say, dod, no, doe, and he'll read it that way, and then he wants to read

238
0:23:04.400 --> 0:23:08.280
every sentence backwards from the end to the beginning, which I'm like, I don't care as

239
0:23:08.280 --> 0:23:15.760
long as you're reading because it's a practicing reading, but the context is completely different.

240
0:23:15.760 --> 0:23:20.560
When you're reading each word in the opposite order, so when you're talking about a structural

241
0:23:20.560 --> 0:23:26.080
representation of a conversation, I think that there needs to be a literal representation

242
0:23:26.080 --> 0:23:31.080
or at least a core screen representation of in what order things are said in order to

243
0:23:31.080 --> 0:23:36.480
glean some kind of meaning, but then are we bleeding into the content related, but like

244
0:23:36.480 --> 0:23:41.040
as we're, you know, that's why I really feel like, like, what are these different maps

245
0:23:41.040 --> 0:23:45.840
look like and trying to maybe elucidate what the representations are is valuable because

246
0:23:45.840 --> 0:23:49.560
I think when you have organization, okay, inside, outside, like this is the sentence

247
0:23:49.560 --> 0:23:54.320
or he said this and she said that or whatever, and then you try to put structure on it, like

248
0:23:54.320 --> 0:24:01.880
that gives it then content or context that they can then, you know, and so on and so

249
0:24:01.880 --> 0:24:03.840
forth.

250
0:24:03.840 --> 0:24:04.840
Dean.

251
0:24:04.840 --> 0:24:11.920
No, I don't have much to add to that other than I just don't think that the, that this

252
0:24:11.920 --> 0:24:17.160
loop that we've, we've just selected this, we said there was going to be a certain amount

253
0:24:17.160 --> 0:24:22.920
of randomness in the last live stream and we've chosen this now, let's walk, let's walk

254
0:24:22.920 --> 0:24:30.160
through it. I don't see it being difficult to, to follow that path and find examples.

255
0:24:30.160 --> 0:24:37.080
So we have a superordinate right now, structurally, we want to carry out this directionality from

256
0:24:37.080 --> 0:24:42.800
the representational side of things to the non-representational side and blue, if you're,

257
0:24:42.800 --> 0:24:48.720
if your kid wants to turn the book upside down, that's, that's actually a feature, right?

258
0:24:48.720 --> 0:24:56.600
Because they're not already stuck in this only one way of doing it thing. So yeah.

259
0:24:56.600 --> 0:25:02.160
Let's complete the red loop and then the green and the orange will come into play. Okay. So

260
0:25:02.160 --> 0:25:08.440
we started with two people in conversation. That's organizational separation of cognition.

261
0:25:08.440 --> 0:25:15.760
This brings us to the structural facet, which is where there's a structural resemblance

262
0:25:15.760 --> 0:25:23.800
in the representations of the conversions. So there, maybe it is the case where they're

263
0:25:23.800 --> 0:25:31.560
both thinking about a similar topology of variables. So there's some structural representation.

264
0:25:31.560 --> 0:25:37.280
But now let's stay within the structural column, go from B to C. Okay. So the two people are

265
0:25:37.280 --> 0:25:44.760
in a conversation. It's kind of like a dance. So what if those two people's representation

266
0:25:44.760 --> 0:25:53.400
is so different that it's actually not structurally resembling? So maybe one person is the more

267
0:25:53.400 --> 0:25:57.120
experienced in the discipline and the other is less experienced, like one person's super

268
0:25:57.120 --> 0:26:03.520
good at fixing motors, the other person is just has no idea. So the representation was

269
0:26:03.520 --> 0:26:07.360
take would be like, well, they're both thinking about the motor. But then when we start to

270
0:26:07.360 --> 0:26:14.960
see like, a cognitive asymmetry, all of a sudden, we fall out of structural representation

271
0:26:14.960 --> 0:26:21.760
list between these two systems, because their cognitive models don't necessarily have similar

272
0:26:21.760 --> 0:26:32.840
structure. Yes, Danielle. Oh, wait, unmute, then go for it.

273
0:26:32.840 --> 0:26:38.240
So I might be missing something here, but I thought that we can only start to talk about

274
0:26:38.240 --> 0:26:42.920
the structural dimension here. Once in this example, the two people in the conversation

275
0:26:42.920 --> 0:26:49.400
are representing the same thing. And then the question is, how much information or how

276
0:26:49.400 --> 0:26:53.880
does each of their representations do each of their representations have to look similar

277
0:26:53.880 --> 0:26:58.880
to one another. But like, part of it has to be that they are representing the same thing.

278
0:26:58.880 --> 0:27:03.840
That sort of necessary component. If they're not representing the same thing, then we're

279
0:27:03.840 --> 0:27:18.840
having a different conversation. Well, that may come to the functional.

280
0:27:18.840 --> 0:27:24.560
That might come to the content related like the novice and the expert, the representations

281
0:27:24.560 --> 0:27:33.200
are both about the engine. But there's so structurally different in their representation

282
0:27:33.200 --> 0:27:37.480
of the engine so that although the content in the aboutness of the representation is

283
0:27:37.480 --> 0:27:47.160
similar, so still qualifying as a representation in that sense, there's a structural non resemblance

284
0:27:47.160 --> 0:27:52.920
such that by that criteria in that situation, we've fallen out of the representational cell

285
0:27:52.920 --> 0:28:01.240
B into something non-representational potentially. Blue, what do you think?

286
0:28:01.240 --> 0:28:06.640
So I think like two people in a conversation can be trying to represent the same thing.

287
0:28:06.640 --> 0:28:11.560
Like, yes, they both need to be trying to represent, have the same representation, like

288
0:28:11.560 --> 0:28:17.360
they're trying to converge on a conversation, a meaningful conversation presumably. But

289
0:28:17.360 --> 0:28:22.120
they don't always converge. And then that's where you get like misunderstandings or like,

290
0:28:22.120 --> 0:28:26.640
you know, we both think that we think the same. We both agree that we're thinking that

291
0:28:26.640 --> 0:28:31.080
we have the same structural representation, but perhaps they're different. And then and

292
0:28:31.080 --> 0:28:41.520
then the communication breaks down. Okay, so the structures are so different

293
0:28:41.520 --> 0:28:47.320
that we're recognizing it as a continuum from total overlap of structural resemblance to

294
0:28:47.320 --> 0:28:54.040
total non overlap, but it would be important to specify that null hypothesis. So we've kind

295
0:28:54.040 --> 0:29:01.600
of scooted into C. How do we stay in that space of like the novice and the expert who

296
0:29:01.600 --> 0:29:07.240
have different cognitive representations and then use that to challenge even organizational

297
0:29:07.240 --> 0:29:17.760
representationalism? Can I? Blue and then Dean first, and then blue.

298
0:29:17.760 --> 0:29:18.760
Go ahead, Dean.

299
0:29:18.760 --> 0:29:23.720
All right. I just thought I want to just go back to the to Daniel's point. So if we're

300
0:29:23.720 --> 0:29:29.840
if we're structuring a conversation normally we turn take, but if we're playing in a band,

301
0:29:29.840 --> 0:29:35.120
we're all playing at once and then we stop playing. So I think we can start with structure

302
0:29:35.120 --> 0:29:42.160
two is just deciding how we want to signal. Right. So I don't think it I don't think there's

303
0:29:42.160 --> 0:29:47.640
an necessarily an order that we have to start with organization first. We can actually start

304
0:29:47.640 --> 0:29:50.000
with structure first as well.

305
0:29:50.000 --> 0:29:55.840
Yeah, and I think a conversation is a particularly challenging example because we're representing

306
0:29:55.840 --> 0:29:59.960
two things, but we're representing what the other person is trying to say and then presumably

307
0:29:59.960 --> 0:30:03.840
what the conversation is about is something else in the world that we could be representing.

308
0:30:03.840 --> 0:30:13.280
Exactly. So I think we're representing a degree of information sharing and I think that this

309
0:30:13.280 --> 0:30:19.280
is going to like lump into out of polices, which I've been really wanting to kind of

310
0:30:19.280 --> 0:30:25.400
get into. But but when we have like, I'm my own person and I'm communicating with Daniel

311
0:30:25.400 --> 0:30:29.960
from, you know, 50,000 miles away, we both feel like we're getting on the same page.

312
0:30:29.960 --> 0:30:35.280
And we actually like do get on the same page. Like, do we form some kind of like separate

313
0:30:35.280 --> 0:30:41.600
cognitive unit? Like at what degree of model overlap is the degree of information sharing

314
0:30:41.600 --> 0:30:48.760
so high that then we are worthy of our own Markov blanket, like we're sure that we understand

315
0:30:48.760 --> 0:30:53.960
that we are the same unit. Right. And I think that this idea of self assembly and information

316
0:30:53.960 --> 0:31:01.800
sharing and model overlap, what I think that there's an important path to traverse down

317
0:31:01.800 --> 0:31:07.040
this way, because if you don't have full overlap of the model, like your or do you need full

318
0:31:07.040 --> 0:31:12.320
overlap to form a self assembling system to be, you know, to form a higher level? It's

319
0:31:12.320 --> 0:31:16.960
just an interesting thought.

320
0:31:16.960 --> 0:31:25.320
That's kind of where the C to D transition takes us, which would be like, so we have

321
0:31:25.320 --> 0:31:30.400
the drummers waiting for this and has a model resembling this, and then the singer has a

322
0:31:30.400 --> 0:31:41.200
totally different structure. And then when we think about the whole cognitive system,

323
0:31:41.200 --> 0:31:46.720
it doesn't deny what we recognize in a that there's still like the sensory motor separation

324
0:31:46.720 --> 0:32:00.200
but we've reached that point by those people or rules being part of a larger, non separable

325
0:32:00.200 --> 0:32:06.800
extended cognitive system. So almost by recognizing the interaction. So here we focused on the

326
0:32:06.800 --> 0:32:15.320
separation in a and that's what granted us the representational cell, but we've returned

327
0:32:15.320 --> 0:32:24.240
to seeing that partial information encapsulation within some type of broader structure, where

328
0:32:24.240 --> 0:32:30.320
none of the entities have like the band level representation. So hopefully other people

329
0:32:30.320 --> 0:32:37.720
can think of other like ABCD examples. But when we were at B, we kind of started branching

330
0:32:37.720 --> 0:32:47.160
off into like talking about the content related things, the aboutness. So here it's like,

331
0:32:47.160 --> 0:32:54.320
there are two people do have a structural resemblance in their internal model. And it's about the

332
0:32:54.320 --> 0:33:02.080
same thing. But then what if one person sees the aboutness in such a different way that

333
0:33:02.080 --> 0:33:09.040
again, we fall out of the content related representation. And then how would we move

334
0:33:09.040 --> 0:33:16.320
from there back to see where all of a sudden the cognitive models in a sense don't have

335
0:33:16.320 --> 0:33:35.720
structural representations resemblance, because they're about different things now. Danielle.

336
0:33:35.720 --> 0:33:41.720
So would this be like in the case of two, two things that are so analogous that they

337
0:33:41.720 --> 0:33:47.760
share a lot of structural similarities and things like that work that you can actually

338
0:33:47.760 --> 0:33:53.240
draw lines between the individual aspects of the concepts, but they could be about totally

339
0:33:53.240 --> 0:33:59.360
different things. But two people talking about these things can can form some sort of structural

340
0:33:59.360 --> 0:34:03.720
similarity in the representations. And it's just like an entry point into being able to

341
0:34:03.720 --> 0:34:11.920
think about all other things. But the aboutness really has nothing to do with it.

342
0:34:11.920 --> 0:34:15.240
Um, Dean, then I might want to ask me on that.

343
0:34:15.240 --> 0:34:23.240
I don't know if I don't know if this answers that Danielle, but from my space, I'm thinking

344
0:34:23.240 --> 0:34:27.120
the difference between say a distracted driver who's looking down at their phone between

345
0:34:27.120 --> 0:34:32.880
the seats and somebody who's got that information and heads up display on their windshield. Right.

346
0:34:32.880 --> 0:34:39.160
So so content twice, but structurally presented one as a one as a distracted state and one

347
0:34:39.160 --> 0:34:44.960
as a contiguous state. So I don't know if that answers your point, but I think we could

348
0:34:44.960 --> 0:34:50.800
we know the difference, right? In terms of what where the where the content is structured

349
0:34:50.800 --> 0:35:03.320
and how we're trying to contextualize each each matter. So

350
0:35:03.320 --> 0:35:12.800
Again, staying with this sort of educational setting. What is it important to see a transference

351
0:35:12.800 --> 0:35:25.440
or a new emergence of? Is it that the structural model of the learner is moving into more resemblance

352
0:35:25.440 --> 0:35:33.120
with the teacher? Is it that the aboutness of the learner is moving towards the same

353
0:35:33.120 --> 0:35:43.480
aboutness of the teacher? Or let's just remind about what the functional is supporting vicarious

354
0:35:43.480 --> 0:35:53.400
use before or in the absence of external events. So does the teaching conversation? Will it

355
0:35:53.400 --> 0:36:02.080
be a functional representation when vicariously without the teacher, the student can carry

356
0:36:02.080 --> 0:36:11.760
out what the teacher could do, which might be having aboutness or not. It might be with

357
0:36:11.760 --> 0:36:20.200
a structural cognitive resemblance or not. It might involve total informational isolation,

358
0:36:20.200 --> 0:36:31.640
putting a squarely in a or it might involve some type of challenging of that in D.

359
0:36:31.640 --> 0:36:36.880
The reason why there's not going to be, I think, a precise answer, because as the paper

360
0:36:36.880 --> 0:36:42.480
lays out, even for the same scenario, people do have different perspectives. So it's not

361
0:36:42.480 --> 0:36:46.880
like we're trying to take a scenario, then classify it into, well, that one's like an

362
0:36:46.880 --> 0:36:56.320
A, B, E, G, or an A, C, E, H, like that is probably not what one of the outcomes could

363
0:36:56.320 --> 0:37:03.920
be. But these are all perspectives that we could take on a given scenario. And they

364
0:37:03.920 --> 0:37:12.680
do reveal interesting things about the systems of studies. Anything else to add on this sort

365
0:37:12.680 --> 0:37:31.000
of like looping around the cells or should we push on? Push. Okay, Blue, what were you

366
0:37:31.000 --> 0:37:40.040
thinking here? I was just taking notes. And so maybe we should talk about content related

367
0:37:40.040 --> 0:37:45.920
and functional. So I was just taking notes on what these are. Organizational, like how

368
0:37:45.920 --> 0:37:50.360
are the representations? And I was trying to draw a picture. So if you, I will draw my

369
0:37:50.360 --> 0:37:55.800
picture if you will talk about maybe functional representation, like what does a functional

370
0:37:55.800 --> 0:38:00.920
representation look like? Or content related? What's inside of those? And then I will draw

371
0:38:00.920 --> 0:38:05.320
my picture and then you can show it. Or I'll just draw it while you're talking.

372
0:38:05.320 --> 0:38:13.720
Sure. So the content related is whether the generative models need to explicitly model

373
0:38:13.720 --> 0:38:21.400
the ways external states produce sensations, environmental models, or the ways actions

374
0:38:21.400 --> 0:38:29.200
produce sensations. Is it really important that internal states resemble external states?

375
0:38:29.200 --> 0:38:45.720
Or is it sufficient that they afford accurate action control? So let's just say there's

376
0:38:45.720 --> 0:38:57.160
a spotlight that's shining photons onto the eye. The content of the cognitive representation

377
0:38:57.160 --> 0:39:05.120
would be more in the representational camp if the cognitive model were truly explicitly

378
0:39:05.120 --> 0:39:20.040
modeling the ways in which the photons hit the retina. Maybe. But this or is a bit challenging

379
0:39:20.040 --> 0:39:25.600
because the way actions produce sensations, that could be a model of like, well, if I

380
0:39:25.600 --> 0:39:31.080
blink, it becomes darker. And when I open my eyes, it's lighter. But that's a totally

381
0:39:31.080 --> 0:39:41.400
disjoint question from understanding how a spotlight works. But those two scenarios

382
0:39:41.400 --> 0:39:49.800
of the spotlight's cognitive explicit modeling, the environmental model, or the sensory motor

383
0:39:49.800 --> 0:39:57.680
model of blinking and it becoming darker, those are both contents related. And, Dean?

384
0:39:57.680 --> 0:40:05.920
Well, I don't know if this helps or not. But one of the things that I used to bring up

385
0:40:05.920 --> 0:40:17.040
around this idea was the puzzle concept. So you got a box and it says a thousand piece

386
0:40:17.040 --> 0:40:24.920
puzzle. And when you open up the box, is that representational or is it not representational

387
0:40:24.920 --> 0:40:31.840
until you've figured out whether all thousand pieces have now been duly assembled, right?

388
0:40:31.840 --> 0:40:39.000
So from a content perspective, do you have what you need in order to be able to tell

389
0:40:39.000 --> 0:40:45.280
the difference between something which is representative and that which is not? So again,

390
0:40:45.280 --> 0:40:49.680
I don't know if that's helpful in terms of sort of trying to see a difference between

391
0:40:49.680 --> 0:40:57.360
that, say, and structure, like where it's placed relative to the context or not. But

392
0:40:57.360 --> 0:41:03.360
that was the way I tried to surface it.

393
0:41:03.360 --> 0:41:11.720
One evolution or handshake that hinges on that or of the environmental models and the

394
0:41:11.720 --> 0:41:18.800
sensory motor models, they do unpack a little bit. So one approach consists in starting

395
0:41:18.800 --> 0:41:24.240
from the sensory motor models. So that would be when I blink, it becomes darker when my

396
0:41:24.240 --> 0:41:30.240
eyes are open, it's lighter, but progressively extends them to incorporate extra variables

397
0:41:30.240 --> 0:41:39.640
that describe external causes of sensation. So like if there's a light on one side, but

398
0:41:39.640 --> 0:41:45.120
not on the other side, then it can be the case that that blinking is true, no matter

399
0:41:45.120 --> 0:41:53.240
how you're turned. But then that could be enriched or augmented with a model of parameters

400
0:41:53.240 --> 0:41:58.720
that describes external causes of sensation, like there's a light over there and not over

401
0:41:58.720 --> 0:42:08.800
there. And so actually that little loop that we just took was from the sensory motor B,

402
0:42:08.800 --> 0:42:17.760
the sensory motor model in B, moving to a representational model of the content, like

403
0:42:17.760 --> 0:42:28.200
there's a light over there. And then does that, well, at least that was the BTE move.

404
0:42:28.200 --> 0:42:34.000
But then maybe that could do something else. So maybe blue will clarify there. But let's

405
0:42:34.000 --> 0:42:41.280
go back to just review functional, like, what is the functional and it's good to revisit

406
0:42:41.280 --> 0:42:47.720
these in the zero one, two, three, four, five, because it's the contribution of the paper.

407
0:42:47.720 --> 0:42:53.880
And maybe there are other facets, other columns to add, and there's just a lot of complexity

408
0:42:53.880 --> 0:43:03.600
even as this is. So the functional one is about supporting vicarious use before or in

409
0:43:03.600 --> 0:43:09.400
the absence of external events. So in that story with the lights and the blinking, it

410
0:43:09.400 --> 0:43:16.360
only had that model only has to be instantiated while the in that room with the photons hitting

411
0:43:16.360 --> 0:43:27.400
the eye and the blinking happening. However, we can imagine a situation that's vicariously

412
0:43:27.400 --> 0:43:33.160
detached or before that setting, like what would happen if there were a light over here

413
0:43:33.160 --> 0:43:40.720
and a light over here, and it was the case that blinking made it darker. And this is

414
0:43:40.720 --> 0:43:48.920
where they trace back to PSA that representations should vicariously stand for something external

415
0:43:48.920 --> 0:44:00.000
in their absence and afford vicarious operations. So there's a light over on the left side,

416
0:44:00.000 --> 0:44:13.360
you reach over and you unscrew it. What is in your hands? Now that is

417
0:44:13.360 --> 0:44:20.840
seeming to be in the functional facet, because we're talking about the role the representation

418
0:44:20.840 --> 0:44:27.120
is playing. And the fact that it is standing for something external in the absence, there's

419
0:44:27.120 --> 0:44:30.840
no physical light that we're talking about. It's not like we're unscrewing it and then

420
0:44:30.840 --> 0:44:49.560
verifying that it's in our hands. Who's for and against that?

421
0:44:49.560 --> 0:44:55.560
What functional roles do internal models play during free energy minimization? And does

422
0:44:55.560 --> 0:45:01.480
minimization require the internal manipulation of variables in ways that resemble vicarious

423
0:45:01.480 --> 0:45:13.600
operations in the classical PSA account of representation?

424
0:45:13.600 --> 0:45:18.160
Yes, blue. So this might be like, I don't know, maybe

425
0:45:18.160 --> 0:45:30.160
it's the easiest and also the hardest to get a grip on. So if we have a representation

426
0:45:30.160 --> 0:45:37.560
of internal variables that are functional, like a functional internal representation,

427
0:45:37.560 --> 0:45:44.360
is this like doing, like you manipulate the variables internally and then manipulate them

428
0:45:44.360 --> 0:45:49.320
externally, like you plan to reach for the cup to take a drink of water. And then you

429
0:45:49.320 --> 0:45:53.240
reach for the cup to take a drink of water, but you have to have like the internal execution

430
0:45:53.240 --> 0:46:03.600
prior to or maybe simultaneous with the external execution. Is that like functional representation,

431
0:46:03.600 --> 0:46:11.080
like you plan the action and do the action, maybe separate or maybe together? Is that

432
0:46:11.080 --> 0:46:16.640
what functional representation looks like? Let's go with the reaching for the cup. Because

433
0:46:16.640 --> 0:46:25.200
as Danielle noted, like conversation, improvised spontaneous conversation of reflexive entities

434
0:46:25.200 --> 0:46:32.760
is one of the hardest cases. But it's the one that we have. So that's awesome. But we're

435
0:46:32.760 --> 0:46:38.360
going to be talking about a adaptive active inference agent reaching for a mere active

436
0:46:38.360 --> 0:46:44.000
inference agent. So in the Sims, other paper we discussed, now we're talking about the

437
0:46:44.000 --> 0:46:50.600
case of unidirectional integration, rather than the multi scale reciprocal integration.

438
0:46:50.600 --> 0:46:56.040
So the person is separated from the cup. There's a separation of the cognitive model

439
0:46:56.040 --> 0:47:05.320
of the agent from the cup. The structural side, if the internal model is cup like, or

440
0:47:05.320 --> 0:47:11.600
it features a cup variable touching a table variable, and then another edge that is engaged

441
0:47:11.600 --> 0:47:16.600
of the hand touching the cup, for example, that might be a structural similarity. But

442
0:47:16.600 --> 0:47:21.960
I think that's part of the debate is, how could there be a structural similarity when

443
0:47:21.960 --> 0:47:26.120
it's not a cup in your brain, which we kind of talked about last time, like, how could

444
0:47:26.120 --> 0:47:33.680
you have something that structurally resembles a car? If it's your brain and body, the contents

445
0:47:33.680 --> 0:47:39.560
related encoding environmental contingencies or sensory motor contingencies. So it could

446
0:47:39.560 --> 0:47:44.560
be the case that a certain sensory motor action will result in picking up and grasping the

447
0:47:44.560 --> 0:47:50.480
cup, whereas another sensory motor action is going to result in the shattering of the

448
0:47:50.480 --> 0:47:57.600
cup. And that could be analyzed in terms of correctness. The functional representational

449
0:47:57.600 --> 0:48:05.640
question would be like the vicarious detachments of the sensory motor loop from the cognition.

450
0:48:05.640 --> 0:48:12.880
So then it would be like, if you were to pick up that cup, then you dumped it, what would

451
0:48:12.880 --> 0:48:18.160
happen? And then someone says like, well, water would fall out. So in that case, it is

452
0:48:18.160 --> 0:48:24.200
like there's a functional representation, whether or not it resembles the structure

453
0:48:24.200 --> 0:48:32.600
of the cup, there's a functional representation, because that idea of grasping the cup, it's

454
0:48:32.600 --> 0:48:40.200
able to be operated on internally vicariously in the absence of direct stimuli related to

455
0:48:40.200 --> 0:48:42.520
the cup. Dean.

456
0:48:42.520 --> 0:48:48.800
Do you mind if I just read right from the paper for a second, because I think it helps

457
0:48:48.800 --> 0:49:00.880
in terms of this difference between the automaticity and reflective aspects of this action. One

458
0:49:00.880 --> 0:49:05.880
important implication falling out of this diagnosis is that when considering functional

459
0:49:05.880 --> 0:49:12.280
rural aspects, it's often how the details of our chosen process theories are fleshed

460
0:49:12.280 --> 0:49:20.120
out and contextualized by the kinds of cognitive phenomena that we are attempting to account

461
0:49:20.120 --> 0:49:30.280
for for that skew or that skew, our interpretation of FEP in one direction or another. For example,

462
0:49:30.280 --> 0:49:35.400
one may consider that there are core aspects of FEP, such as the possession of a Markov

463
0:49:35.400 --> 0:49:40.800
blanket and more ancillary aspects. And I think ancillary is the key here, such as the

464
0:49:40.800 --> 0:49:48.280
possibility, but not the necessity to engage in counterfactual inference, which is only

465
0:49:48.280 --> 0:49:54.280
required for planning. And it is only the latter more ancillary aspects that call for

466
0:49:54.280 --> 0:49:59.360
a representational interpretation under a given process theory. This would imply that

467
0:49:59.360 --> 0:50:05.560
when using functional role as a sole criterion for representational processes, only some

468
0:50:05.560 --> 0:50:10.960
FEP agents, namely those that can engage in counterfactual forms of inference would meet

469
0:50:10.960 --> 0:50:17.000
the criteria for representation. It is only this subset of FEP agents that would be equated

470
0:50:17.000 --> 0:50:23.880
to full fledged predictive processing agents. So there is an automaticity part to this where

471
0:50:23.880 --> 0:50:29.440
it's really not a Markov blanket, you just do it almost subconsciously. And that's again,

472
0:50:29.440 --> 0:50:35.520
the authors are trying to point this out. Yes, if we fail, I drop the cup and now I reflect

473
0:50:35.520 --> 0:50:42.880
on that. That's the representational piece. But prior to that, I was just going through

474
0:50:42.880 --> 0:50:49.400
the motions. I didn't need a set of instructions telling me to reach out for the cup. So that's

475
0:50:49.400 --> 0:50:52.680
just in the author's words.

476
0:50:52.680 --> 0:51:00.240
Thanks a lot for clarifying that it's like, yes, if one is reflexively grasping at it

477
0:51:00.240 --> 0:51:08.240
or accidentally, then it then grasping the cup, like if you're if you're groping around

478
0:51:08.240 --> 0:51:18.280
in a dark room, and then you happen to grasp the cup, it doesn't have to be representational

479
0:51:18.280 --> 0:51:28.960
because there isn't a counterfactual. And that's very interesting how they say that

480
0:51:28.960 --> 0:51:38.400
it is ancillary. So that's kind of like secondary or not essential to it. Because we can imagine

481
0:51:38.400 --> 0:51:44.080
an active inference entity that's taking in sensory observations, updating its generative

482
0:51:44.080 --> 0:51:50.520
model, engaging in policy selection, and then resulting in some action output impacting

483
0:51:50.520 --> 0:51:56.240
the niche and the cycle begins again. That can be just like a single layer model that

484
0:51:56.240 --> 0:52:07.360
doesn't engage in counterfactuals. But they raise that notion that it's only the counterfactuals

485
0:52:07.360 --> 0:52:16.160
in cognition that actually give us the space to have a functional representation. It's

486
0:52:16.160 --> 0:52:22.280
like if the shell just represents the shell, can't be anything else. But then there's another

487
0:52:22.280 --> 0:52:29.200
kind of entity who can see the shell as financial, or can see it in a different way. And then

488
0:52:29.200 --> 0:52:35.680
it's those counterfactuals that enable the shell to play a functional representational

489
0:52:35.680 --> 0:52:45.840
role in that it stands for something else. Blue, what is this imagery on the bottom?

490
0:52:45.840 --> 0:52:53.200
So I just was like trying to really look at or like try to visualize what would these different

491
0:52:53.200 --> 0:52:58.640
like representations really look like, right? If we take like the idea of two, a person

492
0:52:58.640 --> 0:53:03.600
and a cup even, right? Okay, so on the first one, right, we have organizational. So like

493
0:53:03.600 --> 0:53:09.280
I am a thirsty body. I'm contained within me. There is a cup that contains water over

494
0:53:09.280 --> 0:53:13.480
there. Like I know my boundary, I know the boundary of the cup, and the representation

495
0:53:13.480 --> 0:53:24.840
looks like this. And then a structural representation is just me and the cup and my relationship

496
0:53:24.840 --> 0:53:31.280
between me and the cup, right? So do I have to also have like, so my real question here

497
0:53:31.280 --> 0:53:39.320
is, do these perhaps build on one another? So here you have the structural and then

498
0:53:39.320 --> 0:53:44.600
the next one would be content related. Do I also have to have this connecting line in

499
0:53:44.600 --> 0:53:50.480
the content related? Is that required? Like do I have to have an idea of the structure

500
0:53:50.480 --> 0:53:58.160
to understand the content? And then in the functional, like do you need to know the content

501
0:53:58.160 --> 0:54:04.120
and the structure and the organizational to have to have an understanding of the function?

502
0:54:04.120 --> 0:54:08.280
Right? Do I need to know like the content related like, I know that there's water in

503
0:54:08.280 --> 0:54:12.120
the cup, right? I assume that there's water in the cup. To find out, I have to realize

504
0:54:12.120 --> 0:54:16.120
that there's an inside of me and outside of me and inside of the cup and outside of the

505
0:54:16.120 --> 0:54:20.720
cup. I have to realize my relationship between me and the cup and then to find out the content,

506
0:54:20.720 --> 0:54:24.360
like I have to go sample the cup like just who was inside of it and I have to know what's

507
0:54:24.360 --> 0:54:29.200
inside of me. And then the function, like can I only, like I wonder if there's water

508
0:54:29.200 --> 0:54:33.120
in that cup? Like and then if I go to drink it and there's like whiskey in it or something,

509
0:54:33.120 --> 0:54:37.760
like I'm not going to understand the function until I have all of those things layered on

510
0:54:37.760 --> 0:54:44.160
top of each other. And so that's kind of really my question here in Daniel's drawing on my

511
0:54:44.160 --> 0:54:51.920
drawings. But really, like I just wonder if there's levels of increasing complexity between

512
0:54:51.920 --> 0:54:58.880
these different kinds of representations or if it's just merely the structure, the organizational

513
0:54:58.880 --> 0:55:04.480
and I don't need these boundaries between self and cup in these other models, maybe

514
0:55:04.480 --> 0:55:10.560
it's just the line without the circles in the structural or the no external circles and

515
0:55:10.560 --> 0:55:14.400
content related. So I just want to know like what you guys maybe think of that if there

516
0:55:14.400 --> 0:55:18.440
is a layering here, because I was kind of layering them up, but I don't know if that's

517
0:55:18.440 --> 0:55:23.640
really the right mental representation. Thanks, Blue.

518
0:55:23.640 --> 0:55:33.520
Dean? I'm not muted. Good. I think that I think there's two parts to this. One is that

519
0:55:33.520 --> 0:55:39.160
we are able to differentiate, which is what the table allows for. And I think that the

520
0:55:39.160 --> 0:55:47.680
second part is the the arrow, the curved arrow that Daniel drew, which essentially represents

521
0:55:47.680 --> 0:55:54.400
boundary crossing number one. So the difference between something that's static and something

522
0:55:54.400 --> 0:55:59.880
that is translatable. And then the second part of it, I think without going back down the

523
0:55:59.880 --> 0:56:05.240
rabbit hole that we almost fell into him in the point one of this, when we started talking

524
0:56:05.240 --> 0:56:12.760
about free will and can and will and the orthogonal piece of that, I think what it what it speaks

525
0:56:12.760 --> 0:56:22.280
to maybe is that it's not a question of free or or encapsulated. It's it's a degree of

526
0:56:22.280 --> 0:56:29.240
dependency question when you when you throw that curved line on on this sort of tiled

527
0:56:29.240 --> 0:56:36.100
representation and start moving across a boundary. So I don't want to call it degrees of dependency

528
0:56:36.100 --> 0:56:41.360
will up to a point of passing through zero. But I'd like to because I think there is an

529
0:56:41.360 --> 0:56:47.380
aspect of that. And that's why I think it's kind of it's kind of crazy if we just focus

530
0:56:47.380 --> 0:56:53.520
on the static things instead of the moving around the moving through four squares is what

531
0:56:53.520 --> 0:57:03.360
I really think gives our minds a good workout. Yep. So here's another little workout. So

532
0:57:03.360 --> 0:57:10.680
blue had two circles in relationship. So here, the circle is going to reflect an adaptive

533
0:57:10.680 --> 0:57:17.000
active inference agent, or the full fledged predictive processing agent one that can engage

534
0:57:17.000 --> 0:57:22.400
in counterfactuals. So the top is two adaptive entities in relationship, and the triangle

535
0:57:22.400 --> 0:57:28.080
is going to reflect a mere active inference entity like a cup, or just something that

536
0:57:28.080 --> 0:57:35.040
doesn't engage in counterfactuals. So organizational is the separation of the systems. So that's

537
0:57:35.040 --> 0:57:40.000
very similar, because it's just describing there being a Markov blanket separating the

538
0:57:40.000 --> 0:57:46.360
systems. The structural representation is having vehicles that are structurally similar.

539
0:57:46.360 --> 0:57:53.960
So it's simple or in the lower case, triangle out there in the world. Is there a structural

540
0:57:53.960 --> 0:57:59.760
resemblance that would be very representational? Whereas if they were cognitively imagining

541
0:57:59.760 --> 0:58:04.160
something different than a triangle, that would have less resemblance. But that gets

542
0:58:04.160 --> 0:58:12.360
challenging with adaptive adaptive, because we're modeling ourselves modeling each other,

543
0:58:12.360 --> 0:58:17.520
blah, blah, blah. So here's them modeling the conversation. And that's where they're

544
0:58:17.520 --> 0:58:23.000
sort of like, very complex dynamics, which is how can we have a structural similarity

545
0:58:23.000 --> 0:58:29.920
about a conversation with another person? But it's simpler in the adaptive mirror case.

546
0:58:29.920 --> 0:58:35.360
The content related representations encode environmental contingencies or sensory motor

547
0:58:35.360 --> 0:58:42.280
contingencies. So like in this case, the triangle, it is the case that it can rotate clockwise.

548
0:58:42.280 --> 0:58:49.880
And so this entity does have a good content related representation if it can actually

549
0:58:49.880 --> 0:58:57.400
turn the dial to that way. And again, that's a little bit more complex in the reciprocal

550
0:58:57.400 --> 0:59:05.840
case. But in the unidirectional case, this red arrow is a content related representation

551
0:59:05.840 --> 0:59:12.280
of the actual motion in the world. And then this last case is the functional representation.

552
0:59:12.280 --> 0:59:20.800
And here it still is, it could be more structural. So like more about the actual structure of

553
0:59:20.800 --> 0:59:26.240
the cognitive model, or it could be more about the encoding of the contingencies. But the

554
0:59:26.240 --> 0:59:32.000
key piece is this isolation, which isn't a Markovian isolation. This is actually the

555
0:59:32.000 --> 0:59:38.280
true vicarious separation of. So here the person or the entity is able to engage in

556
0:59:38.280 --> 0:59:46.240
either structural pondering of the triangle, or functional pondering of the triangle in

557
0:59:46.240 --> 0:59:51.720
the absence of seeing the triangle or grasping the triangle. And again, though, that's a

558
0:59:51.720 --> 1:00:01.360
little bit complex when you have multiple counterfactual cognizers asking each other

559
1:00:01.360 --> 1:00:02.360
questions.

560
1:00:02.360 --> 1:00:06.000
I just added a counterfactual to your, to your question.

561
1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:13.960
Yeah, exactly. The red one is, then there's the blue one, it could go a different way.

562
1:00:13.960 --> 1:00:19.840
And then this is, this is how we know that it's a true cognizer and a true functional

563
1:00:19.840 --> 1:00:23.920
representation. Yes, great call. Thanks a lot, blue, because it has to do with a vicarious

564
1:00:23.920 --> 1:00:32.600
nature with not directly seeing it. But it also has to do with that representation, whether

565
1:00:32.600 --> 1:00:37.520
more structural, triangular, or more functional, red arrow could be different. So there's

566
1:00:37.520 --> 1:00:47.440
them having a counterfactual action contingency. And here they're also imagining a counterfactual

567
1:00:47.440 --> 1:00:56.920
structural position. Okay, I'm going to go to a question from Steven in the chat. Steven

568
1:00:56.920 --> 1:01:04.920
asked, how do we resolve the use of the term functional as used in correlational dynamics?

569
1:01:04.920 --> 1:01:10.160
So that's referring to some of our earlier discussions on like functional and effective

570
1:01:10.160 --> 1:01:16.760
connectivity in neuroimaging and the term functional in use and the term functional

571
1:01:16.760 --> 1:01:28.440
in terms of having cognitive counterfactuals. So how is the functional here related to effective

572
1:01:28.440 --> 1:01:40.040
and functional connectivity in neuroimaging and time series statistics? I'll give a first

573
1:01:40.040 --> 1:01:45.440
thought. It's not that it can't be linked or connected, but they are different namespaces

574
1:01:45.440 --> 1:01:53.960
and they're totally different. The functional connectivity in the time series is about how

575
1:01:53.960 --> 1:01:59.320
changes in one variable through time influence another variable through time or are associated

576
1:01:59.320 --> 1:02:04.720
with changes in the other one through time. So it's not a mechanistic causal relationship

577
1:02:04.720 --> 1:02:11.400
per se, but it's just that changes in one variable have an edge reflecting how changes

578
1:02:11.400 --> 1:02:19.320
in some other variable change. That does not engage either of the pieces that we're highlighting

579
1:02:19.320 --> 1:02:27.600
here, which is the vicarious or standing for nature, nor the counterfactual nature.

580
1:02:27.600 --> 1:02:35.320
So it is a different use of the term functional. Functional is an overloaded word. And so

581
1:02:35.320 --> 1:02:41.880
yeah, it's not that you couldn't have a paper that was looking at functional representation

582
1:02:41.880 --> 1:02:48.000
and using neuroimaging and using functional and effective connectivity of brain regions

583
1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:54.360
while individuals were engaged in functional representation. But that would a little bit

584
1:02:54.360 --> 1:03:01.560
be like the star was the star of the movie. It's just using a word in multiple senses

585
1:03:01.560 --> 1:03:08.800
in a way that may give some ambiguity to those who don't parse out the different senses

586
1:03:08.800 --> 1:03:19.320
extremely clearly. Is that fair to say? Or does anyone have a different thought? Functional

587
1:03:19.320 --> 1:03:25.520
can also mean teleological, like the function of something essentially. So there's many

588
1:03:25.520 --> 1:03:31.480
uses of function. And I think it's interesting that it has come up in these different spaces.

589
1:03:31.480 --> 1:03:41.680
Lou. So I do agree that they're disconnected, but I am able to perhaps see a relationship

590
1:03:41.680 --> 1:03:52.120
in functional connectivity and also in counterfactuals. So when things are functionally connected,

591
1:03:52.120 --> 1:03:59.000
one drives the other. And then the counterfactual is when things are not functionally connected,

592
1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:10.040
there's no corresponding correlation. So in the exploration of functional connectivity,

593
1:04:10.040 --> 1:04:17.920
you have to have all of the data points over a time series. So you understand functional

594
1:04:17.920 --> 1:04:24.720
connectivity through the exploration of counterfactuals. Does that make sense?

595
1:04:24.720 --> 1:04:31.760
Okay. How about this? Functional connectivity, the term, it is a functional representation

596
1:04:31.760 --> 1:04:37.920
that cognitive scientists use because it could be otherwise. They're engaging and they're

597
1:04:37.920 --> 1:04:43.400
saying region A and B have functional connectivity because I did a time series statistics in

598
1:04:43.400 --> 1:04:53.680
SPM, and we got this value. And so that functional connectivity value is able to be used in subsequent

599
1:04:53.680 --> 1:05:00.120
internal cognitive representations. It stands for something, and it can be engaged with

600
1:05:00.120 --> 1:05:04.760
in a counterfactual way, like what if it would have been stronger, then what would our conclusion

601
1:05:04.760 --> 1:05:10.360
have been or what if it would have been weaker, what would it have been? And then Stephen

602
1:05:10.360 --> 1:05:15.600
wrote, these definitions, these are definitions and ways to name could be where the ontology

603
1:05:15.600 --> 1:05:22.840
working group could have a future role. Yes, ontology development in active inference,

604
1:05:22.840 --> 1:05:31.720
and how will we even make the decisions of what terms to use and what senses and disambiguate

605
1:05:31.720 --> 1:05:39.200
the uses and the different corpuses that we are looking at. So pretty interesting, this

606
1:05:39.200 --> 1:05:46.280
graphic actually, I hope any of the authors or anyone who is like interested in this topic,

607
1:05:46.280 --> 1:05:54.240
what do you think about these doodles? Do you agree, disagree? Let's go to blue's question

608
1:05:54.240 --> 1:06:03.480
about auto poisons. What is like interesting or that about?

609
1:06:03.480 --> 1:06:08.720
Just really where it comes in, and I think we kind of brought it up earlier in our, in

610
1:06:08.720 --> 1:06:19.120
the sharing of a model, like so is sharing of a generative model necessary for self assembly

611
1:06:19.120 --> 1:06:28.160
or even the attempt to share a generative model? Is that a necessary component of auto poisons?

612
1:06:28.160 --> 1:06:32.520
And at what level, like organizationally, structurally, content related, functionally,

613
1:06:32.520 --> 1:06:38.240
like at all the levels, I just wonder like how these things are related and when we were

614
1:06:38.240 --> 1:06:42.160
talking earlier about having a conversation and trying to make your models align with

615
1:06:42.160 --> 1:06:48.800
one another through information sharing. And like we saw with the computational boundary

616
1:06:48.800 --> 1:06:55.360
of a self, about self assembly and auto poisons via Mike Levin, just about the informational

617
1:06:55.360 --> 1:07:04.440
sharing between subunits leads to the formation of a larger cognitive unit. And so I was just

618
1:07:04.440 --> 1:07:10.560
wondering about model relationships and forming a larger cognitive unit, like we're talking

619
1:07:10.560 --> 1:07:15.280
about the conversation and then we form, we've complete overlap of yes, we get it, we rock,

620
1:07:15.280 --> 1:07:21.840
we're there, and then we form a larger cognitive unit. And is that on all aspects, is it just

621
1:07:21.840 --> 1:07:27.680
related to content, structure, organization, or function, or all of the above, just what

622
1:07:27.680 --> 1:07:31.080
anybody thinks about that?

623
1:07:31.080 --> 1:07:40.800
Right. And we saw this actually in Matt Sims earlier paper, the biological symbiosis, right?

624
1:07:40.800 --> 1:07:48.200
Yes. The auto poetic system is capable of producing and maintaining itself by creating

625
1:07:48.200 --> 1:07:54.480
its own parts. So it's kind of like the ship of theseus plus crew, they're able to be

626
1:07:54.480 --> 1:08:06.320
modifying and reconstructing the material basis of the system. On one hand, that maintains

627
1:08:06.320 --> 1:08:12.840
an organizational separation of like the cell and the surrounding in terms of the realist

628
1:08:12.840 --> 1:08:21.840
interpretation of a Markov blanket. At the same time, the auto poetic process does not

629
1:08:21.840 --> 1:08:32.680
need to have, well, it involves ingressing and outgressing material. So that does blur

630
1:08:32.680 --> 1:08:39.200
the boundary. And structurally, it doesn't need to be the case that the auto poetic process

631
1:08:39.200 --> 1:08:46.440
of the cell has like a blueprint or a structural resemblance of the cell. It could just be

632
1:08:46.440 --> 1:08:56.000
subunits that are non representational. They cannot engage. It doesn't even make sense

633
1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:04.720
to ask whether the cognitive model has structural similarity with the target, because it's a

634
1:09:04.720 --> 1:09:14.760
non cognitive entity. And similarly, on the functional side, the enzymes can't engage

635
1:09:14.760 --> 1:09:24.680
in counterfactuals that, you know, synthesize the lipids and add them to the membrane. So

636
1:09:24.680 --> 1:09:26.560
is information a representation?

637
1:09:26.560 --> 1:09:39.560
I don't know. I mean, we're getting getting into the quantum now. So, yeah,

638
1:09:39.560 --> 1:09:50.800
where's, where's information in this? It comes up in the paper. 1817 times. Based on

639
1:09:50.800 --> 1:09:59.400
local information, information comprises the generative model, past and present information,

640
1:09:59.400 --> 1:10:04.280
future information, information gain, no additional information about internal states, that's

641
1:10:04.280 --> 1:10:14.160
the Markov definition. High mutual information can be in the context of a non representational

642
1:10:14.160 --> 1:10:20.000
generalized synchrony, like the pendulums that synchronize. Where is the information

643
1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:23.520
in this eight fold distinction?

644
1:10:23.520 --> 1:10:29.320
So the author talked about here, if I can read a quote quickly, if one only appeals

645
1:10:29.320 --> 1:10:33.800
to the organizational aspect of representation, the presence of environmental or sensory

646
1:10:33.800 --> 1:10:40.320
motor or complex or frugal model does not matter. Insofar as the internal variables

647
1:10:40.320 --> 1:10:44.560
of the model are understood to be separated from external reality by a Markov blanket

648
1:10:44.560 --> 1:10:49.920
and the generative model is leveraged to infer the causal structure of external reality via

649
1:10:49.920 --> 1:10:55.400
self evidencing. However, these differences matter if one considers structural aspects

650
1:10:55.400 --> 1:11:00.560
and the degree of resemblance between hidden variables and environmental dynamics, as opposed

651
1:11:00.560 --> 1:11:08.840
to action or information gathering dynamics. So, I don't know, here the content of representations

652
1:11:08.840 --> 1:11:13.360
is used to draw a further distinction within the representational view between an internalist,

653
1:11:13.360 --> 1:11:23.960
sometimes called intellectualist or encodist, versus an action oriented perspective. So.

654
1:11:23.960 --> 1:11:31.320
Probably one of the most thrilling academic debates. Dean.

655
1:11:31.320 --> 1:11:38.680
Well, please don't. Don't judge what I'm about to say next. Just bear with me, be kind.

656
1:11:38.680 --> 1:11:43.600
So in this representation, for example, where we've got this table, if we were to look at

657
1:11:43.600 --> 1:11:48.320
those lines, each one of those horizontal lines, because there's three I see, and each

658
1:11:48.320 --> 1:11:54.600
one of those vertical lines, because there's four I see. And we realized, and we realized

659
1:11:54.600 --> 1:12:02.120
them as an standard X, Y graph. We know that there's a relationship between X and Y, that

660
1:12:02.120 --> 1:12:10.720
every one of those horizontal lines relative to Y has a zero component to it. And we know

661
1:12:10.720 --> 1:12:18.280
that every one of those vertical lines relative to X has a zero component to it. So most

662
1:12:18.280 --> 1:12:22.320
people will look at the blackness of that relative to the white background, and they'll

663
1:12:22.320 --> 1:12:28.280
just see something material separating. But if we actually look at it graphically, and

664
1:12:28.280 --> 1:12:35.440
we take Daniel's idea of the tetrahedron, every time we round an edge and change direction

665
1:12:35.440 --> 1:12:42.080
on that tetrahedron, there is a zero element that allows for that boundary crossing that

666
1:12:42.080 --> 1:12:49.760
we, again, don't pay as much attention to. And so from a from an auto poetic standpoint,

667
1:12:49.760 --> 1:12:56.560
you can actually see where something like a Markov blanket both separates and leaves

668
1:12:56.560 --> 1:13:05.280
the potential open for that transfer or that crossing or that transition. So when we're

669
1:13:05.280 --> 1:13:12.280
modeling ourselves, the last paragraph of the section five of the paper, they wrote

670
1:13:12.280 --> 1:13:24.400
arriving at an MVP as synthesis. So some some non zero number and zero view depends upon

671
1:13:24.400 --> 1:13:31.840
which representational criterion. We are assuming when either considering MVP central constructs

672
1:13:31.840 --> 1:13:37.600
or considering specific cognitive phenomena through the lens of a process theory under

673
1:13:37.600 --> 1:13:45.880
MVP, do we include the zero piece of this or not tentatively, fully, or do we willfully

674
1:13:45.880 --> 1:13:54.840
ignore it? Hence in the end, the debate about MVP may reveal more about us, our criteria,

675
1:13:54.840 --> 1:14:01.200
whether we want this to be a material thing and not not include the zero aspect of it.

676
1:14:01.200 --> 1:14:05.440
And our interest in particular facets of cognition than does about the representational status

677
1:14:05.440 --> 1:14:11.760
of MVP. So I just want to kind of bring that again, don't judge me because I could be way

678
1:14:11.760 --> 1:14:18.240
wrong here and I may be overfitting. But I think that the auto poetic part of it, we

679
1:14:18.240 --> 1:14:25.080
can see both the separation and we can see the the portal in a line, if we choose to

680
1:14:25.080 --> 1:14:31.680
include both. That's kind of what I wanted to bring up.

681
1:14:31.680 --> 1:14:41.360
Okay, very interesting Dean, thanks. Here's the unfolded tetrahedra. There's a few unfold

682
1:14:41.360 --> 1:14:46.560
there's a few shapes of paper that can be folded into a tetrahedra one looks more like

683
1:14:46.560 --> 1:14:52.080
a parallelogram. And one looks more like an equilateral triangle, we're just kind of like

684
1:14:52.080 --> 1:15:03.120
folds up like the petals of a flower. So these zero lines. So there's the zero point of within

685
1:15:03.120 --> 1:15:09.640
a facet, representational and non representational, that's almost like the two sides of the paper,

686
1:15:09.640 --> 1:15:14.960
like how many triangles are here? Oh, four. How about eight? How many units? How many

687
1:15:14.960 --> 1:15:20.400
triangle units of paint do you need to paint this for? No, eight, two sides. So the zero

688
1:15:20.400 --> 1:15:24.800
is like the thickness of the paper. And that's also when you fold it up, that's like inside

689
1:15:24.800 --> 1:15:34.120
versus outside of the tet. And then these zero Y lines are like the movements from one face

690
1:15:34.120 --> 1:15:41.800
to another face, where it's also thin enough as to be imperceptible, especially when it's

691
1:15:41.800 --> 1:15:52.120
laid flat. But it makes all the difference to move from one side to another. How do we

692
1:15:52.120 --> 1:16:05.240
use moving through zero in this eight fold or other cognitive models? How do we use that

693
1:16:05.240 --> 1:16:15.320
to increase the efficacy or the fluidity or the accessibility of models? Does it help

694
1:16:15.320 --> 1:16:22.640
us in explaining that we're not locked out of that self organization loop that we can

695
1:16:22.640 --> 1:16:33.520
actually participate in it? Is that the first thing that it tells us that we're not locked

696
1:16:33.520 --> 1:16:44.960
out of that ability to self generate? That was a question that wasn't that I wasn't questioning

697
1:16:44.960 --> 1:16:51.800
that was it was an like an honest, sincere question.

698
1:16:51.800 --> 1:17:02.600
I think so. One supportive or complementary component would be this is sort of a map. This

699
1:17:02.600 --> 1:17:06.280
is like a cognitive map. And someone could say, this side of the paper is better than

700
1:17:06.280 --> 1:17:13.280
the other side. And this is my favorite face. But it's presented as part of a larger knowledge

701
1:17:13.280 --> 1:17:18.920
structure such that the learner could engage in counterfactuals, like what if we were on

702
1:17:18.920 --> 1:17:25.200
the other side of the paper, or what if we were on a different face? So this allows,

703
1:17:25.200 --> 1:17:33.160
for example, individuals to reflect their understanding of the lay of the land, but also communicate

704
1:17:33.160 --> 1:17:39.600
their preferences. And as the paper shows, different individuals do have different outcomes

705
1:17:39.600 --> 1:17:43.920
in terms of their cognitive conclusions. And that's what reveals the super fascinating

706
1:17:43.920 --> 1:17:50.240
thing about us. And that's why the paper is modeling ourselves, what the free energy

707
1:17:50.240 --> 1:17:57.040
reveals about our implicit notions of representation, not free energy principle modeling representation,

708
1:17:57.040 --> 1:18:01.000
what the free energy principle reveals about representation, which would be a slightly

709
1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:12.120
different paper and title. So just the scholarship and the sense making phase that only very

710
1:18:12.120 --> 1:18:26.880
few have to engage in, like Samson Pazulo have, is to make these maps and then bring

711
1:18:26.880 --> 1:18:38.160
the perspectives that were not integrated to be shown as just different locations in

712
1:18:38.160 --> 1:18:45.560
a phase space. Like we put four zeros, but so it's not as simple as just like two numbers.

713
1:18:45.560 --> 1:18:50.160
But you know, if there was, if it was just two topics being against each other, every

714
1:18:50.160 --> 1:18:56.080
perspective could have like a position in that phase space. And then what do we do with

715
1:18:56.080 --> 1:19:03.760
that? Yes, Danielle,

716
1:19:03.760 --> 1:19:09.120
I guess I'm thinking about the ourselves part of modeling ourselves. I'm not really thinking

717
1:19:09.120 --> 1:19:16.800
about all humans and the way that our minds work. It's more of the academic conversations

718
1:19:16.800 --> 1:19:20.520
that have been happening around the sort of intellectual tradition that's been happening

719
1:19:20.520 --> 1:19:26.920
around representation. And so this the contribution of this paper, as I see it, is that, look,

720
1:19:26.920 --> 1:19:31.080
we've got this framework that does a lot of work for us in a lot of different disciplines.

721
1:19:31.080 --> 1:19:35.680
And if we apply it to this conversation, this intellectual debate that's been happening,

722
1:19:35.680 --> 1:19:43.320
we can reveal implicit assumptions of the debate itself. And what emerges is that perhaps

723
1:19:43.320 --> 1:19:50.480
as an artifact of particular examples that have been used to understand representation,

724
1:19:50.480 --> 1:19:56.040
we see one side of the coin or another. We can see these, we pull on these different

725
1:19:56.040 --> 1:20:01.040
dimensions that are laid out in this paper. So I guess it's just important to think about

726
1:20:01.040 --> 1:20:08.120
and disagree if you disagree. But the ourselves is really just about the way that philosophers

727
1:20:08.120 --> 1:20:13.680
and and cognitive scientists have been thinking about this. Nothing is true. This is not revealing

728
1:20:13.680 --> 1:20:18.160
something about cognition per se. It's it's more about the implicit assumptions that have

729
1:20:18.160 --> 1:20:22.920
been kind of unfolding and how how we're thinking about the the discipline.

730
1:20:22.920 --> 1:20:31.840
Thanks for that. Just like there was a sort of hinge on the functional being used in two

731
1:20:31.840 --> 1:20:40.240
different ways, another sense of representation, one that might be more commonly used outside

732
1:20:40.240 --> 1:20:46.280
of cognitive science would be like representation in terms of different perspectives or identities

733
1:20:46.280 --> 1:20:53.960
in a group. And then that made me think of nothing about us without us, which is used

734
1:20:53.960 --> 1:20:59.480
in different contexts, but basically has to do with participatory decision making that

735
1:20:59.480 --> 1:21:06.560
decisions are not being made in a way removed from the people who it influences. And that

736
1:21:06.560 --> 1:21:12.480
has to do with representation, no taxation without representation, for example. And so

737
1:21:12.480 --> 1:21:20.280
cognitive science is actually in a nothing about us without us. Because if there's just

738
1:21:20.280 --> 1:21:28.480
an academic discussion, especially an unexamined one with a lot of implicit baggage about a

739
1:21:28.480 --> 1:21:35.400
hyper intellectualized hyper abstracted scenario, or like we like to study representational

740
1:21:35.400 --> 1:21:38.680
organizational cases where it's super clean, these are the ones that we study, these are

741
1:21:38.680 --> 1:21:45.160
the model systems, these are the kind of careers that have been built in academia, for example.

742
1:21:45.160 --> 1:21:53.520
But it's about us in the broader sense, like humans, and then even us as cognitive entities.

743
1:21:53.520 --> 1:22:04.800
And so it is the philosophers and the literature that is in this paper, as Danielle kind of

744
1:22:04.800 --> 1:22:11.880
highlighted, that's the modeling ourself. The selves there are the participants in the

745
1:22:11.880 --> 1:22:20.040
discussion around representation, which of course has been textual abstract, English

746
1:22:20.040 --> 1:22:28.880
speaking, qualitative, other adjectives. So it's another interesting connection there.

747
1:22:28.880 --> 1:22:39.760
So definitely like the subjectivity that Danielle highlighted is a big part of perhaps why we

748
1:22:39.760 --> 1:22:46.040
have these organizational structural, these different like viewpoints. But maybe something

749
1:22:46.040 --> 1:22:53.040
that I don't think is really emphasized too much in this paper is kind of the realist

750
1:22:53.040 --> 1:23:02.560
versus instrumentalist viewpoint of active inference. And so there's a pretty big argument

751
1:23:02.560 --> 1:23:07.720
in the literature. And I think probably the math is not the territory, maybe gets into

752
1:23:07.720 --> 1:23:13.520
it the best, maybe in the most detail of the papers that we've studied here on this stream.

753
1:23:13.520 --> 1:23:20.800
But you know, there's people that say like active inference is a way to model the cognitive

754
1:23:20.800 --> 1:23:26.040
process or the action perception process that we all undergo. And then there are people

755
1:23:26.040 --> 1:23:32.280
who say that this is actually happening in a computational way in the brain. It's not

756
1:23:32.280 --> 1:23:42.440
a model of it is how it works. And so there's this ongoing, like vision fusion feud happening

757
1:23:42.440 --> 1:23:47.480
in the active inference community also. And I just wanted to highlight that because, yeah,

758
1:23:47.480 --> 1:23:55.600
because you may not know. Thanks a lot, blue. I pulled out a few quotes because I also noticed

759
1:23:55.600 --> 1:24:02.480
that when we it was one of the earlier quotes when we were talking about the, I think, organizational

760
1:24:02.480 --> 1:24:13.040
element. So look at how often reality comes into play in these discussions. So internal

761
1:24:13.040 --> 1:24:18.560
variables of a model. Okay, so we're talking about instrumentalism, right? Like models

762
1:24:18.560 --> 1:24:26.000
are understood to be separated from external reality by a Markov blanket. Wait, reality?

763
1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:32.280
And the generative model model is leveraged to infer the causal structure of external

764
1:24:32.280 --> 1:24:48.920
reality. So it flips four times in that sentence from reality, from model to reality, back

765
1:24:48.920 --> 1:25:00.160
to model, back to reality. It's a very, it doesn't make it right or wrong. It's just

766
1:25:00.160 --> 1:25:11.600
a very interesting epistemic artifact. Because within the reality of the model, like the

767
1:25:11.600 --> 1:25:21.040
reality of the map, it is the case that the internal variables are separated. And if the

768
1:25:21.040 --> 1:25:29.680
model is trying to do determination on that level of reality, like maps trying to infer

769
1:25:29.680 --> 1:25:40.480
maps, that is reality. But then that's not the sort of layer one external reality in

770
1:25:40.480 --> 1:25:43.800
the sense that many people often mean or use it. Dean?

771
1:25:43.800 --> 1:25:48.960
Yeah, I think, Danny, if you take the word reality and model and push them out into even

772
1:25:48.960 --> 1:25:55.680
more extreme tales, you could you could see the model, you can see people who are pushing

773
1:25:55.680 --> 1:26:00.520
back against the model idea. And they're arguing, you're just too rigid, right? You're just

774
1:26:00.520 --> 1:26:07.160
too stuck. And you can see people that are taking the non-representational sort of reality

775
1:26:07.160 --> 1:26:15.440
view, the variance maintainer retained view, as say, you can see the people that are on

776
1:26:15.440 --> 1:26:20.400
the model end of the continuum saying, that's just chaos. There's nothing about that that

777
1:26:20.400 --> 1:26:25.320
we can actually make sense of because the cognitive overload right now is just swamping

778
1:26:25.320 --> 1:26:32.520
me, right? And so I think what these authors were trying to do is say, well, can we move

779
1:26:32.520 --> 1:26:39.000
back and forth instead of getting stuck on those really far out positions in terms of

780
1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:46.760
this in terms of this way of being able to see when we have these densities, right? And

781
1:26:46.760 --> 1:26:53.680
then out of those densities, how do those densities re reset back to some sort of invariance

782
1:26:53.680 --> 1:27:01.320
and then re reform, right? So I think that's, and I hope that kind of speaks to what Daniel

783
1:27:01.320 --> 1:27:08.240
was saying too, because sure, we can we can point out the most extreme example, like at

784
1:27:08.240 --> 1:27:16.280
the very end of the continuum, or we can actually talk about how we're going to draw these unidirectional

785
1:27:16.280 --> 1:27:21.360
or bi-directional lines and boundary cross. And I think that's what they were trying to

786
1:27:21.360 --> 1:27:26.760
open us our thinking up to. But maybe maybe I'm just being Pollyanna here because I really

787
1:27:26.760 --> 1:27:33.480
like the paper on them.

788
1:27:33.480 --> 1:27:39.320
Interesting point. Here's some realism is also used in another way, which is kind of like

789
1:27:39.320 --> 1:27:45.880
it's a school of literature or a thread of literature. And so then I found this paper

790
1:27:45.880 --> 1:27:55.120
affective realism evoke realism beyond representation. And so this is in the case of literary expression.

791
1:27:55.120 --> 1:28:01.360
So that's an activity that cognitive entities are engaged in. And we just see a lot of terms

792
1:28:01.360 --> 1:28:13.200
that we talk about in active, like agency, affect process. And here it's not about reality,

793
1:28:13.200 --> 1:28:19.160
but some territory, it's like realization. And realization is an interesting word. And

794
1:28:19.160 --> 1:28:26.400
I know Verveke and others use it as well, because realization, it is about the model.

795
1:28:26.400 --> 1:28:33.840
But when something is realized, it becomes real in the model. But usually we wouldn't

796
1:28:33.840 --> 1:28:40.400
say that something is realized like, oh, I just realized that zebras have nine legs.

797
1:28:40.400 --> 1:28:47.000
It's like you engage in a counterfactual. But is it a realization if the model is updated

798
1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:53.480
in a way that isn't concordant with reality? And I agree that the paper gives us a lot

799
1:28:53.480 --> 1:29:04.080
of nuance to talk about these areas, because we can talk about how, well, the isolation

800
1:29:04.080 --> 1:29:10.360
of the variables doesn't change, or the structure of the legs and the zebra doesn't change

801
1:29:10.360 --> 1:29:21.120
or it can still run, right? So why not nine legs? Is it still a zebra? There's a lot of

802
1:29:21.120 --> 1:29:33.640
open threads, but the way that they use model and reality in light of a lot of the other

803
1:29:33.640 --> 1:29:43.520
discussions we've had is really illustrative. Blue?

804
1:29:43.520 --> 1:29:49.440
So one of my favorite things to think about in terms of the realism versus the instrumentalism

805
1:29:49.440 --> 1:29:55.320
is the Markov blanket. I was looking for the picture of the person sleeping under the Markov

806
1:29:55.320 --> 1:30:03.480
blanket, like really as a partition for a system, like, do systems have Markov blankets?

807
1:30:03.480 --> 1:30:09.680
Or can they be modeled with Markov blankets? And I always just think of that cute little

808
1:30:09.680 --> 1:30:13.760
picture with the little person sleeping under the Markov blanket. Do I have a Markov blanket

809
1:30:13.760 --> 1:30:21.560
wrapped around me? Because that's really where it tends to break down in my mind. Yes, there's

810
1:30:21.560 --> 1:30:29.960
a boundary, but I'm not sure that it's a Friston blanket or a Pearl blanket or a Markov blanket,

811
1:30:29.960 --> 1:30:38.320
like maybe it's just skin. Yes, Dean?

812
1:30:38.320 --> 1:30:44.160
I hate answering a question with another question, but in the conclusion of the paper, the authors

813
1:30:44.160 --> 1:30:49.600
speak specifically to the free energy principle can be very heuristic. And so I'm wondering

814
1:30:49.600 --> 1:30:56.760
in the instrumentalist versus realist debate whether it has to necessarily get up to that

815
1:30:56.760 --> 1:31:01.480
abstract level of Markov blanket, or whether we can just say that sandwich between those

816
1:31:01.480 --> 1:31:12.640
two are rules that we demarcate, that we lay down and that we have act as a parsing mechanism.

817
1:31:12.640 --> 1:31:17.800
I don't know. What do you think, Blue? Like, are rules things that we can just get our

818
1:31:17.800 --> 1:31:21.720
hands on right today instead of having to go all the way up to figuring out what a Markov

819
1:31:21.720 --> 1:31:28.040
blanket is under this set of circumstances? No, I can definitely rule. So I mean, we all

820
1:31:28.040 --> 1:31:32.720
agree that there are lots in physics. Like if you drop an apple, it will fall to the

821
1:31:32.720 --> 1:31:39.280
floor. We all abide by these rules. They might not apply at every scale, but I definitely

822
1:31:39.280 --> 1:31:45.400
think that a rule-based construction or understanding, like does that then bridge the realism versus

823
1:31:45.400 --> 1:31:55.920
instrumentalism debate, perhaps? So building on the point that the ourselves in the title

824
1:31:55.920 --> 1:32:03.800
is the people reading the paper. So not just like people in the psych department, but it's

825
1:32:03.800 --> 1:32:16.080
the ourselves, the people who are in that epistemic commons. So using that, but also the contents

826
1:32:16.080 --> 1:32:25.440
related representations in terms of correctness or truth. So if that, if the ourselves are

827
1:32:25.440 --> 1:32:36.640
those who are pondering FEP, then the heuristic that they refer to, we conclude by highlighting

828
1:32:36.640 --> 1:32:40.880
the heuristic power of the FEP to advance our understanding of the notion of internal

829
1:32:40.880 --> 1:32:48.000
representation. It is pretty meta because we're representing the debate about people

830
1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:59.000
representing the debate about representation. However, the fact that it has a heuristic utility

831
1:32:59.000 --> 1:33:07.880
within the contents related aspect, at the very least, it does have representational

832
1:33:07.880 --> 1:33:12.760
impact. I'm not sure where that takes us. There's probably other ways to take it, but

833
1:33:12.760 --> 1:33:21.320
I think something about the diversity of conclusions that people have and how that shines a light

834
1:33:21.320 --> 1:33:35.360
back on us or is a mirror and how the FEP has been applied here in this paper as a heuristic

835
1:33:35.360 --> 1:33:44.800
for sense making in this meta debate says something, I hope, Danielle.

836
1:33:44.800 --> 1:33:50.960
I hope I'm addressing what you're saying and not taking this in another direction, but

837
1:33:50.960 --> 1:33:55.920
stepping back, I'm thinking of FEP as just one of many different tools of thought that

838
1:33:55.920 --> 1:34:03.240
we have that allow us to align our representations. And if it is an effective tool, we all start

839
1:34:03.240 --> 1:34:09.760
having a conversation that makes sense to each other, that's mutually intelligible.

840
1:34:09.760 --> 1:34:14.920
In this case, it is kind of meta because it's about how the academics, the intellectual

841
1:34:14.920 --> 1:34:21.480
conversation about representations have failed to converge on something. There's this debate,

842
1:34:21.480 --> 1:34:26.520
there are many layers of the debate. And so what it reveals is that we haven't yet converged,

843
1:34:26.520 --> 1:34:33.280
like the community hasn't converged. And so FEP is this thing that we can use that reveals

844
1:34:33.280 --> 1:34:36.960
those things and allows us to then better, because it's revealing these things, we can

845
1:34:36.960 --> 1:34:42.040
all attend to those things that were implicit and are now made explicit, we're converging

846
1:34:42.040 --> 1:34:46.120
our representations. So I think that kind of addresses what you're saying, it's about

847
1:34:46.120 --> 1:34:51.200
representations, but it's also this tool, like there are many other types of tools that

848
1:34:51.200 --> 1:34:59.240
allow us to realize what we've been taking for granted and align our representations.

849
1:34:59.240 --> 1:35:06.920
Thanks a lot, Dean. Yeah, just to add on to that. If you're like me, you think rules

850
1:35:06.920 --> 1:35:15.040
and tools are interchangeable. And the other thing you think is that if it's a heuristic,

851
1:35:15.040 --> 1:35:21.720
it speaks kind of that to that vicarious function in terms of content. So I just want to throw

852
1:35:21.720 --> 1:35:29.360
that on top because I think there's some agreement around that.

853
1:35:29.360 --> 1:35:37.880
We use the rules to make that next vicarious play the next before we make the next move.

854
1:35:37.880 --> 1:35:45.800
So I mean, anybody that doesn't is kind of kidding themselves, I think, but maybe I'm

855
1:35:45.800 --> 1:35:50.440
wrong. Okay, here's a little bit of FEP in a heuristic

856
1:35:50.440 --> 1:35:59.360
case. So we've talked about the Helmholtz decomposition of vector fields, like in stream

857
1:35:59.360 --> 1:36:07.120
number 32, about how there's this pragmatic or sort of hill climbing or gradient descending

858
1:36:07.120 --> 1:36:11.580
component, whether you take the optimistic biology, climbing mountain probable, go straight

859
1:36:11.580 --> 1:36:18.120
up the mountain of fitness, or the physicists gradient descent into the bottom of the well.

860
1:36:18.120 --> 1:36:23.560
In either case, there's that irrotational component that's associated with pragmatism.

861
1:36:23.560 --> 1:36:29.120
And then there's this epistemic component that's associated with the solenoidal isocontor.

862
1:36:29.120 --> 1:36:35.560
So we've talked about that Helmholtz decomposition. So here's one way in which the FEP is being

863
1:36:35.560 --> 1:36:40.640
heuristically applied. So Danielle said, the academic conversation

864
1:36:40.640 --> 1:36:47.520
on representation has not converged, and it has not converged, and it has also not

865
1:36:47.520 --> 1:36:55.000
even coherent. Like, there isn't a shared ontology, there's not a shared narrative,

866
1:36:55.000 --> 1:37:01.120
there's not shared words or regime of attention or what people are even focused on. And so

867
1:37:01.120 --> 1:37:09.720
what the FEP is doing, literally like they did here, with this distinction, it does a

868
1:37:09.720 --> 1:37:17.280
few things, it, it holds space for not overfitting, like, let's just say in 2055, all the people

869
1:37:17.280 --> 1:37:21.760
in the world are all the cognitive scientists, they all agreed, Oh, great, we converged.

870
1:37:21.760 --> 1:37:31.520
Just lock that in. But FEP even then will remind us like not to overfit, and also not

871
1:37:31.520 --> 1:37:37.480
to center one side of the tetrahedra, we could say, this is the side that has these attributes

872
1:37:37.480 --> 1:37:43.480
or we focus on this side for these reasons. And no one goes there to this other side,

873
1:37:43.480 --> 1:37:48.840
or there's a reason why we don't go there, or we take a journey, we travel through there,

874
1:37:48.840 --> 1:37:56.560
but we don't live there or something like that. It brings a level of coherence to the

875
1:37:56.560 --> 1:38:08.680
discussion that doesn't necessarily have the goal of perfect static convergence. But still

876
1:38:08.680 --> 1:38:18.800
there'll be solenoidal flow and differences in opinion, even then. Who said the FEP wasn't

877
1:38:18.800 --> 1:38:19.800
useful?

878
1:38:19.800 --> 1:38:28.960
Well, and maybe this is obvious, but is, is that not what any good theory does? Like

879
1:38:28.960 --> 1:38:33.240
Blue said, well, gravity is true, because if I drop an apple, it will fall. Yeah. So

880
1:38:33.240 --> 1:38:39.080
the theory of gravity does the same thing. It allows us to converge our representations.

881
1:38:39.080 --> 1:38:43.920
It's just that the theory of gravity is not itself about representation.

882
1:38:43.920 --> 1:38:53.720
Yes. This, this is like the hall of mirrors, this paper and conversation, because it is

883
1:38:53.720 --> 1:38:59.800
like it's the group of people in the hall of mirrors, and they're all wearing mirror

884
1:38:59.800 --> 1:39:11.640
suits in a weird way. But it is our gym for building the kind of frameworks that then can

885
1:39:11.640 --> 1:39:20.240
reduce our uncertainty a ton, potentially in similar cases. And the strange loop of reflexive

886
1:39:20.240 --> 1:39:29.480
cognitive entities is going to be this open-ended bount for a long time to come. But just like

887
1:39:29.480 --> 1:39:36.800
how we started here with a really complex reciprocal case of two adaptive entities,

888
1:39:36.800 --> 1:39:47.360
but then it was a lot less ambiguous here. And I wonder if ACTIMF informed system design

889
1:39:47.360 --> 1:39:53.280
will frame an increasing amount of pieces, especially in a digital world, into this bottom

890
1:39:53.280 --> 1:40:01.800
tier, offloading some of the repetitive tasks, attention consuming tasks, anxiety producing

891
1:40:01.800 --> 1:40:09.600
stimuli, into these type of interactions, which opens up new spaces for these kinds

892
1:40:09.600 --> 1:40:20.600
of interactions with the two adaptive entities.

893
1:40:20.600 --> 1:40:24.560
To return to that, having or possessing a Markov blanket, just one quick point was,

894
1:40:24.560 --> 1:40:28.480
which we already even read the quote, which was a core aspect of FEP, such as the possession

895
1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:37.200
of a Markov blanket. So is the Markov blanket the system? Or does it have one? Those are

896
1:40:37.200 --> 1:40:43.760
both realist. Or is it modeled as having? Is it modeled as being? Those are instrumentalist

897
1:40:43.760 --> 1:40:52.120
ways of similar framings. And how do we know what the core aspects are? What does that

898
1:40:52.120 --> 1:40:59.560
stem from? So there's a ton to learn and discuss there. And then let's look at any in just

899
1:40:59.560 --> 1:41:05.760
our last few minutes, any of the other topics. And if anybody wants to highlight one of these

900
1:41:05.760 --> 1:41:16.720
or also maybe as we jump off from 36.2 to 37 and beyond, when we discuss free energy

901
1:41:16.720 --> 1:41:24.800
a user's guide, but also we just continue on our paths, like, why does it matter? Not

902
1:41:24.800 --> 1:41:35.120
all these papers maybe make the argument for why this whole representation debate matters.

903
1:41:35.120 --> 1:41:43.120
So what is the pragmatics that make this meaningful, make it important to fund people working on

904
1:41:43.120 --> 1:41:49.920
it or the way that influences the technologies that we're developing, rather than just a

905
1:41:49.920 --> 1:41:59.920
pure info gain reduction of uncertainty question. So any topics here, or any like thoughts on

906
1:41:59.920 --> 1:42:20.320
how this will or could or should influence our action selection going forward?

907
1:42:20.320 --> 1:42:30.360
I'm comfortable with long silences, but I'm going to throw this out there. I think people

908
1:42:30.360 --> 1:42:38.080
will be able to use this tool to become more creative, not just be able to reduce or minimize

909
1:42:38.080 --> 1:42:45.040
their prediction errors, but actually have the confidence to come up with new and different

910
1:42:45.040 --> 1:42:51.440
ways of looking at problems that we probably didn't have in our tool kit before in terms

911
1:42:51.440 --> 1:43:00.840
of being able to come up with something different. And so I think the first thing that it does

912
1:43:00.840 --> 1:43:07.280
is it allows for a boundary crossing that maybe we constructed in our minds before,

913
1:43:07.280 --> 1:43:14.520
but we're seeing less and less of it as being a hard stop. And there's now maybe a little

914
1:43:14.520 --> 1:43:23.680
bit more, more say in whether to go or don't go. So that's what I would think that this

915
1:43:23.680 --> 1:43:31.440
kind of work is maybe opening up unless somebody comes and shuts it down. And I can't speak

916
1:43:31.440 --> 1:43:35.920
to what outside forces would find terribly threatening, but I'm sure there are some out

917
1:43:35.920 --> 1:43:48.240
outside. Blue? So I'm not sure if this has any pragmatic value, but I'm certainly interested

918
1:43:48.240 --> 1:43:55.040
in kind of really exploring like sensory motor engagement and structural representation

919
1:43:55.040 --> 1:44:00.120
and maybe like synesthesia. I know Daniel's been to Meow Wolf, but like, you know, when

920
1:44:00.120 --> 1:44:04.960
you're playing these invisible like the invisible harp, you know, and like, could you structure

921
1:44:04.960 --> 1:44:09.000
a room, like draw a map in a room? And your goal is to like kind of like an escape room,

922
1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:14.240
but your goal is to find navigate your way through based on sound, right? Like you ting

923
1:44:14.240 --> 1:44:17.240
the things and you have to find the right sound. You play Mary Had a Little Lamb and

924
1:44:17.240 --> 1:44:22.080
then you get to your prize at the end or you get to get out of the room. And so as I wonder

925
1:44:22.080 --> 1:44:28.560
creatively, like Dean was saying, like really these maps, these representations, can we

926
1:44:28.560 --> 1:44:35.720
get literally out of our own representation and into the feeling of an alternate representation?

927
1:44:35.720 --> 1:44:39.120
And what would that feel like or be like? And that's also why I brought up like blindness.

928
1:44:39.120 --> 1:44:42.520
Like, you know, if you ever wake up in like a totally like my power went out the other

929
1:44:42.520 --> 1:44:47.040
night, it was like black, I mean, no moon, nothing, like, it's just like, whoa, total

930
1:44:47.040 --> 1:44:53.920
darkness, right? Like no little blue light from the plug or nothing. So in these like

931
1:44:53.920 --> 1:44:59.240
total darkness situations, you have this representation of like, what is my house look like? Where

932
1:44:59.240 --> 1:45:04.720
is my flashlight? Like you have to be able to navigate yourself in a totally dark situation.

933
1:45:04.720 --> 1:45:09.840
Which is very foreign to go find a flashlight. And so I like these kind of boundary pushing

934
1:45:09.840 --> 1:45:18.440
experiences and because they really force us to examine our own model and perhaps allow

935
1:45:18.440 --> 1:45:24.440
us to explore the kind of models that other people use.

936
1:45:24.440 --> 1:45:33.920
Thinking through other minds is this case with adaptive agents in dialogue. And it's

937
1:45:33.920 --> 1:45:43.480
it's like thinking through other representations and this paper and discussion opens up not

938
1:45:43.480 --> 1:45:53.920
to then simply converge but opens up and holds ways to think and act through other types

939
1:45:53.920 --> 1:46:04.040
of representations, not just the same type, but in a different cognitive entity.

940
1:46:04.040 --> 1:46:14.440
It comes up a lot. And it'd be awesome to see how just as so many other themes that we've

941
1:46:14.440 --> 1:46:22.200
had raised by very prescient papers, like 14, math is not the territory, 20, Emperor's

942
1:46:22.200 --> 1:46:30.520
new Markov blanket and some of the further nuancing about the Markovian assumptions.

943
1:46:30.520 --> 1:46:36.160
This representational and non-representational and these words like organization structure

944
1:46:36.160 --> 1:46:44.520
content and function, they will come up again. And maybe they'll be citing this paper. Maybe

945
1:46:44.520 --> 1:46:52.280
they won't. But like, it's almost like when we see in a future paper just one facet of

946
1:46:52.280 --> 1:46:56.560
the Tet and they'll say, here's how it is. It's this one side and it's like, well, no,

947
1:46:56.560 --> 1:47:01.720
there's other sides and we could be inside or we could be outside. And someone could

948
1:47:01.720 --> 1:47:09.120
still say, I prefer this one, but we know there's a bigger system that we can at least

949
1:47:09.120 --> 1:47:18.000
come to the table around Dean. I'm not I'm not marketing, but it's going to come up

950
1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:25.920
in 37. It's going to come up a bunch of times in 37. So that's just the next paper. So anyway,

951
1:47:25.920 --> 1:47:29.520
hold out of your socks because if you think you have to wait for it to come up again,

952
1:47:29.520 --> 1:47:41.000
it's going to come up again next week. So don't touch that dial.

953
1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:52.320
Thanks a lot for the awesome sequence. This was a somewhat complex or intellectual paper.

954
1:47:52.320 --> 1:47:58.280
I mean, they're all written, but this one was like challenging topics, a lot of different

955
1:47:58.280 --> 1:48:09.680
perspectives. And then not only did they hold it open for all of the different perspectives,

956
1:48:09.680 --> 1:48:17.960
but then rather than pick a winner, they flipped the table in the end and posed it not as

957
1:48:17.960 --> 1:48:29.320
an answered competition for us to then have like domain specific clarity of action within,

958
1:48:29.320 --> 1:48:38.880
but really a challenge on multiple levels for researchers who are familiar with FEP

959
1:48:38.880 --> 1:48:47.120
and not the big question we asked was, can the free energy principle help us advance

960
1:48:47.120 --> 1:48:54.680
or even resolve the long lasting debate on internal representation in philosophy of mind?

961
1:48:54.680 --> 1:49:08.200
We certainly asked. So if anybody has any last comments they want to make on anything,

962
1:49:08.200 --> 1:49:09.200
they're welcome to.

963
1:49:09.200 --> 1:49:18.520
The last word, so I'll get this in real quick. I think that we're still arguing about whether

964
1:49:18.520 --> 1:49:26.440
or not representation and modeling is heavily dependent, like that there is a dependency.

965
1:49:26.440 --> 1:49:35.840
I think that the more philosophical views that we see come up around FEP and active

966
1:49:35.840 --> 1:49:42.640
inference, the harder and harder it is to make the case that we can remove that dependency

967
1:49:42.640 --> 1:49:50.520
or somehow just see the scale free aspects of this tool, that there's actually a heavy

968
1:49:50.520 --> 1:49:56.880
dependency on what we're going to get out of representation or non-representation based

969
1:49:56.880 --> 1:50:03.120
on our awareness or our realization that every time we cross a boundary, that is just

970
1:50:03.120 --> 1:50:12.120
an independent act. That's a highly dependent act. So that'll be my last word.

971
1:50:12.120 --> 1:50:18.800
So I just want to give a final comment. We talk about instrumentalism and realism and

972
1:50:18.800 --> 1:50:25.640
then there's like third axis of utility. And I really think that this paper was super useful

973
1:50:25.640 --> 1:50:31.000
in prompting new questions and holding up these different views of representation and

974
1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:36.280
non-representation and in these different categories and allowing us to really kind of

975
1:50:36.280 --> 1:50:44.840
view them through like a partitioned framework that I think will drive future questions and

976
1:50:44.840 --> 1:50:51.480
really be useful in helping researchers formulate their theories.

977
1:50:51.480 --> 1:51:01.960
Danielle, you're still here. Thanks for joining for your first stream. Do you have any last

978
1:51:01.960 --> 1:51:02.960
comments?

979
1:51:02.960 --> 1:51:10.400
Well, this was a wonderful introduction. I'm curious how representative it is of other

980
1:51:10.400 --> 1:51:16.960
conversations. It was super heady in a really pleasant way.

981
1:51:16.960 --> 1:51:22.360
It was not representative or representational of other conversations. No. Thanks a lot for

982
1:51:22.360 --> 1:51:28.600
the awesome convo. Everyone's always welcome to join these discussions or other lab activities.

983
1:51:28.600 --> 1:51:48.040
So thanks again to the authors and all the participants here. See you.
