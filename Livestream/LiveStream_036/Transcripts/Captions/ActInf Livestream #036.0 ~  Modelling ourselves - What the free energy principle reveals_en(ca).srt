00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:27,985
>>>DANIEL FRIEDMAN: All right. Hello and welcome everyone.

2
00:00:28,167 --> 00:00:31,495
It is Active livestream number 360

3
00:00:31,572 --> 00:00:33,090
and it's January 13,

4
00:00:33,195 --> 00:00:37,485
2022. Welcome to actinF Lab.

5
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:39,940
We are a participatory online lab that

6
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:41,485
is communicating, learning, and

7
00:00:41,517 --> 00:00:43,350
practicing applied active inference.

8
00:00:43,425 --> 00:00:44,920

21
00:01:09,642 --> 00:01:12,960
up. Go to Activeinference.org

22
00:01:13,005 --> 00:01:14,985
to learn more about how to participate

23
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,830
in any of the lab activity or bring some

24
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:19,612
new idea to the lab.

25
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,970
Okay, here we are in livestream number

26
00:01:25,047 --> 00:01:27,820
36 in the second half of January 2022,

27
00:01:27,822 --> 00:01:31,045
and the goal is to learn and discuss

28
00:01:31,122 --> 00:01:33,870
this paper by Matt Sims and Giovanni

29
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,955
Pezzulo from 2021. The paper is called

30
00:01:37,152 --> 00:01:39,580
Modeling Ourselves what the Free Energy

31
00:01:39,627 --> 00:01:41,460
Principle Reveals about Our Implicit

32
00:01:41,505 --> 00:01:44,815
Notions of Representation. And as

33
00:01:44,832 --> 00:01:47,110
with all dot zero videos, the video is

34
00:01:47,142 --> 00:01:49,590
an introduction for some of the ideas

35
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,615
and a hasty review. So it's not a review

36
00:01:52,707 --> 00:01:54,790
or a final word. We're going to have the

37
00:01:54,807 --> 00:01:56,785
upcoming two weeks to talk more about

38
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:59,845
this paper and hopefully talk to some of

39
00:01:59,847 --> 00:02:01,465
the authors or any other people who are

40
00:02:01,482 --> 00:02:05,655
interested in this idea and get involved

41
00:02:05,715 --> 00:02:07,690
if you want to talk about the paper. So

42
00:02:07,707 --> 00:02:10,195
let's just start with saying hello and

43
00:02:10,272 --> 00:02:11,860
an introduction and then what we were

44
00:02:11,892 --> 00:02:13,890
excited to read about the paper. I'm

45
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,330
Daniel, I'm in California and was

46
00:02:16,377 --> 00:02:19,180
excited to read set another paper on

47
00:02:19,227 --> 00:02:21,490
representations and the FEP because it

48
00:02:21,507 --> 00:02:23,110
feels like we had a stretch back there

49
00:02:23,142 --> 00:02:25,765
of five in a row or something. What

50
00:02:25,782 --> 00:02:26,825
about you, Bleu?

51
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:33,255
>>>BLEU KNIGHT: I'm Bleu in New Mexico, and I

52
00:02:33,302 --> 00:02:35,985
really enjoyed Matt Sims paper on

53
00:02:36,017 --> 00:02:38,940
symbiosis that we did a while ago. And I

54
00:02:38,957 --> 00:02:41,562
thought this paper was really neat and

55
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,960
really a clear elucidation of the

56
00:02:45,992 --> 00:02:47,630
different categories of representation

57
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,115
and how, like, there's overarching,

58
00:02:49,145 --> 00:02:50,315
like representation and non

59
00:02:50,345 --> 00:02:52,160
representation and then several

60
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,045
different layers within that. So I

61
00:02:54,047 --> 00:02:55,455
thought it broke it down in a really

62
00:02:55,502 --> 00:02:57,920
clear and concise way, even though it's

63
00:02:57,935 --> 00:02:59,650
a lot of material to digest.

64
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:04,812
>>>DANIEL: You want to ask the big question?

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,210
Sure. The big question of the article

66
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,830
was can the free energy principle help

67
00:03:10,877 --> 00:03:13,335
us advance or even resolve the long

68
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:14,960
lasting debate on internal

69
00:03:15,005 --> 00:03:17,862
representation in philosophy of mind?

70
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,040
It's a long lasting debate. So this is

71
00:03:23,057 --> 00:03:26,145
like the zeros because it's clearly a

72
00:03:26,147 --> 00:03:27,780
topic you could spend a lot of time on.

73
00:03:27,827 --> 00:03:31,620
So that's our disclaimer. It's a

74
00:03:31,622 --> 00:03:33,990
long standing debate. But here's kind of

75
00:03:34,007 --> 00:03:36,905
a meme slide. So it's the first section

76
00:03:36,965 --> 00:03:40,710
of this paper right below the title. It

77
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:43,410
has this question from Walt Whitman and

78
00:03:43,442 --> 00:03:46,110
it says hold it up Sternly. See this?

79
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:49,287
It sends back who is it? Is it you?

80
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,365
And then here are several different

81
00:03:52,457 --> 00:03:55,380
images. And just think about your

82
00:03:55,427 --> 00:03:57,690
perception of these images and the

83
00:03:57,707 --> 00:03:59,160
cultural significance that you might

84
00:03:59,192 --> 00:04:01,335
attach to them. Or the way that black

85
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:03,390
and white pixels or gray pixels on a

86
00:04:03,407 --> 00:04:05,745
screen give the illusion of depth or

87
00:04:05,822 --> 00:04:07,340
mind you of an emergence that you've

88
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,080
never had. So that's kind of trippy and

89
00:04:10,127 --> 00:04:12,075
representation gets at some of those

90
00:04:12,212 --> 00:04:15,680
issues that's one nonphilosophical

91
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,440
take on it. What are they going to aim

92
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,240
to do in this debate which we're going

93
00:04:21,257 --> 00:04:25,005
to sketch out the sides of in this

94
00:04:25,052 --> 00:04:27,400
talk or I guess this discussion?

95
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,962
Do you want to read it Bleu or sure.

96
00:04:32,775 --> 00:04:35,480
The authors argue that even if the FEP

97
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,060
can't solve this long standing debate,

98
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,215
it can play an invaluable role in

99
00:04:40,232 --> 00:04:41,910
revealing our hidden assumptions about

100
00:04:41,942 --> 00:04:44,880
the very notion of representation and

101
00:04:45,002 --> 00:04:47,370
can create some common ground to discuss

102
00:04:47,447 --> 00:04:50,115
and negotiate them. So they say our

103
00:04:50,132 --> 00:04:51,990
general strategy is to use the FEP for

104
00:04:52,007 --> 00:04:53,955
concept clarification of different

105
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,055
notions of representation. We work

106
00:04:56,102 --> 00:04:58,065
backwards from representational or

107
00:04:58,082 --> 00:05:00,170
internal representation interpretation

108
00:05:00,335 --> 00:05:02,705
of the FEP's constructs to the various

109
00:05:02,765 --> 00:05:04,880
notions of representation that motivate

110
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,340
those interpretations. So they claim

111
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,090
that it emerges from their analysis that

112
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:11,865
the FEP has been or can be used to

113
00:05:11,882 --> 00:05:13,700
implement various kinds of computational

114
00:05:13,775 --> 00:05:16,185
models which satisfy the requirements of

115
00:05:16,217 --> 00:05:17,930
certain theories of representation.

116
00:05:18,065 --> 00:05:19,590
>>>BLEU: Hence, the question of whether or not

117
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:22,340
the FEP entails representations depends

118
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,330
on what notion of representation one

119
00:05:24,377 --> 00:05:27,900
uses in the first place. We're going to

120
00:05:27,962 --> 00:05:30,360
unpack that a lot, but just wanted to

121
00:05:30,392 --> 00:05:32,385
give the first coat of paint on what

122
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:33,990
they're aiming and what they claim to

123
00:05:34,007 --> 00:05:36,015
do. So I'll read the first half. The

124
00:05:36,032 --> 00:05:38,900
abstract predictive processing theories

125
00:05:38,975 --> 00:05:41,345
are increasingly popular in philosophy

126
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,090
of mind. Such process theory often gain

127
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,980
support from the free energy principle

128
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,785
FEP a normative principle for adaptive

129
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,570
selforganized systems. >>>DANIEL: Yet there is a

130
00:05:51,572 --> 00:05:53,475
current and much discussed debate about

131
00:05:53,537 --> 00:05:54,830
conflicting philosophical

132
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,915
interpretations of FEP. For example,

133
00:05:58,007 --> 00:05:59,435
representational versus

134
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,235
representational. Here we argue that

135
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:04,050
these different interpretations depend

136
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:05,760
on implicit assumptions about what

137
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:07,890
qualifies or fails to qualify as

138
00:06:07,982 --> 00:06:09,100
representational.

139
00:06:13,387 --> 00:06:16,602
>>>BLEU: The next part we deploy the FEP

140
00:06:16,707 --> 00:06:18,847
instrumentally to distinguish four main

141
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,367
notions of representation which focus on

142
00:06:21,415 --> 00:06:23,287
organizational, structural, content,

143
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,077
related and functional aspects

144
00:06:25,107 --> 00:06:27,352
respectively. The various ways that

145
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,077
these different aspects matter in

146
00:06:29,095 --> 00:06:30,577
arriving at representation action

147
00:06:30,595 --> 00:06:33,312
oriented representation, interpretation

148
00:06:33,462 --> 00:06:36,112
of the FEP area discussed. We also

149
00:06:36,175 --> 00:06:38,557
discuss how the FEP may be seen as a

150
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,747
unified view where terms that

151
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,992
traditionally belong to different

152
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,292
ontologies. For example, notions of

153
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,172
model and expectation versus notions of

154
00:06:48,205 --> 00:06:50,827
autopilsis and synchronization can be

155
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:53,197
harmonized. However, rather than

156
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,277
attempting to settle the

157
00:06:54,295 --> 00:06:56,022
representationalism versus non

158
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:58,347
representationalist debate and reveal

159
00:06:58,392 --> 00:06:59,862
something about internal representation are implication. 

160
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:03,192
This paper demonstrates

161
00:07:03,252 --> 00:07:05,227
how the free energy principle may be

162
00:07:05,245 --> 00:07:07,222
used to reveal something about those

163
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,427
partaking in the debate. Namely, what

164
00:07:09,445 --> 00:07:11,047
are hidden assumptions about internal

165
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,597
representation are assumptions that act

166
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,162
as sometimes antithetical starting

167
00:07:16,225 --> 00:07:18,762
points in this persistent philosophy

168
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:22,672
debate. There's really two or

169
00:07:22,705 --> 00:07:26,227
three pieces to this paper. There's an

170
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:29,377
introduction and an abstract. I guess we

171
00:07:29,395 --> 00:07:32,092
can delete that. >>>DANIEL: The first part

172
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,147
introduces a short summary on the free

173
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,175
energy principle and we'll see that

174
00:07:37,837 --> 00:07:41,162
Action Perception Recognition Model.

175
00:07:42,037 --> 00:07:45,562
The bulk of the paper is in these four

176
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:48,717
segments of each with a dynamics

177
00:07:48,852 --> 00:07:50,637
relationship of internal representation

178
00:07:50,712 --> 00:07:51,912
and the non representational

179
00:07:51,987 --> 00:07:54,277
perspectives. And that section is a lot

180
00:07:54,295 --> 00:07:56,467
like a literature review and a

181
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,587
philosophical taxonomy of different

182
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,437
perspectives and arguments related to

183
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,372
representation and the FEP. And these

184
00:08:04,405 --> 00:08:07,475
four subdivisions. There's then a

185
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,477
addendum on evolutionary function

186
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:14,692
specifically, and that's apt as nothing

187
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,357
in biology makes sense except in the

188
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,547
light of evolution, as they say. And

189
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,772
then section Five kind of turns a mirror

190
00:08:20,817 --> 00:08:24,082
back on the process and thought,

191
00:08:24,235 --> 00:08:26,527
just like those earlier images with the

192
00:08:26,545 --> 00:08:31,347
mirror. And that's where FEP differences

193
00:08:31,392 --> 00:08:34,497
in perspective are used almost as input

194
00:08:34,542 --> 00:08:37,692
data for theorizing and speculating

195
00:08:37,752 --> 00:08:39,727
about different things, which we'll get

196
00:08:39,745 --> 00:08:42,352
to. So that takes the authors then to

197
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,172
the conclusion. So it's a pretty wide

198
00:08:44,217 --> 00:08:47,482
ranging paper and the keywords that

199
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,002
are here are active inference in free

200
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,572
energy principle, predictive processing,

201
00:08:52,692 --> 00:08:54,552
generative model, internal

202
00:08:54,582 --> 00:08:56,427
representation, action oriented

203
00:08:56,457 --> 00:08:59,287
representation, inactivism forward

204
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:03,217
model, and Markov blanket's. There's no

205
00:09:03,265 --> 00:09:05,647
single path or single slide that would

206
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,822
do justice to all these keywords. So

207
00:09:07,855 --> 00:09:10,672
we're just going to kind of jump in and

208
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,322
knowing that some people will be really

209
00:09:12,355 --> 00:09:13,732
familiar with some of these terms and

210
00:09:13,735 --> 00:09:15,412
others will be hearing about them for

211
00:09:15,475 --> 00:09:18,717
the first time. So first the big topic

212
00:09:18,777 --> 00:09:22,177
is representation. Now this is just a

213
00:09:22,345 --> 00:09:25,177
quote from the paper. Whether or not

214
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,852
living organisms have or need internal

215
00:09:27,882 --> 00:09:29,772
representation is an old and fiercely

216
00:09:29,817 --> 00:09:32,962
debated topic. So we kind of like

217
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,342
unzipped that citation to add the titles

218
00:09:36,402 --> 00:09:37,852
and the links and just some of the

219
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,792
images from these citations. So if these

220
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,782
topics or any of this body of literature

221
00:09:43,872 --> 00:09:46,522
you feel like is well motivated or well

222
00:09:46,555 --> 00:09:48,502
reasoned or you've never been exposed to

223
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,727
it, that's sort of the continent we're

224
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:54,102
on. And it is such a large continuum.

225
00:09:54,207 --> 00:09:56,527
So the authors write such a debate is

226
00:09:56,545 --> 00:09:57,897
reiterated within the predictive

227
00:09:57,942 --> 00:09:59,677
processing view. So they're going to

228
00:09:59,695 --> 00:10:01,957
tell the story of representation from

229
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,042
predictive processing as sort of an

230
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:07,042
implicit starting point from a more

231
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,057
specific and mechanistic angle.

232
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:11,302
Assuming the FEP is a good model of

233
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,252
living organisms, does it entail the

234
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,052
notion of internal representation or

235
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,602
not? So it's almost like we're

236
00:10:16,632 --> 00:10:18,807
conditioning our analysis, whether it's

237
00:10:18,822 --> 00:10:21,817
a counterfactual or not, on FEP being

238
00:10:21,865 --> 00:10:24,337
used instrumentally. So we're going to

239
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,442
use it just like we would use a ruler,

240
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:28,537
not by questioning the ruler against

241
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,297
known objects, but by going to unknown

242
00:10:30,342 --> 00:10:32,227
objects and investigating them. So

243
00:10:32,245 --> 00:10:33,757
that's the way Zhat the FEP is going to

244
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,992
be used in this very large scale topic

245
00:10:38,127 --> 00:10:41,197
and complex area of representation. Any

246
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,575
comments? Lu all right, another big

247
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,052
topic and word that comes up in this

248
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,197
paper, but also a lot of other of our

249
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:54,397
discussions is enactivism. And so

250
00:10:54,505 --> 00:10:56,902
who better to hear it from than the

251
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,802
radicals? So Herek 2014.

252
00:10:59,907 --> 00:11:03,072
I think it's a thesis why radical

253
00:11:03,117 --> 00:11:05,317
enactivism is not radical enough, a case

254
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,927
for really radical inactivism. So take

255
00:11:07,945 --> 00:11:09,322
it up with the author. If this is

256
00:11:09,355 --> 00:11:11,152
oversimplifying or that's kind of the

257
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,702
joke appeal here, it is oversimplifying.

258
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:17,975
And here we see three different

259
00:11:18,337 --> 00:11:20,797
framework contrasted against each other

260
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,022
cognitivism, radical inactivism and then

261
00:11:24,055 --> 00:11:28,017
really radical inactivism. And cognition

262
00:11:28,077 --> 00:11:30,312
differs from an activism on the top row

263
00:11:30,387 --> 00:11:32,622
in that cognition says basic cognition

264
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:35,347
is representational and enactivism is

265
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,272
going to be rejecting that claim on all

266
00:11:38,305 --> 00:11:41,077
accounts. And then where this author is

267
00:11:41,095 --> 00:11:43,302
saying that you could even go further

268
00:11:43,482 --> 00:11:45,802
into the inactive camp or forest or

269
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,397
whatever is you could even deny that

270
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,497
linguistic cognition is

271
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:53,077
representational. So even if it looks

272
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,627
symbolic and it looks like it has some

273
00:11:55,645 --> 00:11:57,357
representational characteristic and it's

274
00:11:57,372 --> 00:11:59,137
the gray zone that makes people go, oh,

275
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,347
okay, maybe there is some redeeming

276
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:03,307
aspect of representation, you just have

277
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:06,772
to keep on denying it. So maybe

278
00:12:06,805 --> 00:12:08,302
we can pick that threat up again. But

279
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,937
that's sort of the lay of the land, of

280
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,577
maybe the center and activists, the

281
00:12:12,595 --> 00:12:18,147
moderates and then the extremists Bleu.

282
00:12:18,192 --> 00:12:21,112
Anything? Zhat no. It's so interesting

283
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:24,352
to really think about representation and

284
00:12:24,445 --> 00:12:25,627
the brain. I mean, coming from

285
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:27,277
neuroscience, actually okay, I'll add

286
00:12:27,295 --> 00:12:28,722
something coming from neuroscience,

287
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:30,500
it's interesting to really think about.

288
00:12:31,387 --> 00:12:34,062
>>>BLEU: I mean, the visual cortex is very unique

289
00:12:34,137 --> 00:12:36,702
in the sense that we know that there's

290
00:12:36,732 --> 00:12:39,772
representation that is replicated in the

291
00:12:39,805 --> 00:12:42,352
brain, but everywhere else, it's just

292
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,017
kind of like, you know, we've never

293
00:12:44,065 --> 00:12:46,447
found like the word for apple in the

294
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,142
brain somewhere. Like there's no, like,

295
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,227
apple neurons. So it's just an

296
00:12:50,245 --> 00:12:52,582
interesting I don't know, just a

297
00:12:52,585 --> 00:12:54,342
position, I guess, about representation

298
00:12:54,402 --> 00:12:57,292
and language, thinking about it in terms

299
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,637
of the brain. Also, one really important

300
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,352
aspect that we didn't mention is it's

301
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,312
about action. Like, it is basically

302
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:07,372
saying that action is related to

303
00:13:07,405 --> 00:13:08,722
embodiment and all these other things,

304
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,807
but enactivism is just focusing on

305
00:13:10,885 --> 00:13:12,800
action and what that means.

306
00:13:14,287 --> 00:13:16,522
>>>DANIEL: All right, free energy principle, which

307
00:13:16,555 --> 00:13:18,907
we're going to spend a lot of the

308
00:13:18,985 --> 00:13:21,447
discussion on. It's an integrative

309
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,027
proposal on adaptive self organizing

310
00:13:24,057 --> 00:13:25,252
systems that remain far from

311
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,622
thermodynamics equilibrium. So that

312
00:13:27,655 --> 00:13:29,437
would be cool if we had one common

313
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,167
framework for things that maybe were far

314
00:13:32,215 --> 00:13:34,252
or close to equilibrium. Currently, we

315
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,532
only have some of those areas of

316
00:13:36,535 --> 00:13:38,802
Faithbase. It starts from the premise

317
00:13:38,832 --> 00:13:40,267
that in order to survive, living

318
00:13:40,315 --> 00:13:42,852
organisms engage in reciprocal action

319
00:13:42,882 --> 00:13:44,227
perception exchanges with their

320
00:13:44,245 --> 00:13:47,272
environment. They must do what they can

321
00:13:47,305 --> 00:13:48,897
in order to remain within a neighborhood

322
00:13:48,942 --> 00:13:51,052
of viable states. That's kind of the

323
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,517
cybernetic regulator insight. Then the

324
00:13:54,565 --> 00:13:57,127
bottom paragraph, the idea is cast in

325
00:13:57,145 --> 00:13:58,642
Bayesian terms by assuming that

326
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,272
biological active state state the priors

327
00:14:01,317 --> 00:14:04,087
of the agents, the states that an agent

328
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,577
prefers to visit become the states that

329
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:10,242
Bit expects to visit. Hence minimizing

330
00:14:10,302 --> 00:14:12,052
surprise or its longterm average, which

331
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,577
is entropy becomes a primary imperative

332
00:14:14,607 --> 00:14:17,647
for living organisms as it permits them

333
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,947
to counteract an otherwise unavoidable

334
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,502
process of dimension and loss of

335
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,862
integrity, which kind of closes the loop

336
00:14:23,937 --> 00:14:26,022
back with the resistance to dissipation

337
00:14:26,142 --> 00:14:27,912
that was brought up in the beginning.

338
00:14:28,062 --> 00:14:30,897
So this is kind of one FEP boomerang

339
00:14:31,017 --> 00:14:33,487
from starting switch, a focus on

340
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:36,082
resisting distinctions and then moving

341
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,442
thought, the action of perception loop

342
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:41,527
to ecological preferences and facts of

343
00:14:41,545 --> 00:14:43,572
the reduction of uncertainty and thus

344
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:44,837
resisting dissipation.

345
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,427
A partitioning that is natural or

346
00:14:51,445 --> 00:14:54,367
at least complementary to the FEP is the

347
00:14:54,415 --> 00:14:58,932
Markov blanket partitioning. And we've

348
00:14:58,947 --> 00:15:00,725
talked about this in several other

349
00:15:01,087 --> 00:15:02,827
streams, so we won't go into it in too

350
00:15:02,845 --> 00:15:06,502
much detail. This is from 26. And the

351
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,872
Markov blanket condition, at least in

352
00:15:08,905 --> 00:15:12,350
its more narrow technical sense,

353
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:16,152
is referring to some set of nodes,

354
00:15:16,257 --> 00:15:18,962
representations, statistical variables.

355
00:15:19,912 --> 00:15:22,657
And that set of nodes that make up the

356
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,272
blanket makes some other sets of model,

357
00:15:25,317 --> 00:15:26,782
two other sets of nodes which we can

358
00:15:26,785 --> 00:15:27,927
call the internal and the external

359
00:15:27,957 --> 00:15:29,277
states. It makes those two sets

360
00:15:29,307 --> 00:15:31,842
conditionally independent and the edges

361
00:15:31,902 --> 00:15:35,612
are statistical influence Bleu.

362
00:15:36,787 --> 00:15:38,617
What else would you say about Mark

363
00:15:38,665 --> 00:15:40,252
Friston blanket? They say it here

364
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,772
beautifully. So the blanket states act

365
00:15:42,805 --> 00:15:45,097
as an informational boundary between

366
00:15:45,205 --> 00:15:47,727
internal and external states. And that's

367
00:15:47,757 --> 00:15:49,402
like the simplest way to think about it,

368
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,522
>>>BLEU: right? Like my skin acts as a barrier

369
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:52,927
between myself and the world. The

370
00:15:52,945 --> 00:15:55,337
blanket access as a barrier.

371
00:15:57,037 --> 00:16:00,667
Yes. Cool. Okay.

372
00:16:00,865 --> 00:16:04,582
>>>DANIEL: Leaving FEP land proper, we can

373
00:16:04,735 --> 00:16:08,017
zoom out to some related topics that

374
00:16:08,065 --> 00:16:09,402
sometimes get brought up in discussions

375
00:16:09,432 --> 00:16:12,802
of FEP but often don't. So first is the

376
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,042
predictive processing framework. This is

377
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,787
drawn from a citation that was in the

378
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,482
bibliography but not sure if it was in

379
00:16:20,485 --> 00:16:24,262
the text Hohwy 2020. And this is a

380
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,877
paper, New Directions in Predictive

381
00:16:26,907 --> 00:16:29,397
Processing. So predictive processing

382
00:16:29,442 --> 00:16:31,122
asserts that perceptual and cognitive

383
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:32,727
systems engage in prediction error

384
00:16:32,757 --> 00:16:35,247
minimization, enabling approximate

385
00:16:35,292 --> 00:16:38,737
Bayesian perceptual inference. And some,

386
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,462
but apparently not all authors emphasize

387
00:16:42,537 --> 00:16:45,322
action. So Clark and Howie famously and

388
00:16:45,355 --> 00:16:48,247
recently have emphasized that action is

389
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,002
essential to predictive processing in

390
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,147
the form of active inference, where the

391
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,312
system infers its own policies. So

392
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,617
really emphasizing that the predictions

393
00:16:58,677 --> 00:17:02,577
are not just about sensory inputs

394
00:17:02,757 --> 00:17:05,667
but causes of sensory input,

395
00:17:05,727 --> 00:17:08,352
hypotheses about latent unobserved

396
00:17:08,382 --> 00:17:11,272
causes in the world and also one's own

397
00:17:11,305 --> 00:17:13,327
action and policies, what one expects to

398
00:17:13,345 --> 00:17:15,892
do. And there's a really awesome

399
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:19,222
supplemental file for this paper that

400
00:17:19,255 --> 00:17:22,717
includes a great literature analysis and

401
00:17:22,765 --> 00:17:27,612
a lot of keywords and unique prediction

402
00:17:27,687 --> 00:17:30,427
and lists of empirical evidence. So this

403
00:17:30,445 --> 00:17:33,127
is really awesome work, and it'd be

404
00:17:33,145 --> 00:17:35,707
great to hear from people who study

405
00:17:35,785 --> 00:17:37,297
predictive processing or are more

406
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,802
familiar with it. How theory see it in

407
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,272
relationship to active inference and

408
00:17:41,305 --> 00:17:42,062
FEP,

409
00:17:44,962 --> 00:17:47,902
something that's in the overload of

410
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,767
predictive processing Bayesian

411
00:17:49,827 --> 00:17:51,672
statistical theories, active inference's

412
00:17:51,717 --> 00:17:53,737
is the idea of a generative model model.

413
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:58,112
So let's recall from DCM

414
00:17:58,462 --> 00:18:02,122
the dynamical causal modeling which

415
00:18:02,155 --> 00:18:05,377
we talked about in the previous weeks

416
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:09,817
in number 35. And here

417
00:18:09,865 --> 00:18:13,057
in DCM. It is an appealing to

418
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:14,632
biologically grounded models and

419
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,552
dynamical systems theory to create a

420
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,777
probabilistic generative model of hemo

421
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:21,142
dynamics fluctuations. So what is a

422
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,742
generative model? It's basically opposed

423
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:26,167
to a descriptive model. So why would one

424
00:18:26,215 --> 00:18:28,092
use the generative model in statistics?

425
00:18:28,152 --> 00:18:30,322
Because these types of models can be run

426
00:18:30,355 --> 00:18:32,917
in both directions. They can be fit from

427
00:18:32,965 --> 00:18:35,047
data, but they can also be used to

428
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,122
generate data and then they can be used

429
00:18:38,155 --> 00:18:39,772
in different ways because of that

430
00:18:39,805 --> 00:18:43,827
capacity. Lower dimensional generative

431
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:45,402
models can be very computationally

432
00:18:45,432 --> 00:18:48,622
efficient because they only have to be

433
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,572
updating a few parameters rather than

434
00:18:50,605 --> 00:18:52,042
keeping track of every single data

435
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:55,447
parameter and then a little bit more on

436
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,492
the interpretive layer or beyond the

437
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,757
merely statistical generative model.

438
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,952
Model capture some of these openended

439
00:19:02,982 --> 00:19:05,602
and creative or complex dynamics that

440
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,132
are associated with action and

441
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,547
perception and recognition model.

442
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,247
Therefore, there are links to not only

443
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,317
the cognitive sciences but also

444
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,277
philosophy and phenomenology. So it's

445
00:19:17,307 --> 00:19:20,272
kind of an idea from statistics that

446
00:19:20,305 --> 00:19:22,252
gets connected to some of the

447
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,517
fundamentals of neuroscience and

448
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:29,542
philosophy and anything

449
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,632
out of that Bleu. Yes. So just when I

450
00:19:32,635 --> 00:19:34,942
think of the generative model, having

451
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,547
listened to so many people describe it,

452
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:40,312
my favorite description is almost as

453
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,537
like the recognition model is more

454
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,402
like the hardware or the state space.

455
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,127
>>>BLEU: Then the generative model is like the

456
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,882
software, the action between them, or

457
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,127
like the dominoes and the stock dominoes

458
00:19:53,157 --> 00:19:55,102
and then the cascading wave. Right. So

459
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,967
the dominoes would be the Recognition

460
00:19:57,027 --> 00:19:58,657
model and then the generative model is

461
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,962
the relationship between them, the

462
00:20:00,025 --> 00:20:02,722
cascading wave of dominoes. I always

463
00:20:02,755 --> 00:20:04,752
like to use that analogy, just it's

464
00:20:04,782 --> 00:20:08,527
clear for me. And here's one

465
00:20:08,545 --> 00:20:11,857
more slide from 26 where the idea of

466
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,172
the Mark Cob blanket, which we pulled

467
00:20:14,217 --> 00:20:16,957
from 26 as well is connected to the idea

468
00:20:17,035 --> 00:20:20,722
of a generative model in the section on

469
00:20:20,755 --> 00:20:23,617
predictive processing. >>>DANIEL: And so in this

470
00:20:23,665 --> 00:20:26,227
paper so go check out number 26 or the

471
00:20:26,245 --> 00:20:28,072
paper on Bayesian mechanics to learn

472
00:20:28,105 --> 00:20:30,472
more. But the idea is that it's possible

473
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,042
to use the Markov blanket partitioning

474
00:20:33,177 --> 00:20:35,347
so that there's the blanket states

475
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:38,602
statistically isolating internal and

476
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,717
external states. And then there might be

477
00:20:40,765 --> 00:20:43,377
some systems where those partitioned

478
00:20:43,407 --> 00:20:46,672
internal states are acting as if they

479
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:49,747
are doing inference on external states.

480
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:53,607
So that would be like if I said I'm

481
00:20:53,622 --> 00:20:55,252
going to hold up three fingers and put

482
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,892
it behind my back. And then you had a

483
00:20:58,015 --> 00:21:01,282
generative model that was about what was

484
00:21:01,285 --> 00:21:03,282
the state of that unobserved variable.

485
00:21:03,447 --> 00:21:06,982
And that's something to look more into

486
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,727
from the details on generative model as

487
00:21:09,745 --> 00:21:11,677
with other papers. And that kind of

488
00:21:11,695 --> 00:21:14,677
brings us to our last keyword, which is

489
00:21:14,845 --> 00:21:17,782
active inference. So we'll go into a

490
00:21:17,785 --> 00:21:19,700
little more detail here.

491
00:21:21,337 --> 00:21:23,247
They describe that active inference

492
00:21:23,292 --> 00:21:26,497
agents are selfevident, which is to say

493
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,717
that because minimizing free energy over

494
00:21:28,765 --> 00:21:30,627
time is equivalent to maximizing

495
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:33,147
Bayesian model evidence or evidence

496
00:21:33,342 --> 00:21:36,522
encoding. In longterm active inference,

497
00:21:36,567 --> 00:21:40,087
agents seek out or generate those

498
00:21:40,225 --> 00:21:42,097
sensory samples that maximize the lower

499
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,647
bound on the evidence for an implicit

500
00:21:43,692 --> 00:21:45,322
model of how their sensory states were

501
00:21:45,355 --> 00:21:47,847
generated. As such, active inference

502
00:21:47,892 --> 00:21:49,672
agents author evidence for their own

503
00:21:49,705 --> 00:21:51,712
continued existence via free energy

504
00:21:51,775 --> 00:21:56,052
minimizing model minimization. So active

505
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:58,612
inference is using statistics to

506
00:21:58,675 --> 00:22:01,597
operationalize some of the information,

507
00:22:01,705 --> 00:22:05,277
thermodynamics formalisms of the FEP.

508
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,797
So it would be a more narrow

509
00:22:07,842 --> 00:22:11,152
interpretation that Zhat carries no or

510
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,632
little philosophical baggage or claims

511
00:22:13,647 --> 00:22:15,577
to how the world really is. It would be

512
00:22:15,595 --> 00:22:18,357
a more broad or stronger interpretation

513
00:22:18,447 --> 00:22:20,902
to think that this is capturing actual

514
00:22:20,995 --> 00:22:22,912
information dynamics or the actual

515
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:25,947
thermodynamics relationships of systems.

516
00:22:25,992 --> 00:22:29,107
But the instrumental usage is more of a

517
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,297
statistical similarity or at least

518
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:34,822
attractability argument. And that is

519
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:36,907
not without precedent, not even close,

520
00:22:36,985 --> 00:22:39,147
because the variational Bayesian

521
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:42,937
methods, which minimize or optimize this

522
00:22:43,075 --> 00:22:44,572
quantity called the evidence lower

523
00:22:44,605 --> 00:22:46,902
bound, start maximizing the lower bound

524
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:50,392
for how good the evidence is. And others

525
00:22:50,515 --> 00:22:53,392
in many places have motivated this

526
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,397
fundamental component of modern Bayesian

527
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:58,717
statistics from multiple different

528
00:22:58,765 --> 00:23:00,792
areas. And it's kind of like equations

529
00:23:00,852 --> 00:23:02,602
are true, so equations can be linked to

530
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,447
each other. And it's just kind of cool

531
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,512
that these KL divergences as well as

532
00:23:08,575 --> 00:23:11,272
free energy and the information or

533
00:23:11,305 --> 00:23:14,262
description length criterion all align.

534
00:23:14,337 --> 00:23:16,362
And that's not even like an active

535
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:19,702
synthesis. Applying that to

536
00:23:19,795 --> 00:23:23,947
inference on action is something that is

537
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,127
bringing together a lot of these ideas

538
00:23:26,157 --> 00:23:28,657
from variational Bayesian methods with a

539
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,642
lot of ideas from control theory,

540
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:33,102
cybernetics enactivism, etc.

541
00:23:33,282 --> 00:23:36,622
And again, we can explore back and find

542
00:23:36,655 --> 00:23:38,422
out which ideas came from where. But

543
00:23:38,455 --> 00:23:40,627
just to keep in mind is Zhat. These

544
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,452
pieces were not tied together by active.

545
00:23:43,557 --> 00:23:45,457
Those are excellent relationships in the

546
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,282
literature. But active does integrate

547
00:23:48,447 --> 00:23:50,497
the free energy principle and that

548
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,417
center meme that they started with,

549
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,737
that things have to resist distinctions

550
00:23:55,087 --> 00:23:58,897
with all of this philosophy and

551
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:01,222
more quantitative area zhat have to do

552
00:24:01,255 --> 00:24:03,952
with action and perception. And then in

553
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:06,022
the dot one and dot two cell go more

554
00:24:06,055 --> 00:24:09,322
into the variational and expected free

555
00:24:09,355 --> 00:24:12,577
energy, but kind of wanted to just give

556
00:24:12,595 --> 00:24:14,082
a little thought on active inference.

557
00:24:14,097 --> 00:24:15,772
And if someone has a different thought,

558
00:24:15,805 --> 00:24:18,547
it'd be awesome to hear it as well. But

559
00:24:18,655 --> 00:24:22,625
this paper was very precise and very

560
00:24:24,187 --> 00:24:26,902
subtle in how I thought about some of

561
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,897
these areas. So I think it's really good

562
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,592
to be clear about what we're talking

563
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,825
about in this case.

564
00:24:35,887 --> 00:24:39,350
Okay, onto the paper. All right.

565
00:24:40,537 --> 00:24:43,027
So this is going to be a flow role of

566
00:24:43,045 --> 00:24:46,302
the introduction. There's a growing

567
00:24:46,332 --> 00:24:48,357
consensus in computational and systems,

568
00:24:48,372 --> 00:24:50,272
in neuroscience around the idea. The

569
00:24:50,305 --> 00:24:52,452
brain is a predictive machine which uses

570
00:24:52,482 --> 00:24:53,827
internal or generative models to

571
00:24:53,845 --> 00:24:55,252
continuously generate prediction in

572
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,677
service of prediction, action and

573
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:58,897
learning. So starting with the idea of

574
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,947
prediction second sentence.

575
00:25:02,142 --> 00:25:04,497
One of the ways Zhat people are studying

576
00:25:04,617 --> 00:25:07,377
prediction in the brain is predictive

577
00:25:07,407 --> 00:25:09,232
processing. So we talked about that a

578
00:25:09,235 --> 00:25:10,250
few minutes ago,

579
00:25:12,337 --> 00:25:14,997
the free free energy principle extending

580
00:25:15,042 --> 00:25:17,377
predictive processing by providing it

581
00:25:17,395 --> 00:25:19,422
with a fundamental principle of adaptive

582
00:25:19,467 --> 00:25:21,387
self organization that's the resist

583
00:25:21,462 --> 00:25:23,247
dissipation meme that isn't

584
00:25:23,292 --> 00:25:24,852
intrinsically within predictive

585
00:25:24,882 --> 00:25:26,422
processing framework which might

586
00:25:26,455 --> 00:25:29,532
describe audio processing in a radar

587
00:25:29,622 --> 00:25:32,857
signal. And so that

588
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:36,357
union of FEP and predictive processing

589
00:25:36,522 --> 00:25:39,352
are starting to become prominent outside

590
00:25:39,445 --> 00:25:41,902
of systems neuroscience, which might

591
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,525
seem like their natural niche or origin,

592
00:25:45,187 --> 00:25:47,277
but it's also the case that philosophy

593
00:25:47,307 --> 00:25:48,772
in the philosophy of mind are starting

594
00:25:48,805 --> 00:25:53,502
to think about it. And despite

595
00:25:53,532 --> 00:25:55,872
that attention, the authors are arguing

596
00:25:55,917 --> 00:25:59,837
that some of the implication for FEP's

597
00:26:01,237 --> 00:26:04,222
existence remain widely debated. I think

598
00:26:04,255 --> 00:26:07,527
we can agree on that. And they're

599
00:26:07,557 --> 00:26:09,327
going to focus on one of the prominent

600
00:26:09,357 --> 00:26:10,702
discussions that they think is the most

601
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,027
prominent, which is whether the FEP is

602
00:26:13,045 --> 00:26:16,252
representational or representational and

603
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,867
then to what extent. It is also learning

604
00:26:18,927 --> 00:26:22,422
on debates related to internalism action

605
00:26:22,467 --> 00:26:25,377
orientation and activism. So just it's

606
00:26:25,407 --> 00:26:26,727
all over the map. It's a multi

607
00:26:26,757 --> 00:26:28,777
dimensional philosophy force base with

608
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:31,722
the FEP and it's not totally resolved,

609
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:33,487
but that's what they're going to go into

610
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,562
in this parse.

611
00:26:37,312 --> 00:26:38,075
Okay.

612
00:26:42,412 --> 00:26:46,267
>>>BLEU: Bleu so they

613
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:48,657
note here that philosophical discussions

614
00:26:48,747 --> 00:26:51,957
or representation wars about the FEP

615
00:26:52,047 --> 00:26:54,007
have typically been focused on four

616
00:26:54,085 --> 00:26:56,712
aspects of the notion of representation.

617
00:26:56,862 --> 00:26:58,522
So these four aspects are

618
00:26:58,555 --> 00:27:00,907
organizational, structural, content

619
00:27:00,985 --> 00:27:05,707
related or functional. And the

620
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,597
organizational aspects have some

621
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,982
variable inside a system that's

622
00:27:08,997 --> 00:27:10,767
separated from that which it represents.

623
00:27:10,827 --> 00:27:13,977
Outside the system, structural aspects

624
00:27:14,082 --> 00:27:16,072
have representational vehicles that are

625
00:27:16,105 --> 00:27:17,977
structurally similar to the state of

626
00:27:17,995 --> 00:27:19,447
affairs in the world. Zhat they stand

627
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,677
for contentrelated aspects have internal

628
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:25,122
models that either encode environmental

629
00:27:25,167 --> 00:27:26,997
contingencies or sensory motor

630
00:27:27,042 --> 00:27:29,227
contingencies, specification or

631
00:27:29,245 --> 00:27:31,327
description of how the world is taken to

632
00:27:31,345 --> 00:27:33,352
be in turn analyzed in terms of

633
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,497
correctness or truth conditions. And

634
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,327
>>>BLEU: then the functional aspects support

635
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:40,092
vicarious use before or in the absence

636
00:27:40,152 --> 00:27:43,107
of external events of internal variables

637
00:27:43,122 --> 00:27:45,137
of a model. Whoa.

638
00:27:46,537 --> 00:27:50,542
Yep, bit is kind of a woe, but this four

639
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:53,407
field distinction is the structure of

640
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:56,152
the paper. So we're going to do a few

641
00:27:56,245 --> 00:27:58,912
fun things to help understand this

642
00:27:58,975 --> 00:28:00,877
because it is the contribution and the

643
00:28:00,895 --> 00:28:03,057
structure of the paper. So everyone's

644
00:28:03,072 --> 00:28:04,972
going to interpret all of this in their

645
00:28:05,005 --> 00:28:06,997
own way, which is awesome, but we do

646
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,977
really want to be clear about what the

647
00:28:08,995 --> 00:28:12,667
author's contributions are. >>>DANIEL: So in an

648
00:28:12,715 --> 00:28:14,832
almost unprecedented maneuver, we're

649
00:28:14,847 --> 00:28:18,037
gain to go to the end of the paper first

650
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,152
and then also have the figures out of

651
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:22,777
order. We're going to start with what we

652
00:28:22,795 --> 00:28:24,552
can learn from this debate. So if you're

653
00:28:24,582 --> 00:28:25,807
not sure if you want to listen to the

654
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:28,162
next like 40 minutes on going into this

655
00:28:28,225 --> 00:28:31,522
four Bull distinction, you get it up

656
00:28:31,555 --> 00:28:34,792
front. So they're going to review some

657
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,492
of the most prominent philosophical

658
00:28:36,552 --> 00:28:39,727
interpretations of the FEP. They then

659
00:28:39,895 --> 00:28:42,852
summarize those interpretation according

660
00:28:42,882 --> 00:28:44,902
to the four different categories. Zhat

661
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,977
Bleu just red for each of

662
00:28:47,995 --> 00:28:49,777
those categories, they're going to

663
00:28:49,795 --> 00:28:52,972
consider multiple constructs of FEP, so

664
00:28:53,005 --> 00:28:56,907
kind of tools in the FEP toolkit system.

665
00:28:57,072 --> 00:29:00,772
And they're going to argue that

666
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,817
depending on which perspective you take

667
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,367
on which of these categories and which

668
00:29:06,415 --> 00:29:07,597
constructs, you're going to come to

669
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:08,827
different conclusions about the

670
00:29:08,845 --> 00:29:11,082
representational or representational

671
00:29:11,172 --> 00:29:14,002
nature of the FEP. So it's kind of like

672
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:19,287
a checkerboard that's their first salvo

673
00:29:19,437 --> 00:29:22,737
is we're going to outline a flowchart

674
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:25,882
and a grid and a structure, like a

675
00:29:25,885 --> 00:29:28,822
taxonomy of philosophy, ideas related to

676
00:29:29,005 --> 00:29:32,272
this triple dimensional space

677
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,937
of aspects of representation,

678
00:29:35,362 --> 00:29:37,702
constructs of the FEP and then the

679
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,727
categorical variable representational or

680
00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:42,712
non representational claims. And then

681
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:45,552
the whole second part is saying we're

682
00:29:45,582 --> 00:29:48,837
going to use that three dimensional

683
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:53,877
phase space to shine a light on one's

684
00:29:53,907 --> 00:29:55,992
own implicit notions of representation.

685
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,502
So that's kind of like the looking in

686
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,877
the mirror strange loop part. But the

687
00:30:00,895 --> 00:30:03,132
first part is more like a philosophical

688
00:30:03,222 --> 00:30:06,142
literature analysis. And their

689
00:30:06,265 --> 00:30:09,517
contribution in figure two is to

690
00:30:09,565 --> 00:30:11,997
make this awesome flow chart.

691
00:30:12,192 --> 00:30:15,772
So this is going to funnel you from the

692
00:30:15,805 --> 00:30:19,047
start in the four different domains,

693
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:21,222
four aspects, variational, structural

694
00:30:21,267 --> 00:30:23,842
content and function. And then from

695
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,972
those four starting points, kind of like

696
00:30:26,005 --> 00:30:27,997
sorry board, you're going to get

697
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:31,812
funneled towards representational

698
00:30:31,887 --> 00:30:34,762
or representational FEP, depending on

699
00:30:34,825 --> 00:30:36,577
decisions. And that's what we're going

700
00:30:36,595 --> 00:30:41,767
to unpack in the next sections because

701
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:45,342
again, it's kind of like trippy

702
00:30:45,402 --> 00:30:47,047
and there's a lot to think about. This

703
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,807
is going to be our map. So it's going to

704
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:51,792
be at the bottom of all of the upcoming

705
00:30:51,852 --> 00:30:56,667
slides, which of these eight sections

706
00:30:56,727 --> 00:30:58,897
were in. It's like a cube divided in

707
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:02,317
eight little cubes or two

708
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,597
tetrahedral or some other pattern. But

709
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,067
basically we're going to see whether

710
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:08,352
we're in like representation camp or non

711
00:31:08,382 --> 00:31:10,962
representation camp and which aspects

712
00:31:11,112 --> 00:31:13,372
we're focused on. And then here's that

713
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:14,677
table, but it's just the tip of the

714
00:31:14,695 --> 00:31:18,847
iceberg. So how can we organize our

715
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,047
thinking around philosophy and increase

716
00:31:22,092 --> 00:31:24,847
the rigor and the accessibility of

717
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,052
different arguments? Because it can be

718
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:30,247
difficult sometimes to parse it

719
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:34,282
in long texts. And so

720
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,172
the authors clearly thought a lot about

721
00:31:36,205 --> 00:31:38,797
this. So it's a really pleasure to read

722
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,302
about it and learn about it. And the

723
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,467
flowchart is a great addition. So that

724
00:31:44,515 --> 00:31:47,017
is going to be our map in the coming

725
00:31:47,065 --> 00:31:47,762
slides,

726
00:31:50,212 --> 00:31:51,607
right? Thanks for making such a

727
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:54,187
beautiful map. I have to say I had

728
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,077
pasted a whole bunch of these ideas and

729
00:31:56,095 --> 00:31:58,557
tried to categorize them and then Daniel

730
00:31:58,647 --> 00:32:00,037
constructed them into this beautiful

731
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,577
flowchart. Well, they made the flow

732
00:32:02,607 --> 00:32:04,497
chart, I made the grid. The grid.

733
00:32:04,542 --> 00:32:06,437
>>>BLEU: That's what I meant, the grid. The grid.

734
00:32:06,937 --> 00:32:09,052
Before we see the grid in action now,

735
00:32:09,145 --> 00:32:12,147
let's just recall this action perception

736
00:32:12,192 --> 00:32:14,002
loop. And we're not going to go into it

737
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,432
right now, but that's definitely for dot

738
00:32:15,447 --> 00:32:19,752
one and dot two. What are these nodes

739
00:32:19,782 --> 00:32:23,392
and edges and which can and can't happen

740
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,287
and what do they representation. >>>DANIEL: So that

741
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,947
is sort of the partitioning that we're

742
00:32:28,992 --> 00:32:30,472
going to be working within, which we

743
00:32:30,505 --> 00:32:31,807
brought up a little earlier with the

744
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:33,322
Markov blanket and in a lot of our other

745
00:32:33,355 --> 00:32:37,177
discussions. Okay, so let us start

746
00:32:37,345 --> 00:32:40,775
in this top left square.

747
00:32:41,662 --> 00:32:45,027
So this is the organizational aspect,

748
00:32:45,207 --> 00:32:47,612
the representational perspective.

749
00:32:48,187 --> 00:32:51,875
So the organizational aspect is

750
00:32:53,737 --> 00:32:56,017
describing how variables inside a system

751
00:32:56,065 --> 00:32:57,942
are separated from what it represents

752
00:32:58,002 --> 00:33:00,322
outside the system. So that's like the

753
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:03,652
architectural take

754
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,427
on representations. I don't know is it

755
00:33:06,445 --> 00:33:09,697
classic representations but internal

756
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:13,017
representation camp are going to argue

757
00:33:13,077 --> 00:33:15,727
zhat internal states are segregated from

758
00:33:15,745 --> 00:33:18,147
the external world via Markov blanket.

759
00:33:18,342 --> 00:33:21,622
Therefore the brain activity cast as

760
00:33:21,655 --> 00:33:24,052
internal states do represent what it

761
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:27,922
doesn't have access to Bleu, what do you

762
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:31,175
think? Or anything else to add on it?

763
00:33:33,412 --> 00:33:35,242
>>>BLEU: Nothing I want to delve into here

764
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:36,622
because I'm going to save it for that

765
00:33:36,655 --> 00:33:40,037
one. Okay. Okay. In contrast,

766
00:33:40,987 --> 00:33:43,192
there's other people and other

767
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,627
perspectives who are going to,

768
00:33:46,795 --> 00:33:49,197
in the organizational aspect, take a non

769
00:33:49,242 --> 00:33:52,567
representational perspective. And so

770
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,502
philosophers of the ecological and

771
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,322
activity persuasion have approached that

772
00:33:57,355 --> 00:34:01,147
same Markov blanket formalism and

773
00:34:01,255 --> 00:34:03,907
basically framed it in terms of

774
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,897
representational view of the FEP.

775
00:34:07,017 --> 00:34:09,247
>>>DANIEL: Like Yellow Brunerberg's paper, the

776
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,082
anticipating brain is not a scientist

777
00:34:11,172 --> 00:34:13,272
free energy principle from an ecological

778
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:16,717
and active perspective. So they argue in

779
00:34:16,765 --> 00:34:18,922
those papers, in a lot of papers by

780
00:34:18,955 --> 00:34:23,047
Yellow and others, that just

781
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,407
because you deploy the Markov blanket

782
00:34:25,422 --> 00:34:28,452
formalism it doesn't imply the behavior

783
00:34:28,482 --> 00:34:30,127
of the system is best explained by

784
00:34:30,145 --> 00:34:32,022
inferences generated by an internal

785
00:34:32,067 --> 00:34:34,297
model, the structure of which is

786
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:36,650
representing that, which is a model of.

787
00:34:37,012 --> 00:34:39,652
So read the papers for more detail. But

788
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,400
it's like,

789
00:34:43,087 --> 00:34:46,342
it's an interesting idea and it was also

790
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:49,775
interesting to read from this paper that

791
00:34:52,912 --> 00:34:56,692
the restatement of this argument that

792
00:34:56,815 --> 00:34:58,452
these partially informationally

793
00:34:58,482 --> 00:34:59,977
encapsulated systems like we talked

794
00:34:59,995 --> 00:35:03,477
about in 35 are parsimoniously

795
00:35:03,507 --> 00:35:05,197
understood in terms of achieving high

796
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,852
relative mutual information between the

797
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,502
non representational process of

798
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,467
generalized synchrony and Huygens 1673,

799
00:35:14,665 --> 00:35:17,152
the pendulum clock. So you can get like

800
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:19,637
oscillating pendulums that synchronize

801
00:35:20,212 --> 00:35:22,222
but they don't have representations of

802
00:35:22,255 --> 00:35:24,875
each other. Now maybe you need

803
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:28,702
representations to do something else but

804
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,822
that kind of gets to that enactivism

805
00:35:30,867 --> 00:35:32,977
radical and activist debate. So we'll go

806
00:35:32,995 --> 00:35:34,792
more into it later. Just kind of cool

807
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:39,097
old citation and interesting idea.

808
00:35:39,205 --> 00:35:41,857
So based upon the organization of the

809
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,402
system, there area people who say,

810
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,877
yeah, the FEP is representational of

811
00:35:45,895 --> 00:35:47,452
course because the internal states are

812
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:50,197
isolated or no, because you can get high

813
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,832
mutual information without

814
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:55,100
representation. All right,

815
00:35:56,137 --> 00:35:58,147
that's like what Dean called nine

816
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:01,857
o'clocking, it's 09:00.

817
00:36:01,947 --> 00:36:04,100
>>>BLEU: That's general synchrony. Exactly.

818
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,632
There doesn't need to be a

819
00:36:05,635 --> 00:36:09,082
representation of brushing the teeth in

820
00:36:09,085 --> 00:36:12,287
the mind or anything of the reader.

821
00:36:13,687 --> 00:36:16,477
Okay. Onto the second aspect, the

822
00:36:16,495 --> 00:36:18,382
structural aspects. >>>DANIEL: So the question to

823
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:19,722
be addressed is whether generative

824
00:36:19,767 --> 00:36:21,727
models are structurally similar to their

825
00:36:21,745 --> 00:36:24,997
targets or accuracy descriptions of

826
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:29,262
external reality or whether models

827
00:36:29,337 --> 00:36:31,602
needn't be accurate but merely adequate

828
00:36:31,707 --> 00:36:35,172
enough to leverage for adaptive behavior

829
00:36:35,217 --> 00:36:37,567
control. So does. It actually need to

830
00:36:37,615 --> 00:36:39,875
representation the thing?

831
00:36:40,987 --> 00:36:43,507
Or can bit be just some other

832
00:36:43,585 --> 00:36:46,957
representation that is

833
00:36:47,035 --> 00:36:50,647
effective enough? So here's the

834
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,782
pro and the con for representational.

835
00:36:52,872 --> 00:36:56,825
On one slot, the top

836
00:36:57,337 --> 00:36:59,675
structural representationalist view

837
00:37:00,037 --> 00:37:02,002
argues that the generative model has to

838
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,682
have some structural resemblance with a

839
00:37:03,685 --> 00:37:05,547
generative process in order to be useful

840
00:37:05,592 --> 00:37:07,642
for control purposes that's really

841
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:10,467
related to the good regulator theorem

842
00:37:10,527 --> 00:37:11,912
from Cybernetics.

843
00:37:14,812 --> 00:37:18,057
And so the argument there is you're

844
00:37:18,072 --> 00:37:19,587
gain to need the good representation

845
00:37:19,662 --> 00:37:22,897
about it in order to be on the

846
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:25,562
right page in complex environments.

847
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:30,362
Others disagree.

848
00:37:30,862 --> 00:37:33,352
So here's one line of argument that the

849
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,932
formal constructs in active inference

850
00:37:34,947 --> 00:37:36,672
and specifically the generative density

851
00:37:36,717 --> 00:37:40,197
G, if it's understood correctly,

852
00:37:40,242 --> 00:37:41,602
according to some authors, it would turn

853
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:44,467
out to internal representation. Those

854
00:37:44,515 --> 00:37:46,752
authors suggested REM sad at all 2019,

855
00:37:46,857 --> 00:37:48,427
that generative models do not meet the

856
00:37:48,445 --> 00:37:49,722
requirements of structural

857
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,227
representations where some internal

858
00:37:52,257 --> 00:37:53,782
structure replicates some structure of

859
00:37:53,785 --> 00:37:55,627
the generative process. So the

860
00:37:55,645 --> 00:37:58,312
generative model is the organism's model

861
00:37:58,375 --> 00:38:01,102
of action. The generative process is the

862
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,077
actual world out there, the niche that's

863
00:38:04,107 --> 00:38:06,277
giving rise to observations. And so, in

864
00:38:06,295 --> 00:38:08,407
other words, you might be I don't know

865
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:11,542
if this might be a mal example, but like

866
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:13,747
to run, you don't need to have an

867
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,367
abstract representation of your own

868
00:38:15,415 --> 00:38:18,907
body. You merely need the

869
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:22,325
action interactions with your body.

870
00:38:22,762 --> 00:38:25,147
And so this is kind of arguing that the

871
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:28,482
internal generative density G active

872
00:38:28,647 --> 00:38:31,242
doesn't have to have any resemblance

873
00:38:31,302 --> 00:38:34,077
structure to even the problem which it's

874
00:38:34,107 --> 00:38:35,612
being deployed to solve.

875
00:38:36,937 --> 00:38:39,627
Well, and this always goes to the map

876
00:38:39,732 --> 00:38:41,317
and the territory and active inference

877
00:38:41,365 --> 00:38:43,597
between the map and the territory. So

878
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,092
structural similarity, what does that

879
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:50,482
mean? >>>BLEU: Right. So how similar?

880
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,072
Is there some metric that you're using

881
00:38:52,105 --> 00:38:54,727
for structural similarity? How similar

882
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,202
is the map of the United States to the

883
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,097
actual United States? Right? And so what

884
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,377
does that even mean? Structure

885
00:39:01,407 --> 00:39:05,667
similarity? Sorry, I'm probably poking

886
00:39:05,727 --> 00:39:09,667
the fire bit. Let's hear

887
00:39:09,715 --> 00:39:13,152
from Alex Kilner or Maxwell

888
00:39:13,182 --> 00:39:15,597
or anyone else who feels really strongly

889
00:39:15,642 --> 00:39:17,572
about this issue because we've had some

890
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,222
fun talks on it before. And it's just I

891
00:39:22,255 --> 00:39:24,232
just like seeing the pro and the con

892
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:28,092
laid out together. >>>DANIEL: And then the authors

893
00:39:28,152 --> 00:39:29,000
were very.

894
00:39:31,687 --> 00:39:33,202
>>>BLEU: I just like arguing what is the

895
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,107
difference between the pro and the con?

896
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,282
I want somebody to draw the line for me

897
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,907
what is similar and what is not similar.

898
00:39:39,985 --> 00:39:43,507
Enough niche. Okay, now to the third

899
00:39:43,585 --> 00:39:46,412
aspect. So this is the content related

900
00:39:46,762 --> 00:39:47,612
aspects.

901
00:39:51,712 --> 00:39:54,487
>>>DANIEL: Whether the generative models need to

902
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:56,877
explicitly model the ways external

903
00:39:56,907 --> 00:39:59,652
states produce sensations, aka

904
00:39:59,682 --> 00:40:01,597
environmental models, or the ways that

905
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,822
actions produce sensations or sensory

906
00:40:03,867 --> 00:40:05,087
motor models,

907
00:40:07,087 --> 00:40:09,652
this is very closely related to the

908
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:13,372
previous aspect. So I think it be

909
00:40:13,405 --> 00:40:14,977
cool to unpack a little more. But

910
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:18,275
theorem is a little bit of nuance with

911
00:40:19,237 --> 00:40:22,077
sensory motor systems,

912
00:40:22,257 --> 00:40:25,122
which we talked about in several places,

913
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:27,062
like skilled performance.

914
00:40:27,862 --> 00:40:31,177
And basically this

915
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:34,492
is just one subargument within this

916
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:37,827
section, a pro and a Zhang and they're

917
00:40:37,857 --> 00:40:39,447
talking about essentially skilled

918
00:40:39,492 --> 00:40:42,237
performance, how sensory motor models

919
00:40:42,312 --> 00:40:44,217
can afford sophisticated cognitive

920
00:40:44,277 --> 00:40:48,642
processing. And so the first agreement

921
00:40:48,702 --> 00:40:53,022
here is that here comes that same Jelle

922
00:40:53,067 --> 00:40:55,917
Bruineberg 2016 paper the anticipating

923
00:40:55,977 --> 00:40:58,522
brain is not a scientist saying that,

924
00:40:58,555 --> 00:41:00,277
yeah, actually sensory motor loops. If

925
00:41:00,295 --> 00:41:02,392
you're going to trust the story for one

926
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,797
level of analysis, then why are more so

927
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,672
called complex behavior, not just more

928
00:41:07,705 --> 00:41:09,967
complex combinations of modules which

929
00:41:10,015 --> 00:41:13,242
don't appeal to any representational

930
00:41:13,377 --> 00:41:17,077
content? And then the

931
00:41:17,095 --> 00:41:18,922
sensory motor dynamics created by those

932
00:41:18,955 --> 00:41:20,952
models may be progressively internalized

933
00:41:20,982 --> 00:41:23,082
to support mental operations detached

934
00:41:23,097 --> 00:41:25,147
from the sensory motorcycle. So maybe

935
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,722
like walking and chewing gum or

936
00:41:26,755 --> 00:41:28,627
something like that, or maybe think

937
00:41:28,645 --> 00:41:31,257
about like an insect flying or walking

938
00:41:31,347 --> 00:41:32,982
and how much of that is just the shape

939
00:41:32,997 --> 00:41:35,752
of its body in motion and just the way

940
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:38,152
that the muscles and the joints just

941
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:40,777
like flex. And so ascribing the total

942
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:43,017
motion of every joint to cognition

943
00:41:43,077 --> 00:41:46,807
actions just is probably asking

944
00:41:46,885 --> 00:41:50,272
too much of cognition. Unless taking

945
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,797
embodied and morphological computation

946
00:41:52,917 --> 00:41:55,775
as another type of computation and then

947
00:41:56,662 --> 00:41:59,912
firing back for the representationalism

948
00:42:01,987 --> 00:42:05,302
is coming from the area of

949
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,722
schema theory which is where there

950
00:42:08,755 --> 00:42:11,202
is a nucleus of sensory motor models,

951
00:42:11,232 --> 00:42:13,712
but then they're extended to include

952
00:42:14,137 --> 00:42:16,552
external causes of selection. So that

953
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:18,202
just kind of like a flavor of one of the

954
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,602
subdivates. And it would be good to

955
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:23,842
discuss, I think, how the structure and

956
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:26,247
organizational and content related

957
00:42:26,367 --> 00:42:28,677
differ because it is like a nuanced

958
00:42:28,707 --> 00:42:30,397
debate. And so I appreciate how clear

959
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:33,567
they did make it given that it's murky

960
00:42:33,627 --> 00:42:35,587
waters because these are like four

961
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:38,375
aspects of a philosophical idea.

962
00:42:40,312 --> 00:42:43,037
Oh, then of course this meme.

963
00:42:43,387 --> 00:42:47,322
Okay, so the embodied cognition

964
00:42:47,442 --> 00:42:49,047
literature has shown some practical

965
00:42:49,092 --> 00:42:50,602
examples of how good control can be

966
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,602
realized using fast and frugal solutions

967
00:42:52,632 --> 00:42:54,802
and very simple models. This is an

968
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:57,022
example that Dave described on a live

969
00:42:57,055 --> 00:42:59,742
stream just recently. One popular

970
00:42:59,802 --> 00:43:01,527
example is the baseball outfielder

971
00:43:01,557 --> 00:43:03,277
problem or the fact that catching a

972
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,392
moving ball may not require a full model

973
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,402
of the ball's position, velocity and

974
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,762
direction, allowing for trajectory

975
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,287
prediction, but a simpler control

976
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:13,057
mechanism that only keeps the image of

977
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,982
the ball stationarity on the retina.

978
00:43:15,147 --> 00:43:18,802
Alright, so here on the left, this is

979
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:22,777
like the physics class model of some

980
00:43:22,795 --> 00:43:24,727
of the parameters. So this is already a

981
00:43:24,745 --> 00:43:26,272
map of the territory. We're not going

982
00:43:26,305 --> 00:43:29,077
into the temperature of the ball and the

983
00:43:29,095 --> 00:43:30,552
wavelength of the grass. So this isn't

984
00:43:30,582 --> 00:43:32,902
like a world model. This is just the

985
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,972
physics reduced model of the physics of

986
00:43:35,005 --> 00:43:37,747
the asymptotic ball in this kind of

987
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:40,207
idealized settling range. So that's a

988
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:43,672
lot of parameters like as drawn out

989
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:46,692
there. And here from this Wired article,

990
00:43:46,752 --> 00:43:48,717
how do people actually catch baseballs?

991
00:43:48,852 --> 00:43:51,682
Here's the apparent ball position as a

992
00:43:51,685 --> 00:43:54,575
function of time and just showing how if

993
00:43:55,687 --> 00:43:57,727
you're in the position to catch the

994
00:43:57,745 --> 00:44:00,072
ball, that there's a simple heuristic

995
00:44:00,117 --> 00:44:02,847
line related to the apparent ball's

996
00:44:02,892 --> 00:44:06,007
position. Whereas Bull that

997
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,237
you're too short or too long to catch

998
00:44:09,487 --> 00:44:11,697
have a very different visual trajectory.

999
00:44:11,817 --> 00:44:14,975
So in other words, an activism is saying

1000
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,752
this on the left doesn't have to be the

1001
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:20,422
representation. Zhat would be something

1002
00:44:20,455 --> 00:44:23,427
that might satisfy the most formal

1003
00:44:23,532 --> 00:44:25,702
representationalist. But then this is

1004
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,502
sort of a gray area. Like what if there

1005
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,207
is a visual representation of the ball

1006
00:44:30,222 --> 00:44:32,075
on the retina? So there is something

1007
00:44:32,437 --> 00:44:35,572
that's featuring information about the

1008
00:44:35,605 --> 00:44:38,812
real world in an actionable way, but it

1009
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:43,957
is of a totally different type than the

1010
00:44:44,035 --> 00:44:46,822
parameters in the physics class. And so

1011
00:44:46,855 --> 00:44:47,977
that can get, of course, a little

1012
00:44:47,995 --> 00:44:51,057
sticky. So here is us on the Phillies.

1013
00:44:51,222 --> 00:44:53,472
We're trying to catch the fly Bull

1014
00:44:53,592 --> 00:44:55,852
here's. Friston hitting it out of the

1015
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:59,587
park with the action perception loop and

1016
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:03,277
all the work in this field. So what is

1017
00:45:03,295 --> 00:45:06,622
the equivalent? Do we need to have the

1018
00:45:06,655 --> 00:45:10,642
physics class model or

1019
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,942
is bit possible for us to have some

1020
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:17,977
other type of understanding? Just a

1021
00:45:17,995 --> 00:45:20,152
thought. What do you think? Bleu. >>>BLEU: So it

1022
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:21,592
just really makes me think about

1023
00:45:21,715 --> 00:45:24,577
blindness, right? And I know that this

1024
00:45:24,595 --> 00:45:26,712
seems like a way out there trajectory

1025
00:45:26,787 --> 00:45:30,252
bit, we know the physics of our natural

1026
00:45:30,282 --> 00:45:31,822
environment. We know it pretty well.

1027
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:34,102
What about when we remove ourselves or

1028
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,697
like remove one sense, like remove

1029
00:45:35,742 --> 00:45:38,032
vision? Right now we have like a really

1030
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:41,647
different perception of our

1031
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,812
environment and we have to completely

1032
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:48,157
retrain through kinesthetic memory where

1033
00:45:48,235 --> 00:45:49,852
we are in our environment. If like the

1034
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:51,592
lights go out. I mean, I was without

1035
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,107
power for 4 hours the other day in the

1036
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:54,202
middle of the night and I was like

1037
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:55,432
totally freaked out because I live in

1038
00:45:55,435 --> 00:45:57,097
the country and there was absolutely no

1039
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:00,607
light, like none. So in that you have

1040
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:02,572
to know where all the things are. So

1041
00:46:02,605 --> 00:46:04,867
like, this is a structural map in your

1042
00:46:04,915 --> 00:46:07,117
mind of your reality that's really

1043
00:46:07,165 --> 00:46:08,797
different from what you're able to

1044
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:10,942
absolutely perceive at that moment.

1045
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:14,407
Just makes me think of that. >>>DANIEL: Nice.

1046
00:46:14,485 --> 00:46:16,862
That's just a fun slide.

1047
00:46:17,887 --> 00:46:21,337
Various slides. This is still

1048
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,807
on the this is I guess on the functional

1049
00:46:24,897 --> 00:46:27,577
aspects. Alright, so here's the

1050
00:46:27,595 --> 00:46:31,242
functional perspective or the functional

1051
00:46:31,377 --> 00:46:34,657
aspects of representation. Another way

1052
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:36,127
to address the issue of what a

1053
00:46:36,145 --> 00:46:37,852
representation is and what it is not is

1054
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:39,612
by asking what functional internal

1055
00:46:39,687 --> 00:46:41,182
representation play within a

1056
00:46:41,185 --> 00:46:43,897
hierarchical architecture. So this is

1057
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:47,197
the function, kind of the pragmatics of

1058
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:49,747
the representation. What it does. An

1059
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:52,377
idea zhat dates back to at least PSA

1060
00:46:52,557 --> 00:46:55,542
four is the idea that representation

1061
00:46:55,602 --> 00:46:57,637
should vicariously stand for something

1062
00:46:57,775 --> 00:47:00,942
external in its absence and afford

1063
00:47:01,002 --> 00:47:02,997
vicarious operating plant mental

1064
00:47:03,042 --> 00:47:06,662
operations using an internal vehicle

1065
00:47:07,162 --> 00:47:09,397
that are executed before acting on the

1066
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:12,502
external preference of the vehicle or

1067
00:47:12,595 --> 00:47:14,272
even when the external reference is

1068
00:47:14,305 --> 00:47:17,422
absent. So it is able

1069
00:47:17,455 --> 00:47:21,052
to be cause and effect within

1070
00:47:21,145 --> 00:47:25,132
the mental ecosystem like we'll see

1071
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:27,972
from these examples. Consider mentally

1072
00:47:28,017 --> 00:47:30,702
whether one would enjoy eating a pizza

1073
00:47:30,807 --> 00:47:33,817
with no pizza in sight. So be like okay,

1074
00:47:33,865 --> 00:47:35,122
think of a pizza. Do you want to eat

1075
00:47:35,155 --> 00:47:38,452
that? Now imagine that type of food that

1076
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:40,147
I previously mentioned and then what

1077
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,367
type of restaurant it is and what

1078
00:47:42,415 --> 00:47:43,857
equipment do they have in the kitchen,

1079
00:47:43,947 --> 00:47:46,297
like an oven or something like that? So

1080
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,512
there's something that's being

1081
00:47:47,575 --> 00:47:50,512
functionally carried forth in that

1082
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:54,912
cognitive sequence. Can that be uniquely

1083
00:47:54,987 --> 00:47:56,772
explained, predicted, controlled,

1084
00:47:56,817 --> 00:47:59,462
designed with just sensory motor loops?

1085
00:48:00,862 --> 00:48:02,892
This functional role of representation

1086
00:48:02,952 --> 00:48:04,567
has been expressed in terms of whether

1087
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:06,277
the agent's internal operations are

1088
00:48:06,295 --> 00:48:07,872
detached from its action perception

1089
00:48:07,917 --> 00:48:10,302
cycle and hence autonomously generated

1090
00:48:10,407 --> 00:48:12,217
versus determined or sustained by

1091
00:48:12,265 --> 00:48:14,452
external stimuli. So if something were

1092
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:17,922
just repeatedly causing visual stimuli

1093
00:48:17,967 --> 00:48:19,775
and Zhat were causing, like, sort of

1094
00:48:20,437 --> 00:48:23,797
unaware movements, that would not be one

1095
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:27,292
category of phenomena. But what about

1096
00:48:27,415 --> 00:48:30,592
going on a walk and remembering a five

1097
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,427
digit number by just chanting it to

1098
00:48:33,445 --> 00:48:36,747
yourself? Is that sensory motor?

1099
00:48:36,867 --> 00:48:39,247
How is that playing out? And when

1100
00:48:39,355 --> 00:48:41,847
cognition is playing a functional role

1101
00:48:41,967 --> 00:48:43,872
seemingly uncoupled from the action

1102
00:48:43,917 --> 00:48:45,772
perception loop, which is probably not

1103
00:48:45,805 --> 00:48:47,952
exactly how Piaget framed it, but that's

1104
00:48:48,057 --> 00:48:52,162
what that notion is. And so within

1105
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:55,162
the functional aspect, the FEP is

1106
00:48:55,225 --> 00:48:57,927
leading on to ask, what functional roles

1107
00:48:57,957 --> 00:48:59,572
do internal models play during free

1108
00:48:59,605 --> 00:49:01,717
energy minimization? So just like the

1109
00:49:01,765 --> 00:49:03,367
memorizing, the number was like a cause

1110
00:49:03,415 --> 00:49:05,412
and effect of a cognitive environment.

1111
00:49:05,562 --> 00:49:08,762
Is it the case that the FEP is featuring

1112
00:49:09,262 --> 00:49:11,787
things that are also causes and effects

1113
00:49:11,862 --> 00:49:14,237
in the cognition environment?

1114
00:49:14,962 --> 00:49:17,412
And does that resemble vicarious

1115
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:20,887
operations in the classical phase based

1116
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:24,037
account of representation? And again,

1117
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:25,377
it's going to be the dot one, the dot

1118
00:49:25,407 --> 00:49:27,727
two when we go into the variational and

1119
00:49:27,745 --> 00:49:29,682
the expected free energy. But that's

1120
00:49:29,697 --> 00:49:31,572
like, the big picture on the functional

1121
00:49:31,617 --> 00:49:34,762
aspect is, do these variables play

1122
00:49:34,825 --> 00:49:37,002
functional roles in a way that's

1123
00:49:37,032 --> 00:49:39,702
uncoupled from the immediacy of action

1124
00:49:39,732 --> 00:49:41,832
and perception? I hope I represented

1125
00:49:41,847 --> 00:49:43,222
that because I'm also not sure how that

1126
00:49:43,255 --> 00:49:47,857
one okay.

1127
00:49:47,935 --> 00:49:50,752
Anything to add? Bleu? So I think about

1128
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:52,332
it in a different way. Like, you're

1129
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:54,157
walking down a path and remembering a

1130
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,707
five digit number, but like, I don't

1131
00:49:55,722 --> 00:49:57,222
know, something Zhat probably resonates

1132
00:49:57,267 --> 00:49:59,302
with Sasha or like anybody else that

1133
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,102
does extensive Zhat lab research. Zhat,

1134
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,277
you've done. So it surprise me that it

1135
00:50:03,295 --> 00:50:04,552
doesn't bring its mind for you is,

1136
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:07,632
like, thinking about your action. >>>BLEU: It's

1137
00:50:07,647 --> 00:50:09,832
like a dry run of your experiments the

1138
00:50:09,835 --> 00:50:11,947
next day. Do I have the tubes I need,

1139
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,822
the enzymes I need, the reagents I need?

1140
00:50:13,855 --> 00:50:15,327
Where are all these things located?

1141
00:50:15,432 --> 00:50:17,232
When it's a really important experiment,

1142
00:50:17,322 --> 00:50:19,387
like hit or miss, it has to be done now

1143
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:21,502
or never. Like, which you know that

1144
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,607
there are some that are like, that it's

1145
00:50:23,622 --> 00:50:24,727
important to go through and make sure

1146
00:50:24,745 --> 00:50:26,592
that you've got, like, a cognitive

1147
00:50:26,652 --> 00:50:28,027
representation. Like, you build it and

1148
00:50:28,045 --> 00:50:30,022
so it's fresh in your mind for when you

1149
00:50:30,055 --> 00:50:31,747
absolutely, like, execute the

1150
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:33,352
experiments. And so that's like,

1151
00:50:33,445 --> 00:50:35,047
instead of walking down a path thinking

1152
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,397
of a five digit number, how about,

1153
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:39,147
like, planning, like, the sensory motor

1154
00:50:39,192 --> 00:50:41,077
planning of executing a series of

1155
00:50:41,095 --> 00:50:42,427
experiments. It brings that to mind for

1156
00:50:42,445 --> 00:50:45,200
me. Yeah, great.

1157
00:50:46,012 --> 00:50:49,252
And that makes me think, like,

1158
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:51,117
let's just say it's a 1 hour experiment

1159
00:50:51,177 --> 00:50:54,442
that you're thinking about. >>>DANIEL: Now,

1160
00:50:54,565 --> 00:50:58,602
does the motor pattern firing associated

1161
00:50:58,632 --> 00:51:00,382
with pushing your thumb down on the

1162
00:51:00,385 --> 00:51:04,087
pipette, does Zhat get engaged during

1163
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:06,800
the prospective planning of that event?

1164
00:51:08,137 --> 00:51:10,497
Who knows to zhat extent. But that's

1165
00:51:10,542 --> 00:51:13,002
kind of what's at play here. If there's

1166
00:51:13,032 --> 00:51:16,497
a totally disjoint neural phenomena

1167
00:51:16,542 --> 00:51:18,177
associated with the prospective

1168
00:51:18,207 --> 00:51:21,592
planning, then the inaction we're in one

1169
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,797
camp of representationism. I don't even

1170
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,227
know which side of the line anymore.

1171
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:28,497
But then if you do have that thumb

1172
00:51:28,692 --> 00:51:31,177
neural firing pattern, like it's just

1173
00:51:31,195 --> 00:51:32,707
like sped up or just shortened or

1174
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:33,832
something, maybe we're in a different

1175
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:37,537
area. So let's return to these

1176
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,702
ideas because, again, it's very nuanced

1177
00:51:39,732 --> 00:51:41,902
and it's just great the authors laid it

1178
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,227
out as simply as they did because this

1179
00:51:44,245 --> 00:51:46,447
is clearly a lot of literature to go

1180
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,842
through. So that was the eight,

1181
00:51:50,965 --> 00:51:54,202
the four times two. I won't even go

1182
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:56,450
Hinton it, but four times two. And

1183
00:51:56,962 --> 00:51:58,552
that's the bulk of the paper. And then

1184
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:00,622
there was this addendum section on

1185
00:52:00,655 --> 00:52:02,712
representation as an evolutionary

1186
00:52:02,862 --> 00:52:05,667
function. So similar to other cognitive

1187
00:52:05,727 --> 00:52:07,377
functions like working memory,

1188
00:52:07,482 --> 00:52:09,007
planning, cognitive control and

1189
00:52:09,010 --> 00:52:11,622
attention, or perhaps even to functions

1190
00:52:11,667 --> 00:52:14,847
like flying or swimming. Representation

1191
00:52:15,042 --> 00:52:17,022
here intended in the sense of affording

1192
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:19,102
vicarious operations and detachment from

1193
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,667
the current action perception cycle,

1194
00:52:20,727 --> 00:52:23,157
may be an evolutionary function. So it's

1195
00:52:23,172 --> 00:52:25,192
kind of like when people argue that

1196
00:52:25,315 --> 00:52:28,222
consciousness has an adaptive role and

1197
00:52:28,255 --> 00:52:30,297
that the origination of consciousness

1198
00:52:30,342 --> 00:52:32,302
could be scaffolded or nurtured or

1199
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,702
selected for once it arose. This is a

1200
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,287
little bit less phenomenological and

1201
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:40,947
more cognitiveist or computationalist

1202
00:52:41,067 --> 00:52:42,517
with respect to saying how

1203
00:52:42,565 --> 00:52:45,052
representation might play an

1204
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:47,577
evolutionary role. So let's just imagine

1205
00:52:47,607 --> 00:52:50,017
that there was this detachment between

1206
00:52:50,065 --> 00:52:52,062
the action perception role and planning.

1207
00:52:52,212 --> 00:52:55,037
Like here's Pokemon and I'm Ants.

1208
00:52:55,687 --> 00:53:00,267
Imagine if they're able to perceive

1209
00:53:00,327 --> 00:53:02,152
the polarization of light or the

1210
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:04,092
intensity of the light or the humidity

1211
00:53:04,227 --> 00:53:05,602
and then have something like a

1212
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,422
representation that helps them assess

1213
00:53:07,542 --> 00:53:09,547
whether it's appropriate to forage on

1214
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:12,142
that day. That is going to be a more

1215
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:15,997
adaptive nest mate for the colony. Does

1216
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:19,672
the colony have a representation? What

1217
00:53:19,705 --> 00:53:23,197
level is the representation existing at?

1218
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:27,117
Is it the direct target of selection

1219
00:53:27,177 --> 00:53:30,157
or is it arising from selection on other

1220
00:53:30,235 --> 00:53:33,287
units? What do you think? Bleu?

1221
00:53:33,862 --> 00:53:36,532
We were just talking about this,

1222
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:39,962
right? >>>BLEU: Is the niche the Internet,

1223
00:53:40,387 --> 00:53:42,342
right? Is that like the meta

1224
00:53:42,402 --> 00:53:44,992
representation of humanity? Like the

1225
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,652
web? That's it. So I wrote that here

1226
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:50,602
and things to discuss and the dot one or

1227
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:53,067
dot two is external representation.

1228
00:53:53,127 --> 00:53:55,492
Like, how do you offload this

1229
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:57,812
representationalism into the niche?

1230
00:54:00,037 --> 00:54:02,450
>>>DANIEL: Awesome question. And I also,

1231
00:54:03,037 --> 00:54:05,797
I think, probably subconsciously was

1232
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:07,282
thinking about that. Like the image on

1233
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:10,252
the right is a trail, a truth trail that

1234
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:13,297
the Pokemon mermax use. And so it's like

1235
00:54:13,405 --> 00:54:15,157
it's not going in every direction in

1236
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,522
this colony. It's only going in one

1237
00:54:16,555 --> 00:54:19,227
direction, it's along a tree. So it's

1238
00:54:19,257 --> 00:54:21,102
kind of accentuating this natural

1239
00:54:21,207 --> 00:54:23,902
pattern in the generative process in the

1240
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,767
niche. But then now that is like an

1241
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:30,477
externalized prior for foragers

1242
00:54:30,507 --> 00:54:32,322
that's based upon the clearing of grass

1243
00:54:32,367 --> 00:54:33,847
and then they're less likely to go like

1244
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:35,482
walk order the midden pile and forage in

1245
00:54:35,485 --> 00:54:36,742
a different direction. But then it does

1246
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:39,562
happen, so the trail does move.

1247
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:42,942
So it's like interesting topics.

1248
00:54:43,077 --> 00:54:44,602
Yes. Thanks for writing down about the

1249
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:46,402
internet. Okay, let's continue through a

1250
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:49,302
few of these last ideas and I'm glad

1251
00:54:49,332 --> 00:54:51,875
that we're moving briskly through this

1252
00:54:52,387 --> 00:54:53,900
long paper.

1253
00:54:55,537 --> 00:54:59,542
Okay, so let's keep thinking about that

1254
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:02,272
detachment of representation from the

1255
00:55:02,305 --> 00:55:05,077
action perception loop they write. In

1256
00:55:05,095 --> 00:55:06,927
other words, full fledged decoupled

1257
00:55:06,957 --> 00:55:09,417
representational capacities might shade

1258
00:55:09,477 --> 00:55:11,932
off, which I wasn't even sure what the

1259
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:13,852
origins were. Maybe it's used in God for

1260
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:17,352
Smith 96 into other cognitive or minimal

1261
00:55:17,382 --> 00:55:19,852
cognitive processes, the dynamics of

1262
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:21,307
which are increasingly more coupled to

1263
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:22,902
the environment through action sensory

1264
00:55:22,932 --> 00:55:25,207
perception. So it's like being at a

1265
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:27,397
levels of cognitive complexity where you

1266
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:30,877
can spin up other active entities or

1267
00:55:30,895 --> 00:55:33,997
like the queen as a reproductive ant is

1268
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:36,277
spinning off cognition but not

1269
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:39,387
reproductive nest mates. Therefore,

1270
00:55:39,462 --> 00:55:41,572
when taking functional role as

1271
00:55:41,605 --> 00:55:43,312
contextualized by evolutionary function

1272
00:55:43,375 --> 00:55:45,592
as a criterion for identifying when

1273
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,847
recourse to representation is warranted

1274
00:55:47,892 --> 00:55:50,962
in explanation, which is a very

1275
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:53,762
complexity linguistic clause.

1276
00:55:54,562 --> 00:55:57,787
But we're finding out when

1277
00:55:57,850 --> 00:56:00,847
representation is warranted, the

1278
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,112
criteria for that would be evolution

1279
00:56:05,062 --> 00:56:07,747
shaping function. So it's a lot like

1280
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:09,427
saying nothing in biology makes sense

1281
00:56:09,445 --> 00:56:12,322
except in light of evolution. And then

1282
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:14,827
under those settings it is possible to

1283
00:56:14,845 --> 00:56:17,752
interpret at least some processes, the

1284
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:20,097
ones that involve vicarious variables

1285
00:56:20,292 --> 00:56:22,325
related to minimizing free energy.

1286
00:56:24,562 --> 00:56:28,077
Under that context, the author

1287
00:56:28,107 --> 00:56:29,797
suggests that could drive the kind of

1288
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:31,597
self organization that FEP would

1289
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:35,052
describe as representational. So it's

1290
00:56:35,082 --> 00:56:37,902
layered, but it's very fascinating

1291
00:56:38,007 --> 00:56:40,177
because it is just like you had Majid

1292
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:44,202
Bleu with our niche, but it's

1293
00:56:44,232 --> 00:56:47,827
like just stacking rocks on

1294
00:56:47,845 --> 00:56:50,277
top of each other. It's resisting

1295
00:56:50,307 --> 00:56:54,292
disorder, it displays culture, but those

1296
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:56,772
rocks don't have a self modeling

1297
00:56:56,817 --> 00:56:59,947
capacity. It's like uni

1298
00:57:00,055 --> 00:57:02,452
variational multi scale integration the

1299
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:05,572
other Sims paper whereas here we have

1300
00:57:05,605 --> 00:57:09,207
like a human who is part of their niche,

1301
00:57:09,372 --> 00:57:12,852
has made another adaptive active

1302
00:57:12,882 --> 00:57:15,702
inference entity and now they're engaged

1303
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:17,622
in this reciprocal multi scale

1304
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:22,252
integration. And so I

1305
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:23,772
think the authors might be suggesting

1306
00:57:23,817 --> 00:57:26,387
that there's aspects of this settling

1307
00:57:26,812 --> 00:57:30,442
point might be described as or

1308
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:33,147
might be warranted to utilize

1309
00:57:33,192 --> 00:57:36,727
representation in the exploration. What

1310
00:57:36,745 --> 00:57:37,550
do you think?

1311
00:57:40,537 --> 00:57:43,147
>>>BLEU: So I always wonder whether we should

1312
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:46,850
talk about multiscale integration or

1313
00:57:47,887 --> 00:57:49,942
thinking thought other minds in terms of

1314
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:52,412
translating into the niche.

1315
00:57:53,212 --> 00:57:56,652
And how do you decide whether we're

1316
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:59,052
interactions? As I Dean, I guess there's

1317
00:57:59,082 --> 00:58:01,062
always this thinking through other mind

1318
00:58:01,137 --> 00:58:03,847
aspects of, you know, we live like

1319
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,882
stigma jack traces in our niche

1320
00:58:06,897 --> 00:58:08,992
environment and then they're picked up

1321
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,962
by other people or is it really

1322
00:58:12,025 --> 00:58:14,452
multiscale integration, like in terms of

1323
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:15,832
you and I are connecting and forming a

1324
00:58:15,835 --> 00:58:18,427
bigger unit. I always and this is we

1325
00:58:18,445 --> 00:58:19,747
were just talking about this like ten

1326
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:22,642
minutes before we got here today. So

1327
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:24,800
this is something to me that's like this

1328
00:58:25,237 --> 00:58:27,652
fundamental paradox. Like I don't know

1329
00:58:27,745 --> 00:58:29,975
how to distinguish these.

1330
00:58:34,012 --> 00:58:35,727
I guess that shared informational

1331
00:58:35,757 --> 00:58:37,527
channel always comes through the niche

1332
00:58:37,557 --> 00:58:39,012
environment, whether it's the Internet

1333
00:58:39,087 --> 00:58:41,602
or some knowledge artifacts like a

1334
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:44,647
scientific paper or a computer or

1335
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,762
something else. But my relationship with

1336
00:58:46,825 --> 00:58:49,552
you or any human is always through the

1337
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:51,682
niche environment. There's always that

1338
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,562
filtration and whether it's in real time

1339
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:58,187
like we are here now, or sequentially.

1340
00:58:59,962 --> 00:59:03,177
Even if it's so called in person, it's

1341
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:06,352
mediated by vibrating air molecules now

1342
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:08,722
it's intermediated through routers and

1343
00:59:08,755 --> 00:59:12,067
such it's utilization of

1344
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:14,677
the niche. And I think this is just

1345
00:59:14,695 --> 00:59:16,612
raising a super fascinating question.

1346
00:59:16,675 --> 00:59:18,397
>>>DANIEL: Cell yeah, thanks for raising this.

1347
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:20,197
We'll discuss that and then this is like

1348
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:22,927
saying it's one thing to talk through

1349
00:59:22,945 --> 00:59:25,252
the tin cans. That's like using the

1350
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:29,122
direct passive active inference agents

1351
00:59:29,305 --> 00:59:31,522
even if we could describe the tin can as

1352
00:59:31,555 --> 00:59:33,727
perception and action. But now what if

1353
00:59:33,745 --> 00:59:36,852
there's a chat bit that's intermediate

1354
00:59:36,882 --> 00:59:37,902
between the two of us or it's

1355
00:59:37,932 --> 00:59:39,292
translating between two different

1356
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:42,727
languages. Then where does that put the

1357
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:45,350
status of that entire cognitive system?

1358
00:59:46,237 --> 00:59:47,902
How does it influence thinking through

1359
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,792
other minds when the intermediaries are

1360
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,702
passive versus adaptive active inference

1361
00:59:51,732 --> 00:59:55,925
entities? So nice questions. All right.

1362
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:58,572
This is the part which also will unpack

1363
00:59:58,617 --> 01:00:02,182
more in the one and two. This is kind

1364
01:00:02,185 --> 01:00:05,397
of the wormhole strange loop turning

1365
01:00:05,442 --> 01:00:08,122
the mirror back on itself part. So the

1366
01:00:08,155 --> 01:00:11,377
authors write in much the same manner as

1367
01:00:11,395 --> 01:00:13,222
arriving at internal representation or

1368
01:00:13,255 --> 01:00:15,297
internal representation interpretation

1369
01:00:15,492 --> 01:00:18,747
of FEP. So that's the whole sections

1370
01:00:18,792 --> 01:00:21,217
that we just spent the whole time on

1371
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:23,722
like everything within the realm of

1372
01:00:23,755 --> 01:00:27,442
actually using the FEP, not taking

1373
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:29,902
it as an unknown, but taking the FEP as

1374
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,542
an instrument and then using it to ask

1375
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:34,597
whether it is representation or not on

1376
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:36,012
those different aspects. So now we're

1377
01:00:36,512 --> 01:00:38,827
going to put that behind us and consider

1378
01:00:38,995 --> 01:00:42,177
arriving at FEP as a synthesis.

1379
01:00:42,357 --> 01:00:44,547
Depends on which representational

1380
01:00:44,592 --> 01:00:46,792
criteria are assumed when either

1381
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:49,567
considering FEP central constructs or

1382
01:00:49,615 --> 01:00:51,522
considering specific cognition phenomena

1383
01:00:51,567 --> 01:00:53,337
through the lens of a process theory

1384
01:00:53,487 --> 01:00:56,472
under FEP. Hence, in the end, the debate

1385
01:00:56,517 --> 01:01:00,142
about FEP may reveal more about us, our

1386
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:01,927
criteria for representation and our

1387
01:01:01,945 --> 01:01:03,577
interests in particular facets of

1388
01:01:03,595 --> 01:01:05,377
cognition than it does about internal

1389
01:01:05,395 --> 01:01:09,972
representation status of the FEP. So JFK

1390
01:01:10,017 --> 01:01:12,502
is out there somewhere. Ask not what the

1391
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:14,075
FEP can do for you,

1392
01:01:15,637 --> 01:01:18,697
it's saying because you can be all over

1393
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:21,952
the map. Maybe all of these sectors are

1394
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:24,502
in play and all the perspectives in each

1395
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:27,547
of those aspects. That means that

1396
01:01:27,655 --> 01:01:30,937
somebody's posterior confidence in

1397
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,672
different claims is

1398
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:36,667
probably better reflecting of their

1399
01:01:36,715 --> 01:01:39,622
prior and update process than some sort

1400
01:01:39,655 --> 01:01:43,032
of objective stance or consensus reality

1401
01:01:43,197 --> 01:01:46,657
about what the FEP is. As if it

1402
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:48,907
could be such a thing independent of how

1403
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:51,922
it specifically deployed, as we talked

1404
01:01:51,955 --> 01:01:54,072
about with model based science and Majid

1405
01:01:54,117 --> 01:01:57,725
Beni. So this is a very nice

1406
01:01:58,087 --> 01:01:58,850
point,

1407
01:02:01,837 --> 01:02:03,547
I think both. Yeah. I mean,

1408
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:06,097
fundamentally, the FEP is a

1409
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:09,442
representation. I mean, it is our

1410
01:02:09,565 --> 01:02:11,257
representation, our model. I mean, it

1411
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:12,922
might be the one that we employ with

1412
01:02:12,955 --> 01:02:15,052
which to it might be an instrument, or

1413
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:19,400
it might be a real thing, but still

1414
01:02:19,987 --> 01:02:22,947
we represent FEP, like, with equations

1415
01:02:23,067 --> 01:02:25,707
and with ideas and memes and I don't

1416
01:02:25,722 --> 01:02:27,397
know. >>>BLEU: I mean, we impute our

1417
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:30,202
representation on it all the time. So

1418
01:02:30,295 --> 01:02:32,647
whether it is representation itself or

1419
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:35,092
we represent the FEP, but there's some,

1420
01:02:35,215 --> 01:02:38,600
like there's some, like, play there.

1421
01:02:39,037 --> 01:02:43,372
It's integrated with representation all

1422
01:02:43,405 --> 01:02:45,652
the time, like linguistically or other

1423
01:02:45,745 --> 01:02:49,192
or maybe not. Maybe I'm not a radical

1424
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,742
enactivism enough, or what was the

1425
01:02:51,865 --> 01:02:53,937
radical inactivist? Really? >>>DANIEL: Radical?

1426
01:02:54,012 --> 01:02:57,397
Yeah. Well, I'm sure we'll talk

1427
01:02:57,430 --> 01:02:59,022
more about it. So just the conclusion

1428
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:01,642
and then a few last points.

1429
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:05,427
So, nine sentences in the conclusion.

1430
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:08,092
One, they looked at four different

1431
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:11,150
aspects of representation. Two,

1432
01:03:11,962 --> 01:03:14,197
understanding which side of which line

1433
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:17,092
to come down on was complicated because

1434
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:19,692
the FEP appeals to multiple constructs

1435
01:03:19,827 --> 01:03:23,197
that don't prior seem to be

1436
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:25,197
strongly linked or naturally linked.

1437
01:03:25,242 --> 01:03:26,832
Like, it's unclear whether one begets

1438
01:03:26,847 --> 01:03:29,427
the other or whether they constantiate.

1439
01:03:29,607 --> 01:03:31,002
And that's the kind of work that we're

1440
01:03:31,032 --> 01:03:33,672
really interested in, in the ontology

1441
01:03:33,792 --> 01:03:35,577
project and in the knowledge corpus

1442
01:03:35,607 --> 01:03:38,082
engineering, of course, in the.edu

1443
01:03:38,172 --> 01:03:40,852
organizational unit of actinF Lab. So

1444
01:03:40,870 --> 01:03:43,647
the FEP appeals to multiple constructs,

1445
01:03:43,767 --> 01:03:47,077
and those model can be constructed in

1446
01:03:47,095 --> 01:03:50,302
various ways. So it's good to clear up

1447
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:51,957
representation into these fourfold

1448
01:03:51,972 --> 01:03:53,862
distinctions. However, it's complexity

1449
01:03:53,937 --> 01:03:56,032
still, because the FEP is kind of like a

1450
01:03:56,035 --> 01:03:59,317
plurality in and of itself. Three,

1451
01:03:59,365 --> 01:04:01,867
they argue that depending on how you

1452
01:04:01,915 --> 01:04:03,712
think about things, you're going to

1453
01:04:03,775 --> 01:04:06,472
think about things differently. They

1454
01:04:06,505 --> 01:04:09,702
then turn the mirror back and suggest

1455
01:04:09,732 --> 01:04:11,827
that that's an opportunity. It's a

1456
01:04:11,845 --> 01:04:13,327
challenge, but it's also an opportunity

1457
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:16,700
to reflect upon how we value

1458
01:04:17,212 --> 01:04:20,212
representation and different features in

1459
01:04:20,275 --> 01:04:23,572
our model selection related to the main

1460
01:04:23,605 --> 01:04:26,077
part of this paper. And then they sort

1461
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:28,637
of salvage the utility of FEP,

1462
01:04:29,062 --> 01:04:32,817
whether heads FEP wins, tails not FEP

1463
01:04:32,877 --> 01:04:36,237
loses, because the FEP can be heuristic.

1464
01:04:36,387 --> 01:04:40,617
So, like, kind of good for functionally

1465
01:04:40,677 --> 01:04:43,042
or pragmatically for philosophy of mind,

1466
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:44,902
even if not so much to settle the

1467
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:47,047
dispute on internal representation, but

1468
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,702
to unveil and dissect the hidden

1469
01:04:48,732 --> 01:04:51,052
assumptions in the debate. So it's kind

1470
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:53,527
of like deploying FEP into the

1471
01:04:53,545 --> 01:04:55,807
representation debate. It's not going to

1472
01:04:55,810 --> 01:04:59,692
be the judge, it's going to be like some

1473
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:02,737
other role. What is the FEP in that

1474
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:06,622
setting? Six, another lesson learning is

1475
01:05:06,655 --> 01:05:08,987
that some traditional polarizations

1476
01:05:10,237 --> 01:05:12,247
might be attenuated or dissolved under

1477
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:15,267
the FEP. So here we're seeing multiple

1478
01:05:15,327 --> 01:05:17,557
uses of the free, which is why there's a

1479
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:20,682
bunch of different colors on here. It's

1480
01:05:20,772 --> 01:05:24,847
a theoretical plurality. It has also

1481
01:05:24,955 --> 01:05:28,327
a plurality of applied models. It's a

1482
01:05:28,345 --> 01:05:32,162
mirror, it's a bit hedge.

1483
01:05:33,037 --> 01:05:35,292
It's a unifier with traditional

1484
01:05:35,352 --> 01:05:37,377
polarizations like cognitiveist versus

1485
01:05:37,407 --> 01:05:39,697
an activism. And then here's a really

1486
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:41,017
fascinating part. Zhat I know many

1487
01:05:41,065 --> 01:05:42,607
people in the lab will be excited to

1488
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:45,252
talk about the FEP advances a unified

1489
01:05:45,282 --> 01:05:47,127
view where terms that traditionally

1490
01:05:47,157 --> 01:05:49,627
belong to different ontologies can be

1491
01:05:49,645 --> 01:05:53,127
harmonized. So it's an ontological

1492
01:05:53,232 --> 01:05:56,497
unifier. For example, modeling and

1493
01:05:56,530 --> 01:05:59,677
expectation is not used in some of the

1494
01:05:59,695 --> 01:06:01,207
works that talk about autopoeysis and

1495
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:05,362
synchronization. Eight how

1496
01:06:05,425 --> 01:06:08,407
does the FEP do this? It begins with a

1497
01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:11,197
strong inactivist flavor and a focus on

1498
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:12,567
action that's missing from traditional

1499
01:06:12,627 --> 01:06:15,202
cognitive theories. So by starting with

1500
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:17,877
1ft squarely in action, it brings

1501
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:20,022
something that a lot of neurocognitive

1502
01:06:20,067 --> 01:06:22,297
theories are missing from and then

1503
01:06:22,330 --> 01:06:24,117
extends the scope of an activist

1504
01:06:24,252 --> 01:06:26,032
thinking to territories of, for example,

1505
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:27,637
counterfactual thinking and model

1506
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:30,217
selection and abductive logic like we

1507
01:06:30,265 --> 01:06:32,802
talked about also with Beni. So it's

1508
01:06:32,832 --> 01:06:36,087
kind of like coming from action landia

1509
01:06:36,237 --> 01:06:38,122
and bringing in inference and then

1510
01:06:38,155 --> 01:06:39,997
starting from inference landia and

1511
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:42,627
bringing in action. Almost like it's

1512
01:06:42,657 --> 01:06:44,377
called act of inference or that's like a

1513
01:06:44,395 --> 01:06:47,002
related idea or something. And then the

1514
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:49,777
9th sentence is just saying the space of

1515
01:06:49,795 --> 01:06:53,827
the possible is big and we're going to

1516
01:06:53,845 --> 01:06:56,497
have to reduce our uncertainty by making

1517
01:06:56,530 --> 01:07:00,382
it happen. So it's a really great

1518
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:01,412
conclusion.

1519
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,982
Any other comments on Zhat Bleu? Just

1520
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:11,247
pretty epic paper. I think it ties

1521
01:07:11,292 --> 01:07:14,047
together a lot of stuff we've talked

1522
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,752
about. Stuff we will talk about. Yep.

1523
01:07:16,932 --> 01:07:19,462
Okay, final things and things to discuss

1524
01:07:19,525 --> 01:07:22,672
in dot one and two. Okay, so here is a

1525
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:25,175
quote from the paper where they say

1526
01:07:25,837 --> 01:07:28,177
given the FEP has been implemented in a

1527
01:07:28,195 --> 01:07:30,127
family of computational models that are

1528
01:07:30,145 --> 01:07:32,162
by definition fully observable,

1529
01:07:35,287 --> 01:07:37,987
that's the first part to highlight. So

1530
01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:40,857
in Zhat sense, are computational models

1531
01:07:40,947 --> 01:07:42,277
fully observable or what does

1532
01:07:42,295 --> 01:07:45,172
observation mean for models? What does

1533
01:07:45,205 --> 01:07:47,547
explainability mean or transparency

1534
01:07:47,667 --> 01:07:50,422
mean? Is that reproducibility? Is that

1535
01:07:50,455 --> 01:07:53,502
perturbability? Is the map fully

1536
01:07:53,532 --> 01:07:55,902
observable? Is the territory fully

1537
01:07:55,932 --> 01:07:58,267
observable? Are there settings where one

1538
01:07:58,315 --> 01:08:00,502
or the other or neither or both are

1539
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:03,057
variable? So what is this visual

1540
01:08:03,147 --> 01:08:05,527
metaphor and what are some of the

1541
01:08:05,545 --> 01:08:08,892
nuances with like observation and visual

1542
01:08:08,952 --> 01:08:13,002
perception? And then here is FEP

1543
01:08:13,032 --> 01:08:17,052
as a unifier. So it's

1544
01:08:17,082 --> 01:08:19,002
less surprising if one considers FEP

1545
01:08:19,032 --> 01:08:20,442
unites notions that are generally

1546
01:08:20,502 --> 01:08:22,497
considered antithetical some meaning

1547
01:08:22,542 --> 01:08:24,952
like contrary to each other, most

1548
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:26,472
notably the notion of internal

1549
01:08:26,517 --> 01:08:28,342
generative model, which is usually

1550
01:08:28,390 --> 01:08:29,877
associated with representationalist

1551
01:08:29,907 --> 01:08:31,552
theorem, and autopoeicis, which is

1552
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:32,572
usually associated internal

1553
01:08:32,605 --> 01:08:35,322
representation inactive approaches.

1554
01:08:35,442 --> 01:08:39,337
So I think just who

1555
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:42,062
considers which notions antithetical?

1556
01:08:42,487 --> 01:08:44,727
Some classic examples area provided

1557
01:08:44,757 --> 01:08:48,432
here, like To, Helmholtz and Maturana

1558
01:08:48,447 --> 01:08:52,072
and Area. But just who

1559
01:08:52,255 --> 01:08:55,837
disagrees and why? And what can we learn

1560
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:57,897
by just hearing different perspectives

1561
01:08:57,942 --> 01:09:02,347
on some of these debates? And then how

1562
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:03,967
is representation related to

1563
01:09:04,015 --> 01:09:07,977
autopilotis? So autopoetic

1564
01:09:08,007 --> 01:09:09,967
systems are those that are variable of

1565
01:09:10,090 --> 01:09:12,022
producing and maintaining themselves by

1566
01:09:12,055 --> 01:09:14,722
creating their own parts. It's kind of a

1567
01:09:14,755 --> 01:09:17,917
classic complexity idea and

1568
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:21,312
it made me think about poetic naturalism

1569
01:09:21,462 --> 01:09:23,152
and then all these other proposals like

1570
01:09:23,170 --> 01:09:25,462
the metapoetic naturalism and stuff.

1571
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:29,437
And then there were zero Google hits for

1572
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:32,722
autopilotic naturalism. But I think

1573
01:09:32,755 --> 01:09:36,177
it's very related to what we spoke

1574
01:09:36,207 --> 01:09:39,112
about with Majeedni and science as

1575
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:42,502
modeling in the world and about, of

1576
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:46,625
course, the title of this paper and the

1577
01:09:48,187 --> 01:09:51,125
representations questions.

1578
01:09:52,162 --> 01:09:54,732
So this is just a very provocative

1579
01:09:54,822 --> 01:09:56,457
paragraph that brings a lot of ideas.

1580
01:09:56,472 --> 01:09:59,377
In Bleu it's also just the middle way,

1581
01:09:59,470 --> 01:10:02,572
right? Is it this or that or maybe some

1582
01:10:02,605 --> 01:10:04,927
combination of these two things? Is the

1583
01:10:04,945 --> 01:10:08,577
right thing the depth perception,

1584
01:10:08,607 --> 01:10:10,627
as Dean says? So then one more sort of

1585
01:10:10,645 --> 01:10:12,877
general comment and then we'll go to the

1586
01:10:12,895 --> 01:10:15,727
specifics to discuss next time. So this

1587
01:10:15,745 --> 01:10:18,952
is the FEP as mirror. So one can use the

1588
01:10:18,970 --> 01:10:21,652
debate on representation in FEP the

1589
01:10:21,670 --> 01:10:23,302
other way around, not as a way to

1590
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:24,832
resolve the issue at stake, but as a

1591
01:10:24,835 --> 01:10:27,102
mirror to look at one's own implicit

1592
01:10:27,282 --> 01:10:30,277
notions of representation. So here's a

1593
01:10:30,295 --> 01:10:32,472
paper that I wrote with my colleague

1594
01:10:32,517 --> 01:10:35,692
Eirik Sovik in 2019, where we talked

1595
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:37,177
about scientific theories for

1596
01:10:37,195 --> 01:10:40,777
consciousness. And so instead of using

1597
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:43,137
a model of consciousness for granted,

1598
01:10:43,212 --> 01:10:45,127
like integrated information theory or

1599
01:10:45,145 --> 01:10:46,777
some other quantitative measure of

1600
01:10:46,795 --> 01:10:50,572
consciousness, we took the system as

1601
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:52,417
the recognition, which was an ant

1602
01:10:52,465 --> 01:10:55,842
colony, and then reflected

1603
01:10:55,902 --> 01:10:58,177
back on different scientific theories of

1604
01:10:58,195 --> 01:11:01,462
consciousness, what Zhat Majid about,

1605
01:11:01,525 --> 01:11:03,652
what people value, about, for example,

1606
01:11:03,745 --> 01:11:06,492
anatomical versus functional linguistic

1607
01:11:06,552 --> 01:11:09,667
behavior, components of systems. And so

1608
01:11:09,715 --> 01:11:11,847
we talked about like forward tests,

1609
01:11:11,967 --> 01:11:13,512
where you're good with your tests,

1610
01:11:13,662 --> 01:11:16,102
you've got a calibrated instrument. And

1611
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:17,827
so this is like what the bulk of the

1612
01:11:17,845 --> 01:11:19,402
literature review was in the first half

1613
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:21,402
of this paper, which was like, we're

1614
01:11:21,432 --> 01:11:23,797
just going to go with the FEP as what

1615
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:26,152
our framework is, and then we're going

1616
01:11:26,170 --> 01:11:28,177
to assess there's still a diversity of

1617
01:11:28,195 --> 01:11:30,577
perspectives on representation, even if

1618
01:11:30,595 --> 01:11:32,847
you think the FEP is totally the Goto

1619
01:11:32,892 --> 01:11:34,972
theory. So this does not mean that you

1620
01:11:35,005 --> 01:11:37,132
eliminate ambiguity. It just means that

1621
01:11:37,135 --> 01:11:40,197
you're using your tool in a deployment

1622
01:11:40,242 --> 01:11:43,462
oriented way versus the reverse test,

1623
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,127
which is like taking things that are

1624
01:11:45,145 --> 01:11:47,422
known in the world or some sort of

1625
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:50,525
internal preference data and then

1626
01:11:51,787 --> 01:11:55,417
shining it back as a mirror on the

1627
01:11:55,465 --> 01:11:59,212
test and comparing amongst tests, which

1628
01:11:59,275 --> 01:12:02,392
also does, of course, recurs because

1629
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:05,017
it's a test being applied to do so. But

1630
01:12:05,065 --> 01:12:07,317
that's where the real revolutionary

1631
01:12:07,452 --> 01:12:11,600
science happens. And so this paper

1632
01:12:12,187 --> 01:12:15,822
by Pezzulo and Sims showed

1633
01:12:15,867 --> 01:12:20,277
both modes in total harmony.

1634
01:12:20,457 --> 01:12:22,102
And so I think it's an awesome

1635
01:12:22,195 --> 01:12:24,942
contribution from velocity of science

1636
01:12:25,002 --> 01:12:27,352
perspective. So I look forward to

1637
01:12:27,370 --> 01:12:29,782
talking about that and about Ford and

1638
01:12:29,785 --> 01:12:31,407
reverse tests. And then here's a bunch

1639
01:12:31,422 --> 01:12:33,417
of other stuff. What are you excited

1640
01:12:33,477 --> 01:12:35,902
about here? >>>BLEU: Bleu this is just stuff I

1641
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,957
wrote down to talk about, like cell. I

1642
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:39,397
was just taking notes while we were

1643
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:41,287
talking today about what might be cool

1644
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:44,842
to discuss in the one and two a lot

1645
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:47,127
about the sensory motor loop, mental

1646
01:12:47,157 --> 01:12:49,522
engagement, mental action. Does. That

1647
01:12:49,555 --> 01:12:52,197
trigger the same kind of biological

1648
01:12:52,242 --> 01:12:54,812
response as an actual action,

1649
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:57,052
and then the idea of thinking through

1650
01:12:57,070 --> 01:12:58,602
other minds versus multiscale

1651
01:12:58,632 --> 01:13:00,322
integration, what might be similar or

1652
01:13:00,355 --> 01:13:03,942
different there, and the independent

1653
01:13:04,002 --> 01:13:06,307
evidence of the FEP? Or is it just a

1654
01:13:06,310 --> 01:13:08,637
mere we hold up? Maybe for ourselves,

1655
01:13:08,787 --> 01:13:10,972
but I think that this paper was

1656
01:13:11,005 --> 01:13:14,347
provocative and great. I have been a big

1657
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:16,522
fan of Tesla for a long time. More

1658
01:13:16,555 --> 01:13:19,087
recently a Matt Sims fan, but probably

1659
01:13:19,150 --> 01:13:20,797
I've been reading Pazilla's papers for

1660
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:23,992
ten years and excited to have the chance

1661
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:26,422
to really dissect a paper by him with

1662
01:13:26,455 --> 01:13:29,602
more than just myself. Great.

1663
01:13:29,770 --> 01:13:33,067
Well, glue. >>>DANIEL: Thanks a ton for the awesome

1664
01:13:33,115 --> 01:13:36,022
work on the dot zero. I think we were

1665
01:13:36,055 --> 01:13:38,512
trepidacious to jump into this paper,

1666
01:13:38,575 --> 01:13:44,092
but then you were prediction no

1667
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:46,977
problem. I got it. I'm processing it's.

1668
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:50,422
True. >>>BLEU: That's easy. Yeah, we got it.

1669
01:13:50,455 --> 01:13:52,272
One week, sure. Three days for double

1670
01:13:52,317 --> 01:13:55,477
zero. We got it. We're good. I read a

1671
01:13:55,495 --> 01:13:58,552
long time ago also. Yes. We just hope

1672
01:13:58,570 --> 01:14:01,025
that anyone who wants to ask a question

1673
01:14:01,462 --> 01:14:04,642
can. Even if it's long past the one two.

1674
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:06,262
>>>DANIEL: If you're listening to this in time,

1675
01:14:06,325 --> 01:14:08,452
then congrats. And you should definitely

1676
01:14:08,545 --> 01:14:12,147
get involved conversation and otherwise

1677
01:14:12,192 --> 01:14:14,347
we'll see you around the lab. So thanks

1678
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:16,027
again, Bleu, and thanks everybody, for

1679
01:14:16,045 --> 01:14:17,662
watching. See you later. Thanks.
