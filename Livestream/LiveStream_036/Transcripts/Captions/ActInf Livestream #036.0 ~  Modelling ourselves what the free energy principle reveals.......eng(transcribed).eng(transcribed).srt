00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,160
all right hello and welcome everyone

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,519
it is actin flab live stream number 36.0

5
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,360
and it's january 13th 2022.

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,000
welcome to the actin flap we are a

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,079
participatory online lab that is

8
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,000
communicating learning and practicing

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,079
applied active inference you can find us

10
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,239
at the links here on this slide

11
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,480
this is a recorded and an archived live

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,920
stream so please provide us with

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,680
feedback so that we can improve on our

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,600
work and also if you're watching along

15
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,760
live please write any comments or

16
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,480
questions you have in the live chat all

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,640
backgrounds and perspectives are welcome

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,879
here and we'll be following good video

19
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,280
etiquette for live streams and thanks

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,560
blue for

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,920
helping a lot with the slides and for

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,280
coming on because this will be a fun

23
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,280
comp up

24
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,439
go to activeinference.org to learn more

25
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,759
about how to participate in any of the

26
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,799
lab activities or bring some new idea to

27
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,200
the lab

28
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,479
okay

29
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,920
here we are in

30
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,799
live stream number 36 in the second half

31
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,799
of january 2022

32
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,040
and the goal is to learn and discuss

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,759
this paper by matt sims and giovanni

34
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,280
pizzulo from 2021 the paper is called

35
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,520
modeling ourselves what the free energy

36
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,439
principle reveals about our implicit

37
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,439
notions of representation

38
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,399
and

39
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,200
as with all zero videos the video is an

40
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,000
introduction for some of the ideas and a

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,439
hasty review

42
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,920
so it's not a review or a final word

43
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,360
we're going to have the upcoming two

44
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,159
weeks to talk more about this paper and

45
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,399
hopefully talk to some of the authors or

46
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,079
any other people who are interested in

47
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,680
this idea

48
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,640
and

49
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,560
get involved if you want to talk about

50
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,878
the paper so let's just start with

51
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,200
saying hello and an introduction and

52
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,640
then what we were excited to read about

53
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,760
the paper i'm daniel i'm in california

54
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,599
and was excited to

55
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,120
read yet another paper on

56
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,440
representations and the fep because it

57
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,040
feels like we had a stretch back there

58
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,680
of

59
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,520
five in a row or something

60
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,319
what about you blue

61
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,200
i'm blue i'm in new mexico and um i

62
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,000
really enjoyed matt sims paper on

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,879
symbiosis that we did a while ago and i

64
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,680
thought this paper was really neat and

65
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,680
um really a clear elucidation of

66
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,879
the different categories of

67
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,400
representation and how like there's

68
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,000
overarching like representation and

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,080
non-representation and then several

70
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,920
different layers within that so i

71
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,360
thought it broke it down in a really

72
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,680
clear and concise way um even though

73
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,200
it's a lot of material to digest

74
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,080
do you want to ask the big question

75
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,879
sure the big question of the article was

76
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,040
can the free energy principle help us

77
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,680
advance or even resolve the long-lasting

78
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,159
debate on internal representation in

79
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,840
philosophy of mind

80
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,879
it's a long lasting debate so this is

81
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,200
like the dot zero of dot zeros because

82
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,879
it's clearly a topic you could spend a

83
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,640
lot of time on so

84
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,200
that's our disclaimer is uh

85
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,959
it's a long-standing debate

86
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,200
but here's kind of a meme slide so it's

87
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,560
uh the first section of this paper

88
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,400
right below the title

89
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,200
it has this quotation from walt whitman

90
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,080
and it says hold it up sternly see this

91
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,680
it sends back

92
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,920
who is it is it you

93
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,400
and uh then here are several different

94
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,519
images

95
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,319
and

96
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,400
just think about your perception of

97
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,080
these images and the cultural

98
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,599
significance that you might attach to

99
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,599
them or the way that black and white

100
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,319
pixels or gray pixels on a screen give

101
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,400
the illusion of depth or remind you of

102
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,480
an experience that you've never had so

103
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,720
that's kind of trippy and representation

104
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,239
gets at some of those

105
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,439
issues

106
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,880
that's one non-philosophical take on it

107
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,160
what are they going to aim to do in this

108
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,680
debate which we're going to sketch out

109
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,680
the sides of in

110
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,720
uh

111
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,759
this talk

112
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,680
or i guess this discussion um

113
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,280
do you want to read it blue or tell me

114
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,800
sure so

115
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,520
the authors argue that even if the fep

116
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,240
can't solve this long-standing debate

117
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,000
it can play an invaluable role in

118
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,759
revealing our hidden assumptions about

119
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,320
the very notion of representation

120
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,880
and can create some common ground to

121
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,199
discuss and negotiate them

122
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,040
so they say our general strategy is to

123
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,360
use the fep for conceptual clarification

124
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,520
of different notions of representation

125
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,840
we work backwards from representational

126
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,400
or non-representational interpretations

127
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,639
of the fep's constructs to the various

128
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,800
notions of representation that motivate

129
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,639
those interpretations

130
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,320
so they claim that it emerges from their

131
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,199
analysis that the fep has been or can be

132
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,960
used to implement various kinds of

133
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,360
computational models which satisfy the

134
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,960
requirements of certain theories of

135
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,039
representation hence the question of

136
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,639
whether or not the fep entails

137
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,120
representations depends on what notion

138
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,199
of representation one uses in the first

139
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,280
place

140
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,600
we're going to unpack that a lot but

141
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,360
just wanted to give the first coat of

142
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,280
paints on what they're aiming and what

143
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,639
they claim to do

144
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,919
so i'll read the first half of the

145
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,360
abstract

146
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,199
predictive processing theories are

147
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,360
increasingly popular in philosophy of

148
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,000
mind such process theories often gain

149
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
support from the free energy principle

150
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,720
fep a normative principle for adaptive

151
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,639
self-organized systems

152
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,240
yet there is a current and much

153
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,080
discussed debate about conflicting

154
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,199
philosophical interpretations of fep

155
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,360
for example representational versus

156
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,120
non-representational

157
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,880
here we argue that these different

158
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,720
interpretations depend on implicit

159
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,400
assumptions about what qualifies or

160
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,799
fails to qualify as representational

161
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,880
the next part

162
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,680
we deploy the fep instrumentally to

163
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,199
distinguish four main notions of

164
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,360
representation which focus on

165
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,360
organizational structural content

166
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,960
related and functional aspects

167
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,520
respectively the various ways that these

168
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,520
different aspects matter in arriving at

169
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,520
representation or non-represent

170
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,919
representational interpretations of the

171
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,800
fep are discussed we also discuss how

172
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,680
the fep may be seen as a unified view

173
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,680
where terms that traditionally belong to

174
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,319
different ontologies for example

175
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,360
notions of model and expectation versus

176
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,199
notions of autopoiesis and

177
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,919
synchronization can be harmonized

178
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,000
however rather than attempting to settle

179
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,960
the representationalist versus

180
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,840
non-representationalist debate and

181
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,039
reveal something about what

182
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,000
representations are simplicitor this

183
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,319
paper demonstrates how the free energy

184
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,919
principle may be used to reveal

185
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,000
something about those partaking in the

186
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,840
debate namely what are hidden

187
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,840
assumptions about what representations

188
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,319
are assumptions that act as sometimes

189
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,960
antithetical starting points in this

190
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,039
persistent philosophical debate

191
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,400
so there's really two

192
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,680
or three pieces to this paper

193
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,240
there's an introduction and

194
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,720
an abstract i guess we can delete that

195
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,039
um the first part introduces a short

196
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,440
summary on the free energy principle

197
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,919
and we'll see that

198
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:38,960
action

199
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,080
perception cognition loop

200
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,599
the bulk of the paper is in these four

201
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,800
segments of each with a dyadic

202
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,720
relationship of the representational and

203
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,039
the non-representational perspectives

204
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,400
and that section is a lot like a

205
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,520
literature review and a philosophical

206
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,879
taxonomy

207
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,680
of different perspectives and arguments

208
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,080
related to representation and fep and

209
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,080
these four subdivisions

210
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,000
there's then a

211
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,840
addendum on evolutionary function

212
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,560
specifically and

213
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,400
that's apt as

214
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,160
nothing in biology makes sense except in

215
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,319
the light of evolution as they say

216
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,319
and then section 5 kind of turns a

217
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,560
mirror back on

218
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,319
the process and thought

219
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,400
just like those earlier images with the

220
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,280
mirror

221
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,638
and that's where fep

222
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,958
differences in perspective are used

223
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,000
almost as input data for

224
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,399
theorizing and speculating about

225
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,799
different things which we'll get to so

226
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,320
that takes the authors then to the

227
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,880
conclusion it's a pretty wide-ranging

228
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,160
paper

229
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,240
and the keywords that are

230
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,320
here are active inference free energy

231
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,720
principle predictive processing

232
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,519
generative model internal representation

233
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,519
action-oriented representation

234
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,880
inactivism

235
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,640
forward model and markov blankets

236
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,200
there's no single path or single slide

237
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,120
that would do justice to all these

238
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,880
keywords so we're just going to kind of

239
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,240
jump in

240
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,000
and knowing that some people will be

241
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,519
really familiar with some of these terms

242
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,959
and others will be hearing about them

243
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,200
for the first time

244
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,640
so first the big topic is representation

245
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,399
now this is just a

246
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,640
quote from the paper whether

247
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,360
or not living organisms have or need

248
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,279
internal representations is an old and

249
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,519
fiercely debated topic

250
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,200
so we kind of like

251
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,320
unzipped that citation to add the titles

252
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,760
and the links and just some of the

253
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,120
images from these

254
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,000
citations so if these topics or any of

255
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,880
this

256
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,800
body of literature you feel like is well

257
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,160
motivated or

258
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,000
well reasoned or you've never been

259
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,920
exposed to it that's sort of the

260
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,839
continent we're on

261
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,480
and it is such a large continent so the

262
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,399
authors write such a debate is

263
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,839
reiterated within the predictive

264
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,760
processing view so they're going to tell

265
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,000
the story of representation from

266
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
predictive processing as sort of a

267
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,120
implicit

268
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,399
starting point

269
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,240
from a more specific and mechanistic

270
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,800
angle i.e assuming the fep is a good

271
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,959
model of living organisms does it entail

272
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,959
the notion of internal representation or

273
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,560
not so it's almost like we're

274
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,800
conditioning our analysis whether it's a

275
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,480
counterfactual or not

276
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,440
on fep being used instrumentally

277
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,440
so we're going to use it just like we

278
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,440
would use a ruler not by questioning the

279
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,680
ruler against known objects but by going

280
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,360
to unknown objects and investigating

281
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,440
them so that's the way that the fep is

282
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,839
going to be used in this very large

283
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,200
scale

284
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,240
topic

285
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,880
and complex area of representation

286
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,279
any comments blue

287
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,320
alright

288
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,680
another big topic and word that comes up

289
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,920
in this paper but also a lot of other of

290
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,200
our discussions is inactivism

291
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,079
and so who better to hear it from

292
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,560
than the radicals so

293
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,279
herrick 2014 i think it's a

294
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,399
thesis

295
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,480
why radical inactivism is not radical

296
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,320
enough a case for really radical and

297
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,720
activism so take it up with the author

298
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,640
if this is oversimplifying or that's

299
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,600
kind of the joke slash

300
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,000
appeal here it is oversimplifying and

301
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,160
here we see three different

302
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,079
uh frameworks contrasted against each

303
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,040
other

304
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,480
cognitivism

305
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,160
radical and activism and then really

306
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,279
radical in activism and

307
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,440
cognitivism differs from an activism on

308
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,760
the top row in that cognitivism says

309
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,079
basic cognition is representational and

310
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,399
an activism is going to be

311
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,360
rejecting that claim on all accounts

312
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,279
and then where this author is saying

313
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,600
that you could even go further

314
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,680
into the inactive camp or forest or

315
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,560
whatever

316
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,040
is you could even deny that linguistic

317
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,240
cognition

318
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,120
is representational so even if it looks

319
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,320
symbolic

320
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,519
and it looks like it has some

321
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,200
representational characteristic and it's

322
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,120
the gray zone that makes people go oh

323
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,440
okay maybe there is some redeeming

324
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,200
aspect of representation you just have

325
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,399
to keep on denying it so

326
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,000
maybe we can pick that thread up again

327
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,519
but that's sort of the lay of the land

328
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,480
of maybe the uh center and activists the

329
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,800
moderates and then the extremists

330
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,760
blew anything down

331
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,680
no it's so interesting to really think

332
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,880
about about representation and the brain

333
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,399
i mean coming from neuroscience actually

334
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,079
okay i'll add something coming from

335
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,519
neuroscience it's interesting to really

336
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,800
think about

337
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,519
um i mean the visual cortex is very

338
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,160
unique in the sense that we like know

339
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,240
that there's representation that is

340
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,360
replicated in the brain um but

341
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,880
everywhere else it's just kind of like

342
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,040
you know we've never found like the word

343
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,360
for apple in the brain somewhere like

344
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,760
there's no like apple neuron so so it's

345
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,279
just an interesting

346
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,959
i don't know just a juxtaposition i

347
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,200
guess about representation and language

348
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,079
um

349
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,880
thinking about it in terms of the brain

350
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,240
also one really

351
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,839
important aspect that we didn't mention

352
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,920
is it's about action like it is

353
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,560
basically saying that action is

354
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,160
it's related to embodiment and all these

355
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,760
other things but inactivism is just

356
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,200
focusing on action and what that means

357
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,399
um

358
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,399
all right free energy principle which

359
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,839
we're going to spend

360
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,399
a lot of the discussion on

361
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,639
it's an integrative prince proposal on

362
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,399
adaptive self-organizing systems that

363
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,920
remain far from thermodynamic

364
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,200
equilibrium

365
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,040
so that would be cool if we had one

366
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,560
common framework for things that maybe

367
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,839
were

368
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,160
far or close to equilibrium currently we

369
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,639
only have some of those areas of face

370
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,760
space

371
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,279
it starts from the premise that in order

372
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,839
to survive living organisms engage in

373
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,839
reciprocal action perception exchanges

374
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,360
with their environment

375
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,680
they must do what they can in order to

376
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,360
remain within a neighborhood of viable

377
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,240
states

378
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,399
that's kind of the cybernetic regulator

379
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,760
insight

380
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,839
then the bottom paragraph

381
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,920
the idea is cast in bayesian terms by

382
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,680
assuming that ecologically adaptive

383
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,440
states constitute the priors of the

384
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,560
agents

385
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,560
the states that an agent prefers to

386
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,040
visit become the states that it expects

387
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,040
to visit

388
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,040
hence minimizing surprise or its

389
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,639
long-term average which is entropy

390
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,600
becomes

391
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,120
a primary imperative for living

392
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,360
organisms as it prevents them or permits

393
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,360
them to counteract an otherwise

394
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,040
unavoidable process of dispersion and

395
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,279
loss of integrity which kind of closes

396
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,199
the loop back with the resistance to

397
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,120
dissipation that was brought up in the

398
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,079
beginning

399
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,040
so this is kind of one fep boomerang

400
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,920
from starting with a focus on resisting

401
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,880
dissipation and then moving through the

402
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,560
action and perception loop

403
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,440
to ecological preferences and back to

404
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,519
the reduction of uncertainty and thus

405
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,480
resisting dissipation

406
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,079
a partitioning that is

407
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,199
natural

408
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,079
or at least complementary to the fep is

409
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,600
the markov blanket partitioning

410
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,639
uh

411
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,120
we've talked about this in several other

412
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,720
streams so we won't go into it in too

413
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,120
much detail this is from 26

414
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,839
and

415
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:06,720
the

416
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,199
markov blanket condition at least in its

417
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,120
uh more narrow slash technical sense

418
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,240
is referring to some set of nodes

419
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,079
representing statistical variables

420
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,560
and that set of nodes that make up the

421
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,199
blanket make some other sets of nodes

422
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,639
two other sets of nodes which we can

423
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,320
call the internal and external states it

424
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,759
makes those two sets conditionally

425
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,040
independent

426
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,800
and the edges are statistical influence

427
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,880
blue

428
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,720
what else would you say about markov

429
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,199
blankets they say it here beautifully so

430
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,120
the blanket states act as an

431
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,759
informational boundary between internal

432
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,920
and external states and that's like the

433
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,519
simplest way to think about it right

434
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,759
like my skin acts as a barrier between

435
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,399
myself and the world the blanket acts as

436
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,880
a barrier

437
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,839
yes cool

438
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:00,880
okay

439
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,680
leaving fap land proper

440
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,720
we can

441
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,920
zoom out to some related topics that

442
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,360
sometimes get brought up in discussions

443
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,680
of fep but often don't

444
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,240
so first is the predictive processing

445
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,440
framework

446
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,320
this is drawn from a citation that was

447
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,160
in the bibliography but not sure if it

448
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,800
was in the text highway 2020

449
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,399
and this is a

450
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,519
paper

451
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,079
new directions in predictive processing

452
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,920
so predictive processing asserts that

453
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,839
perceptual and cognitive systems engage

454
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,920
in prediction error minimization

455
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,240
enabling approximate bayesian perceptual

456
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,680
inference

457
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,759
and some but

458
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,759
apparently not all authors

459
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,560
emphasize action so clark and howie

460
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,040
famously and recently have emphasized

461
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,199
that action is essential to predictive

462
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,880
processing in the form of active

463
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,360
inference where the system infers its

464
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,720
own policies

465
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,480
so really

466
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,120
emphasizing that the predictions are not

467
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,399
just about

468
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,600
sensory

469
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,800
inputs

470
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,480
but causes

471
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,760
of sensory input hypotheses about latent

472
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,640
unobserved causes in the world and also

473
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,640
one's own action policies what one

474
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,160
expects to do

475
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,839
and there's a really awesome

476
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,199
supplemental file for this paper that

477
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,720
includes a great literature analysis and

478
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,559
a lot of keywords

479
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,959
and unique uh

480
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,960
predictions and lists of

481
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,840
empirical evidence so this is really

482
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,360
awesome uh work and it'd be great to

483
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,280
hear from people who

484
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,200
study predictive processing or are more

485
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,799
familiar with it

486
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,320
how they see it in relationship to

487
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,600
active inference and fep

488
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,559
something that's

489
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,200
in the overlap of predictive processing

490
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,120
bayesian statistical theories active

491
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,039
inference is the idea of a generative

492
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:53,919
model

493
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,360
so let's recall

494
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,120
from

495
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,320
dcm

496
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,360
uh the dynamical causal modeling

497
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,679
that uh which we talked about in the

498
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:04,960
previous

499
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,000
weeks in uh number 35

500
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,520
and

501
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,160
here in dcm it's a

502
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,080
appealing to biologically grounded

503
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,000
models and dynamical systems theory to

504
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,320
create a probabilistic generative model

505
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,880
of hemodynamic fluctuations so what is a

506
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,640
generative model

507
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,559
it's basically opposed to a descriptive

508
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,799
model so why would one use a generative

509
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,280
model in statistics because these types

510
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,520
of models can be run in both directions

511
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,240
they can be fit from data but they can

512
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,799
also be used to generate data

513
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,400
and then they can be used in different

514
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,760
ways because of that capacity

515
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,360
dimensional general

516
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,559
generative models can be very

517
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,559
computationally efficient

518
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,280
because they only have to be updating a

519
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,039
few parameters rather than keeping track

520
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,039
of every single data parameter

521
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,760
and then a little bit more on the

522
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,760
interpretive layer or

523
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,160
beyond the merely statistical

524
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,320
generative models capture some of these

525
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,320
open-ended and creative or complex

526
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,880
dynamics that are associated with action

527
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,280
and perception and cognition

528
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,760
and therefore there are links to

529
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,480
not only the cognitive sciences but also

530
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,799
philosophy and phenomenology

531
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,000
so it's kind of an idea from statistics

532
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,160
that gets connected to some of the

533
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,480
fundamentals of neuroscience and

534
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,840
philosophy

535
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,159
and

536
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,200
uh

537
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,440
anything to add on that blue

538
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,880
yeah so just when i think of the

539
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,640
generative model um

540
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,919
having listened to so many people

541
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,320
describe it my favorite description is

542
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,600
um

543
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,559
almost as like the the recognition model

544
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,760
is more like the hardware or like the

545
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,679
state and then the generative model is

546
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,120
like the software the action between

547
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,160
them or like the dominoes and the like

548
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,000
stacked dominoes and then the cascading

549
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,240
wave right so the dominoes would be the

550
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,679
recognition model and then the

551
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,120
generative model is the relationship

552
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,760
between them the cascading wave of

553
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,600
dominance i always like to to use that

554
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,880
analogy just it's clear for me so

555
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,919
cool

556
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,559
and here's one more slide from 26

557
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,400
where the idea of the mark called

558
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,440
blanket which we pulled from 26 as well

559
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,240
is connected to the idea of a generative

560
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,760
model

561
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,400
in the section on predictive processing

562
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,880
and so in this paper so go check out

563
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,039
number 26 or the paper on bayesian

564
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,600
mechanics to learn more but the idea is

565
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,679
that it's possible to use that markov

566
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,200
blanket partitioning

567
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,600
so that there's the blanket states

568
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,880
statistically

569
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,760
isolating internal and external states

570
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,440
and then there might be some

571
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,760
systems where those partitioned internal

572
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,720
states

573
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,360
are acting as if they are

574
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,000
doing inference on external states

575
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,640
so that would be like if i

576
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,039
said i'm gonna hold up three fingers and

577
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,080
put it behind my back and then you had a

578
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,880
generative model that was about

579
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,400
what was the state of that unobserved

580
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,520
variable

581
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,039
and uh

582
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,840
that's something to look more into from

583
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,760
the details on generative model as with

584
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,039
other papers

585
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,039
and that kind of brings us to our last

586
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,880
keyword which is

587
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,480
active inference

588
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,400
and so we'll go into a little more

589
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,200
detail here

590
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,200
they describe that active inference

591
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,080
agents

592
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,679
are self-evidencing

593
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,679
which is to say that because minimizing

594
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,919
free energy over time is equivalent to

595
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,840
maximizing bayesian model evidence or

596
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,360
self-evidence

597
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,600
in engaging in long-term

598
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,320
active inference agents

599
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,640
seek out or generate those sense sensory

600
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,400
samples that maximize the lower bound on

601
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,919
the evidence for an implicit model of

602
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,400
how their sensory states were generated

603
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,559
as such active inference agents author

604
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,080
evidence for their own continued

605
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,400
existence via free energy minimizing

606
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,640
model optimization

607
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,600
so

608
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,559
active inference is using statistics to

609
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,559
operationalize

610
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,799
some of the information thermodynamic

611
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,520
like formalisms of the fep

612
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,480
so

613
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,120
it'd be a more narrow interpretation

614
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,360
that that carries no or little

615
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,760
philosophical baggage or claims to how

616
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,000
the world really is it would be a more

617
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,640
broad or stronger interpretation to

618
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,039
think that this is capturing the actual

619
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,960
information dynamics or the actual

620
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,640
thermodynamic

621
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,559
relationships of systems but the

622
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,039
instrumental usage is more of a

623
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,200
statistical similarity or at least

624
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,640
attractability

625
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,679
argument

626
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,159
and that is not without precedent not

627
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,640
even close because the variational

628
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,760
bayesian methods which minimize or

629
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,120
optimize this

630
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,720
quantity called the evidence lower bound

631
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,320
start maximizing the

632
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,960
lower bound for how good the evidence is

633
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,840
and

634
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,960
others in many places have motivated

635
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,480
this fundamental

636
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,440
component of modern bayesian statistics

637
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,919
from multiple different areas and it's

638
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,520
kind of like equations are true so

639
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,360
equations can be linked to each other

640
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,840
and it's just kind of cool that these

641
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,679
kl divergences

642
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,679
as well as free energy

643
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,679
and the information or description

644
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:12,799
length

645
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,280
criterion all align and that's not even

646
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,240
like an active synthesis

647
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,240
applying that to inference on action is

648
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,159
something that is

649
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,000
bringing together a lot of these ideas

650
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,559
from variational bathing methods with a

651
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,640
lot of ideas from control theory

652
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,159
cybernetics inactivism etc and

653
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,039
again

654
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,880
we can explore back and find out which

655
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,280
ideas came from where but just to keep

656
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,440
in mind it's like these pieces were not

657
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,159
tied together by active those are

658
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,360
excellent relationships in the

659
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,480
literature but academ does integrate

660
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,400
the free energy principle and that

661
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,880
center meme that they started with that

662
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,120
things have to resist dissipation

663
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,320
with

664
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,400
all of this philosophy

665
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,960
and more quantitative areas that have to

666
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,120
do with action and perception

667
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,360
and then in the dot one and dot two

668
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,039
we'll go more into

669
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,200
the um variational and expected free

670
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,720
energy but

671
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,320
kind of wanted to just

672
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,679
give a little thought on active

673
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,440
inference and if someone has a different

674
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,440
thought it'd be awesome to hear it as

675
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,600
well but this paper was very precise

676
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,320
and very um

677
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,720
subtle in how it thought about some of

678
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,799
these areas so i think it's really good

679
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,480
to be clear about what we're talking

680
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,360
about

681
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,479
in this case

682
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,480
okay onto the paper

683
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,640
all right

684
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,960
so this is going to be a slow roll of

685
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,520
the introduction

686
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,039
there's a growing consensus in

687
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,880
computational and systems neuroscience

688
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,640
around the idea the brain is a

689
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,799
predictive machine which uses internal

690
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,240
or generative models to continuously

691
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,600
generate predictions in service of

692
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,679
prediction action and learning so

693
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,720
starting with the idea of prediction

694
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,159
second sentence

695
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,640
one of the ways that people are studying

696
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,559
prediction in the brain

697
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,640
is predictive processing so we talked

698
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,760
about that a few minutes ago

699
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,880
the free energy principle is extending

700
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,480
predictive processing

701
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,159
by providing it with a fundamental

702
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,480
principle of adaptive self-organization

703
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,880
that's the resist dissipation meme that

704
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,720
isn't intrinsically within predictive

705
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,320
processing framework which might

706
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,360
describe

707
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,880
audio processing in a radar signal

708
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,039
and so that

709
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,559
union of fep and predictive processing

710
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,440
are starting to become prominent outside

711
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,360
of systems neuroscience

712
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,120
which might seem like their natural

713
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,279
niche or origin

714
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,279
but it's also the case that philosophers

715
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,720
in the philosophy of mind are starting

716
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,120
to think about it

717
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,039
and

718
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,360
despite that attention the authors are

719
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,000
arguing that some of the implications

720
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,360
for fep's uh

721
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,480
existence

722
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,360
remain widely debated i think we can

723
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,640
agree on that

724
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,720
and they're going to focus on one of the

725
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,320
prominent discussions that they think is

726
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,240
the most prominent which is whether the

727
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,400
fep is representational or

728
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,000
non-representational

729
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,480
and then to what extent it is also

730
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,559
bearing on debates related to

731
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:21,919
internalism

732
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,120
action orientation and activism so just

733
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,320
it's all over the map it's a

734
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,559
multi-dimensional philosophy face space

735
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:29,919
with the fep

736
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,240
and it's not totally resolved but that's

737
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,840
what they're going to go into in this

738
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,158
paper

739
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,840
okay

740
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,840
the oh yeah blue

741
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,559
so

742
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:45,360
um

743
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,919
they they note here that philosophical

744
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,039
discussions or representation wars about

745
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,600
the fep have typically been focused on

746
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,679
four aspects of the notion of

747
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:56,960
representation

748
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,440
so these four aspects are organizational

749
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,520
structural content related or functional

750
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,039
um and

751
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,440
the organizational aspects have some

752
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,880
variable inside a system that's

753
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,720
separated from that which it represents

754
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,559
outside the system

755
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,120
structural aspects have representational

756
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,279
vehicles that are structurally similar

757
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,799
to the state of affairs in the world

758
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,200
that they stand for content related

759
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,919
aspects have internal models that either

760
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,080
encode environmental contingencies or

761
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,159
sensory motor contingencies

762
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,080
specification or description of how the

763
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,880
world is taken to be in turn analyzed in

764
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,200
terms of correctness or truth conditions

765
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,360
and then the functional aspects support

766
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,080
vicarious use before or in the absence

767
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,159
of external events of

768
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,399
internal variables of a model

769
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:47,399
well

770
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,960
it is kind of a whoa but this four-fold

771
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,440
distinction is the structure of the

772
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,799
paper so we're gonna do a few fun things

773
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,480
to help understand

774
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,640
this because it is the contribution and

775
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,960
the structure of the paper so everyone's

776
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,960
going to interpret all of this in their

777
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,880
own way which is awesome but we do

778
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,880
really want to be clear about what the

779
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,120
author's contributions are

780
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,159
so

781
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,559
in an almost unprecedented maneuver

782
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,880
we're going to go to the end of the

783
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,200
paper first and then also have the

784
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,279
figures out of order

785
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,880
we're going to start with what we can

786
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,640
learn from this debate so if you're not

787
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,000
sure if you want to listen to the next

788
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,039
like 40 minutes on going into this for

789
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,720
full distinction

790
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,200
you get it up front so

791
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,279
they're going to review some of the most

792
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,279
prominent philosophical interpretations

793
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,799
of the fep

794
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:39,919
they then

795
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,120
summarize

796
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,039
those interpretations according to the

797
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,520
four different categories that blue just

798
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,360
read

799
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,440
for each of those categories they're

800
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,520
going to consider multiple constructs of

801
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,720
fep

802
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,039
so kind of tools in the fep

803
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,120
toolkit ecosystem

804
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,679
and they're going to

805
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,480
argue that depending on which

806
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,279
perspective you take on which of these

807
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,039
categories and which constructs you're

808
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,320
going to come to different conclusions

809
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,000
about the representational or

810
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,559
non-representational nature of the fep

811
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,360
so

812
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,600
it's kind of like a checkerboard

813
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,399
that's their first

814
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,520
salvo

815
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,240
is

816
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,120
we're going to outline a flow chart and

817
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,399
a grid and a structure like a taxonomy

818
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,039
of philosophical ideas related to

819
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,000
this

820
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,960
triple

821
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,279
dimensional space of

822
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,440
aspects of representation

823
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,120
constructs of the fep

824
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,720
and then the categorical variable

825
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,799
representational or non-representational

826
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:41,919
claims

827
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:42,880
and then

828
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,480
the whole second part

829
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,840
is saying we're going to use that

830
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,720
three-dimensional phase space

831
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,440
to shine a light on

832
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,039
one's own implicit notions of

833
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,880
representation so that's kind of like

834
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,200
the looking in the mirror

835
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,520
strange loop part but the first part is

836
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,600
more like a philosophical literature

837
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,960
analysis

838
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,960
and their contribution in figure two

839
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,320
is to make this awesome flow chart

840
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,120
so

841
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,679
this is going to funnel you from the

842
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:16,720
start

843
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,440
in the four different domains four

844
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,120
aspects organizational structural

845
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,880
content and functional

846
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,440
and then from those four starting points

847
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,279
kind of like sorry board

848
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,960
you're going to get funneled

849
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,760
towards

850
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,960
non-representational or representational

851
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,080
fep depending on decisions and that's

852
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,399
what we're going to unpack in the next

853
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,879
sections

854
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,720
because again it's kind of like

855
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,720
trippy and there's a lot to think about

856
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,200
this is going to be our map

857
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,880
so it's going to be at the bottom of all

858
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,760
of the upcoming slides

859
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,080
which of these eight

860
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,080
sections were in it's like a cube

861
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,679
divided in eight

862
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,279
little cubes

863
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,480
or two

864
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,480
tetrahedra or some other pattern but

865
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,240
basically we're gonna see whether we're

866
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,000
in like representation camp or

867
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,120
non-representation camp and which aspect

868
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,279
we're focused on and then here's that

869
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,559
table but it's just the tip of the

870
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:15,840
iceberg

871
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,799
so

872
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,559
how can we organize

873
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,360
our thinking around philosophy

874
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,360
and increase the rigor

875
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,120
and the accessibility of different

876
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,159
arguments

877
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,360
because it can be difficult sometimes to

878
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,679
parse it in

879
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,679
long texts

880
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,919
and so the authors clearly thought a lot

881
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,159
about this so it's a really um pleasure

882
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,799
to read about it and learn about it

883
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,080
and the flowchart is a great addition so

884
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,640
that is going to be our map in the

885
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,360
coming slides

886
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,519
right now thanks for making such a

887
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,000
beautiful map i have to say like i had

888
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,840
like pasted a whole bunch of these ideas

889
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,279
and tried to like categorize them and

890
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,279
then daniel you know constructed them

891
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,679
into this beautiful flow chart so well

892
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,120
yeah they made the flowchart i made the

893
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,039
grid yep the grid that's what i meant

894
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,960
the grid the grid

895
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,120
before we see the grid in action though

896
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,159
let's just recall this action perception

897
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:13,840
loop and we're not gonna go into it

898
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,120
right now but that's definitely for a

899
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,120
dot one and dot two

900
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,279
what are these

901
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,960
nodes and edges and

902
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,399
which

903
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,840
can and can't happen and what do they

904
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,960
represent

905
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,919
so

906
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,399
that is sort of the partitioning

907
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,000
that we're going to be working within

908
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,440
which we brought up a little earlier

909
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,960
with the markov blanket and in a lot of

910
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,480
our other discussions

911
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,440
okay so let us start

912
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,640
in this

913
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,080
top left

914
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,760
square

915
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,240
so this is the organizational

916
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,320
aspect the representational perspective

917
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,039
so

918
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,200
the organizational aspect

919
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,760
is uh

920
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,000
describing how variables inside a system

921
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,919
are separated from what it represents

922
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,440
outside the system

923
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,960
so that's like the architectural

924
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,840
take on representations that's i don't

925
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,080
know is it classic representations

926
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,840
but um the pro-representation camp

927
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,320
are going to argue that internal states

928
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,480
are segregated from the external world

929
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,399
via markov blanket

930
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:19,519
therefore

931
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,919
the brain's activity cast as internal

932
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:22,880
states

933
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,720
do represent what it doesn't have access

934
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,640
to

935
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,799
blue what do you think

936
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,559
or anything else to add on it

937
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,120
nothing i want to delve into here

938
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,559
because i'm going to save it for that

939
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,880
one okay okay in contrast

940
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,640
there's other people

941
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,200
and other perspectives who

942
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,880
are going to

943
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,799
in the organizational aspect take a

944
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,799
non-representational

945
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,240
and so philosophers of the ecological

946
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,640
and activist persuasion have

947
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,640
approached that same markov blanket

948
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,720
formalism

949
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,799
and basically framed it

950
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,200
in terms of

951
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,039
non-representational view of the fep

952
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,119
like yella bronenberg's paper the

953
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,199
anticipating brain is not a scientist

954
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,199
free energy principle from an ecological

955
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,960
and active perspective

956
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,159
so they argue in those papers in a lot

957
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,480
of papers by yella and others

958
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,719
that

959
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,960
just because you deploy the markov

960
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,879
blanket formalism

961
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,560
it doesn't imply the behavior of the

962
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,639
system is best explained by inferences

963
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,960
generated by an internal model

964
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,719
the structure of which is representing

965
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,119
that which is a model of

966
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,000
so

967
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,679
read the papers for more detail but it's

968
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,399
like

969
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,638
um

970
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,239
it's an interesting idea and it was also

971
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,040
interesting to read in from this paper

972
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,279
that

973
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,239
the

974
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,800
restatement of this argument that

975
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,400
these partially informationally

976
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,839
encapsulated systems like we talked

977
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:00,839
about in

978
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:02,640
35 are

979
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,400
parsimoniously understood in terms of

980
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,000
achieving high relative mutual

981
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,200
information

982
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,280
between the non-representational process

983
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,800
of generalized synchrony in huygens 1673

984
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,119
the pendulum clock so you can get like

985
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,240
oscillating pendulums that synchronize

986
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,079
but they don't have representations of

987
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,359
each other

988
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,359
now maybe you need

989
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,760
representations to um

990
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,119
do something else but that kind of gets

991
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,760
to that inactivist radical and activist

992
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,599
debate so we'll go more into it later

993
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,040
just kind of cool

994
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,599
old citation and um

995
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,320
interesting idea so

996
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,680
based upon the organization of the

997
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,680
system there's people who say yeah the

998
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,160
fep is representational of course

999
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,240
because the internal states are isolated

1000
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,480
or no because you can get high mutual

1001
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,320
information without representation

1002
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,160
all right

1003
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,079
that's like what what dean called nine

1004
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,640
o'clocking

1005
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,480
it's nine o'clock that's general

1006
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,560
synchrony exactly

1007
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,520
there's doesn't need to be a

1008
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,599
representation of um brushing the teeth

1009
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,880
in the

1010
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,440
in the mind or the anything of the

1011
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,760
reader

1012
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,560
okay

1013
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,880
on to the second aspect the structural

1014
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,800
aspects so the question to be addressed

1015
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,320
is whether generative models are

1016
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,440
structurally similar to their targets

1017
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,359
or accurate descriptions of external

1018
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:26,720
reality

1019
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,240
or

1020
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,400
whether models needn't be accurate but

1021
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,800
merely adequate enough

1022
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,040
to leverage for adaptive behavioral

1023
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,160
control

1024
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,880
so does it actually need to represent

1025
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,040
the thing

1026
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,520
or can it be just some other

1027
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,760
representation

1028
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,560
that

1029
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,680
is effective enough

1030
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,920
so here's the pro and the con for

1031
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,480
representational on one

1032
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,920
slide

1033
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,359
the top

1034
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,160
structural representationalist view

1035
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,839
argues that the generative model has to

1036
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,440
have some structural resemblance with

1037
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,119
the generative process in order to be

1038
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,280
useful for control purposes that's

1039
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,920
really related to the good regulator

1040
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,720
theorem from cybernetics

1041
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,880
um

1042
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,640
and so

1043
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,240
the argument there is you're going to

1044
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,880
need the good representation about it

1045
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,400
in order to be

1046
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,640
on the right page in complex

1047
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,560
environments

1048
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,160
um

1049
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,359
others

1050
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:30,960
disagree

1051
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,200
so here's one line of argument that the

1052
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,040
formal constructs in active inference

1053
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,800
specifically the generative density g

1054
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,480
if it's understood correctly according

1055
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,200
to some authors it would turn out to be

1056
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,079
non-representational

1057
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,920
those authors suggested ramp said at all

1058
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,240
2019 that generative models do not meet

1059
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,680
the requirements of structural

1060
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,200
representations

1061
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,960
where some internal structure replicates

1062
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,200
some structure of a generative process

1063
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,960
so the generative model

1064
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,680
is the organism's model of action

1065
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,839
the generative process is the actual

1066
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,240
world out there the niche that's giving

1067
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,320
rise to observations and so in other

1068
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,920
words you might be

1069
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,320
i don't know if this might be a mal

1070
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,680
example but like

1071
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,680
to run you don't need to have an

1072
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,040
abstract representation of your own body

1073
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,040
you merely need the

1074
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,240
action

1075
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,880
interactions with your body

1076
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,119
and so this is kind of arguing that the

1077
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,359
internal generative density g

1078
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,560
inactive doesn't have to have any

1079
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,560
resemblance structurally to even the

1080
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,800
problem which it's being deployed to

1081
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,040
solve

1082
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,920
well and this always goes to the map and

1083
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,599
the territory and the difference between

1084
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,760
the map and the territory so

1085
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,720
structural similarity like what does

1086
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,400
that mean

1087
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,880
right like so so how similar is there

1088
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,160
some metric that you're using for

1089
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,800
structural similarity like how similar

1090
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,119
is the map of the united states to the

1091
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,520
actual united states right and so what

1092
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,280
what does that even mean structural

1093
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,520
similarity sorry like i'm i'm probably

1094
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,280
you know

1095
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,240
poking the fire but

1096
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,280
let's

1097
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,960
hear from um

1098
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,079
alex keefer or maxwell or anyone else

1099
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,920
who feels really strongly about this

1100
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,240
issue because we've had some fun talks

1101
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,200
on it before and it's just

1102
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,240
i just liked seeing the pro and the con

1103
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,160
laid out together

1104
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,440
and then

1105
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,960
the authors were very um

1106
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,119
very i just like arguing what is the

1107
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,960
difference between the pro and the con i

1108
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,400
i want to i want somebody to draw the

1109
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,280
line for me what is similar and what is

1110
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,200
not similar enough

1111
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,320
nice okay now to the third aspect so

1112
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,880
this is the content related

1113
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,880
aspect

1114
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,119
um

1115
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,760
whether the generative models

1116
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,320
need to explicitly model the ways

1117
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,119
external states produce sensations

1118
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,280
aka environmental models or the ways

1119
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,359
that actions produce sensations or

1120
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,560
sensory motor models

1121
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,520
this is very closely related to the

1122
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,440
previous

1123
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,079
aspect so i think it'd be cool to unpack

1124
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,599
it a little more but there is a little

1125
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,599
bit of nuance

1126
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,280
with

1127
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,040
sensory motor

1128
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,319
systems

1129
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,040
which we talked about in several places

1130
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,920
like skilled performance

1131
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,500
and um

1132
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,680
[Music]

1133
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,880
basically

1134
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,640
this is just one

1135
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,880
uh sub argument within this section a

1136
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,800
pro and a con

1137
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,880
um and they're talking about essentially

1138
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,599
skilled performance how sensory motor

1139
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,680
models can afford sophisticated

1140
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,760
cognitive processing

1141
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,079
and so the first

1142
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,760
argument here

1143
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,560
is that here comes that same

1144
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,280
yellow broomberg 2016 paper the

1145
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,920
anticipating brain is not a scientist

1146
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,760
saying that yeah actually sensory motor

1147
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,839
loops if you're going to trust the story

1148
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,640
for one level of analysis then why

1149
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,119
are more so-called complex behaviors not

1150
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,119
just more complex combinations of

1151
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,960
modules which don't

1152
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,960
appeal to any representational content

1153
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,880
and then

1154
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,560
the sensory motor dynamics created by

1155
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,240
those models may be progressively

1156
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,760
internalized to support mental

1157
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,599
operations detached from a sensory

1158
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,680
motorcycle so maybe like walking and

1159
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,079
chewing gum or something like that or

1160
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,319
maybe think about like an insect flying

1161
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,560
or walking and how much of that is just

1162
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,440
the shape of its body in motion and just

1163
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,960
the way that the

1164
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,640
muscles and the joints just like flex

1165
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,359
and so ascribing the total motion of

1166
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:44,400
every joint to cognitive actions

1167
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,599
just

1168
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,280
is probably asking too much of cognition

1169
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,920
unless taking embodied and morphological

1170
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,680
computation as another type of

1171
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,880
computation

1172
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,839
and then

1173
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:56,800
um

1174
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,240
firing back

1175
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,839
for the representationalists

1176
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,760
um is um

1177
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,520
coming from the area of schema theory

1178
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,920
which is where there is a nucleus of

1179
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,599
sensory motor models but then they're

1180
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:14,240
extended to include

1181
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,480
external causes of sensations so that's

1182
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,079
just kind of like a flavor of one of the

1183
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:19,520
sub debates

1184
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,599
and it'd be good to discuss i think how

1185
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:22,880
the um

1186
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,119
structural and organizational and

1187
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,280
content related differ

1188
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,040
because it is like a nuanced debate and

1189
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,119
so i appreciated how clear they did make

1190
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:31,920
it

1191
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,720
given that it's murky waters because

1192
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,960
these are like four aspects of a

1193
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,000
philosophical idea

1194
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:41,200
oh

1195
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,440
then of course this meme

1196
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,680
okay so

1197
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,079
um the embodied cognition literature has

1198
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:49,599
shown some practical examples of how

1199
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,520
good control can be realized using fast

1200
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,280
and frugal solutions and very simple

1201
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,000
models this is an example that dave

1202
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,040
described on a live stream just recently

1203
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,880
one popular example is the baseball

1204
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,640
outfielder problem or the fact that

1205
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,720
catching a moving ball may not require a

1206
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,640
full model of the ball's position

1207
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,400
velocity and direction

1208
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,480
allowing for trajectory prediction but a

1209
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,160
simpler control mechanism that only

1210
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,920
keeps the image of the ball stationary

1211
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,200
on the retina

1212
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,319
all right so

1213
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,319
here on the left

1214
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,720
this is like the physics

1215
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,160
class model

1216
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,160
of some of the parameters so this is

1217
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,000
already a map of the territory we're not

1218
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,680
going into the temperature of the ball

1219
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,599
and um you know the wavelength of the

1220
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,079
grass so this isn't like a world model

1221
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:33,920
this is just the physics-reduced model

1222
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,200
of the physics of the asymptotic ball in

1223
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,200
this kind of idealized setting

1224
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,640
and so that's a lot of parameters like

1225
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,560
as drawn out there

1226
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,960
and here from this wired article how do

1227
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,880
people actually catch baseballs

1228
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,280
here's the apparent ball position

1229
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,960
as a function of time

1230
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,760
and just showing how if if um

1231
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,640
you're in the position to catch the ball

1232
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,119
that there's a simple heuristic line

1233
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,160
related to the apparent balls position

1234
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,520
whereas

1235
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,280
balls that you're too short or too long

1236
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,640
to catch

1237
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,520
um

1238
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,839
have a very different visual trajectory

1239
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:14,079
so in other words an activism

1240
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,599
is saying

1241
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,599
this on the left doesn't have to be the

1242
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,520
representation

1243
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,960
that would be something that might

1244
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,240
satisfy

1245
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,040
the most formal representationalist but

1246
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,960
then this is sort of a gray area like

1247
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,599
what if there is a visual representation

1248
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,280
of the ball on the retina so there is

1249
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,480
something that's featuring

1250
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,480
information about the real world in an

1251
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,160
actionable way

1252
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,760
but it is of a totally different type

1253
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,520
than

1254
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,319
the parameters in the physics class

1255
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:47,920
and so that can get of course a little

1256
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,599
sticky so here is

1257
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,280
us on the phillies

1258
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,599
we're trying to catch the fly ball

1259
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:54,960
here's fristen

1260
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,960
hitting it out of the park

1261
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,280
with the action perception loop

1262
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,000
and all the work in this field

1263
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:02,800
so

1264
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,400
what is the equivalent

1265
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,400
do we need to have

1266
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,839
the physics class model

1267
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:10,880
or

1268
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,599
is it possible for us to have

1269
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,280
some other type of understanding

1270
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,680
just a thought what do you think blue

1271
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,440
so it just really makes me think about

1272
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,119
like blindness

1273
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:24,720
right and i know that like this seems

1274
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,200
like a way out there trajectory but but

1275
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,760
like you know we know the physics of our

1276
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,280
natural environment we know it pretty

1277
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,839
well what about when we remove ourselves

1278
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,599
or like remove one sense like remove

1279
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,000
vision right now we have like a really

1280
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,400
different

1281
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,760
perception of our environment um and

1282
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,680
we have to completely like retrain

1283
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,680
through like you know kinesthetic memory

1284
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,680
where we are in our environment if like

1285
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,520
the lights go out i mean i was without

1286
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,960
power for four hours the other day in

1287
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,160
the middle of the night and i was like

1288
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,280
totally freaked out because i live in

1289
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,040
the country and there was absolutely no

1290
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,480
light like none

1291
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,200
so so in that like you have to know

1292
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,960
where all the things are so like this is

1293
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,760
a structural map in your mind of your

1294
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,599
reality that's really different from

1295
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,839
what you're able to absolutely perceive

1296
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,200
at that moment

1297
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,000
just makes me think of that

1298
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
nice that's just a fun slide no

1299
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,359
area slides

1300
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,480
um

1301
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,280
this is still on the uh uh this is i

1302
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,680
guess on the functional aspects all

1303
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,960
right so uh here's the functional

1304
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,160
perspective

1305
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,440
or the functional

1306
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,079
aspects of representation

1307
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:35,920
another way to address the issue of what

1308
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,680
a representation is and what it is not

1309
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,599
is by asking what functional role

1310
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,040
representations play within a

1311
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,200
hierarchical architecture

1312
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,520
so this is the function

1313
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,280
kind of the pragmatics of the

1314
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,520
representation what it does

1315
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,359
an idea that dates back to at least

1316
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,440
piaget 1954

1317
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,760
is the idea that representation should

1318
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,319
vicariously stand for something external

1319
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,160
in its absence

1320
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,560
and afford vicarious operations i.e

1321
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,160
mental operations

1322
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,119
using an internal internal vehicle

1323
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:09,280
that are executed before acting on the

1324
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,000
external referent of the vehicle

1325
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,240
or even when the external referent is

1326
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,920
absent

1327
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,720
so it is able to be

1328
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,559
cause and effect

1329
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:23,440
within the mental ecosystem

1330
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,480
like

1331
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,040
we'll see from these examples

1332
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,280
consider mentally whether one would

1333
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,839
enjoy eating a pizza with no pizza in

1334
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,480
sight so be like okay think of a pizza

1335
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,559
do you want to eat that now

1336
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:38,480
imagine that type of food that i

1337
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,319
previously mentioned and then what type

1338
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,640
of restaurant it is and what equipment

1339
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,640
do they have in the kitchen like an oven

1340
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,480
or something like that so there's

1341
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,079
something that's being functionally

1342
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:49,680
carried forth

1343
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,720
in that

1344
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,160
cognitive sequence can that be

1345
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,720
uniquely explained predicted control

1346
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,880
designed with just sensory motor loops

1347
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,880
this functional role of representations

1348
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,480
has been expressed in terms of whether

1349
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,160
the agent's internal operations are

1350
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,839
detached from its action perception

1351
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:10,400
cycle and hence autonomously generated

1352
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,160
versus determined or sustained by

1353
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,680
external stimuli

1354
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,400
so if something were just repeatedly um

1355
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,240
causing visual stimuli and that were

1356
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,200
causing like sort of um unaware

1357
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,319
movements

1358
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:24,079
that might be one

1359
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:25,920
category of phenomena

1360
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,880
but what about going on a walk

1361
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,680
and remembering a five-digit number

1362
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,720
by just

1363
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,960
chanting it to yourself

1364
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,839
is that sensory motor how is that um

1365
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:40,400
playing out and when cognition is

1366
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,480
playing a functional role seemingly

1367
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,240
uncoupled from the action perception

1368
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,240
loop which is probably not exactly how

1369
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,640
piaget framed it but that's what that

1370
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,079
notion is

1371
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:51,520
and so

1372
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,119
within the functional aspect the fep is

1373
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:56,960
leading one to ask

1374
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,720
what functional roles do internal models

1375
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,040
play during free energy minimization so

1376
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,800
just like the memorizing the number was

1377
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,559
like a cause and effect of a cognitive

1378
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:05,599
environment

1379
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,280
is it the case that the fep is featuring

1380
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,760
things that are also causes and effects

1381
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,559
in

1382
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:15,040
the cognitive environment

1383
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,359
and does that resemble vicarious

1384
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:19,359
operations in the classical

1385
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,960
um psja based account of representation

1386
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,119
and again it's gonna be the dot one the

1387
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:27,520
dot two when we go into the variational

1388
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,599
and the expected free energy but that's

1389
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,520
like the big picture on the functional

1390
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,640
aspect

1391
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,280
is do these variables play functional

1392
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,240
roles

1393
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,559
in a way that's uncoupled from the

1394
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,800
immediacy of action and perception i

1395
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,400
hope i represented that because i'm also

1396
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,839
not sure about that one

1397
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,760
okay anything to add blue

1398
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,680
so i think about it in a different way

1399
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,520
like you're walking down a path and

1400
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,359
remembering a five-digit number but like

1401
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:56,720
i don't know something that probably

1402
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,880
resonates with sasha or like anybody

1403
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,480
else that does extensive wet lab

1404
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,079
research which you've done so it

1405
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:03,760
surprises me like it doesn't bring it to

1406
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,119
mind for you is like

1407
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:07,520
thinking about your actions like it's

1408
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,680
like a dry run of your experiments the

1409
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,839
next day like do i have the tubes i need

1410
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,760
the enzymes i need the reagents i need

1411
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,440
where are all these things located like

1412
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,280
when it's a really important experiment

1413
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,359
like hit or miss it has to be done now

1414
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:21,520
or never like which you know that there

1415
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,119
are some that are like that

1416
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:24,319
like it's important to go through and

1417
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:26,000
make sure that you've got like a

1418
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,760
cognitive represent like you build it

1419
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,520
and so it's fresh in your mind what for

1420
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,599
when you absolutely like execute the

1421
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,760
experiments and so that's like instead

1422
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,200
of walking down a path thinking of a

1423
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,559
five-digit number how about like

1424
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:39,119
planning like the the sensory motor

1425
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,960
planning of executing a series of

1426
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,319
experiments it brings that to mind for

1427
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:44,240
me

1428
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,599
yeah great

1429
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:47,200
comment and

1430
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,559
that

1431
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:50,079
makes me think let's just say it's a one

1432
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:52,480
hour experiment that you're

1433
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,400
thinking about now does the motor

1434
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,359
pattern

1435
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:59,680
firing associated with um pushing your

1436
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,359
thumb down on the pipet

1437
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:03,680
does that get engaged

1438
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,079
during the prospective planning of that

1439
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:08,240
event

1440
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,559
who knows to what extent but that's kind

1441
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:13,040
of what's at play here if there's a

1442
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,599
totally disjoint

1443
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:17,520
neural phenomena associated with the

1444
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,960
prospective planning then the inaction

1445
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,359
we're in one camp of representationism i

1446
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:24,559
don't even know which side of the line

1447
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:27,599
anymore but then if you do have that

1448
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:28,800
thumb

1449
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,119
neural firing pattern like it's just

1450
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:32,559
like sped up or just shortened or

1451
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:33,839
something maybe we're in a different

1452
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:35,599
area so

1453
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:36,640
let's

1454
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,480
return to these ideas because again it's

1455
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,559
like very nuanced and it's just great

1456
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:42,720
the authors laid it out

1457
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,480
as simply as they did because this is

1458
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,319
clearly a lot of literature to go

1459
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:48,079
through

1460
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:51,040
so that was the um the eight

1461
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,520
the four times two you know that

1462
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,119
i won't even go into it but four times

1463
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,040
two and um

1464
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,400
that's the bulk of the paper and then

1465
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,480
there was this addendum section on

1466
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,880
representation as an evolutionary

1467
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,599
function so similar to other cognitive

1468
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:07,920
functions like working memory planning

1469
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,920
cognitive control and attention

1470
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,319
or perhaps even to functions like flying

1471
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:13,680
or swimming

1472
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,040
representation

1473
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,960
here intended in the sense of affording

1474
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,040
vicarious operations and detachment from

1475
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,800
the current action perception cycle may

1476
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,720
be an evolutionary function

1477
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,640
so it's kind of like when people argue

1478
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,920
that consciousness has an adaptive role

1479
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,680
and that the origination of

1480
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,599
consciousness could be scaffolded or

1481
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:34,079
nurtured or selected for once it arose

1482
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:35,440
this is a little bit

1483
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,920
less phenomenological

1484
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,760
and a more cognitivist or

1485
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,160
computationalist with respect to saying

1486
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,240
how representation

1487
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,640
might play an evolutionary role

1488
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,079
so let's just imagine that there was

1489
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:49,680
this detachment

1490
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,200
between the action perception role and

1491
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,240
planning

1492
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,760
like here's pogonomyrex ants

1493
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,200
imagine if they're able to

1494
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,920
perceive the polarization of light or

1495
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,280
the intensity of the light or the

1496
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,440
humidity and then have something like a

1497
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,520
representation that helps them assess

1498
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,440
whether it's appropriate to forage on

1499
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,800
that day

1500
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,960
that is going to be a more adaptive nest

1501
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,680
mate for the colony

1502
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:19,359
does the colony have a representation

1503
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:21,920
what level is the representation

1504
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,440
existing at

1505
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,599
is it

1506
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:27,599
the direct target of selection or is it

1507
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:32,000
arising from selection on other units

1508
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,520
what do you think blue

1509
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,559
like we were just talking about this

1510
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:38,240
right like like so

1511
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,480
is the niche the internet

1512
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,319
right is that like the the meta

1513
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,960
representation of humanity like the the

1514
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,400
web like that's it so so i i wrote that

1515
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,160
here and things to discuss in the dot

1516
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,319
one or dot two is external

1517
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:54,240
representation like what how do you

1518
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,800
offload this representationalism into

1519
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,280
the niche

1520
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:02,640
awesome question and i also

1521
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,559
um i think probably

1522
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:06,400
subconsciously was thinking about that

1523
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,040
like the image on the right is a trail

1524
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,240
a trunk trail that the pogonomyrmex use

1525
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,319
and so it's like it's not going in every

1526
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:16,160
direction in this colony it's only going

1527
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,960
in one direction it's along a tree so

1528
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,200
it's kind of accentuating this natural

1529
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,839
pattern in the generative process in the

1530
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:26,720
niche but then now that is like um an

1531
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,720
externalized

1532
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,359
prior for foragers that's based upon the

1533
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:32,880
clearing of grass and then they're less

1534
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,559
likely to go like walk over the midden

1535
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:36,000
pile and forage in a different direction

1536
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,480
but then it does happen so the trail

1537
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,680
does move

1538
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,440
so it's like

1539
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,760
interesting topics yes thanks for

1540
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,119
writing down about the internet okay

1541
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:46,720
let's continue through a few of these

1542
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,319
last ideas

1543
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,880
and i'm glad that we're moving briskly

1544
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,400
through this

1545
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,520
long paper

1546
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,040
okay so

1547
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:57,839
let's

1548
00:54:57,839 --> 00:54:59,760
keep thinking about that

1549
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,160
detachment of representation from the

1550
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,400
action perception loop

1551
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,319
they write in other words full-fledged

1552
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:08,319
decoupled representational capacities

1553
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:11,359
might shade off which i wasn't even sure

1554
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,359
what the origins were maybe it's used in

1555
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:15,599
godfrey smith 96

1556
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:17,280
into other cognitive or minimal

1557
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,680
cognitive processes the dynamics of

1558
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,200
which are increasingly more coupled to

1559
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,799
the environment through action sensory

1560
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:25,359
perception so it's like being at a level

1561
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:27,599
of cognitive complexity where you can

1562
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:30,960
spin up other active entities or like

1563
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,599
the queen as a reproductive ant

1564
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:36,319
is spinning off cognitive but not

1565
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:38,880
reproductive nest mates

1566
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,440
therefore when taking functional role as

1567
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,280
contextualized by evolutionary function

1568
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,520
as a criterion for identifying when

1569
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,760
recourse to representation is warranted

1570
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,839
in explanation

1571
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:52,160
which is a very complex

1572
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,640
linguistic clause

1573
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,559
but

1574
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:59,200
we're finding out when representation is

1575
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,559
warranted

1576
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:02,480
the criteria for that

1577
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,200
would be evolution

1578
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,880
shaping function

1579
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,480
so it's a lot like saying nothing in

1580
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,000
biology makes sense except in light of

1581
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,599
evolution

1582
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:14,160
and then under those settings it is

1583
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,680
plausible to interpret at least some

1584
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,520
processes

1585
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,960
the ones that involve vicarious

1586
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,160
variables

1587
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:24,078
related to minimizing free energy

1588
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:25,599
under

1589
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,520
that context

1590
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,280
the authors suggest that could drive the

1591
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,520
kind of self-organization that fep would

1592
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,559
describe as representational

1593
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:37,040
so it's layered but it's very

1594
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,280
fascinating because it is just like you

1595
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,000
had said blue with

1596
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,680
our niche

1597
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,920
but it's like

1598
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:46,720
just

1599
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,880
stacking rocks on top of each other it's

1600
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:49,680
um

1601
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,960
resisting disorder it displays culture

1602
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:53,920
but

1603
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,720
those rocks don't have a self-modeling

1604
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:59,559
capacity it's like uni direct or

1605
00:56:59,559 --> 00:57:02,240
uni-directional multi-scale integration

1606
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,400
the other sims paper

1607
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,359
whereas here we have like a human

1608
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:09,440
who has part of their niche

1609
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,839
has made

1610
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:14,480
another adaptive active inference entity

1611
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,920
and now they're engaged in this

1612
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,280
reciprocal multi-scale integration

1613
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,760
and so

1614
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,680
i think the authors might be suggesting

1615
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,880
that there's aspects of this setting

1616
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,079
that might be described as uh

1617
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,079
or might be warranted

1618
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:34,400
to utilize representation in the

1619
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,480
explanation

1620
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,240
what do you think

1621
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,640
so i wonder if this is

1622
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,040
so i always wonder whether we should

1623
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,079
talk about multi-scale integration

1624
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:47,599
or

1625
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:49,359
like thinking through other minds in

1626
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:51,119
terms of translating

1627
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:53,280
into the niche

1628
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:56,400
and how do you like decide whether like

1629
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,720
we're integrating as i mean i guess

1630
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,240
there's always this thinking through

1631
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,319
other minds aspect

1632
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:04,480
of you know we leave like stigmatic

1633
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,520
traces in like our niche environment and

1634
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,440
and then they're picked up by other

1635
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,720
people

1636
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,680
or is it really multi-scale integration

1637
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:14,799
like in terms of you and i are

1638
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:16,880
connecting and forming a bigger unit i

1639
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,640
always and and this is we were just

1640
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,000
talking about this like 10 minutes

1641
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,880
before we got here uh today so this is

1642
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,280
something to me that's like this

1643
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,680
fundamental paradox like i don't know

1644
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:31,200
how to distinguish these two things like

1645
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,599
we can never really

1646
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,599
i mean i guess that shared informational

1647
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:37,440
channel always comes through the niche

1648
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,520
environment whether it's the internet or

1649
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,440
you know some knowledge artifact like a

1650
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,280
scientific paper or

1651
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,119
you know a computer or something else

1652
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,440
but like my relationship with you or any

1653
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,400
human

1654
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,799
is always through the niche environment

1655
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:52,640
there's always that that filtration and

1656
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:55,280
whether it's in real time like we are

1657
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,400
here now

1658
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,920
or sequentially

1659
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,119
even if it's uh so-called in person it's

1660
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:04,640
mediated by

1661
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,480
vibrating air molecules now it's

1662
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,760
intermediated through routers and such

1663
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:13,680
it's a utilization of the niche

1664
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,440
and i think this is just raising a super

1665
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,599
fascinating question well yeah thanks

1666
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:19,359
for raising this we'll discuss that and

1667
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:21,359
then this is like saying

1668
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:22,960
what it's one thing to talk through the

1669
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,160
tin cans

1670
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,480
that's like using the direct

1671
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,359
um passive active inference agents um

1672
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:31,440
even if we could describe the tin can as

1673
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,599
perception in action but now what if

1674
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:35,680
there's a chat bot

1675
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,359
that's intermediating between the two of

1676
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:38,960
us or it's translating between two

1677
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,720
different languages

1678
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:41,760
then

1679
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,680
where does that put the status of that

1680
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,319
entire cognitive system

1681
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:47,760
how does it influence thinking through

1682
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,760
other minds when the intermediaries are

1683
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,680
passive versus adaptive active inference

1684
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:55,119
entities so nice questions

1685
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:56,400
all right

1686
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,480
this is the part which also will unpack

1687
00:59:58,480 --> 00:59:59,760
more in the

1688
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,119
one and two

1689
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:03,040
um this is kind of the

1690
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,680
wormhole strange loop turning the mirror

1691
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:10,079
back on itself part so the authors write

1692
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:12,000
in much the same manner as arriving at a

1693
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,160
representational or non-representational

1694
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:15,760
interpretation at

1695
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,319
fep so that's the whole

1696
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:20,240
sections that we just spent the whole

1697
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,319
time on like

1698
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,079
everything within the realm of actually

1699
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:26,240
using the fep

1700
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,720
um not taking it as an unknown but

1701
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,359
taking the fap as an instrument and then

1702
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,280
using it to ask whether it is

1703
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,640
representational or not on those

1704
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,720
different aspects so now we're gonna

1705
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,119
put that behind us and consider

1706
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:40,880
arriving at fep

1707
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,599
as a synthesis depends on whether on

1708
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:45,119
which representational criteria are

1709
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:46,160
assumed

1710
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,079
when either considering fep's central

1711
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:50,480
constructs or considering specific

1712
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,160
cognitive phenomena through the lens of

1713
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,599
a process theory

1714
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:56,400
under fep hence in the end the debate

1715
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,839
about fep may reveal more about us

1716
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:01,839
our criteria for representation and our

1717
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:03,440
interests in particular facets of

1718
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,280
cognition than it does about the

1719
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,079
representational status of the fep

1720
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:08,880
so

1721
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,520
you know jfk is out there somewhere

1722
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:15,520
ask not what the fep can do for you

1723
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:16,960
it's saying

1724
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,240
because you can be all over the map

1725
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,799
maybe all of these sectors are in play

1726
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:24,559
and all the perspectives in each of

1727
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:26,480
those aspects

1728
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,200
that means that somebody's posterior

1729
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,480
confidence

1730
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,799
in different

1731
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,160
claims

1732
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,559
is probably better reflecting of their

1733
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,720
priors and update process

1734
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,520
then some sort of objective stance or

1735
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,200
consensus reality

1736
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,079
about what the fep is

1737
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:48,000
as if it could be such a thing

1738
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
independent of how it's specifically

1739
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,200
deployed

1740
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,880
as we talked about with model-based

1741
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,440
science and majeed benny

1742
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,039
so this is a very

1743
01:01:57,039 --> 01:01:58,160
nice

1744
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,480
point

1745
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:02,960
wanna add anything blue

1746
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,000
yeah i mean fundamentally the fvp is a

1747
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,359
representation

1748
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:08,880
right i mean it is

1749
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,200
our representation our model i mean it

1750
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,799
might be the one that we employ with

1751
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:15,039
which to it might be an instrument or it

1752
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:17,280
might be a real thing

1753
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,640
but

1754
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,839
still it's it it's we represent the fep

1755
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:24,400
like with equations and with ideas and

1756
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,119
memes and i don't know i mean we impute

1757
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:29,680
our representation on it all the time

1758
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:32,319
so whether it is a representation itself

1759
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:35,200
or we represent the fep but there's some

1760
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,079
like

1761
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:37,440
there's some like

1762
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:38,640
play there

1763
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,160
it has it's integrated with

1764
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,680
representation

1765
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,119
um at

1766
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:45,200
all the time like linguistically or

1767
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:48,480
other or maybe not maybe i'm not real

1768
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,119
uh a real an activist enough or what was

1769
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:53,440
the radical radical inactivist really

1770
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,720
radical yeah

1771
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,319
um

1772
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:57,839
well i'm sure we'll talk more about it

1773
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:00,319
so just the conclusion and then a few

1774
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:03,200
last points so

1775
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,559
nine sentences in the conclusion one

1776
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:08,880
they looked at four different aspects of

1777
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,480
representation

1778
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,000
two

1779
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,160
understanding which side of which line

1780
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,039
to come down on was complicated because

1781
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:19,760
the fep appeals to multiple constructs

1782
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,440
that don't

1783
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,319
a priori seem to be strongly linked or

1784
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:25,839
naturally linked like it's unclear

1785
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:27,839
whether one begets the other or whether

1786
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:30,079
they co-instantiate or and that's the

1787
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:31,200
kind of work that we're really

1788
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,480
interested in

1789
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,720
in the ontology project and in the

1790
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,880
knowledge corpus engineering of course

1791
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:39,280
in the edu organizational unit of

1792
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:40,640
activelab

1793
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,640
so the fep appeals to multiple

1794
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,440
constructs and those models

1795
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:48,319
can be constructed in various ways

1796
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:49,359
so

1797
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:50,880
it's good to clear up representation

1798
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,480
into these four full distinctions

1799
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,640
however it's complex still because the

1800
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,720
fep is kind of like a plurality in and

1801
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,960
of itself

1802
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,520
three they argue that depending on how

1803
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,680
you think about things you're going to

1804
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:06,240
think about things differently

1805
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:09,039
they then turn the mirror back

1806
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:11,520
and suggest that that's an opportunity

1807
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,880
to challenge but it's also an

1808
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,440
opportunity to reflect upon

1809
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,200
how we value

1810
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,839
representation and different features

1811
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:22,319
in our model selection

1812
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:25,119
related to the main part of this paper

1813
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:26,799
and then they sort of salvage the

1814
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:29,119
utility of fep

1815
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:30,079
whether

1816
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:31,680
hence fep wins

1817
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,839
tails not fep loses

1818
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:36,400
because the fep can be heuristic

1819
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,039
so like kind of um

1820
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:41,440
good for functionally or pragmatically

1821
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,280
for a philosophy of mind

1822
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,799
even if not so much to settle the

1823
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,960
dispute on internal representation but

1824
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,640
to unveil and dissect the hidden

1825
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,400
assumptions in the debate

1826
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,000
so it's kind of like

1827
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,079
deploying fep into the representation

1828
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:55,039
debate

1829
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:57,280
it's not gonna be the judge it's gonna

1830
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:59,359
be like

1831
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:02,720
some other role what is the fep in that

1832
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:03,839
setting

1833
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:06,400
six another lesson learned

1834
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:10,319
is that some traditional polarizations

1835
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:12,160
might be attenuated or dissolved under

1836
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,599
the fep

1837
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:15,920
so here we're seeing multiple uses of

1838
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,680
the fep which is why there's a bunch of

1839
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,160
different colors on here

1840
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,720
it's a theoretical plurality

1841
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:26,319
it's as a um also a plurality of applied

1842
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:27,839
models

1843
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:30,319
it's a mirror

1844
01:05:30,319 --> 01:05:33,200
um it's a bet hedge

1845
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,280
it's a unifier with traditional

1846
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,440
polarizations like cognitivist versus an

1847
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,720
activism

1848
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,000
and then here's a really fascinating

1849
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,680
part that i know many people in the lab

1850
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,520
will be excited to talk about

1851
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:46,160
the fep advances a unified view where

1852
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:47,520
terms that traditionally belong to

1853
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,280
different ontologies

1854
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,599
can be harmonized

1855
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:54,400
so it's an ontological unifier

1856
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,839
for example

1857
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:58,480
modeling and expectation

1858
01:05:58,480 --> 01:05:59,920
is not used in some of the works that

1859
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,039
talk about autopoesis and

1860
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:02,480
synchronization

1861
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,039
eight

1862
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:07,440
how does the fep do this

1863
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,280
it begins with a strong inactivist

1864
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,240
flavor

1865
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,920
and a focus on action that's missing

1866
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,079
from traditional cognitive theories

1867
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:16,319
so by starting with one foot squarely in

1868
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:17,280
action

1869
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:19,039
it brings something that a lot of

1870
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:21,839
neurocognitive theories are missing from

1871
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:23,280
and then extends the scope of an

1872
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,599
activist thinking to territories of for

1873
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:27,280
example counter factual thinking and

1874
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,839
model selection and abductive logic like

1875
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:32,720
we talked about also with benny so it's

1876
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:33,839
kind of like

1877
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:37,119
coming from actionlandia and bringing in

1878
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:38,799
inference and then starting from

1879
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:41,760
inference landia and bringing in action

1880
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,680
almost like it's called active inference

1881
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,119
or that's like a related idea or

1882
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:47,839
something and then the ninth sentence is

1883
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:49,039
just saying

1884
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:51,520
the space of the possible

1885
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,880
is big

1886
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,559
and we're going to have to reduce our

1887
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:56,160
uncertainty by

1888
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,400
making it happen

1889
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:02,960
so it's a really great conclusion

1890
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:06,559
any other comments on it blue

1891
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:09,280
just pretty epic paper

1892
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:12,000
like i think it um ties together a lot

1893
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,200
of

1894
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,880
stuff we've talked about stuff we will

1895
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:15,920
talk about

1896
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:16,960
yep

1897
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,440
okay final things and things to discuss

1898
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,359
in dot one and dot two

1899
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:24,000
okay so here is a quote from the paper

1900
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,839
where they say

1901
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:28,079
given that fep has been implemented in a

1902
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:30,000
family of computational models that are

1903
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,599
by definition fully observable

1904
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:36,640
dot dot dot that's the first part to

1905
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:37,599
highlight

1906
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,240
so in what sense are computational

1907
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,160
models fully observable or what does

1908
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,720
observability mean for models

1909
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,640
what does explainability mean or

1910
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,559
transparency mean is that

1911
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:52,559
reproducibility is that perturbability

1912
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:54,640
is the map fully observable

1913
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,880
is the territory fully observable

1914
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,559
are there settings where one or the

1915
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:01,599
other or neither or both are visible

1916
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:04,559
so what is this visual metaphor

1917
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:06,160
and what are some of the nuances with

1918
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,079
like observability

1919
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:10,400
and visual perception

1920
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:15,839
and then um here is fep as a unifier so

1921
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:16,799
um

1922
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:18,560
it's less surprising if one considers

1923
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,399
fep unites notions that are generally

1924
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:22,560
considered antithetical so meaning like

1925
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,719
contrary to each other most

1926
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:26,399
most notably the notion of internal

1927
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:28,319
generative model which is usually

1928
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:29,839
associated with representationalist

1929
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:31,439
theories and autopoiesis which is

1930
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:32,399
usually associated with

1931
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:33,920
non-representational

1932
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,399
inactive approaches so

1933
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:37,839
i think just

1934
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:38,960
um

1935
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:42,560
who considers which notions antithetical

1936
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,960
some classic examples are provided here

1937
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,960
like to helmholtz

1938
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,600
and matarana and varela

1939
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,359
but just

1940
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:54,640
who disagrees and why

1941
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:57,040
and what can we learn by just hearing

1942
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:58,560
different perspectives on some of these

1943
01:08:58,560 --> 01:08:59,759
debates

1944
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:00,529
and then um

1945
01:09:00,529 --> 01:09:02,080
[Music]

1946
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,839
how is representation related to auto

1947
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:07,279
policies so

1948
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:08,960
autopoetic systems are those that are

1949
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,120
capable of producing and maintaining

1950
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,920
themselves by creating their own parts

1951
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,439
it's kind of a classic complexity idea

1952
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,600
and it made me think about

1953
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,238
poetic naturalism and then all these

1954
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:24,080
other proposals like the metapoetic

1955
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,679
naturalism and stuff

1956
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:27,520
and then

1957
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:29,439
there were zero google hits for

1958
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:31,040
autopoetic

1959
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,920
naturalism but i think it's very related

1960
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:34,880
to

1961
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,839
what we spoke about with majibeni

1962
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:41,198
and science as modeling in the world

1963
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:43,520
and about of course the title of this

1964
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:44,719
paper

1965
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:45,839
and um

1966
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:46,839
the

1967
01:09:46,839 --> 01:09:50,399
uh representations

1968
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:52,238
questions

1969
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:54,719
so this is just a very provocative

1970
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:56,560
paragraph that brings a lot of ideas in

1971
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:57,440
blue

1972
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,920
well it's also just the middle way right

1973
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:02,480
like is it this or that or maybe some

1974
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,800
combination of these two things is the

1975
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,600
right thing

1976
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,600
the depth perception as dean says so

1977
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,600
then one more sort of general comment

1978
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,360
and then we'll go to the specifics to

1979
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:15,120
discuss next time so

1980
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:18,000
um this is the fep as mirror

1981
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,520
so one can use the debate on

1982
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,360
representation and fep

1983
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,199
the other way around not as a way to

1984
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:24,719
resolve the issue at stake but as a

1985
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:26,560
mirror to look at one's own implicit

1986
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:29,040
notions notions of representation

1987
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:32,000
so here's a paper that i wrote with my

1988
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,960
colleague eric sovik in 2019

1989
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:36,560
where we talked about scientific

1990
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,719
theories for consciousness

1991
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:41,520
and so instead of using a model of

1992
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,520
consciousness for granted like

1993
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,199
integrated information theory or some

1994
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:46,640
other quantitative measure of

1995
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:47,840
consciousness

1996
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:50,000
we took the system

1997
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,320
as the precondition which was an ant

1998
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:53,360
colony

1999
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,040
and then

2000
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,520
reflected back on different scientific

2001
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,080
theories of consciousness

2002
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,560
what that said about what people value

2003
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:05,120
about for example anatomical versus

2004
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,120
functional linguistic behavioral

2005
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:10,080
components of systems and so we talked

2006
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,320
about like forward tests where you're

2007
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:13,840
good with your test you've got you've

2008
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:15,840
got a calibrated instrument

2009
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,679
and so this is like what the bulk of the

2010
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:19,360
literature review was in the first half

2011
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,440
of this paper which was like we're just

2012
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:24,000
gonna go with the fep as what our

2013
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,440
framework is

2014
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,880
and then we're going to assess there's

2015
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,800
still a diversity of perspectives on

2016
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,159
representation

2017
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:32,320
even if you think the fep is totally the

2018
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,640
go-to theory so this does not mean that

2019
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:36,880
you eliminate ambiguity it just means

2020
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,640
that you're using your tool in a

2021
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:42,320
deployment-oriented way versus the

2022
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:44,719
reverse test which is like taking things

2023
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:47,199
that are known in the world or some sort

2024
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:49,600
of internal reference data

2025
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,920
and then

2026
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:54,719
shining it back as a mirror

2027
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:58,880
on the test and comparing amongst tests

2028
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,440
which also does of course

2029
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,120
recurse because it's a test being

2030
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:04,640
applied to do so

2031
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:07,440
but that's where the real revolutionary

2032
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,199
science happens

2033
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:10,159
and so

2034
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:10,960
this

2035
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,239
paper

2036
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:15,280
by pazulo and sims

2037
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,840
showed both modes

2038
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:18,640
in

2039
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,560
total harmony

2040
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,159
and so i think it's an awesome

2041
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:24,000
contribution from

2042
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,480
velocity of science perspective

2043
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,800
so i look forward to talking about that

2044
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,560
and about forward and reverse tests and

2045
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,800
then here's a bunch of other stuff what

2046
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,640
are you excited about here blue

2047
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,640
this is just stuff i wrote down to talk

2048
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,800
about like well i was just taking notes

2049
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,560
while we were talking today about what

2050
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:43,280
might be cool to discuss in the dot one

2051
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,600
and dot two um a lot about like the

2052
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,600
sensory motor loop mental engagement

2053
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:50,239
mental action like does that trigger the

2054
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:52,719
same kind of like physiological response

2055
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:54,960
as like an actual action

2056
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,960
um and then the idea of thinking through

2057
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,560
other minds versus multi-scale

2058
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,239
integration what might be similar or

2059
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:02,000
different there

2060
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,560
and you know the independent existence

2061
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,560
of the fep or is it just a mirror we

2062
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:09,120
could hold up maybe for ourselves but i

2063
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,880
think that um you know this paper was

2064
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:14,080
provocative and great i um have been a

2065
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,480
big fan of pizzula for a long time more

2066
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,120
recently a matt sims fan but probably

2067
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:20,719
i've been reading fazzullah's papers for

2068
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:22,880
10 years and um

2069
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:24,400
excited to have the chance to really

2070
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,480
dissect a paper by him with with more

2071
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,880
than just myself

2072
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:29,840
great

2073
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:30,800
well

2074
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:33,199
glue thanks a ton for the awesome work

2075
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:35,600
on the dot zero i think uh

2076
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:38,080
we were trepidatious to jump into this

2077
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,719
paper but then

2078
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:43,520
you were happy

2079
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:46,640
no problem i got it no i'm projecting

2080
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,480
it's true it's true it does i was like

2081
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:50,320
yeah that that's an easy yeah we got it

2082
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,800
one week sure three days for zero we got

2083
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,480
it we're good

2084
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:57,199
so i i read a long time ago also so

2085
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:59,120
um yep we just hope that anyone who

2086
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,520
wants to ask a question

2087
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:02,480
can

2088
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,719
even if it's long past the dot 1.2 if

2089
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:06,640
you're listening to this in time then

2090
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,719
congrats and you should definitely get

2091
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:10,560
involved in the conversation

2092
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:11,600
and uh

2093
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,840
otherwise we'll see you around the lab

2094
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,360
so thanks again blue and thanks

2095
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,280
