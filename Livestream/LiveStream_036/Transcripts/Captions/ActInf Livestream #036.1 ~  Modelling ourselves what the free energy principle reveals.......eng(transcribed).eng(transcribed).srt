hello and welcome everyone to actin flab

6
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,640
live stream number zero 36.1

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,719
it's january 19th

8
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,640
2022

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,719
welcome to the actin flap

10
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,120
we are a participatory online lab that

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,440
is communicating learning and practicing

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,280
applied active inference

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,960
you can find us at the links here on

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,239
this slide

15
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,480
this is a recorded and an archived live

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,760
stream so please provide us with

17
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,559
feedback so that we can improve our work

18
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,559
all backgrounds and perspectives are

19
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,480
welcome and we'll be following good

20
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,199
video etiquette for live streams

21
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,520
you can check out activeinference.org to

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,520
learn about how to participate in any

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,479
active lab events which go beyond but

24
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,560
also support the live streams

25
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,360
and also the coda site at the bottom

26
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,200
will give you access to the table with

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,119
metadata on the past and upcoming live

28
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,880
streams

29
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,759
all right

30
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,439
today in

31
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,000
acting stream number 36.1 we're going to

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,040
be

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,439
discussing and learning and seeing who

34
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,640
joins

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,040
for the paper modeling ourselves what

36
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,200
the free energy principle reveals about

37
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,200
our implicit notions of representation

38
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,880
by sims and pazulo 2021

39
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,840
we went over some of the background in

40
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,079
36.0

41
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,799
and today we're just going to

42
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,479
introduce ourselves say hello what we

43
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,720
were excited about in the paper and then

44
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,200
we wrote down some things to discuss

45
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,079
but i'm sure both of you have other

46
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,680
random things you wrote down and

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,040
anything that people write in a live

48
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,560
chat we can also

49
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,399
look at so

50
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,399
i'm daniel i'm a researcher in

51
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,560
california and

52
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,040
i think i'm excited to just hear

53
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,639
dean's marginal

54
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,679
comments

55
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,680
and just see where it goes because this

56
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,680
there's just a lot in this paper and so

57
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,959
it's just a

58
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,640
it'll be a thick dot one

59
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,000
well i'm i'm dean i'm here in calgary

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,360
and uh

61
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,239
i

62
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,000
really didn't know if i even had time to

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,160
even look at this paper and then

64
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,879
i

65
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,360
i listened in on

66
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,959
daniel and blue's conversation in the

67
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,959
zero and that it

68
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,599
piqued my interest and so

69
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,760
uh i read the paper and i got really

70
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,879
really

71
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,560
i was really happy to read this paper

72
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,440
because um where you were daniel and

73
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,959
blue

74
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,480
kind of took a a path to introducing the

75
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,519
material

76
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,440
uh this is this is kind of familiar

77
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,360
ground familiar territory for me which

78
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,840
is very unusual because most of

79
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,760
the stuff that we look at i'm looking at

80
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,319
it for the first time and so

81
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,000
i'm really excited and i don't want to

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,680
detour anything that you guys want to

83
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,840
sort of look at at the point one

84
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,400
maybe at the point two point of this

85
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,800
process we can look at what the section

86
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,879
five of this paper what can we learn

87
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,720
from this debate because i think that

88
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,440
section five of this is

89
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,560
super

90
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,879
interesting and not just trippy you guys

91
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,200
use the word trippy which i thought was

92
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,440
fantastic quite uh

93
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,360
quite a good description but i i think

94
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,879
we can pull

95
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,120
parts of this um

96
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,040
out and look at them and reassert them

97
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,200
and reattach them in our own way and

98
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,799
actually come up with something pretty

99
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:43,680
uh

100
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,200
pretty amazing

101
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,238
i'll pass it down to blue

102
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,720
hi everyone i'm blue i'm a researcher in

103
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,000
new mexico

104
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,920
and this paper um

105
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,840
it was great like like dean was saying

106
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,799
um

107
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,439
it was familiar to me but not because of

108
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,480
my background just i i thought it really

109
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,920
um

110
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,560
explained and summarized a lot of like

111
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,439
different points in the fep and active

112
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,319
inference and how we use it to model

113
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,920
ourselves and

114
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,279
it it pulled out a lot of really

115
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,959
important questions i think that i'm

116
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,400
looking to

117
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,759
looking forward to discussing with you

118
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,759
guys

119
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,919
so we wrote down some things to discuss

120
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,919
but maybe

121
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,720
let's start with just a blank slate

122
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,280
dean what do you think would be some

123
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,040
approaches that we can take or some

124
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,720
starting points

125
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,560
because we already have

126
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,120
other cards up our sleeve

127
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,800
well i don't want to be i don't want to

128
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,680
be a

129
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,080
guy holding up a flag and detouring your

130
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,320
conversation one of the things we might

131
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,320
get to near closer to the end hopefully

132
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,759
is

133
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,960
the authors speak to the possibility of

134
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,240
you know when you set up your table

135
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,800
daniel you one of the things that they

136
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,960
potentially talked about in the section

137
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,800
five of the paper is

138
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,600
the idea that the um lines are a little

139
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,320
bit fuzzy here maybe they're broken

140
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,360
and the idea of in some cases our

141
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,639
ability to move from the

142
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,400
non-representational

143
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,479
into the representational

144
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,160
it's kind of a big deal because you can

145
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,919
have the debate that says here's the

146
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,639
parts that would align with a

147
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:33,680
non-representational view and here's the

148
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,440
lines that would parts that would align

149
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,440
with a representational view but then

150
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,600
they insert this part that says but

151
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,880
maybe

152
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,039
we slip into and out of these

153
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,120
representations kind of like we slip

154
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,080
into and out of the q density and so

155
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,240
maybe at near closer to the end today

156
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,840
we can tap into that a bit

157
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,160
let's start with that

158
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,600
grid

159
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,800
yeah

160
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,880
because this is the structure of the

161
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,360
paper and

162
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,639
the

163
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,680
uh elucidating contribution

164
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,560
and also i think dave left a youtube

165
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,080
comment or something like there's other

166
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,639
dimensions so this is kind of

167
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,080
pointing away towards an interesting

168
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,680
approach to

169
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,680
uh making sense of some philosophical

170
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,120
debates kind of laying them out in

171
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,280
tables like this

172
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,199
so

173
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,360
how should we approach it there's the

174
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,639
representational and the

175
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,560
non-representational

176
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,440
perspectives or stances or modes or

177
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,840
archetypes that is definitely very

178
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,720
blurry because of course it depends on

179
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,800
what you mean by representation

180
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,919
and that can have some fundamental

181
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,520
ambiguity

182
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,720
and then that representational

183
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,360
versus not continuum or

184
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,720
dialectic

185
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,919
is then

186
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,560
separated into a few

187
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,120
domains

188
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,880
i think

189
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,560
we could talk about what are the

190
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,919
similarities and differences because

191
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,759
some of it was a little

192
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,120
nuanced and i wondered if there was

193
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,400
other categories or

194
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,319
they were organizational structural

195
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,400
content related and functional so then

196
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,360
this is your game board of eight

197
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,680
lower dimensional projections

198
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,680
that the thought can be in

199
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,599
or it's something like one of these

200
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,120
eight

201
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,440
uh octants

202
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,520
and then a lot of the papers going

203
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,520
through some of the literature

204
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,479
and

205
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,120
rhetoric for and against

206
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,840
each of

207
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,120
these using the fep as kind of the

208
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,479
interpretand

209
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,800
what is being interpreted to speak for

210
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,360
one of those eight cells

211
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,960
what do either of you

212
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,840
want to

213
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,000
continue it there

214
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,759
well on the action domains on that

215
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,840
sensory motor stuff and

216
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,360
yellie bloomberg talks a good a good

217
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,319
a good argument around the idea that

218
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,319
for example i could be in a flow state

219
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,800
and there is no model that i'm or plan

220
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,400
that i'm necessarily following and

221
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,840
that's true if we're talking about

222
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,039
extension and

223
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,840
and and embedded as two of those four

224
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,720
e's

225
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,599
um you don't necessarily have to move to

226
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,080
that place that requires

227
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,840
something to

228
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,080
work off of you could just be flowing

229
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,039
and working in something right

230
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,320
that that

231
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,200
that

232
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,880
rate of change

233
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,200
is is you extended

234
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,159
so

235
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,720
there are there are times when

236
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,560
you literally don't have to be working

237
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,120
off of a plan you could also be moving

238
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,519
from a blueprint

239
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,680
to some kind of outcome that you want to

240
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,959
achieve

241
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:57,920
and then

242
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,880
that

243
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,160
it's pretty obvious then that the

244
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,600
representational piece has to exist

245
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,440
um so

246
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,480
maybe the argument isn't that both

247
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,519
aren't

248
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,600
at work it's how

249
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,200
we transition

250
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
from a density

251
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,279
out of a density and then back into a

252
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,480
density

253
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,399
something something to

254
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,839
at least have a conversation about

255
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,839
because i think blue was touching on

256
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,000
this last time too she said

257
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,440
i just want somebody to be able to show

258
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,399
me how

259
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,360
how these lines are in this this sort of

260
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,320
structured relationship exist because

261
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,240
and i when i when i heard to say that i

262
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,440
was kind of like

263
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,200
no i think that's a that's a fair

264
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,519
question because those those lines seem

265
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,080
to be blurred

266
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,440
so something that came up yesterday um

267
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,160
is the idea of free will

268
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,920
and um i just wonder how that might play

269
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,360
into

270
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,959
these different

271
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,560
grid boxes like like is there

272
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,839
free will

273
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,760
in all of these or in none of them or

274
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,720
is that even related

275
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,839
okay

276
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,719
let's write it down

277
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,560
one interesting thing about this

278
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,480
is it has a little bit of that visual

279
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,680
illusion

280
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,279
with the black

281
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,120
grid and the white dots at the junctions

282
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,880
so it's kind of a

283
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,959
perceptive artifact

284
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,000
it's just sort of messing with our

285
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
visual representation and visual

286
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,360
representations are

287
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,040
are you know when you see it you believe

288
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,519
it that kind of

289
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,480
focused system in a lot of the active

290
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,440
literature and vision

291
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,839
uh okay

292
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,680
so let's let's

293
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,480
save free will and the the blurriness

294
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,920
for later and then come to some of the

295
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,920
things we wrote down for the previous

296
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,160
list

297
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,800
okay

298
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,240
so in what sense can or are

299
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,240
computational models or any other kind

300
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,519
of models be fully observable

301
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,510
can i can i give maybe a possible

302
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,760
[Music]

303
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,240
real-life example that maybe speaks

304
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,640
starts to speak to that sure

305
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,800
okay so

306
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,920
in the paper he um the authors say

307
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,760
however these differences matter if one

308
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,839
considers structural aspects and the

309
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,600
degree of resemblance between hidden

310
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,720
variables

311
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,680
and environmental dynamics

312
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,839
so i was thinking about your question

313
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,040
and i so i wrote this down if dynamics

314
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,760
then the material i.e the content the

315
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,920
structure and the organization is going

316
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,399
to have a different change rate

317
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,560
than the function so the first the first

318
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,399
three columns are going to

319
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,760
behave

320
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,680
differently than the fourth

321
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,639
for example the screwdriver

322
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,360
as tool remains very stable hopefully

323
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,440
relative to the spiral effect or

324
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,079
function than it can generate on the

325
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,600
screw

326
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,279
to the one driving the screw there are

327
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,160
now two rates to juggle

328
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,160
the assumption that the tool applying

329
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,920
the function as a rule is stable and

330
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,959
consistent and the effect sought

331
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,279
will be a form change meaning action

332
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,560
orientation

333
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,200
or a new representation outcome

334
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,480
happens

335
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,320
you quite literally start and end with a

336
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,440
dance

337
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,079
between the stabilities and the dynamics

338
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,320
leveraging off of each other

339
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,120
so back and forth so we need to keep

340
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,680
open the possibility that the the stable

341
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,600
or the representational

342
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,360
and the dynamic which

343
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,000
as yelly points out can be

344
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,200
non-representational as well

345
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,880
are both in play

346
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,399
and then i wrote here because i've used

347
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,839
the expression when in doubt zoom in

348
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,720
zoom out when mark off blanket

349
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,760
zoom in zoom out

350
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,560
so in terms of in terms of the

351
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,600
computation there's actually two

352
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,399
computations one around around what we

353
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,880
think should remain relatively

354
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,639
consistent

355
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,880
and one which we

356
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,760
then apply that consistency

357
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,519
to something that we actually want to

358
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,440
see a rate change

359
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,600
expedited

360
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,199
so there's actually i think there's two

361
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,880
calculations here

362
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,800
to the person that's trying to figure

363
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,040
out

364
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,560
how they're going to

365
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,680
see what's on the other side of the

366
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,160
blanket

367
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,360
very

368
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,040
interesting lorenzen laplace

369
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,639
so i like this idea of um zooming in and

370
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,279
out with a markov blanket um and i think

371
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,519
it speaks to

372
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,000
the the way that um

373
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,800
agents are nested or

374
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,959
or anything is nested i don't want to

375
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,680
necessarily ascribe agency or free will

376
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,440
um to

377
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,880
different levels of organization but um

378
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,279
i think when markup blanket zoom in

379
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,880
different marker blankets zoom out

380
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,519
different markov like it so for me like

381
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,120
it speaks to

382
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,360
multi-scale systems

383
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,920
and how applying markup blankets is kind

384
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,880
of

385
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,920
scale-friendly or like imputed onto the

386
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,120
the system in question

387
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,320
one

388
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,560
extension or maybe example of that

389
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,000
we've probably talked before like the

390
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,440
table it's

391
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,920
in the process ontology it's material

392
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,320
that's tabling but then that material is

393
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,920
also process based so sort of this

394
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,560
multi-scale process ontology and the

395
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,560
identification of a given system of

396
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,680
interest at stationarity like an object

397
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,320
that can be tracked

398
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,600
with but there's objects that are too

399
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,199
fast to be tracked and there's objects

400
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,120
that are too slow to be tracked below

401
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,079
the just noticeable difference and so

402
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,440
within a given measurement or um

403
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,519
active inference regime

404
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,600
a given entity can

405
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,639
have a

406
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,199
attention on a given system of interest

407
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,480
it can't have attention on things that

408
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,560
are slower or faster like out of its

409
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,079
frequency band

410
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,600
but

411
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,480
that's discarding 99 of the system

412
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,519
to

413
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,160
not consider outside of the frequency

414
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,120
band

415
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,399
it's like the observables are just

416
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,839
one

417
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,839
they're they're very bounded

418
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,279
and so that

419
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,199
the slower things are the larger things

420
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,560
and the faster things are the smaller

421
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,560
things

422
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,680
so that's kind of a nice

423
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,600
and and and let me just piggyback on

424
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,560
that

425
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,120
and if we're talking about specificity

426
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,279
or

427
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,720
scale friendly

428
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,120
versus

429
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,399
um cosmic and scale free that's also

430
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,959
part of that zoom in zoom out

431
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,120
exercise because there there are quite

432
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,519
literally elements of this that are

433
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,759
still scale free

434
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,680
that if again

435
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,920
as they said modeling ourselves we can

436
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,800
we can

437
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,120
we can start from that position of scale

438
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,279
free and then find the specifics or we

439
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,199
can find the specifics

440
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,839
and ask ourselves how far

441
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,680
out can we extend our

442
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,040
confidence that the stability will hold

443
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,800
so that's again

444
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,279
piggyback on what you just said daniel

445
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,199
there's all there's all kinds of ways of

446
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,320
interpreting

447
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,439
zoom in and zoom out and i think that's

448
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,959
maybe that's one of the insights

449
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,079
that we get when we don't get ourselves

450
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,359
hung up on being a really radical

451
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,799
an activist

452
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,599
even though i i'm of the camp that says

453
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,760
we start out in the non-representational

454
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,959
and activist

455
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,039
leaning side and then we

456
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,439
the plans and the representations and

457
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,559
the

458
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,918
effects of that are representational

459
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,360
all right i'll think of an example that

460
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,160
uh

461
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,799
a wet lab example so i'm thinking of

462
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,679
doing

463
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,400
pcr or a wet lab technique where you're

464
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,120
not observing perhaps the outcomes of

465
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,440
what's happening for multiple steps and

466
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,760
even then it might be a color change or

467
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,760
a number on a screen

468
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,440
and so then you get limited observables

469
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,760
those are sometimes your degrees of

470
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,600
manipulation like in a thermocycler

471
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,039
that's changing the temperature the only

472
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,160
thing you're measuring during the

473
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,000
reaction is the temperature sometimes

474
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,679
you might also look at like the optical

475
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,679
property but usually just changing the

476
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,200
temperature

477
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,880
and then it's very representation like

478
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,679
to have a mental or a cognitive

479
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,039
representation which can include

480
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,400
extended

481
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,000
phenotype like the notebook and the

482
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
computer but that's pretty

483
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,480
representational to have counterfactuals

484
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,559
about what molecules would do that have

485
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,160
never been visually observed

486
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,320
and so

487
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,880
science becomes

488
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,120
representational

489
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,600
and i think

490
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:41,360
how

491
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,919
far does that reach back and it kind of

492
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,720
blurs off into increasingly

493
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,679
non-representational forms

494
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,960
not saying that science is the most

495
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,880
representational thing but

496
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,320
what are the most representational

497
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,760
things

498
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,840
and how do we move back and forth on

499
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,880
that is what i'm seeing with the

500
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,120
two feet in two feet out

501
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,720
but you just hit on a really important

502
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,440
point because you said science becomes

503
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,120
so so what makes up the becomes

504
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,080
like what what exists in that

505
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,799
that space

506
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,039
prior to it

507
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,520
us all agreeing that it's now science

508
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,039
and i think that's

509
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,880
what this

510
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,880
i think that's what this modeling as

511
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,000
opposed to

512
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,840
us as model

513
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,160
asks us to consider

514
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,000
that's a really that's a really you you

515
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,039
touched on the the big the big deal here

516
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,840
abductively

517
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,240
so what makes up that what what what has

518
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,320
to be present for us to be able to say

519
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,240
okay now you've crossed a threshold and

520
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,200
now we're talking science

521
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,799
yep

522
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,760
it reminds me of the paper of

523
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,240
burnberg anticipating brain is not a

524
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,440
scientist

525
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,919
and we can just take uh

526
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,400
the always prescient titles and content

527
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,200
of these papers to be targeting

528
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,880
attention point like is the markov

529
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,919
blanket a valid or useful construct more

530
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,280
recently but back several years ago

531
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,720
identifying

532
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,320
some similarities

533
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,440
or at least a uh

534
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,159
area of interaction

535
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,360
with

536
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,440
the anticipatory

537
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,760
and cybernetics of systems which is

538
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,799
pretty

539
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,360
system agnostic can apply to

540
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,960
very abstract

541
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,600
representations as well as perhaps real

542
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,559
systems

543
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,120
and then the physical brain hypotheses

544
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,000
and the

545
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,159
inactivist and ecological perspectives

546
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,520
on cognition

547
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,640
with

548
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,320
this activity

549
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,000
called science and the role of a

550
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,280
scientist

551
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,360
and so

552
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,080
a few ways to parse science

553
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,760
um one is uh as we heard from majeed

554
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,000
benny recently with model-based science

555
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,440
so that's one like relevant way that we

556
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,880
learned about and talked about this

557
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,960
recently like science being the

558
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,200
application of models

559
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,400
but then

560
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,799
other systems are perhaps doing

561
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,440
something different well what is science

562
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,640
anyone in the live chat should

563
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,880
definitely respond what is science and

564
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,480
also i would like to hear what both of

565
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,640
you think and how that relates to

566
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,840
anything we're talking about here or

567
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,840
ever so so i always think about science

568
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,679
as the application of the scientific

569
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,240
method to anything right like so

570
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,880
observations hypothesis experiment et

571
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,799
cetera um

572
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,320
and

573
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,400
because i think of science like like

574
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,200
this

575
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,559
science itself

576
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,280
is

577
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,480
just a model also right like so so we

578
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,440
use science like we build a model of

579
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,799
whatever phenomenon it is that we're

580
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,480
trying to replicate or

581
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,799
observe or test or whatever

582
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,600
um and we do we experiment with our

583
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,480
model like essentially so so

584
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,799
the scientific method itself is a model

585
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,120
for doing science and then the process

586
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,919
of

587
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,039
doing it

588
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,799
is creating a model of of the world so

589
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,360
it's like nested models all the way down

590
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,039
in science in my world

591
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,880
so blue can i ask you a quick question

592
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,320
do you what do you think

593
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:22,970
precedes

594
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,799
[Music]

595
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:25,520
the

596
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,080
engagement with what you're describing

597
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,320
is or is or

598
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,640
because the authors always say

599
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,400
assumptions matter

600
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,480
what what assumptions do you think goes

601
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,200
into a person saying okay well now i'm

602
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,000
going to use scientific method

603
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,240
are there are there things that that

604
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,080
priors that we should

605
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,640
sort of pull out and examine

606
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,720
that are consistent when a person gets

607
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,640
to a place where they say okay well i'm

608
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,600
gonna i'm gonna do that

609
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,200
yeah i mean so so there's a lot of um

610
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,720
stuff that's in the scientific when i

611
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,400
say the scientific method it's like i

612
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,240
mean it encompasses things like

613
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,679
scientific bias and uh positive control

614
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,760
and a negative control and and so all of

615
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,360
these things are kind of this in this

616
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,640
like umbrella

617
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,760
category when i say scientific method um

618
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,159
an experimental design like is is not

619
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,480
always simple but but definitely like

620
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,520
what

621
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,520
precedes any science happening is simply

622
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,000
observation right like so you have to

623
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,240
like be observant and and to have

624
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,080
observation you have to

625
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,559
have some instrument with which to

626
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,520
measure or gauge the phenomena which

627
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,480
you're

628
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,679
trying to

629
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,159
examine right so even if it's just your

630
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,120
brain

631
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,919
um

632
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,919
like which is probably the most powerful

633
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,000
instrument of all of the instruments

634
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,440
because it's fundamental to any test in

635
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,799
a testable

636
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,799
instrument that tests anything in the

637
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,919
world so i think um yeah like that so

638
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,240
that's a lot of priors i think

639
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,360
so so

640
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,200
is it fair to say then

641
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,400
that to get to a place of

642
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,919
of adopting a scientific method

643
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,000
one might

644
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,760
first possess before they can actually

645
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,520
get into the formalities of that

646
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,200
a field seeking curiosity and a way

647
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,400
finding bias

648
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,320
and those are two different things right

649
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,480
one is i can be a spectator the other

650
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,200
one is i've got to get in the boat i've

651
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,039
got to get my skin in the game do you

652
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,200
think that those two things are

653
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,840
necessary

654
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,960
to adopt

655
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,720
scientific method or to commit to

656
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,279
scientific method

657
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,600
so

658
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,600
i'd like for you to unpack those a

659
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,679
little bit more so um

660
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,440
yeah can you just describe what you mean

661
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,760
about like the those two the wayfinding

662
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,240
and the the curiosity and yeah yeah the

663
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,000
field seeking curio well curiosity i

664
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,919
mean it's got it's kind of got four

665
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,840
parts right there's there's an epistemic

666
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,799
piece

667
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,080
there's a

668
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,279
there's a

669
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,200
sensing piece

670
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,080
um i can't remember what the other two

671
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,240
are right off the top of my head but but

672
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,080
bottom line is that curiosity doesn't

673
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,799
just it's not sort of a monolith

674
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,480
um and and part of

675
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,720
that

676
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,120
determination because you don't know but

677
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,400
you you still

678
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,360
you're you're you're prepared to put in

679
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,960
some time and effort

680
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,760
uh

681
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,799
to get past not knowing means that you

682
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,960
can take one of two essential paths you

683
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,039
can find out

684
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,559
right you can go to a source that

685
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,840
already knows or you can figure out

686
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,640
um based on sort of collecting and

687
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,240
curating

688
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,760
um evidence

689
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,240
so that that's the that's the field

690
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,960
seeking piece and then the thing wait

691
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,400
wait wait what's the difference between

692
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,080
finding out and figuring out like to me

693
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,360
those are the same so like whether

694
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,799
you're collecting evidence like from

695
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,559
google or from

696
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,039
that's epistemic right but to to figure

697
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,880
out is to

698
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,480
is to

699
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,760
not have a source already

700
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,000
not a single source of truth

701
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,120
that would be the difference so one you

702
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,919
can find you can find a truth source and

703
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,320
then either believe it or not and the

704
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,320
other is you have to you have to develop

705
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,520
your own

706
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,640
truth

707
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,520
through

708
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,120
it takes a lot more time because you

709
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,720
have to go around and gather a whole

710
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,080
bunch of other

711
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,520
bits of information that aren't

712
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,000
necessarily pre-packaged for you does

713
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,480
that make sense

714
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,600
yeah and and also like what is truth

715
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,520
well right right i mean you ultimately

716
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,279
have to be the one that decides that

717
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,960
right whether to trust and have

718
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,159
confidence in something or not

719
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,080
cool lots of um

720
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,360
yeah

721
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,320
go for it no go ahead daniel

722
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,720
um so let's pull one level back from or

723
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,559
two from one and a half fractional

724
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,799
dimensions from the curiosity fourfold

725
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,799
distinction

726
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,039
there was like the personal factors so

727
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,400
the question was what precedes the type

728
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,919
of engagement that might be called

729
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,200
scientific

730
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,440
right and there's some personal factors

731
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,600
they're basically psychodynamic or like

732
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,520
situational

733
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,720
behavioral

734
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,720
archetypes but they're things about

735
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,559
individual uh

736
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,399
people humans what other kind of factors

737
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,080
even if the individual is the nexus of

738
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,240
agency what other factors come into play

739
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,679
and like what precedes the kind of

740
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:38,799
engagement that might be called

741
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,960
scientific if the person is our system

742
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,960
of interest what do we how do we zoom in

743
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,840
and out from there

744
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,799
well that that's my that's my question

745
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,960
my question isn't i don't have an answer

746
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,120
necessarily but what i have is

747
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,080
so you know before the big bang kind of

748
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,480
thinking we don't know

749
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,480
but is it possible that there actually

750
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,000
is something that we can put our finger

751
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,720
on

752
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,120
that leads someone to

753
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,159
have confidence in a scientific method

754
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,919
and not just sort of

755
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,720
remain in a kind of in a

756
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,480
place of stasis

757
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,240
and and not be curious right because

758
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,880
there's lots and lots of people who are

759
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,840
kind of

760
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,000
quite comfortable just going going along

761
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,120
with whatever

762
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,320
is happening around them but then

763
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,799
there's others that appear to have

764
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,120
um

765
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,279
a potential for a deeper commitment so

766
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,000
when

767
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,760
so for example when

768
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,000
when we were talking prior to mcgee

769
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,440
coming with us

770
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,440
on with us um

771
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,640
blue

772
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,600
raised the specter that

773
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,520
genes don't necessarily

774
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,360
have to have time

775
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,520
in order to be

776
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,880
considered prediction matter expertise

777
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,559
because it has both the cause and the

778
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:55,840
effect

779
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,760
included in the

780
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,120
in the structure

781
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,520
so that got me curious right like

782
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,679
some for some people just making that

783
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,760
statement or that or asking that

784
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,200
question

785
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,440
blow right by them they wouldn't even

786
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,679
give it a second thought but then for

787
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:12,960
some people

788
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,039
just making that claim arrests them

789
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,640
slows them down

790
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,880
and gets them asking questions on their

791
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,840
own now so that's why i'm asking this in

792
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,600
the context of so why would somebody

793
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,559
now

794
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,640
go from i don't care i don't give a

795
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,440
rat's backside about science too i i'm

796
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,440
very passionate about science i'm very

797
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,360
interested in learning this method

798
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,000
so i think um science really is seen by

799
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,279
many as a kind of truth-finding

800
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,559
endeavor

801
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,679
uh um

802
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,399
because whether it's through

803
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,200
mining previous knowledge or generating

804
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,039
new information

805
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,919
maybe knowledge um

806
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,080
either one of those is definitely like

807
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,520
like a

808
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,640
a

809
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,320
thinking of the truth

810
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,840
um

811
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,760
and in that way like

812
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,320
aren't we all just looking to like

813
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,279
minimize our uncertainty reduce our

814
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,480
uncertainty

815
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,120
so so i look at science like like it is

816
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,360
an uncertainty reduction

817
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,080
task i mean that's the the point of it

818
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,200
perhaps

819
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,960
so i don't know what factors um

820
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,799
you know other than the fact that like

821
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,279
maybe we're in a simulation

822
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,640
like we could go there

823
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,840
um because that that would like precede

824
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,279
the scientific endeavors that we

825
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,520
undertake in our truth-finding

826
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,720
efforts

827
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,520
um

828
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,080
but but really like the knowledge of

829
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,520
science as a way to determine truth um i

830
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,399
think

831
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:49,360
might be

832
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,679
part of it i mean and maybe not everyone

833
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:52,960
is taught that

834
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,880
um i think about like you know in

835
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,880
western culture we're all like

836
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,640
indoctrinated with the scientific method

837
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,399
from i don't know fourth grade on or

838
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:04,039
something like that right

839
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,519
and then they give you the phd at the

840
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,679
end when you're fully indoctrinated but

841
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,200
but here's the thing blue and this is a

842
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,120
but you bring up a really cool point in

843
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,039
you know fourth grade indoctrinated and

844
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,960
i think one of the things you and i have

845
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,600
kind of gone we volleyed back and forth

846
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,919
is so

847
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,519
yes science and so somebody has has said

848
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,679
this is a this has got some practical

849
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,840
things and some truth finding things but

850
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,440
i've always come back with

851
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,799
great

852
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,240
science

853
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,600
plan these these are material things my

854
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,080
question has always been when and you

855
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,360
bring up the

856
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,080
well we've decided when it's grade four

857
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,519
but

858
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,640
i'm not sure that some someone who's

859
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,799
pray for let me see that be about

860
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,039
nine ten years of age is saying it's the

861
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,159
same sciences for somebody who's 29 30

862
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,399
or 39 40 right

863
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,719
so

864
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,279
what i'm suggesting is is that before

865
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,159
the the the plan or the science

866
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,000
there's something before that some

867
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,080
really important things that we're just

868
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,399
assuming or

869
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,679
willfully

870
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,039
ignoring

871
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,480
because

872
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,080
now we're onto the plan right because

873
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,279
that's what has been reified and and

874
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,960
given the the

875
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,559
the holy blessing

876
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,360
sort of thing so so i think you're

877
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,039
you're hitting something that that's

878
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,880
critical and it's why i'm disagreeing

879
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,159
with you so i don't think that the

880
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:35,360
science that you're doing when you're

881
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,200
nine is that different from the science

882
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,760
that you're doing when you're 39 um

883
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,640
and

884
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,279
the perfect example of that is um

885
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,960
a feinman like i was reading i don't

886
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,799
remember maybe it's in in the meaning of

887
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,799
it all like maybe it's in that book but

888
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,120
um you know he talks about

889
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,919
how like for him he just plays right and

890
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,840
so for a lot of his science is like oh i

891
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,960
get to like

892
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,480
make this toy and play with it and try

893
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,399
to look at it and i keep playing with it

894
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,240
and i keep playing with it and so

895
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,760
you this is something i think that's

896
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,919
like innate in us like to just the

897
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,000
figuring out part like the truth-finding

898
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,640
part so even as a baby like from the

899
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,240
time you can sit up like what is this

900
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,840
block like what is the shape what is the

901
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,240
slinky right like it's finding out and

902
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,760
figuring out

903
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,279
like what are the affordances of the

904
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,760
objects right right and um

905
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,679
some of them are imposed by the outside

906
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,840
like don't stand on the chair

907
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,159
um because kids will use chairs as tents

908
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,720
and step stools and you know like so

909
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,679
it's

910
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,760
some of it like that we impose some

911
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,320
structure on you can't use this toy in

912
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,360
that way

913
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,120
but but really like kids will don't they

914
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,720
don't know they'll use anything anyway

915
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,279
like they'll they do all kinds of crazy

916
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,279
things like like they'll you know

917
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:49,200
slide down a mountain on you know

918
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,279
a trash bag or something right like so

919
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,919
they don't know right how to

920
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,679
what what the limits are

921
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:56,480
um

922
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,480
and so they'll explore new limits and i

923
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,720
think that scientists um at least the

924
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,039
ones that really love to do science

925
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,840
uh play a lot

926
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,519
also so so again the

927
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,520
the the trial and error piece

928
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,280
can be like the triangles piece it can

929
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,440
be scale free and i would never push

930
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,239
back

931
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,918
on that

932
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:19,040
piece the epistemic and the specific is

933
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,359
what you just described the other two

934
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,679
parts of curiosity are the distributed

935
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,560
and the sensing and that's kind of the

936
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,079
sort of the more

937
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,199
active

938
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,079
part

939
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,280
where you have to kind of go out and do

940
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,119
the skin in the game you have to get in

941
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,760
get in the boat across the south pacific

942
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,918
you can be doing the epistemic and the

943
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,000
specific as well because you can be

944
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,040
taking samples but

945
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,359
you can get you can kind of see that

946
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:46,560
there's another

947
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,440
side to this so my my question around

948
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,159
the wind isn't around the

949
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:52,820
the um

950
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,000
[Music]

951
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,159
the ability to see the scale free part

952
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,200
of it my question is is if i'm a 10 year

953
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,160
old

954
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,880
and there's something before the plan

955
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,520
how sophisticated is that something

956
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,520
relative to the something before the

957
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,000
plan as a 40 year old

958
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,359
i i just don't think that the

959
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,839
experiences that a 10 year old has

960
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,320
and the resources that they necessarily

961
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,359
draw upon are the same so i do think

962
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,280
there's also a specific and a scale

963
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,400
friendly

964
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,760
part to this

965
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,280
would you

966
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,240
would you push back on that

967
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,680
i mean i think that we all kind of just

968
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,640
operate on whatever level that like i i

969
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,560
do agree like that the knowledge of a 10

970
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,920
year old isn't the same as the knowledge

971
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,760
of of a 40 year old but um i i think you

972
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,400
know

973
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,320
we just operate at whatever level that

974
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,400
we're at similarly like a baby you know

975
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,079
like they're just doing their own kind

976
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,000
of truth finding but so the process is

977
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,079
the same like even though the priors may

978
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,359
differ

979
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:58,800
i think the process is similar

980
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,280
this reminds me of in the linguistics

981
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,760
guest stream with elliot murphy how

982
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,839
there's the view of language as the

983
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:07,119
construct

984
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,440
like subject verb object and then

985
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,680
there's the language as learned by each

986
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,800
learner and so i'm almost hearing like

987
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,960
blue saying it's the same process

988
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,520
everyone's on the same trip but of

989
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,000
course recognizes that each learner is

990
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,760
going to have individuated factors

991
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,200
including like what they specifically

992
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,160
know maybe has some correlations or

993
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,960
um whatever with age or with other

994
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,000
features

995
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
and then that's

996
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,760
i feel like maybe partially reflected

997
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,440
with a specific

998
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,680
of the

999
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,560
um

1000
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,599
like

1001
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,599
if yeah is the nine-year-old and the

1002
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:48,079
four-year-old learning the same science

1003
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,560
it's either it's like pan scientism or

1004
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,280
uni uh solipsism scientism everybody's

1005
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,599
in their own scientific niche and so

1006
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,200
it's just a million different granules

1007
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,160
and then the other hand the other end of

1008
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,359
that extreme debate would be it's all

1009
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,440
one integrated extended cognitive

1010
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,440
process which i wrote some notes on so

1011
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,280
dean go for that and then we'll think

1012
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,560
about it as more of an extended

1013
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,320
continuous process

1014
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,760
yeah and again i'm not i'm not trying to

1015
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,760
i don't want to sort of shoehorn

1016
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,560
something in here and then

1017
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,560
so i would always i would always hear

1018
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,480
from people in my

1019
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,520
history

1020
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,000
um the expression um

1021
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,920
well i know that's a problem there i

1022
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,119
guess you're just gonna have to get

1023
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,320
creative you're gonna have to think

1024
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,839
outside the box and being the um

1025
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,640
insurgent and the

1026
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,480
non-compliant person that i am i would

1027
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,240
say i would come back with and i was

1028
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,680
reporting to people i would come back

1029
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,720
with so tell me about this box

1030
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,359
what makes up the box what makes up the

1031
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,760
process

1032
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,200
and of course that didn't make me very

1033
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,200
popular because nobody could get

1034
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,599
specific about what

1035
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,079
what's inside or what makes up

1036
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,680
that three-dimensional space

1037
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,440
and and i i think it's the same thing

1038
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,560
with we can say well there's a process

1039
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,400
well tell me

1040
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,760
then

1041
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,560
why a 10 year old thinks

1042
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,680
in the same way as a 40 year old does

1043
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,079
what evidence what what what what are

1044
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,359
you hooking

1045
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:22,160
that

1046
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,839
assumption on

1047
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,520
and again i'm not i'm not trying to be a

1048
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,400
pill here i want i'm really curious what

1049
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,520
would make a 10 year old think

1050
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,359
the same way as somebody with an

1051
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,280
additional 30 years

1052
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,680
of experience

1053
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,200
they want uncertainty reduction

1054
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,839
that's a generalization that i can agree

1055
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,920
with but what about the specifics i'll

1056
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,920
give a specific in a general i think

1057
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,560
that for disciplinary education some of

1058
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,760
the questions might be very similar like

1059
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,839
why is this leaving group superior to

1060
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,119
that one

1061
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,040
in organic chemistry i think if somebody

1062
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,520
were very precocious and 10 and learning

1063
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,599
about the halides as leaving groups or

1064
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,000
if they were learning about it in adult

1065
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,880
education they would ask that question

1066
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,160
and then once they

1067
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,480
got the answer they would have moved on

1068
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,800
in their learning in that disciplinary

1069
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,599
finding out way like here's the periodic

1070
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,839
table here's why the trend is this way

1071
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:20,800
so

1072
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,000
that's not the whole of education but in

1073
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,880
that

1074
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,920
mode

1075
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,960
which many of us have come from and

1076
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,880
exist within

1077
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,440
that was the education that's

1078
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,160
educational instruction

1079
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,880
so that's the instructionism component

1080
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,960
and then i think it becomes different as

1081
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,760
you move away from that spotlight

1082
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,640
um so then a few other comments like

1083
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,320
about the specifics of how the different

1084
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,680
age would be different

1085
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,960
um

1086
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,240
there's

1087
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,280
the the biology of how the individuals

1088
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,640
would be different

1089
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,880
like in uh

1090
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,480
some of their cognitive features

1091
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,320
whatever it meant for that person from

1092
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,520
working memory to the specific long-term

1093
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,920
memories and other capabilities they

1094
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,880
have

1095
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,800
perspectives they've learned about

1096
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,150
um

1097
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,720
[Music]

1098
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,359
they're a different complex system

1099
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:16,160
but

1100
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,760
they can be a complimentary part of a

1101
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,720
system

1102
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,200
like older people providing mentorship

1103
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,560
for younger people but i think that's

1104
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,040
what kind of um comes to some of these

1105
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,200
notes on science as an extended

1106
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,440
cognitive phenomena which is partly what

1107
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,520
has been got at

1108
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,119
um

1109
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,200
so science has many different

1110
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,599
possible

1111
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:39,520
goals and sometimes scientists in an ad

1112
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,960
hoc way will appeal to different

1113
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,960
components like science is correct

1114
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,960
because there's technology like it's

1115
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,520
demonstrable or it's useful

1116
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,359
um not always providing a null

1117
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,760
hypothesis for what we would have

1118
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,520
if we had done something different but

1119
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,520
there's all kinds of different

1120
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,400
uh

1121
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,480
ways to look at it but

1122
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,280
it deals with individual cognitive

1123
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,240
features

1124
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,400
and learning an action in their niche

1125
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,880
but it also refers to broader

1126
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,640
phenomena like maybe a differentiating

1127
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,800
question is can one person

1128
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,599
on an island by themselves do science

1129
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,200
and if the answer is like yes they could

1130
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,520
explore and hypothesis test then that's

1131
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,480
one

1132
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,640
perspective another perspective would be

1133
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,160
you're only doing science when you're

1134
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,280
using

1135
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,119
this interpretation of the scientific

1136
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,119
method and

1137
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,880
you're using science as a body of

1138
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,079
knowledge like you're using the

1139
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,240
literature with the dois

1140
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,640
and some people go as far to say that

1141
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,960
you need to have a career in a certain

1142
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,800
specific institution or a specific

1143
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,359
degree or a specific training

1144
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,280
or approach

1145
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,000
so

1146
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,079
that is clearly not applicable to the

1147
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,800
one person on the island and not that

1148
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,720
one of them is better but that whole

1149
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,640
apparatus that's part of the extended

1150
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,520
niche

1151
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,200
and then also there's at least in our

1152
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,079
case

1153
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,240
the emphasis on the digital or at least

1154
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,319
informational stigma g

1155
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,400
like there's a recognition in science in

1156
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,240
a different way than like there's many

1157
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,240
books you could read on um

1158
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,240
tying knots probably a lot of youtube

1159
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,200
channels

1160
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:09,510
um

1161
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,800
[Music]

1162
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,160
is there a doi for information on knots

1163
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,040
probably not but

1164
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,160
that um in science is a big emphasis

1165
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,119
reading and writing the literature

1166
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:24,640
at least in the way that we know it

1167
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,359
today but again that could also

1168
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,040
perhaps not be as much of a core

1169
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,520
component anyways just like a few

1170
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,440
points that this

1171
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,880
maybe now will bring it back to this

1172
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,560
paper but

1173
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,920
science is kind of the representational

1174
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,400
paradigm and i think dean's question is

1175
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,680
getting at

1176
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,079
what is before what's the before and the

1177
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,319
after or the subconscious or the

1178
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:52,000
submerged of science

1179
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,440
and then when we're talking about that

1180
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,040
representational piece and when we're

1181
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,720
talking about science

1182
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,800
we're talk we typically talk in terms of

1183
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,920
isms

1184
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,160
what is where is

1185
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,480
how is when we when we set up our our

1186
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,079
hypothesis

1187
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:07,599
and i think what this paper if we're

1188
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:09,520
bringing it back to the paper i think

1189
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,280
what section five of the paper speaks to

1190
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,119
especially when we're talking about the

1191
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:15,119
the functional dimension

1192
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,640
is the if

1193
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,319
the counter factual

1194
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,800
and how they talk in there about how i'm

1195
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,520
not sure if it was clark or hoey or one

1196
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,520
of them talks about the fact that so a

1197
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,599
bacteria doesn't typically

1198
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,960
ask the question what if

1199
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,640
when it's sampling its environment

1200
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,880
so that's that's pre

1201
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,040
science

1202
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,640
yeah i think that relates a lot to

1203
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,440
martin boots's uh guest stream i think

1204
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,319
12 on the event-based cognition

1205
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,720
and how if there is an event-based

1206
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,079
structure to cognitive events

1207
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,480
then for any given parameter in that

1208
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,359
model

1209
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,040
it can be otherwise

1210
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,480
you could say like the ball is rolling

1211
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,079
off a table

1212
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,480
the ball is not rolling off a table

1213
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,400
the cup is rolling off the table like

1214
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,960
you can start to just do single

1215
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,400
mutations

1216
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,599
especially the important counterfactuals

1217
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,319
for linguistic structures

1218
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,240
and then

1219
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,920
that might be

1220
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,599
closer to what we've seen discussed in

1221
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:23,200
other sims papers as the adaptive active

1222
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,200
inference agent going back to earlier

1223
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,880
papers citing that but just

1224
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,560
that was our previous discussion with

1225
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,599
sims this paper has sims like the

1226
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,280
pendulum

1227
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,119
does not have a counter factual about

1228
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,839
whether it could

1229
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:39,680
go on a different axis

1230
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,920
it's mechanically constrained whereas

1231
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,319
cognitive structures can

1232
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:47,359
engage in counter factual play

1233
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,520
in a way that

1234
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,680
the pinball machine can't even if the

1235
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,400
pinball machine has chaotic

1236
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,920
or other types of seemingly agentic

1237
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,440
behavior

1238
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,960
and then and in that in that

1239
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,760
in that space i can be at the top of the

1240
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,200
of the ski hill

1241
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,040
prior to it prior to a gradient descent

1242
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,200
and i can be adaptive meaning i can

1243
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,680
close my eyes and do a visualization and

1244
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,040
i can also be

1245
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,280
variational meaning that i can try to

1246
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,480
recreate through my proprioceptive

1247
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,680
sensors a sensation of floating

1248
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,839
pre pushing off

1249
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:31,119
and engaging with that process right

1250
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,040
so again

1251
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,160
i the when the when of this i think is

1252
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,760
something that really matters i think we

1253
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,160
gloss over it or we don't even pay any

1254
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,880
attention to it typically because

1255
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,800
we want to get to

1256
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,880
in the paper it's figure two we wanna

1257
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,720
get to figure two

1258
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,400
but i think

1259
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,960
before there was a figure two

1260
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,200
before that there was a plan or a

1261
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,040
representation

1262
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,079
um

1263
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:00,800
we might wanna ask when plan

1264
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,640
if i'm engaging in counter factual

1265
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,720
inference prior then doesn't everything

1266
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,240
in the diagram

1267
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,400
depend on prospecting

1268
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,160
up the nodes in that representation

1269
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,920
all right do not do i not have to

1270
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,040
provision up a format that will be

1271
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,240
potentially

1272
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,520
something that others can comprehend

1273
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,640
as now organized and don't i have to

1274
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:28,240
propose alternative paths as links like

1275
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,520
all of those things are pre-planned all

1276
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,480
of those things have to be present

1277
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,640
pre-science

1278
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,440
so we can we can say

1279
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,280
well i'm not paying attention to that

1280
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,240
now because you know i'm busy putting

1281
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,960
processing something that i can now

1282
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,079
transfer to other readers and viewers of

1283
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,720
this diagram

1284
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,119
but i think to ignore those things is to

1285
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:57,359
ignore the difference between a 10 year

1286
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:58,480
old

1287
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,480
doing a science experiment and a 40 year

1288
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,760
old doing a science experiment

1289
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:05,440
let me give one

1290
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,280
thought on that it actually speaks to

1291
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,960
this question of whether science is the

1292
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,040
same for everybody or different for

1293
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,319
everybody

1294
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:14,240
is this the board

1295
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,280
exactly as laid out that everybody has

1296
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,640
to play by

1297
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,800
that's like the game of life

1298
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,119
um the board game not the cellular

1299
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:25,200
automata simulator but the board game

1300
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,880
there's one path or there's limited

1301
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,440
points of agency and then everybody on

1302
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,559
the board on that layer one is moving

1303
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:33,920
through life

1304
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,720
on the same or on a constrained set of

1305
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,000
trajectories so it's like are these the

1306
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,720
immutable railroads of decision making

1307
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,160
and thought

1308
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,440
or

1309
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,119
might other people have

1310
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:48,960
different connections or different

1311
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,319
decisions

1312
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:51,359
or

1313
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,520
totally different railroad stops

1314
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,680
or different dimensionality or just

1315
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,640
represented in a different format

1316
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,800
is it like well here are the battle

1317
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,680
lines

1318
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,440
that are always going to be the case for

1319
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,640
philosophy

1320
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,760
and there's going to be some people

1321
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,640
whose situation and neurodiversity leads

1322
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,559
them to be on this side or this quadrant

1323
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,559
or emphasize this component the regime

1324
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:13,599
of attention

1325
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,559
or is even that layer

1326
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:17,760
shifting

1327
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,720
because there isn't any stability to be

1328
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,160
found in

1329
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,040
counterfactuals

1330
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,640
there you go

1331
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,118
back to the questions

1332
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:39,119
it was a great early point about the

1333
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:40,640
rates of change being different because

1334
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,800
also that does at least talking about

1335
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,200
rates of change kind of evoke numbers

1336
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,480
gets the scientists excited because

1337
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,000
could there be like a number could it be

1338
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,680
a sentiment score

1339
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,680
or could it be like this sentence is

1340
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,920
totally consistent with both or it's

1341
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,079
inconsistent with this could we annotate

1342
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,000
the literature and measure

1343
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,559
or do surveys or

1344
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,319
um actually measure those rates of

1345
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,720
change in individuals on their learning

1346
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,359
trajectory or in fields

1347
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:11,599
like how could it go from just being a

1348
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:13,119
really insightful

1349
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:15,119
philosophy paper

1350
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,800
with a lot of

1351
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,160
scholarship

1352
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,119
into being something where we can

1353
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,359
use some numbers or something

1354
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:24,960
so i see the first three columns

1355
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,700
organization structure and

1356
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,160
[Music]

1357
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,680
content as

1358
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,760
the more stable

1359
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,680
i think you had another you had another

1360
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,559
diagram where you were showing that

1361
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:39,440
going out over longer periods of time

1362
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,800
right

1363
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,720
so which one do you think is the most

1364
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,480
rapidly changing

1365
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,960
functional

1366
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,720
okay so let's kind of recap them

1367
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,920
so organizational seems to be related to

1368
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,640
the encapsulation

1369
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,559
uh the the organization like the

1370
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:00,480
architectural

1371
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,720
features of the world such that the

1372
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,800
representation is separated from the

1373
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,640
what is represented so like you could

1374
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,640
have representation of the sun but then

1375
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,240
that's very far

1376
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,040
physically from the sun the structural

1377
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,359
aspect is related to representational

1378
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:18,000
vehicles to toot that are structurally

1379
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,319
similar to the state of affairs in the

1380
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,559
world they stand for

1381
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:25,359
so that is the abstract structure of the

1382
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:26,559
representation

1383
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:28,240
having some

1384
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,720
congruence or isomorphism or like

1385
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,119
similarly some similarity

1386
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:33,920
to

1387
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:34,800
what

1388
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,680
um

1389
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,520
is being represented

1390
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,640
this one

1391
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,240
is super dependent on the definition of

1392
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,599
representation because someone go well

1393
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:43,119
you can't represent a car in your head

1394
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:46,880
because your head's not a car

1395
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:49,920
content related

1396
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,839
having internal models that either

1397
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:53,599
encode environmental contingencies or

1398
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:56,800
sensory motor contingencies

1399
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,319
specification

1400
00:50:58,319 --> 00:50:59,920
or description of how the world is taken

1401
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,440
to be turned

1402
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,880
analyzed in terms of correctness or

1403
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,200
truth

1404
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,520
so that seems to be more consistent with

1405
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,839
the car content you know it's like the

1406
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:13,040
youtube content the car content can be

1407
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,319
represented if it's stands for something

1408
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:19,040
the content of that message was an

1409
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:22,240
invitation to the birthday party so that

1410
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,839
is related to the information or like

1411
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:26,160
the mimetics

1412
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,599
especially in a actionable

1413
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,359
way

1414
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:34,319
um and then the functional role this is

1415
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:35,359
where we're going to highlight and

1416
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:36,880
hopefully dina i want to hear a little

1417
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,640
more about why this one is different

1418
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,760
supports vicari's use

1419
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,760
before or in the absence of external

1420
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,920
events of internal variables of a model

1421
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,520
that was discussed in the paper a lot in

1422
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,880
the context of sensory motor detachment

1423
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,880
and there have been some blurry lines

1424
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,520
found there for sure like motor replay

1425
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,640
and pre-play so we know that it is on

1426
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,599
the spectrum of existing that neural

1427
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:04,319
dynamics but cognitive dynamics involved

1428
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:05,520
during

1429
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,480
our involved echoes or anticipations of

1430
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,079
them are involved

1431
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:11,359
in the before

1432
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:13,680
and after as well as counterfactuals

1433
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,200
before and after

1434
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,119
so what is happening with functional

1435
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:18,640
representations and then maybe how does

1436
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,200
it relate to active and fep

1437
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,760
yeah so i don't i i don't know i know

1438
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,760
enough about dreams

1439
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,839
and subconsciousness just to get me into

1440
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:30,319
trouble but the first three

1441
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:32,720
when we reorganize through our dreaming

1442
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,119
and whatever those representations are

1443
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:37,520
non-representations depending on your

1444
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,800
your

1445
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,000
wish

1446
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,559
those are all backwards looking

1447
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:43,680
typically

1448
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,119
and then the functional

1449
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:46,800
that's what segregates it out it's

1450
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,960
forward and backwards

1451
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,079
so that's to me a huge differentiator

1452
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:54,559
right there

1453
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,839
in terms of how much how much or how

1454
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:02,960
long we expect something to stabilize

1455
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,559
versus how much we want to act on

1456
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:09,200
something and and generate that change

1457
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,119
or outcome that we're seeking

1458
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:13,359
that's why that's why i get back to that

1459
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:14,960
search field

1460
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:19,040
being different than a framework

1461
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,480
okay it's a lot to think about but it's

1462
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,200
interesting

1463
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,559
the organizational

1464
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:35,440
um maybe there's some

1465
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,359
dissenting view from this but this is

1466
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:38,559
related to

1467
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:41,119
how the system is arranged

1468
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:42,400
so this one

1469
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,119
is

1470
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,640
can be thought to be slowly changing

1471
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,880
because we're talking about things

1472
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,319
which means we're talking something that

1473
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:50,000
has persistence and so the

1474
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,680
organizational aspects of systems tend

1475
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,640
to be the slowest changing perhaps like

1476
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,440
the organization of the servers changes

1477
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,200
on a very slow time scale relative to

1478
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,720
the processor

1479
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:01,760
then

1480
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,680
the structural aspect

1481
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,400
also it's very important that it has

1482
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,800
persistent like storing a variable in

1483
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,760
memory like you want things to stand for

1484
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,680
each other for a long time you want the

1485
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,839
doi to be a representation of that paper

1486
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:17,680
for a long time

1487
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,319
those are also related to like

1488
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:22,640
it's sort of the functional side of

1489
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,480
organization like form and function a

1490
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,920
little bit but i know for functional is

1491
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,680
used later so not to confuse the term

1492
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,160
function but this is related to some of

1493
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,040
the performative aspects

1494
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,319
of

1495
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:36,319
organization and infrastructure and

1496
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:37,520
architecture

1497
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,599
so that's also like that's you don't

1498
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:40,960
want the screwdriver to be a different

1499
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,160
thing

1500
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:45,280
in your hands that's too slow but maybe

1501
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,880
be cool if you can modify or tweak the

1502
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,480
tool or like you know unscrew it and

1503
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,480
bolt something in a little slower to

1504
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,240
make it different but usually you don't

1505
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,839
want to change too fast then

1506
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,880
but what about the content related this

1507
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,960
seems to be also changing

1508
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,520
somewhat faster because

1509
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,799
environmental

1510
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:07,280
or sensory motor contingencies

1511
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,720
that seems like that could change on the

1512
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,839
fly

1513
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,760
and then i agree that the functional

1514
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,799
role as defined here like vicarious

1515
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:18,240
detachment including counter factual

1516
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:21,599
and self-modeling counterfactuals

1517
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:24,160
this is like some of the most

1518
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,799
uh rapidly mutating but what do you

1519
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:30,000
think about content also changing fast

1520
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,839
well i think whenever i make a mistake

1521
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:34,960
and i accidentally hit the delete button

1522
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,920
on my notes how upset i get because the

1523
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,040
stability of the content is lost

1524
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,920
so i actually see it is still relatively

1525
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,799
stable as opposed to something that's

1526
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:49,839
changing rapidly

1527
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,280
so

1528
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,559
these four

1529
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,640
uh

1530
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,960
columns here

1531
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,960
there is a different temporal aspect

1532
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,880
which relates to what you asked earlier

1533
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,240
about when

1534
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,319
representation so

1535
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:08,559
instead of the possessive do organisms

1536
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:10,400
have representations

1537
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,400
or the identitarian

1538
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,680
are organisms representations

1539
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,680
or the definitional what are

1540
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,200
representations

1541
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,559
this is the temporal or the dynamical

1542
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:25,200
when our representations well that's not

1543
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,640
complete you have to say what it is you

1544
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,240
can't just say when it is

1545
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,319
well couldn't you just flip the words

1546
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:32,240
wouldn't it be just the other person's

1547
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,000
perspective

1548
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,040
you can't talk about is without when

1549
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,359
so why is that one okay why are there

1550
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:41,920
papers about what is a representation

1551
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,040
what is it like to be a bat rather than

1552
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,720
when is it

1553
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,119
like i don't think it has to be or

1554
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:50,720
i think it's both

1555
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,720
the other thing that i would i think we

1556
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:56,000
need to maybe think about a bit is

1557
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,520
the first three

1558
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,880
um

1559
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,040
tend to be on a continuum

1560
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,680
that's orthogonal to the fourth

1561
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:08,799
i can organize i can structure and i can

1562
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:10,960
content build

1563
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,400
functional now

1564
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,760
is orthogonal that i will

1565
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,119
because it's going

1566
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:19,119
it's used before

1567
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:22,640
so again back to that temporal aspect

1568
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:23,760
it's both

1569
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,079
i i wouldn't drop any of the four

1570
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:28,079
columns i'm just saying that i think

1571
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:30,400
that the fourth column is maybe on a

1572
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,440
y-axis relative to the first three that

1573
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,960
are on on the x plane

1574
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,040
okay a few notes here so before or

1575
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,640
in the absence of

1576
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,000
right now

1577
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,920
isn't it the case that usually

1578
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,079
anticipation entails something being

1579
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:50,640
both before and in the absence of i

1580
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,480
wonder what it will be like when my

1581
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,720
friend comes over that's in the absence

1582
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,839
of the event

1583
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:58,400
and it's a counterfactual before but it

1584
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,920
may happen it's a prediction it's an

1585
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,160
expectation and maybe even an act of

1586
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,400
inference it's a preference

1587
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,240
so i agree like even the way that the

1588
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,720
authors have written it these are

1589
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,280
related to architectural and

1590
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,640
performative

1591
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,160
features of

1592
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:14,960
um

1593
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,280
like basically functional or structural

1594
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,160
definitions of representations

1595
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,400
what they are what they do and then this

1596
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,440
is even uses temporal words

1597
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,520
as well as counter factual words though

1598
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,200
um and those are probably like used

1599
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,799
elsewhere in the paper but that's a very

1600
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:31,920
interesting

1601
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,599
uh distinction and so it's like there's

1602
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,599
our map but you know how easy is it to

1603
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:37,440
just lay out the map and go all right

1604
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,119
here's northern california here's a map

1605
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:44,480
instead of um the temporal aspect

1606
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,240
and i think that also shines a light

1607
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,160
actually on another feature of what

1608
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,000
people would call science which is like

1609
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,640
science the metric system

1610
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,400
and then like okay you've gone too far

1611
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,040
with the metric time but then pretty

1612
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,960
much on a lot of the other fronts except

1613
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,440
in the united states um the metric

1614
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,400
system

1615
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,359
has

1616
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:04,880
um holds

1617
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,079
as how people are sense making in terms

1618
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:09,359
of like distance and time and other

1619
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:12,000
units and that's kronos like

1620
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,480
like like um chronology and time in the

1621
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,839
decimal time

1622
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:17,599
and then kairos is like the timeliness

1623
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:19,040
and there's other ways to think about

1624
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,839
time so we kind of open it up and it

1625
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:23,680
just um

1626
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,599
makes me wonder okay what else is handed

1627
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:27,040
with the map

1628
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,280
is there a time object how do we share

1629
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,240
time

1630
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,559
along with the map is that attention is

1631
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:33,599
um

1632
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:37,440
focus times time times

1633
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,359
all these other things so how do we

1634
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:41,599
convey the temporal aspect

1635
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:43,599
and instead of just this gene regulatory

1636
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:46,960
network or this is that the map here

1637
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,559
or the map and the math and the

1638
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:52,160
territory how do we bring the temporal

1639
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,480
along

1640
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,280
so

1641
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,480
i wonder like

1642
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,480
about the temporal also and especially

1643
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,799
like now that we're kind of delving into

1644
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:06,160
um like quantum aspects

1645
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,559
because you know like the the

1646
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:12,000
simultaneous existence of more than one

1647
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,640
state right is possible and so is the

1648
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:17,680
the

1649
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,960
is it possible to be like building and

1650
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,040
like executing your model at the same

1651
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,559
time like can

1652
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:26,880
is it input then output is it always

1653
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,280
sequential or or is there some

1654
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,720
kind of like

1655
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:33,040
simultaneous

1656
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,280
happening right like that's that's going

1657
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,960
on there i don't know

1658
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,839
oh blue that's perfect for the next

1659
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:42,079
question i wanted to ask so is one of

1660
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:43,599
the assumptions here

1661
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:46,079
that there's a a continuum

1662
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:46,799
like

1663
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:49,760
if then between i can and i will because

1664
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,520
this was a debate that i got into with

1665
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:54,480
people forever when i was in education

1666
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,000
that there's some sort of an assumption

1667
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,359
that because i can therefore i will

1668
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:01,119
well i wouldn't jump off a cliff even

1669
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:03,520
with a parachute on there's no will for

1670
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,400
me to do that because that's just not my

1671
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,839
it's not my jam

1672
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:09,680
but but if

1673
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,040
speaking

1674
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:15,119
if if if organization is on the on the x

1675
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,119
and structural is on the x and content

1676
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:20,640
is on the x but functional is on the y

1677
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,359
now i can separate the two things out

1678
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:25,599
and and as you said if i go back to the

1679
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,040
quantum level

1680
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,040
now i'm i'm pre

1681
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:31,839
decision branch in that diagram

1682
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:33,839
you notice that the diagram is basically

1683
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:37,280
unidirectional it's always heading to a

1684
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,280
particular outcome it's always

1685
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,720
i can make this decision branch moment

1686
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,119
therefore i will arrive at

1687
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:48,000
representational or non-representational

1688
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,359
and i'm

1689
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:52,880
with you i'm not so sure that

1690
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,720
previous to this that it isn't

1691
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,280
bi-directional it isn't functional it

1692
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,680
isn't orthogonal i think it could be all

1693
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:02,558
three of those things

1694
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,520
blue would you like to say anything or

1695
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,359
can i

1696
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:08,319
all right

1697
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:10,640
two points i would be remiss not to make

1698
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,039
first the tetrahedron and fuller

1699
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:15,280
synergetics gives us a mnemonic to have

1700
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,599
four spatial dimensions so

1701
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,480
this

1702
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,480
four column scheme all of them can be

1703
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,480
four intersecting spatial dimensions

1704
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,559
they're coordinated at 60 degrees not 90

1705
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:27,039
degrees and then the second

1706
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:29,920
point is like this um one directional

1707
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,400
maze reminded me a lot of the way that

1708
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,000
people study decision making and path

1709
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
finding or figuring whichever one may be

1710
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,680
in ants which is there's some laboratory

1711
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,400
maze like a y maze or a t maze or maybe

1712
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,680
some branch on a tree in nature

1713
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,200
and then

1714
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,599
for the purposes of the science so

1715
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:53,280
called the paper

1716
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,119
it's going to be like we counted them as

1717
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:57,119
going down a certain branch making a

1718
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:59,200
decision at the node when they went five

1719
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,039
centimeters past the branch point and

1720
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:03,680
didn't return so it's like this is the

1721
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,839
the line that you trip when it goes from

1722
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:08,720
zero to one on that number and that's

1723
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,799
what gets fed into the scientific uh

1724
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:12,799
process and the method the observations

1725
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:14,720
of the literature and the statistics and

1726
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,039
all of that but then if you're watching

1727
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:19,359
the ant or if you look at the video

1728
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:22,079
maybe they dwell at the node or they

1729
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:23,280
turn around

1730
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,280
or they walk down one and then they come

1731
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,280
back or like even they go far down one

1732
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,680
and they come back so it is very

1733
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,760
interesting and it's a subtle graphical

1734
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,160
point but one that would be almost seen

1735
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,599
as like what do you mean how could these

1736
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:37,440
be undirected edges

1737
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,599
well what if we say hey let's start at

1738
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:42,079
representational fep it's it's just

1739
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:44,160
where we're going to start today and

1740
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,359
then

1741
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:47,119
let's pull back to the vicarious use of

1742
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:48,799
variables

1743
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:50,799
now where can we go from there to

1744
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:53,359
sensory motor detachment or we can take

1745
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:54,880
no and all of a sudden we're a

1746
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,760
non-representational fep because

1747
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,920
they're only one step away

1748
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,839
because they're both outcomes of the

1749
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:03,359
decision about the vicarious use of

1750
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:04,559
variables

1751
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:05,280
so

1752
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,440
i hope those are some interesting points

1753
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,880
and i think that relates a lot to the

1754
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,400
discussions that we've been having in

1755
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,520
edu about cyclic curriculum

1756
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,200
and you touched on it we i'm going to

1757
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,599
just bring it i'm going to reduce it not

1758
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:20,160
over reduce it i'm going to reduce it to

1759
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:23,039
to your point daniel there can be a yes

1760
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:25,440
there can be a no and there could be a

1761
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,799
maybe

1762
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:28,880
and the maybe part is what's being left

1763
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,440
out of this

1764
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:34,079
cool i'll read a comment from serval in

1765
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:35,359
the chat

1766
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:38,240
uh who i was also thinking of when we

1767
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,599
talked about like science as a human

1768
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:41,760
phenomena and all of that i think

1769
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,319
survival has a lot to say on that

is it possible that can entails will it

1776
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,839
would be a distributional property

1777
01:04:57,839 --> 01:05:02,160
though not a trajectory property

1778
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:09,039
okay i have to think of that in terms of

1779
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:11,920
what i how i set up entailment

1780
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:12,320
um

1781
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:15,359
[Music]

1782
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:17,359
maybe

1783
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:19,359
i'm not trying to i'm not trying to duck

1784
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:22,559
i think there will be times when my

1785
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:23,760
confidence

1786
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,640
through my ability to say that i've done

1787
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,559
something before

1788
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:31,039
leads me to a lower threshold around

1789
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:32,480
will

1790
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:35,680
but then sometimes it doesn't

1791
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:38,079
so i'm not i'm not trying to be evasive

1792
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:40,000
but i can think of times when it can

1793
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,079
entail and i can also think of times

1794
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:45,359
when it very much does not

1795
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,280
so will

1796
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,440
it's a short english word

1797
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,599
it's could refer to something that will

1798
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:52,720
happen

1799
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,720
like the ball will go to the bottom of

1800
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:55,839
the bowl

1801
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:57,359
unless anything else stops it from doing

1802
01:05:57,359 --> 01:05:58,400
that

1803
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,960
or it can refer to sort of that

1804
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:04,160
motivational psychological energy which

1805
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,920
is related to agency

1806
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,280
and so it's real it's kind of an

1807
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:08,799
interesting

1808
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:10,960
uh

1809
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:14,000
congealed word because agency

1810
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,039
and will are very related

1811
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:20,160
and uh i'm just trying to think if

1812
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,880
they're positively related like to feel

1813
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,880
that you have the choice is to have the

1814
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,400
agency

1815
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,559
and that can be seen as willpower

1816
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:30,720
whereas willpower doesn't come into play

1817
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,119
in situations where there's no agency if

1818
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:34,640
you just need to sit in the seat on the

1819
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:35,760
airplane

1820
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,680
it doesn't require any

1821
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,319
willpower or agency

1822
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:42,400
for that action to occur

1823
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,559
so i'm just thinking about cervel's

1824
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:46,960
comment and um the distributional

1825
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:49,280
property like counter factuals

1826
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:51,520
do we engage with them as a possible

1827
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,400
uh

1828
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:55,039
cosmological reality like in the many

1829
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:57,440
world type theories or just

1830
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,680
uh cognitive

1831
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,359
possibilities

1832
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:03,520
so they can be engaged with without

1833
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,079
taking on like a cosmological

1834
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:07,200
meaning

1835
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,200
and then what does that mean about our n

1836
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,119
equals one trajectory

1837
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:14,640
the specifics of our

1838
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:15,920
kind of

1839
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:17,520
entity in motion

1840
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:20,079
and then the the distribution of

1841
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:21,359
perhaps different types of

1842
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:22,960
counterfactuals

1843
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,960
or different kinds of

1844
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,640
possible stochastic rollouts of the

1845
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,319
system given really similar starting

1846
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:30,640
conditions

1847
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,319
and that's where the wheel can entail

1848
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:34,799
the can i can start out by asking what

1849
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:35,680
if

1850
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,880
but i still have to select

1851
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,520
the can the which if

1852
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,000
so that's what again i

1853
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,559
at some point we can have we can see a

1854
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:50,799
relationship of entailment but i think

1855
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:51,599
as

1856
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:54,240
as a as a quantum question

1857
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:57,520
they're orthogonal can and will are not

1858
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:01,440
one leads necessarily to the other

1859
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:02,960
so

1860
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,960
just to kind of like play on words and

1861
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:07,599
loop back around to what i was

1862
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:11,359
talking about earlier um like can is an

1863
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:13,599
affordance right like so if you have an

1864
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:16,000
affordance like like that doesn't mean

1865
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,040
that that you'll use it right and will

1866
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:22,399
like means i i will choose or or implies

1867
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:24,640
that you have some agency right i

1868
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:27,120
choose to um you know

1869
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,319
not start a fight with a flight

1870
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:29,759
attendant while i'm sitting in my seat

1871
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:31,600
on the airplane or whatever because you

1872
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,679
can do all kinds of things any any you

1873
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:35,439
get many affordances

1874
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:37,040
um

1875
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,520
and i just wonder how this ties into

1876
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:40,880
these representational and

1877
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,640
non-representational

1878
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:45,839
aspects of of the fep like really when i

1879
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:48,080
was talking about free will earlier if

1880
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,839
internal states are a direct

1881
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:53,198
representation of external states

1882
01:08:53,198 --> 01:08:55,600
it seems to me like i kind of feel like

1883
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:56,719
there's

1884
01:08:56,719 --> 01:08:58,479
less

1885
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:01,040
options there

1886
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:02,960
whereas internal and external states

1887
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:05,040
have coupled dynamics

1888
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,679
that kind of leaves some

1889
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:08,880
like

1890
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,399
mystical

1891
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:12,158
fluff outside like that i can

1892
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:14,238
potentially leverage with my own choice

1893
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:15,040
or

1894
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:16,238
something like that i mean i don't know

1895
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:18,399
what to call it mystical fluff but but

1896
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:21,279
um it leaves something unsaid right like

1897
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,679
there's a coupling it's like a hidden

1898
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:25,600
there's a hidden states there that like

1899
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,600
are only that that's where i can impose

1900
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:28,880
my will

1901
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,399
well i'm gonna put that fluff on a

1902
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:32,719
pedestal

1903
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:34,479
i'm gonna honor the fluff because i do

1904
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:36,319
think that there are actual

1905
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:38,238
times when

1906
01:09:38,238 --> 01:09:40,000
the

1907
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,880
the ability not to be captured by our

1908
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,040
observations is actually

1909
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:48,640
an advantage so mystical meh

1910
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,479
may be uncertain

1911
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:52,880
yes and and is and there are there's

1912
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,280
other advantages to that at times

1913
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,320
yes

1914
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,320
so we call it fluff but i think

1915
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:59,600
sometimes

1916
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:03,840
um we don't pay it enough respect

1917
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,080
i think that

1918
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,400
relates to the cloud of unknowing

1919
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,400
which is perhaps a text if somebody

1920
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:13,520
wants to go into a more esoteric avenue

1921
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:16,400
but i'd like to return to the figure

1922
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,400
and ask what either of you

1923
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:21,120
thought about figure one how does that

1924
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,159
play

1925
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:24,320
into this conversation we've been having

1926
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,120
like

1927
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:27,600
what does this entity and action

1928
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:28,800
partitioning

1929
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,520
have to do with science is this

1930
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:32,880
partitioning

1931
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,960
unique to active inference are other

1932
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:36,880
partitionings possible

1933
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:39,040
does it

1934
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:42,679
could it be another way

1935
01:10:44,159 --> 01:10:45,520
i think this is a pretty stable

1936
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:47,120
representation

1937
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:48,640
and it and i think it and i think it

1938
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:50,320
does honor to the

1939
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:51,679
the um

1940
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:53,920
scale-free aspects of what the free

1941
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,960
energy principle is pointing to in terms

1942
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:57,760
of a

1943
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:00,640
in terms of as a statistical

1944
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:03,280
pathway

1945
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,520
yeah i mean how many

1946
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,360
debates and uncertainties could be

1947
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,840
prevented by saying this is a

1948
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:13,440
representation of an entity

1949
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,600
and having people know what was meant by

1950
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,239
representation

1951
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:20,480
right because it's like i made this

1952
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,800
representation of an entity

1953
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:26,159
i think it does this useful thing

1954
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:28,640
those points cannot be

1955
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:30,719
false

1956
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:33,760
they're assertions by a person

1957
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:36,880
and what would be disagreed with

1958
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,480
that it's not a representation someone

1959
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:39,760
could say there's a more useful

1960
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:41,520
representation or more good true

1961
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:42,640
beautiful

1962
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,159
simple

1963
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:46,159
but then let's see it

1964
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:48,000
and then we can use science to compare

1965
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
representations because that would be

1966
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,520
okay

1967
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:53,120
right

1968
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:54,320
and then you said it does honor to the

1969
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,760
scale free

1970
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:56,719
so

1971
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:58,480
the only thing that kind of hints

1972
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,600
otherwise is the person and the world

1973
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,960
kind of gives a scale

1974
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,199
uh indicator

1975
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:08,960
for this model

1976
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:11,360
but without that iconography

1977
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,640
it would

1978
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:13,840
uh be

1979
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,000
and also adding in perhaps a legend or

1980
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,120
description

1981
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:19,360
of what the edges mean

1982
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:20,960
because it does say schematic of

1983
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:23,600
reciprocal exchanges

1984
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,960
and it uses statistical vocabulary

1985
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,600
but it also uses actual like ontological

1986
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:33,040
vocabulary in the terms of actuators

1987
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,880
so are these the physical things that

1988
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,480
are doing the actuating

1989
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,480
or are they the statistical

1990
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,560
or informational exchanges or is this

1991
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,880
the representation the form of the

1992
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,360
scientists model so we're only ever

1993
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,880
talking about scientists using these

1994
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:49,199
models so we're only ever talking about

1995
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:50,719
that kind of nexus where we're referring

1996
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:52,560
to both loosely

1997
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:56,239
and so it shouldn't be interpreted as

1998
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,320
either of them specifically

1999
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,480
it's just dialogue

2000
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,480
there's a lot of ways to interpret what

2001
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,640
the edges are and

2002
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,080
they might have similar different

2003
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,840
labelings and different

2004
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:08,960
schemes

2005
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:11,440
but it is statistical

2006
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:14,839
it is quantifiable

2007
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:17,760
it's amenable

2008
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,760
it's a qualitative topological

2009
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:22,239
partitioning that's amenable

2010
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:24,800
and beyond to certain quantitative

2011
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,440
analyses like if you can draw it like

2012
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:28,480
that

2013
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:31,120
you might be able to do a bayesian graph

2014
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:32,960
and then there's software toolkits and

2015
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:35,199
there's implementable algorithms and

2016
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:36,800
then there might be some quite

2017
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,159
interesting

2018
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:40,880
guarantees or tendencies

2019
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,040
with certain architectures for example

2020
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,520
to perform predictive processing or to

2021
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:48,320
have learning anticipation and memory or

2022
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:51,040
to engage in control or anticipatory

2023
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:53,440
control

2024
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,320
but that's definitely some of the most

2025
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:57,360
core

2026
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:01,440
iconography that we've seen i mean 50 of

2027
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:04,480
papers or what we'll find out blue

2028
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:07,919
have the action loop

2029
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,440
because

2030
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,360
what little side hustle have you blue

2031
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:14,159
got going here

2032
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:16,480
we're trying we're trying to um

2033
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:20,000
read more papers together

2034
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,400
and learn about them

2035
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:23,440
okay

2036
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,440
but it's interesting how often this has

2037
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,280
come up and

2038
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,920
sometimes authors draw on the same image

2039
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,679
other times they do different and

2040
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:35,120
sometimes the arrows are just the clock

2041
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:37,199
like just a uni-directional flow other

2042
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:39,120
times there are some bi-directional

2043
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,560
arrows

2044
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:41,360
and

2045
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,480
um

2046
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:43,760
the

2047
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,280
there are several guest streams on the

2048
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,679
more technical aspects there but um

2049
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:49,520
let's return to the general questions

2050
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:50,800
anyways anything else to say on figure

2051
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,120
one though like just on this

2052
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,840
like what is this

2053
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,760
how does it think this represents better

2054
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:58,880
the

2055
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,080
the

2056
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:02,960
eye fixating on the

2057
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:05,040
on the pop fly

2058
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:08,640
than it does on the physics model and so

2059
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:10,480
i think it's until something as you said

2060
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,480
until somebody comes along with a better

2061
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,480
representation one that

2062
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:16,880
that seems to give us the maximum amount

2063
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:19,520
of information that we need

2064
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:22,239
versus the

2065
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,719
maximum that we can handle i think this

2066
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:27,920
is a this is a good rep

2067
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:31,760
great and very satisfying conclusion

2068
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:32,640
it's

2069
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:33,760
yeah

2070
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:36,880
sorry uh i i really think that they're

2071
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,520
um what's not shown in this

2072
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,760
representation and what i feel like is

2073
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,040
always left out

2074
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:44,960
is the fact that

2075
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,640
that the

2076
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:48,960
there are some states are hidden right

2077
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,199
and so like where is the hiding here

2078
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:54,480
what is hidden from what um in this and

2079
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:57,120
so like the sensory states we don't even

2080
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:57,920
know

2081
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,760
if like we perceive i mean we know that

2082
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,760
we all perceive temperature differently

2083
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:03,600
like some people i'm cold in this room

2084
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,520
but many people would be comfortable and

2085
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,520
some people like my favorite color is

2086
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:09,040
purple my daughter's favorite color is

2087
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,719
yellow so

2088
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:12,719
like we don't perceive things in the

2089
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:14,000
same way

2090
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,560
and so there's there's always something

2091
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,320
hidden from

2092
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:19,840
everyone else and i think that this this

2093
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:22,000
schematic kind of leaves that out i've

2094
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,719
seen the hidden states um represented

2095
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:26,880
well in other like action perception

2096
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:29,440
loops but i i think that it's important

2097
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:30,640
to um

2098
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:33,120
recognize like what's obvious and what's

2099
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,440
not

2100
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:36,800
if i could give a

2101
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,560
one thought there then dean so i think

2102
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,800
there's there's two levels of like what

2103
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,320
are the hidden states

2104
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,960
from the perspective of the internal

2105
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:46,719
states the system of interest the

2106
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:49,520
external states are hidden states

2107
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:51,679
implicitly are explicitly modeled but

2108
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:53,199
they're the ones that are never directly

2109
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:54,400
observable

2110
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:55,920
they're only

2111
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,679
observed through their proxy sensory

2112
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:00,239
states and enacted or the transition

2113
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:02,239
frequencies are modified through policy

2114
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:04,480
selection through action so within the

2115
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,800
model within the tetrahedra

2116
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:09,120
the hidden states are relative to the

2117
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,400
internal states on the other side of the

2118
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,640
markov blanket and then there's like the

2119
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:15,280
implicit tetrahedra which is like us

2120
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:18,640
modeling this four-fold partitioning

2121
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,640
and then everything that's not included

2122
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,960
as a variable in that statistical model

2123
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:26,400
is like implicitly a hidden state

2124
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,239
but then what is that

2125
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:29,600
but then we'd have a different model if

2126
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,640
it wasn't a hidden estate

2127
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:35,679
and the other thing i think is that the

2128
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:37,199
vertical line

2129
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:39,360
between sensory states and action states

2130
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,920
if you tip that 90 degrees it would look

2131
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,440
like a blank

2132
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,440
even though it has two points on the end

2133
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:48,719
of it and i think that's that blank is

2134
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:51,360
by definition hidden state it's to be

2135
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:52,960
filled in

2136
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:56,239
so i think i think again

2137
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:58,640
you can you can fill in the blank or you

2138
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,560
can leave it blank and say because it's

2139
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,600
blank

2140
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:05,199
that is by definition hidden

2141
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,719
so another

2142
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:08,159
related point thanks for bringing that

2143
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:09,280
up dean

2144
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:10,880
is um

2145
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,400
there's there's one edge that's not

2146
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,480
shown here but has featured very

2147
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,960
importantly in recent discussions on

2148
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,760
active and that's the sigma

2149
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,960
or the mapping function from number 26

2150
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,640
and number 32

2151
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,800
a mapping function

2152
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,520
of internal states to external states

2153
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:30,880
now

2154
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,560
look at axle constant and yellow

2155
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,480
brundenberg's work to think about how

2156
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:35,920
the niche is also doing like

2157
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,600
anticipatory modeling of the individual

2158
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,520
so the other way but let's just focus on

2159
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:42,159
the entity and its mapping to external

2160
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:45,440
states it's predicting external states

2161
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,360
or at least acting as if or can be

2162
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,920
modeled as if so there is an edge there

2163
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:51,679
that we've seen in

2164
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:53,280
modern work

2165
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:55,840
it's not drawn here which actually might

2166
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,920
suggest either the inheritance of a

2167
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:00,239
legacy graphical pattern or

2168
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:01,760
some

2169
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,600
preferences or conclusions about what

2170
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,679
these edges do represent again even

2171
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:07,600
though they're unlabeled so that's one

2172
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,920
edge that we've been hearing more about

2173
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,679
and then i think another edge that dean

2174
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:14,400
just highlighted is this one directly

2175
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:17,679
between sensory and action states

2176
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:20,239
and again the clock flow doesn't have

2177
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:21,040
this

2178
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:23,280
the one that's just internal action

2179
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:26,239
external sense that doesn't have the

2180
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:28,400
sense action bridge

2181
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:29,679
right and

2182
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:31,760
it depends a lot on what these things

2183
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:33,040
mean

2184
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:35,199
but

2185
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:36,480
it'd be cool to

2186
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,560
understand what is meant by the

2187
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,880
backwards connections

2188
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,920
as well as by the vertical connections

2189
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,920
and why are there not backwards

2190
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,679
connections

2191
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:50,400
between action and internal and sensory

2192
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,400
and external it's like

2193
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,400
it's really a four by four

2194
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:57,280
matrix with some connections and that's

2195
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,960
how we've seen it represented as the

2196
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,280
sparse connectivity matrix

2197
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,719
in

2198
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:04,400
number 32

2199
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,040
and thinking about the um way that we

2200
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,639
model complex systems and generate

2201
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:10,560
approximations that sometimes can also

2202
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,000
retain some other features like the

2203
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,560
highly optimistic exponent so

2204
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,320
some thoughts there blue

2205
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:19,120
so we've definitely seen um internal

2206
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,040
states and sensory states like that

2207
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,280
reciprocality happen

2208
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:26,639
um but i do i always wonder why like

2209
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:28,320
especially since we did the mental

2210
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:31,440
action paper like how

2211
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:34,239
action states don't influence internal

2212
01:20:34,239 --> 01:20:36,719
states and so for me like when you take

2213
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:38,560
action like when you

2214
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,800
practice playing the piano

2215
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,960
that affects your internal states

2216
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,520
totally like not just through external

2217
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,520
states or even mental action like where

2218
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,760
you're doing nothing with external

2219
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:52,800
states it's entirely internal um and so

2220
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:55,120
i always wonder why that action and

2221
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,199
internal um

2222
01:20:57,199 --> 01:21:00,239
is there but i i less so wonder why

2223
01:21:00,239 --> 01:21:02,560
there's not a reciprocal loop between

2224
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,639
external states and sensory states like

2225
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:06,480
what like i never want the sensory

2226
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,719
states to go back to the external states

2227
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:09,840
um

2228
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,000
for me that doesn't make sense and maybe

2229
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,360
you guys have an example where it does

2230
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,679
make sense but i always want the action

2231
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:17,440
and internal states to loop together to

2232
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,920
have it bi-directional

2233
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:22,239
here's one possibility on the sense back

2234
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:24,080
to external but it depends of course on

2235
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,639
a specific interpretation of those

2236
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:28,639
a photon

2237
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:30,480
let's just assume it's out there

2238
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,080
it hits the retina

2239
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:33,840
if we talk about the retina as a sense

2240
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:36,400
state using it very loosely not the

2241
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,000
statistical variable correlating to the

2242
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
sense state but the actual retina it's

2243
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:40,880
the

2244
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:43,360
absorption of the photon

2245
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:45,760
that changes the niche

2246
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:47,760
to be sensed like if you're going to be

2247
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:50,880
sensing molecules from the ants cuticle

2248
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,880
you have to take some

2249
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,960
you could sense from the ground the ones

2250
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,040
that have already been deposited but if

2251
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,280
you want some from the thing

2252
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,440
you have to take a sample

2253
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:04,080
and so that may and whether that would

2254
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:06,560
be better understood as being an action

2255
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:07,840
in the niche is another question but

2256
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:08,719
like

2257
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:11,520
you do have to change the external state

2258
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:14,000
to be half skin in the game

2259
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,520
no and i just thought of it as you're

2260
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,840
saying that like the observer phenomenon

2261
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:20,639
right like so there's that too right

2262
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:22,880
just just the act of sensing it changes

2263
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:26,080
it or is the observer phenomena does

2264
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,760
that come from sense

2265
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:30,239
does that come from

2266
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:32,400
internal states does it come from action

2267
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,800
states are the observers just acting in

2268
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:35,920
a way that

2269
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:40,080
might fit in within an action state but

2270
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,760
those are really interesting questions

2271
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,760
dean

2272
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,120
no i just think you're right i think

2273
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,639
both of you

2274
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:48,800
are

2275
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,320
we're getting we're getting closer i

2276
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:52,560
don't think we'll ever fly directly into

2277
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:55,520
the sun but we're getting warmer

2278
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:58,719
yeah this uh we'll have another few

2279
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:00,159
minutes to talk this has been a really

2280
01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:01,679
great discussion and i look forward to

2281
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:04,080
like re-listening to it and discussing

2282
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,400
more then of course feel so appreciative

2283
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:09,280
that we'll have a dot too as well

2284
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:10,560
so

2285
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:11,760
we

2286
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:13,360
can return to some of our early ones

2287
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:14,639
free will

2288
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:16,880
maybe save it for the dot 2 or

2289
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:19,360
if we want to talk about it now

2290
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:21,040
i think we've blurred and fuzzed some of

2291
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:23,520
these lines a little bit so we did kind

2292
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,840
of get there let's see what else we had

2293
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,440
down and of course if anyone in the last

2294
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:29,040
30 minutes has any

2295
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:30,560
questions they want to

2296
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:33,120
write so steven wrote i like your method

2297
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:35,199
to work backwards in the flow diagram

2298
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:36,560
start at

2299
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,400
representative or non-representative

2300
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,880
assumptions or perhaps conclusions like

2301
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,400
starting at those endpoints as

2302
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,719
assumptions then looking for prediction

2303
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:46,960
errors in our action perception this

2304
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:48,639
maintains uncertainty in ways that does

2305
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:51,120
not happen when following the causal

2306
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:54,320
effective correlations

2307
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:58,080
that's sort of like 20 questions it's

2308
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,000
framed as a game of

2309
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:00,840
um

2310
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:03,120
oh i'm sorry i didn't know that

2311
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,120
mentioning common children's games was

2312
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:06,800
funny um

2313
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,880
that's framed as a game of going from

2314
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:11,199
the most uncertain towards more

2315
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:13,280
certainty like if you were asking

2316
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:16,480
uninformative questions

2317
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:17,840
what are you doing if you're not if

2318
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,120
you're just getting like and that's

2319
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,960
information theory kind of exemplified

2320
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:22,639
you're reducing the set

2321
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:25,280
of what you can be

2322
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:26,400
um

2323
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,800
guessing with the preference to like win

2324
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,480
within 20 questions

2325
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,080
and then this is

2326
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,560
as steven is pointing out kind of the

2327
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:37,120
other direction

2328
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:38,960
but then what does that look like and

2329
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:41,840
that is almost inflating uncertainty at

2330
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:45,920
least in the information theory sense

2331
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,520
so here's steven's question and then

2332
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:48,719
either of you if you have a thought on

2333
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:50,639
this

2334
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:53,199
do we model the temporal lags in

2335
01:24:53,199 --> 01:24:55,760
dynamical change between sensory state

2336
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:59,840
in relation to changes in action state

2337
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:04,320
so maybe a related question would be how

2338
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:07,280
do time scales and temporal lags

2339
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:08,880
play into

2340
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:10,159
our

2341
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:12,080
modeling of action perception and

2342
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:14,639
cognition

2343
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:16,639
this is why i kept saying to young

2344
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:19,040
people when in doubt

2345
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:21,040
zoom in zoom out and it wasn't just zoom

2346
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:24,560
in zoom out in a sort of a

2347
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:26,960
in a visual sense you have to zoom in

2348
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:29,199
and zoom out on the temporal sets

2349
01:25:29,199 --> 01:25:32,800
as well you have to think about the

2350
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,800
you have to think about the unit of

2351
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:38,080
analysis both as a as a

2352
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,480
as an object but also

2353
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,679
the

2354
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:44,159
as a time of the length of time

2355
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:47,759
something can remain stable or not

2356
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:50,960
i don't think we i don't think we're

2357
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:53,440
naturally inclined to include

2358
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:54,960
the time frame

2359
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:58,159
as much as we're inclined to include the

2360
01:25:58,159 --> 01:25:59,440
did it change

2361
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:01,280
did it float

2362
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:03,840
did it burn whatever whatever it is that

2363
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:06,480
we're waiting to see what happens next

2364
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:08,639
we don't tend to give as much attention

2365
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:12,320
over to how long did it take

2366
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,320
i'll give a complimentary thought which

2367
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,040
is

2368
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:18,639
more related to the kinds of models that

2369
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:21,440
we've specifically seen in actinf so the

2370
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:24,000
deep temporal models or sophisticated

2371
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,280
active inference

2372
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:28,639
in for example a three time step model

2373
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:31,120
at time step one it's doing inference on

2374
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:33,360
one two and three that's

2375
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:36,000
planning as inference in anticipation at

2376
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,840
time step three it can still be

2377
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,440
calculating the model in light of

2378
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:41,679
incoming evidence about time step one

2379
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:42,880
two and three

2380
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:45,760
which is related to memory and learning

2381
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:48,159
and all these other sorts of so-called

2382
01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:50,800
backwards looking types of inference so

2383
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,880
there's like anticipation there's now

2384
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:55,760
casting and then there's reconstruction

2385
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:59,040
of your recent and long-term past and

2386
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:00,560
how that's related to

2387
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:03,520
identity so i think the the question

2388
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,920
um do we or how do we model

2389
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,400
the temporal or just the temporality of

2390
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:11,440
sense and action states the answer

2391
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,600
from model based science is

2392
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,440
what's the time horizon parameter on the

2393
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:16,800
model that we ran

2394
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,719
oh it was 15 days

2395
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:20,880
okay well then we modeled the temporal

2396
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:22,080
lag

2397
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:24,480
up to 15 days

2398
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:26,639
and that is what we modeled

2399
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:28,000
and

2400
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,960
that is sort of where the uh

2401
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:33,440
scale free becomes the scale friendly

2402
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:35,760
becomes the scale specific

2403
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,679
and then that's the

2404
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:40,639
the most that it contracts down to is

2405
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:44,000
that one specific model as deployed by

2406
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,719
those researchers

2407
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:51,679
here's another question from stephen

2408
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:54,880
when do we sense and when do we act

2409
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,960
when do our sense states update when

2410
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:58,880
does our generative model update and

2411
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:01,199
when do our action states update

2412
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:02,800
i'll start with the model based science

2413
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,400
one which is again it would just be the

2414
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:06,639
specifics of how the pseudocode and the

2415
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:08,639
actual computer code were written which

2416
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:10,560
line of code updates first that's the

2417
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,159
narrow answer but what about a more

2418
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:15,719
broader answer

2419
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:20,239
does it depend on how open we are

2420
01:28:20,239 --> 01:28:22,719
how how how

2421
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:24,159
how

2422
01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:26,960
confident competent we are in

2423
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:31,520
staying in an uncertain non-specific

2424
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:34,800
space and can we can we necessarily know

2425
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,400
going in

2426
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:38,400
how long that will be

2427
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,480
i don't i don't know i don't know how

2428
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,000
long

2429
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,320
and what about precognition right like

2430
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:46,960
if we you know expand to that

2431
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:49,120
possibility like like i knew that was

2432
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:50,960
gonna happen i mean that happens to all

2433
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,639
of us right we all experience that like

2434
01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:54,080
oh i knew that was gonna happen like if

2435
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:57,040
i you know step on this ice cube it's

2436
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:58,960
gonna like this ice pile it's gonna

2437
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:00,560
crack through to water or whatever like

2438
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:02,320
i knew that was gonna happen so so we're

2439
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:05,120
able to kind of perceive things before

2440
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:06,719
they happen and so

2441
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:09,199
i don't know like is there not

2442
01:29:09,199 --> 01:29:11,920
necessarily the the temporal

2443
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:13,920
um separation this makes me like think

2444
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:16,239
back to like shanna dobson and like the

2445
01:29:16,239 --> 01:29:18,239
flattening of the time diamond right

2446
01:29:18,239 --> 01:29:20,480
like so so really like um

2447
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,400
is that um

2448
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,480
is it necessary that there's sequence

2449
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,320
here or can it just all be happening

2450
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:28,159
simultaneously that kind of relates to

2451
01:29:28,159 --> 01:29:30,800
what i was asking earlier to like at

2452
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,239
is there some kind of

2453
01:29:32,239 --> 01:29:35,280
simultaneous update sensing action

2454
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:37,280
possibility and i think that there is i

2455
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,880
mean i i don't think that

2456
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:41,600
um not in a computational model because

2457
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:43,679
you know code just runs like it is but

2458
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:45,920
um i think

2459
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:49,760
in our model it's possible yeah

2460
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,440
okay one more general and then more

2461
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:54,400
specific comment the 4d spatial model

2462
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:57,040
tetrahedral synergetic geometry you have

2463
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:59,679
space and time four dimensions spatially

2464
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:02,000
represented rather than the xyz you have

2465
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,120
three spatial dimensions and then

2466
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:04,400
there's like the special question of how

2467
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:07,520
does t come into play so some is known

2468
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:09,600
there and some is not known there but

2469
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:12,400
when and where and how are of course

2470
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:13,840
very linked

2471
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,520
and if we take model-based science

2472
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:17,920
seriously then they're also very

2473
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:20,000
enabled and constrained by the kinds of

2474
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,400
models we have so maybe it's related to

2475
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,320
how we think about geometry

2476
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,239
and then

2477
01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:29,519
the sense and action

2478
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:33,199
are they continuous or are they discrete

2479
01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:36,080
we've seen recently decosta at all like

2480
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:37,679
the synthesis of active inference on

2481
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:39,440
discrete state spaces

2482
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:42,480
and then we've also seen some of uh alex

2483
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:45,040
chance's work on the continuous

2484
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,239
control

2485
01:30:46,239 --> 01:30:48,639
settings with like the mountain car

2486
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:51,760
which is not just um the uh discrete

2487
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:52,880
case

2488
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:55,920
so it's just interesting to see how

2489
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:58,000
uh

2490
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,840
some of the theory goes out in front and

2491
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:01,440
then there's parallel lines of

2492
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:03,760
mathematical development with continuous

2493
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:05,760
and discrete modeling like digital and

2494
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,639
analog modeling and sometimes those

2495
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:10,400
types of modeling scientifically are

2496
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:12,239
very well reconciled

2497
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:14,080
and other times they result in pretty

2498
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:16,480
fundamentally different patterns

2499
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:17,760
like there are certain equations where

2500
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:20,159
the discretized form or the version

2501
01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:22,000
that's computed without really high

2502
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,600
precision numbers on a computer has

2503
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:25,360
really different behavior than the other

2504
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:27,360
kinds of models which

2505
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:29,840
gets at the importance of thinking about

2506
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:32,639
how the model is is

2507
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:34,400
framed and then also applied because

2508
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:36,480
like if the precision of the processor

2509
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,320
matters for what the paper discovers

2510
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:39,360
then

2511
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:40,480
shouldn't that be a part of the

2512
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:43,480
consideration

2513
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:48,960
okay

2514
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:51,360
here's a few of the other comments and

2515
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:53,679
for thirty six one two so by the way

2516
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:55,360
we'll write down any other questions so

2517
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:56,960
if anyone in the last few minutes has

2518
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,480
some questions

2519
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,480
they can ask and we'll be just writing

2520
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:02,000
things down

2521
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,679
getting excited for

2522
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:05,840
dot two and if anybody wants to join who

2523
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:07,360
wasn't here today they're also very

2524
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:10,759
welcome too

2525
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:14,080
how is representation related to

2526
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:16,000
autopoesis

2527
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,320
so refresher autopoetic system is

2528
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:20,000
capable of producing and maintaining

2529
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,679
itself by creating its own parts

2530
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:26,639
so how does representation differ or

2531
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:29,040
does it differ for a system that is just

2532
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:31,440
engineered and secreted into the niche

2533
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:33,199
like a computer

2534
01:32:33,199 --> 01:32:34,880
versus potentially something that is

2535
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:37,040
reassembling its parts continually why

2536
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:41,000
does that matter if it does

2537
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:51,199
that is that a

2538
01:32:51,199 --> 01:32:53,440
thing to look at and point to daniel

2539
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:55,280
that sounds good yeah yeah not i'm

2540
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:57,040
trying to push it on but i mean

2541
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:59,440
the reality is is that

2542
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:01,440
we can take each of the of the different

2543
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:02,960
segments the organizational the

2544
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:04,000
structural

2545
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,400
and the content related and then

2546
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:10,480
put them through the autopoetic grinder

2547
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,320
and see what pops out the other side

2548
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,880
okay great suggestion apply this to the

2549
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:17,440
four columns

2550
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,639
um

2551
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:20,639
what other things would be fun to

2552
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:22,480
discuss in

2553
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:24,880
dot 2 or what else can go through the

2554
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:27,120
four column grinder or what would be any

2555
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:31,559
other question that any of you have

2556
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:40,320
in the in the in the 0.2 also if we can

2557
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:42,000
we can spend a little bit of time on

2558
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,840
some of the

2559
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:45,440
some of the comments that were in the

2560
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:47,360
section 5 of the paper

2561
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:49,600
specifically around how

2562
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,840
we face state from

2563
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:54,400
potentially they didn't say that this is

2564
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,960
true but they said if if this claim is

2565
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:59,679
true we could be face stating from not

2566
01:33:59,679 --> 01:34:02,320
representational too representational

2567
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:04,159
maybe maybe could we spend a little bit

2568
01:34:04,159 --> 01:34:06,320
of time not just looking at the

2569
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:10,880
autopilosis aspect of that but how does

2570
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:13,760
how does that density form in the in

2571
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:16,159
relationship to this idea of modeling

2572
01:34:16,159 --> 01:34:18,320
ourselves

2573
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:19,600
great question

2574
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:22,400
here's a question that um stephen wrote

2575
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:24,880
so feel free to give a thought on it or

2576
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:25,920
we can

2577
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,679
uh push it

2578
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:29,520
it was

2579
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:33,280
will robotics or neurophenomenology

2580
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:35,520
help most in testing these complex

2581
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:39,600
temporal dynamics in a realist way

2582
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:44,239
i'm just going to say that's a great

2583
01:34:44,239 --> 01:34:45,920
question and i think we need the person

2584
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:48,080
who asked the question to come on and

2585
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:51,679
chat with us about that a little bit

2586
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:55,199
we're just delegating so hard here blue

2587
01:34:55,199 --> 01:34:57,199
go ahead

2588
01:34:57,199 --> 01:34:59,679
so something that i've brought up i

2589
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:01,679
think in the dodge zero is like i would

2590
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:03,679
really like to tease apart the

2591
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:05,840
similarities and differences between

2592
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:07,920
like structural aspects

2593
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:09,040
and

2594
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:10,960
content related aspects

2595
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:14,400
i'm not entirely certain like that's a

2596
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:15,840
fuzzy blurred

2597
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:17,600
line for me

2598
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:20,639
um there so maybe we could get into that

2599
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:22,639
a little bit more

2600
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:26,239
i agree it's fuzzy for me too

2601
01:35:26,239 --> 01:35:28,480
these are awesome questions too thanks

2602
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:30,800
for writing us all out blue well we have

2603
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:32,400
multiple pages so we have

2604
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:34,560
auto polices

2605
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:38,000
from non-rep to non-rep to rep and back

2606
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,520
and forth or

2607
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:41,280
whatever else how does that form in the

2608
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:44,080
context of self-representation

2609
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:45,520
i think there's a few hamlet quotes that

2610
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:46,880
will come into play there

2611
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:49,040
then stephen's question about technology

2612
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:51,600
and realism

2613
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:55,360
structural content aspects

2614
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:58,159
detached representations in the

2615
01:35:58,159 --> 01:35:59,920
neurobehavioral systems in the sensory

2616
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:02,880
motor loop

2617
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:06,320
niche modification

2618
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:08,719
stigma g and the digital case extended

2619
01:36:08,719 --> 01:36:11,679
cognitive systems that include digital

2620
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:16,480
and uh mirror adaptive systems

2621
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:18,480
steven's singing 80 songs in the chat i

2622
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:20,400
believe

2623
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:21,520
thinking through other minds and

2624
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:23,679
multi-scale integration one of sims

2625
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:25,280
other papers

2626
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:27,760
how are they related

2627
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:30,400
does the fep exist independently or only

2628
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,960
in the mirror

2629
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:35,600
a lot of ways to answer that one

2630
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:37,119
[Music]

2631
01:36:37,119 --> 01:36:38,400
one part

2632
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:41,920
we could look into now or

2633
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:44,400
maybe in the dot two would be the free

2634
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:46,080
expected free energy and variational

2635
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:47,440
free energy

2636
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:49,360
and how they play different roles in the

2637
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:52,159
fep

2638
01:36:52,159 --> 01:36:53,600
these are also some things like if

2639
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:55,119
people are watching live or in the next

2640
01:36:55,119 --> 01:36:56,400
few days then

2641
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:59,440
they can write a comment on it or um get

2642
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:00,880
in touch with us or like if they want to

2643
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:02,719
submit a question or

2644
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:04,320
they can come on and discuss it in the

2645
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:05,600
dot too

2646
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:07,040
variational

2647
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:09,760
and expected

2648
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:12,560
free energy

2649
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:15,760
there's a lot of parts to the paper

2650
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:18,159
oh and action-oriented representation we

2651
01:37:18,159 --> 01:37:19,040
didn't

2652
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:21,760
get to that slide in the dot zero

2653
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:23,840
but just what is what is action oriented

2654
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:25,360
representation we've talked about

2655
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:27,760
representations today but then did we

2656
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:29,119
talk about

2657
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:30,560
were we implicitly talking about

2658
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:32,639
action-oriented representations are

2659
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:36,960
those a subclass how are they different

2660
01:37:46,239 --> 01:37:48,320
any other yeah

2661
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,960
in our in our like system in like human

2662
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:53,040
cognition there are some

2663
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:54,159
um

2664
01:37:54,159 --> 01:37:56,800
like hard-coded representations that we

2665
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:59,280
have um

2666
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:02,080
like action-oriented maybe one of them

2667
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:04,880
um like kinesthetic memory and also like

2668
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:07,520
visual recognition systems and

2669
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:10,800
it's really interesting that um

2670
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:13,199
and perhaps easy to apply

2671
01:38:13,199 --> 01:38:15,600
the fep to

2672
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:18,320
specific cognitive systems

2673
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:19,920
like subsystems

2674
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:21,199
but

2675
01:38:21,199 --> 01:38:22,400
it's

2676
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,400
really much more difficult when we have

2677
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:26,639
like multiple competing processes like

2678
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:28,159
we're not just

2679
01:38:28,159 --> 01:38:30,480
playing the piano and we're not just

2680
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:32,239
looking at the piano keys like we're

2681
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:33,600
doing both of those things at the same

2682
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,040
time and lots of other things like we

2683
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:37,920
might be you know having some memory of

2684
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:39,199
one time that we heard the song that

2685
01:38:39,199 --> 01:38:41,679
we're playing or something like that so

2686
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:43,600
it's really interesting to think about

2687
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:45,280
um

2688
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:47,119
representation and all the ways that it

2689
01:38:47,119 --> 01:38:49,040
exists also even in memory right like

2690
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:52,800
the memory representation is um

2691
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,159
is it's like a

2692
01:38:54,159 --> 01:38:57,440
it's not that's not a hard-coded um

2693
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:59,760
thing it's really squishy and it's it's

2694
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:02,000
um subject to change through time and

2695
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,080
you know we might remember a situation

2696
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:05,920
like you can tell me your phone number

2697
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:07,440
right now and i'll remember it you know

2698
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:09,920
in five minutes but in five days no like

2699
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:12,719
or something like that so um i don't

2700
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:14,719
know it's really interesting

2701
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:17,600
to think about the fep and how it can

2702
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:19,840
apply in this overarching way

2703
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:21,760
um where there are multiple competing

2704
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:23,119
goals and

2705
01:39:23,119 --> 01:39:24,840
priorities and

2706
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:26,960
um yeah

2707
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:28,560
that

2708
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:30,000
one thought i hope i'm not

2709
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,560
misrepresenting an empirical result was

2710
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:35,280
in fruit fly the drosophila

2711
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:36,080
they

2712
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:38,880
found that uh short-term memories

2713
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:41,360
didn't require protein synthesis like

2714
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:44,239
just second to second some sound or some

2715
01:39:44,239 --> 01:39:46,000
symbol could be associated with a

2716
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,040
preferred or repulsive outcome

2717
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:49,920
but

2718
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:52,239
preventing protein synthesis block the

2719
01:39:52,239 --> 01:39:54,320
consolidation of memory and perhaps

2720
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:56,480
that's similar to other systems and so

2721
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:57,920
there's kind of like

2722
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:01,040
the resonant neural structures

2723
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:04,239
that are just using

2724
01:40:04,239 --> 01:40:07,520
the system's connections as they are

2725
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:09,840
that's sort of one perhaps faster mode

2726
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:12,159
of cognition that's like running around

2727
01:40:12,159 --> 01:40:13,679
figure two

2728
01:40:13,679 --> 01:40:15,760
and then there's a

2729
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:18,080
restructuring

2730
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:20,719
that requires changing the model like

2731
01:40:20,719 --> 01:40:22,880
structure learning but that also

2732
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:24,159
connects to realism because we're

2733
01:40:24,159 --> 01:40:25,760
talking about the

2734
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:28,159
synapses and the neurogenesis like of

2735
01:40:28,159 --> 01:40:29,440
specific

2736
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:32,400
cells that could be maybe measured and

2737
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:34,080
then the neurophysiology and the

2738
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:35,440
behavior can be

2739
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:36,960
observed as well

2740
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:38,880
if we have integrative frameworks like

2741
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:40,000
active

2742
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:40,960
so

2743
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:42,320
like

2744
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:43,840
it also relates to dean's comment about

2745
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:46,639
the scales the time scales of change

2746
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:48,560
like neural circuits cannot be changing

2747
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:51,280
at a time scale faster than neural

2748
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:54,239
firing so how does the spiking component

2749
01:40:54,239 --> 01:40:56,320
or the other sensory transduction or

2750
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:58,480
other chemical components how do those

2751
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:00,560
overlapping time scales

2752
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:02,560
coordinate

2753
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:04,239
this reminds me to daniel of something

2754
01:41:04,239 --> 01:41:05,840
that we talked about like the very first

2755
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:08,320
time we met um because it was a recent

2756
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:10,639
experiment at that time about the memory

2757
01:41:10,639 --> 01:41:13,920
transfer between snails um via injection

2758
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:15,840
of of rna

2759
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:18,400
um so that was like an interesting

2760
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:19,760
possible

2761
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:21,760
memory storage um

2762
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:23,520
and i'm not sure what what else has you

2763
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:24,960
know developed from that but but also

2764
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:26,159
we've talked about

2765
01:41:26,159 --> 01:41:28,480
you know ants and what

2766
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:30,159
um how they leave like

2767
01:41:30,159 --> 01:41:31,760
they like told me like that they're just

2768
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:33,440
throwing up rna like they're throwing up

2769
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:34,719
all the time all over the place and like

2770
01:41:34,719 --> 01:41:37,760
maybe leaving chemical like rna traces

2771
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:39,520
for each other um we talked about that

2772
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:41,360
too so maybe i don't know if you want to

2773
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:43,440
expand on that or or does that tie into

2774
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:47,040
this protein synthesis um you know

2775
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:49,040
thing

2776
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:51,840
one thought on that it was a recent uh

2777
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:54,719
ant paper where basically the act of

2778
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:56,560
mating which we won't describe on this

2779
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:58,880
family-friendly discussion

2780
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:01,840
directly infuses neurotransmitters into

2781
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:04,000
the recipient and that changes their

2782
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,440
behavior and induces all these other

2783
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:08,560
hormonal changes and so the realism of

2784
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:10,880
cognition like the embodiment and the

2785
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:13,679
physicality of these systems

2786
01:42:13,679 --> 01:42:16,560
it is perturbable by infusions of

2787
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:18,159
neurotransmitters

2788
01:42:18,159 --> 01:42:19,199
in

2789
01:42:19,199 --> 01:42:22,239
other neural systems and in us so that's

2790
01:42:22,239 --> 01:42:24,080
sort of where realism can't be

2791
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:25,600
eradicated

2792
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:28,400
amidst all of these representations

2793
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:29,600
because

2794
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:32,239
things do hit our head and molecules do

2795
01:42:32,239 --> 01:42:34,560
diffuse it's kind of like grounding it

2796
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:36,000
and that's i think why it's such an

2797
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,159
interesting and um

2798
01:42:38,159 --> 01:42:39,679
integrative area with a lot of

2799
01:42:39,679 --> 01:42:40,800
contention

2800
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:43,760
because the four e side

2801
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:45,760
is holding down that

2802
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:48,159
real side

2803
01:42:48,159 --> 01:42:51,520
and then the science side so called is

2804
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:53,360
holding down the abstractions and the

2805
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:54,880
representations

2806
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:57,440
and then cognitive science especially as

2807
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:59,199
applied to humans

2808
01:42:59,199 --> 01:43:01,600
is kind of where it meets in the middle

2809
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:03,440
it's like well yeah you're talking about

2810
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:05,920
embedded cognition and active cognition

2811
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:08,080
but that's your cognition

2812
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:09,600
that's modeling

2813
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:11,440
and so then you get

2814
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:14,239
um all kinds of fun

2815
01:43:14,239 --> 01:43:16,159
viewpoints and

2816
01:43:16,159 --> 01:43:17,840
ideas because

2817
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:19,600
of

2818
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:22,320
how mixed and complex that

2819
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:25,719
area is

2820
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:30,159
thanks blue and dean

2821
01:43:30,159 --> 01:43:32,400
and those who participated in chat for

2822
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:34,080
this really great

2823
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:36,400
discussion i hope you can

2824
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:39,119
digest it and learn in the next week and

2825
01:43:39,119 --> 01:43:40,480
reflect on some of these questions and

2826
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:43,199
that anyone can ask more questions or

2827
01:43:43,199 --> 01:43:44,639
start to prepare some thoughts so that

2828
01:43:44,639 --> 01:43:46,400
they can also be involved because this

2829
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:48,800
was really fun

2830
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:49,760
all right

2831
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:53,040
we've got one question yes statement

2832
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:55,040
um

2833
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:56,800
every one of these live streams i don't

2834
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:57,679
know

2835
01:43:57,679 --> 01:43:59,600
ultimately how it's decided which order

2836
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:01,040
that we do them in but the fact that

2837
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:02,239
we've gone

2838
01:44:02,239 --> 01:44:04,400
from conner's paper to magee's paper to

2839
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:05,520
this one

2840
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:07,600
whether it was done with some sort of

2841
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:08,639
intent

2842
01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:10,480
and looking back a lot back to the

2843
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:11,440
future

2844
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:13,520
or it was just okay well i think we'll

2845
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:15,760
we'll do this one next and see what

2846
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:18,320
happens i think the order of these last

2847
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:20,560
three papers in particular

2848
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:21,140
has been

2849
01:44:21,140 --> 01:44:22,239
[Music]

2850
01:44:22,239 --> 01:44:24,639
pretty just the order in which we've

2851
01:44:24,639 --> 01:44:27,119
looked at them has generated a whole

2852
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:28,400
bunch of

2853
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:29,840
interesting

2854
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:32,320
ideas including sort of the

2855
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:34,560
the idea of tr intransitivity in the

2856
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:37,280
last paper now potentially

2857
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:39,199
influencing how we've discussed this

2858
01:44:39,199 --> 01:44:41,440
paper so

2859
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:42,800
again i don't know how much pre-thought

2860
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:44,719
goes into that but if there was some

2861
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:46,320
pre-thought that went into putting these

2862
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:49,119
papers in this particular order

2863
01:44:49,119 --> 01:44:51,920
it's been very uh helpful

2864
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:55,360
and one other thing if

2865
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:57,600
if i find something happy

2866
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:00,239
because it's true i'm gonna laugh

2867
01:45:00,239 --> 01:45:02,960
and if i find something happy because

2868
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:04,880
it's playing a game like 20 questions or

2869
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:06,000
any game

2870
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
i'm gonna laugh so

2871
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,600
if i can't be

2872
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:12,639
uh if i can't enjoy and uh

2873
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:15,520
and really appreciate

2874
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:17,760
the sophistication of the conversation

2875
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:19,840
here i probably wouldn't show up so

2876
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:21,520
thanks to both of you

2877
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:23,280
you can make me read active papers but

2878
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:25,840
you can't make me have fun

2879
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:28,880
but just to give it one closing answer

2880
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:30,639
information for anybody who wants to

2881
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:32,480
like get involved with the discussions

2882
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:36,080
here's our coda for the dot coms unit

2883
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:37,600
and so here's the live stream table the

2884
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:39,280
one that gets represented on the

2885
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:41,600
viewable public one so we have all the

2886
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:44,719
papers planned like in this case up till

2887
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:48,320
37 38 39 40 up through the end of march

2888
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:49,920
so we try to plan the papers in advance

2889
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:51,760
so that people can have time to read

2890
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:53,600
them and commit to collaborating on the

2891
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:56,320
dot zero background video and then we

2892
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:58,800
have papers to potentially discuss

2893
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:00,800
and so here people add papers and then

2894
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:04,159
they click a heart and dean we just

2895
01:46:04,159 --> 01:46:06,239
sorted by hearts

2896
01:46:06,239 --> 01:46:08,639
and then we picked the papers

2897
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:11,600
that were on the four top papers

2898
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:12,719
and we said okay we're going to read

2899
01:46:12,719 --> 01:46:13,840
these four

2900
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:17,119
for um 36 seven eight nine

2901
01:46:17,119 --> 01:46:19,119
um

2902
01:46:19,119 --> 01:46:20,800
yeah those

2903
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:23,760
and then we emailed the authors

2904
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:25,760
and so we of different papers and we

2905
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:27,440
said well what dates might work because

2906
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:29,199
we always will prefer to schedule a

2907
01:46:29,199 --> 01:46:30,719
paper that we want to read when the

2908
01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:32,639
authors want to join and so that's kind

2909
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:34,880
of our first um like the way that we

2910
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:35,679
pull

2911
01:46:35,679 --> 01:46:38,320
papers out like we set the dates for um

2912
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:40,719
the quantum free energy discussions in

2913
01:46:40,719 --> 01:46:42,880
march and then we work backwards from

2914
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:45,360
there and then just try to not

2915
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:47,119
do two

2916
01:46:47,119 --> 01:46:47,440
um

2917
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:48,960
[Music]

2918
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:51,280
not even overlapping papers just try to

2919
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:53,119
provide

2920
01:46:53,119 --> 01:46:55,119
rhythm and novelty and

2921
01:46:55,119 --> 01:46:56,880
philosophy and

2922
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:58,639
technical details so it's sort of a

2923
01:46:58,639 --> 01:47:00,480
local decision making

2924
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:01,760
based upon

2925
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:03,600
the votes that people provide who are

2926
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:06,480
participating in the dot coms unit

2927
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:08,560
and pretty random yeah and just what

2928
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:09,760
people surface

2929
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:11,199
that's going to say that's a pretty

2930
01:47:11,199 --> 01:47:13,360
serendipitous uh order then that's

2931
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:16,960
fantastic it's fun um and and if anybody

2932
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:19,199
watching or listening wants to suggest a

2933
01:47:19,199 --> 01:47:22,000
paper for the live stream uh please do

2934
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,679
