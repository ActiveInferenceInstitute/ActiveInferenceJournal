00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,680
welcome to active inference lab

6
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,320
we are a participatory online lab that

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,800
is communicating learning and practicing

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,120
applied active inference you can find us

9
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,600
at the links here on this page

10
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,600
this is a recorded and an archived live

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,280
stream so please provide us with

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,079

and we'll be following good video

16
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,280
etiquette for live streams

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,360
check out activeinference.org if you

18
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,240
want to learn more about what active lab

19
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,159
is up to or if you want to participate

20
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,880
in any of the activities which include

21
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,119
live streams in the communications

22
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,799
organizational unit but a ton of other

23
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,520
stuff is happening

24
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,880
today in 36.2 our third discussion on 36

25
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,880
we're going to continue to

26
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,560
learn and discuss this paper by sims and

27
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,880
pizzulo 2021

28
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,479
modeling ourselves

29
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,479
what the free energy principle reveals

30
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,159
about our implicit notions of

31
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,880
representation and

32
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,079
we're gonna have a

33
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,360
nice jumping off dot two as we do

34
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,399
and have some questions written down and

35
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,600
prepared

36
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,840
other things will spontaneously arise

37
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,320
and if anyone watching live wants to

38
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,000
just write a question in a live chat we

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,960
can also address that

40
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,920
we'll start with an introduction so

41
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,640
we'll go around and introduce ourselves

42
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,159
people can say anything they want and

43
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,840
they can also add just what got them

44
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,400
excited about the paper in general or

45
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,840
for this dot to discussion specifically

46
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,640
so

47
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,319
i'm daniel i'm a researcher in

48
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,599
california

49
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,440
and

50
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,200
just excited to see

51
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,200
how this representation

52
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,840
discussion influences our

53
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,120
own self

54
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,680
representation and

55
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,640
that at the individual and the lab scale

56
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,200
moving forward i'll pass it to blue

57
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,440
hi i'm blue i'm a independent research

58
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,720
consultant in new mexico and i am

59
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,200
excited by this paper because in our

60
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,680
previous discussions we're as usual left

61
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,480
with more questions than answers and

62
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,319
also i kind of um

63
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,120
i'm finding myself like swayed by the

64
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,120
different like representational

65
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,879
structural content driven

66
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,720
non-representational like these

67
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,480
different arguments and i just find them

68
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,800
very interesting and i just want to know

69
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,200
if at the end of this if i'll be swayed

70
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,120
more or less in certain directions or

71
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,040
maybe just be more open to

72
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,519
other interpretations of fep

73
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,440
and i will pass it to danielle

74
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,239
hello i'm danielle i'm a cognitive

75
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,159
scientist at google with a background in

76
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,560
language evolution language development

77
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,560
i'm really interested in

78
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,799
thinking about how humans evolve the

79
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,480
ability to model other minds so

80
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,319
interested in how this this discussion

81
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,480
can contribute to that and generally

82
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,920
interested in how

83
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,360
really good frameworks like the fep can

84
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,480
help um kind of encompass other

85
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,079
frameworks and and revise them

86
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,599
awesome dean

87
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,000
hi i'm dean i'm up here in calgary

88
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,799
in canada and

89
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:01,680
uh

90
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,519
a little bit of recency effect i started

91
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,200
watching ozark the

92
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,439
last season and so i i'm trying to plug

93
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,519
this paper in through what would marty

94
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,560
bird do

95
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,040
so that's kind of my little twist on

96
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,560
modeling so

97
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,238
back to you daniel

98
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,680
who is marty bird and what would he do

99
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,600
right

100
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,079
exactly

101
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,960
great question well that's all we

102
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,600
prepared for today so

103
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,160
we'll go into the discussion

104
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,120
but

105
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,800
we have some things written down is

106
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,759
there anything just off the bat

107
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,919
that anybody wants to just ask or jump

108
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,080
into or like a figure or a quotation to

109
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,840
begin with or we can

110
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,199
look at some of the things that we had

111
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,680
written down

112
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,320
okay let's just start with

113
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,840
what we've written down and then of

114
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,239
course at any point we can branch off

115
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,120
okay

116
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,440
i think a big

117
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,759
theme that we'll probably return to

118
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,960
again and again is this idea of

119
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,680
moving back and forth

120
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,600
from

121
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,240
non-representational forms to

122
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,880
representational forms

123
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,360
in the paper they introduce

124
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,880
four different facets of representation

125
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,919
and then

126
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,680
how each of those facets can be

127
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,520
approached in a representational or

128
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,600
non-representational way and although

129
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,400
the image here shows some solid black

130
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,600
lines

131
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,840
that was kind of the discussion was is

132
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,120
there movement across these areas or

133
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,919
blurriness so maybe

134
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,600
dean

135
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,400
what

136
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,520
is there to say or start to explore

137
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,520
with representations

138
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,600
emerging like almost precipitating or

139
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,960
crystallizing out of something

140
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,120
non-representational and then the

141
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,199
reverse process of something that is

142
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,800
more representational

143
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,560
submerging back into something that's

144
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,720
less

145
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,240
well one of the things the authors did

146
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,240
talk quite a bit about in terms of the

147
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,880
the functional aspect of this was the

148
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,800
vicarious nature and then they also

149
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,280
talked quite a bit about

150
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,160
whether or not somebody who's sort of

151
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,680
moving in that

152
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,080
radical and activism

153
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,720
space um still has to be able to

154
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,520
differentiate and get some some include

155
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,560
some of the

156
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,400
temporal aspects of what might pop up

157
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,199
and

158
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,600
become something that we can stabilize

159
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,880
and in

160
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,280
model representation form

161
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,800
but then it has to also be able to

162
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,039
disappear right it also has to not

163
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,440
necessarily consume everything in terms

164
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,800
of our our attentional fields so

165
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,120
i'm not really sure exactly

166
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,800
how that

167
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,600
works itself through

168
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,919
[Music]

169
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,280
but i would think that it's difficult to

170
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,360
say that

171
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,360
even if we're in a flow state

172
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,880
that there isn't some

173
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,319
moment when we

174
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,520
do reflect in that mirror so

175
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,199
that's kind of where i'm at i i don't

176
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,280
have any answers per se but i

177
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,280
don't want to get stuck in the idea that

178
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,560
it's just a

179
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,800
on off switch i think that there's a bit

180
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,840
of a

181
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,800
a moment of dimming and then

182
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,440
re-re-lighting

183
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,680
so

184
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,520
that makes me think about certain

185
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,919
paths that our thought takes

186
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,560
over these eight cells

187
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,720
like when we're in the representational

188
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,919
side when we're dealing with a

189
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,120
representation how do we take that

190
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,800
tetrahedra and look at the four

191
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,400
different sides

192
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,120
and then how do we stay within a column

193
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,960
looking at just the organizational

194
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,599
aspects of a system and then move

195
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,440
north and south

196
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,479
on that

197
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,639
um

198
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,039
do these kinds of knowledge

199
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,520
or cognitive transitions

200
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,879
happen

201
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,240
all the time

202
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,759
do they have other

203
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,840
names that might be more familiar than

204
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,680
using some of this

205
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,000
philosophical language

206
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,080
like what is it are there any times in

207
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,840
our days

208
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,879
where we're dealing with something

209
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,680
representationally and we shift

210
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,520
to a non-representational

211
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,919
version

212
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,839
within one of these categories or across

213
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,479
categories

214
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,599
so i was just thinking of that actually

215
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,000
like um

216
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,800
what

217
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,760
does like organism organizational

218
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,519
an organizational representation look

219
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,120
like like that is like

220
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,440
a map like a structural organ

221
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,959
representation a content related

222
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,240
representation and a functional

223
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,160
representation and and

224
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,959
like what what do these representations

225
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,640
look like like

226
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,560
and how are they different

227
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,560
i was thinking about that

228
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,080
let's go to the definition of the

229
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,399
organizational representation just to

230
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,920
kind of

231
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,920
remember

232
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,600
the fact that fep requires internal

233
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,560
states

234
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,120
states that encode the recognition model

235
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,360
that are statistically separated from

236
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,000
the external reality

237
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,399
so the organizational

238
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,399
area

239
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,440
is about

240
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,080
how variables inside of systems are

241
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,279
separated from variables

242
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,399
outside of the system

243
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,279
the

244
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,640
pro representation take

245
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,880
is

246
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,720
there's an evidentiary boundary

247
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,959
the markov blanket

248
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,680
and there's something on the inside

249
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,120
that is doing something like a

250
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,959
representation on what's outside

251
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,959
so that's the pro representational take

252
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,360
then the

253
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,120
non-representational take is where we

254
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,920
get into the ecological and the

255
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,880
inactivist persuasion

256
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,399
and that's where the authors say that

257
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,560
some have approached this markov blanket

258
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,680
structural

259
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,680
formalism

260
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,040
even though we're talking about it in

261
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,600
the organizational not the structural

262
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,640
facet

263
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,760
in a manner that suggests a

264
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,040
non-representational view

265
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,839
and they argue that just partitioning

266
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,519
two coupled systems like agent and

267
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,880
environment

268
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,399
with a mark out blanket

269
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,320
doesn't imply

270
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,279
that the behavior of the agent

271
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,600
is explained by

272
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,920
anything related to an internal model

273
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,839
that's doing anything like capturing the

274
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,800
structure of

275
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,000
the outside world

276
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,959
so you just use like organizational and

277
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,760
structural like in this like big hobnob

278
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,760
but so my question was really

279
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,120
what does an organizational

280
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,320
representation look like and so

281
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,480
i'm hearing that you answered that there

282
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,399
are clearly defined boundaries in

283
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,480
organizational representation

284
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,640
or partitions between internal and

285
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,560
external studies so like i have a

286
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,160
clearly when i have a representation in

287
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,880
my mind that's organizational

288
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,040
it is

289
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,600
like your boundary is different from

290
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,040
like is it

291
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,040
only your own boundary or is it like the

292
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,200
boundaries of each individual agent are

293
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,120
organizationally represented in your

294
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,720
mind or is it just the boundary between

295
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,839
you and the outside world

296
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,839
and how might that differ from

297
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,519
structural and content related like what

298
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,040
do these different representations look

299
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,920
like that's what i'm trying to see like

300
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,279
would they be maps and how would the

301
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,000
maps be different

302
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,200
the structural which does come up

303
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,040
several times in

304
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,719
the organizational definition

305
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,279
so we see structure coming up the

306
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,040
structure of the system in how it's

307
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,639
organized but what is the structural

308
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,200
specifically okay

309
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,519
having representational vehicles that

310
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,519
are structurally similar to the state of

311
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,000
affairs in the world that they stand for

312
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,760
the pro-representational

313
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,079
structural side

314
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,560
is kind of like the good regulator

315
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,040
theorem of cybernetics

316
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,480
so the organizational side is

317
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,959
highlighting that there is some sort of

318
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,880
informational encapsulation we might

319
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,040
even say like our previous discussions

320
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,480
but some sort of

321
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,480
organization of variables such that

322
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,800
there's an inside and outside that are

323
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,320
separated

324
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,920
and

325
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,040
the structural side is saying that

326
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,959
um it's like if there's

327
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,880
three things that are connected in the

328
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,560
outside world

329
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,480
then the not just that there are

330
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,320
variables that are organizationally

331
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,200
separated in the internal states but

332
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,000
that the structure of those

333
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,839
isolated variables

334
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,079
is going to do something like

335
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,079
recapitulate or have a structural

336
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,519
resemblance

337
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,680
to the generative process

338
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,839
generative process that's like the niche

339
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,000
that's what's outside generative model

340
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,399
that's what the agent has on board

341
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,040
and so if it's to be useful for control

342
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,720
purposes then

343
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,040
it may have to have some sort of

344
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,760
structural resemblance to the actual

345
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,199
connectivity

346
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,360
of the generative process so

347
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,519
generative model and generative process

348
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,360
being separated is what's captured in

349
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,360
the organizational side

350
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,959
them having similar

351
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,800
resemblances or similar structures is

352
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,839
what the structural side is

353
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,839
the structural non-representationalists

354
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,760
are suggesting

355
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,680
this is i think tale of two densities

356
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,839
with ramstead at all or modeling

357
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,120
ourself author suggests that generative

358
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,120
models do not meet the requirements of

359
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,399
structural representations

360
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,680
because the process of exploitable

361
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,760
structural representations so posterior

362
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,160
beliefs in the

363
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,560
entity

364
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,800
is enacted

365
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,440
and so it doesn't necessarily have to

366
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,320
recapitulate the form of the generative

367
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,399
process so maybe one could

368
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,040
be skilled in the performance of driving

369
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,360
without having variables connected in

370
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,279
the way that a car

371
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,920
pieces are connected

372
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,839
it comes back to a theme that

373
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,360
active presents to us

374
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,880
perhaps more as a question than an

375
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,519
answer which is how much do we have to

376
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,560
know in order to act

377
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,040
do we have to have

378
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,839
an internal

379
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,920
model that is very similar to the

380
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,240
process

381
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,440
uncorrelated and how similar it is

382
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,759
anti-correlated in how similar it is

383
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,959
and can we have a framework as

384
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,519
researchers that helps us compare the

385
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,839
structure and organization of generative

386
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,240
processes and generative models of those

387
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,800
processes

388
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,359
yes um kill 14.

389
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,440
so i'll put this out there and then

390
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,360
people push back or say it doesn't make

391
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,399
any sense

392
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,320
from what i read in the paper now

393
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,519
because i had to go back over and look

394
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,880
at it again

395
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,959
if i were to try to draw a simple

396
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,720
comparison between organization and

397
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,920
structure

398
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,720
organization would you could see it as

399
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,279
being something as being either in or

400
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,320
out

401
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,199
so you could be inside

402
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,600
you could be inside a cell or outside of

403
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,160
a cell then in our minds we can tell

404
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,320
we will draw those partitions and then

405
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,720
we'll decide what's in or out

406
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,040
structural i think takes on more of the

407
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,800
entailing question something that serve

408
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,480
all brought up in the

409
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,160
chat which is

410
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,920
so once you've decided whether

411
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,600
something's in or not is there something

412
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,720
else that now can be seen as being super

413
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,639
ordinate to that

414
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,560
from us from

415
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,959
from the perspective of sort of what's

416
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,480
wrapped around

417
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,199
now the thing that's in or what can sit

418
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,880
upon

419
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,519
theoretically the thing that you've now

420
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,279
decided is is

421
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,519
foundational to whatever it is you're

422
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,000
looking at and what can be set aside as

423
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
not being important to what you're

424
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
looking at so again

425
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,520
pull that apart and say that that's

426
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,400
wrong but that's kind of what i try to

427
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,319
read into what the readers or what the

428
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,079
writers were saying so it's just my

429
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,799
interpretation

430
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,439
thanks blue

431
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,359
so i i just wonder in this

432
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,240
organizational representation is

433
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,120
do you draw a distinction between

434
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,799
i mean clearly there's one between like

435
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,600
what's internal and external to yourself

436
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,000
but are you also trying to like draw

437
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,760
distinctions between what's internal and

438
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,039
external to

439
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,760
your computer or your refrigerator or

440
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,720
your best friend or your child like are

441
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,880
you making a representation of

442
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,799
everything that's internal and external

443
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,880
to every other thing or is it only with

444
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,640
respect to your own

445
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,919
self versus environment

446
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,320
i would think it's it's when you do that

447
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,760
i don't know that it's

448
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,320
implied that you do it all the time

449
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,039
but if you choose to do that

450
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,559
i think that that's something that's

451
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,240
pretty easy to

452
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,679
tell the difference

453
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:12,640
around

454
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,039
so again i'm not sure that they were

455
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,760
saying that we do this we're do always

456
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,840
constantly doing this but i think

457
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,600
they're what they were trying to do is

458
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,520
show the difference between

459
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,840
knowing when something's in or out

460
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,760
versus knowing when something's first or

461
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,840
second

462
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,400
from a structural standpoint

463
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,840
again i don't want to put words in the

464
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,039
author's mouth

465
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,280
but i that's i did

466
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,520
i did hear that in the words that they

467
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,679
were doing to try to parse those two

468
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,640
things and give each each their due as

469
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,440
opposed to saying

470
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,039
they're just the same thing overlapping

471
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,280
let's try one

472
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,960
little thought loop

473
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,360
so let's start with

474
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,799
blue's question of what does an

475
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,840
organizational representation look like

476
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,480
so we'll start in that very top left

477
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,520
cell

478
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,400
and then

479
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,360
shift

480
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,600
the focus towards the structural

481
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,720
components

482
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,480
and then challenge the structural

483
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,919
representation

484
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,000
but stay within the structural domain

485
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,799
and then see if that can result to us

486
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,880
making it back to a non-representational

487
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,600
organizational uh framing

488
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,480
so what is a good organizational what's

489
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,400
something that is

490
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,960
classic vanilla organizational

491
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,559
representation

492
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,679
well

493
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,320
that's something that is well separated

494
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,400
in terms of variables inside and outside

495
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,320
the system so we're not worried about

496
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,240
the structure of the variables inside or

497
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,840
outside just that they are separated

498
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,360
so

499
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,480
computers seem like pretty clear cases

500
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,480
where within a program

501
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,520
you could have variables that by design

502
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,480
are

503
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,640
separated through like an intermediate

504
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,840
variable

505
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,640
or

506
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,120
computers and hardware

507
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,440
like two computer systems could be

508
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,600
totally separated except for an

509
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,760
interface like a usb port

510
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,640
or something but of course this paper

511
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,840
is about that strange loop

512
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,720
when

513
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,039
it's a cognizing agent

514
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,600
an adaptive active inference agent doing

515
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,720
that

516
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,480
representing not necessarily a

517
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,520
mere

518
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,120
active agent

519
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,280
but

520
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,480
should we

521
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,240
use a computational example or

522
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,240
some sort of um enocted human

523
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,520
example

524
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,120
but you got got a good example right

525
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,360
here on the page so how would we how

526
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,640
would we shift

527
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,600
across the y-axis between organizational

528
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,360
representational because i'm assuming

529
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,760
we're going clockwise from to

530
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,000
representational structural

531
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,400
that's not that's not a hard

532
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,720
example to to

533
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,080
make

534
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,880
yes um

535
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,200
yes so um in the

536
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,080
human

537
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,200
case this would be like um so two humans

538
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,159
in a conversation

539
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,360
they are in a conversation

540
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,520
yes

541
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,840
perfect outside of the conversation yes

542
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,640
two humans when two humans are in

543
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,000
conversation

544
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,440
right there is

545
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,559
separation

546
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,760
in terms of their sensory motor

547
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,200
systems

548
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,000
so

549
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,880
we have check the box for organizational

550
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,360
representational

551
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,120
starting in the top left cell

552
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,320
all right now the question would be

553
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,880
is there structural representation

554
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,600
so

555
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,919
that would be like maybe if one person

556
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,520
thought of a sentence and then said it

557
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,039
and then the other person

558
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,960
thought of that sentence too

559
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,720
would that qualify as a structural

560
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,640
representation because

561
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,039
there's a structural resemblance

562
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,159
in the model of the two

563
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,799
conversions

564
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,080
um yeah we could also find out if if

565
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,000
both of us were talking at the same time

566
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,559
and suddenly stopped turn taking that

567
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,400
the structure

568
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,880
of that

569
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,679
model would would now fundamentally

570
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,159
change it's still representational

571
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,480
and two people arguing over top of one

572
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,440
another

573
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,280
to the third party isn't necessarily

574
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,200
something comprehendable

575
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,799
never mind to the two people that are

576
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,918
inside the conversation right

577
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,280
blue

578
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,400
so

579
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,840
when i think about conversation

580
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,159
something comes to mind recently like

581
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,240
like really you need to have like the

582
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,640
order of the language specified like my

583
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,520
son is reading now and he's five um and

584
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,200
and you know he's taking the book like

585
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,960
pop on pop the dr seuss book and he'll

586
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,520
turn it upside down and he'll say dad no

587
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,960
dough and like we'll read it that way

588
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,559
and then he wants to read like every

589
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,799
sentence backwards like from the end to

590
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:07,919
the beginning which i'm like i don't

591
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:08,880
care as long as you're reading because

592
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,720
it gets them practicing reading but it's

593
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,159
it's completely

594
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,039
the context is completely um different

595
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,600
right when you're reading like each word

596
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,039
in the opposite order so like when

597
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,400
you're talking about a structural

598
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,480
representation of a conversation

599
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,480
i think that there needs to be like a

600
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,640
literal representation or at least like

601
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,799
a coarse grained representation of

602
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,799
in what order things are said in order

603
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,799
to glean some kind of meaning but then

604
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,840
are we bleeding into the content related

605
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,480
but like as we're you know that's why i

606
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,320
really feel like like what are these

607
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,400
different maps look like and trying to

608
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,640
maybe elucidate what the representations

609
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,240
are is valuable because i think when you

610
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,159
have organization okay inside outside

611
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,080
like this is this sentence or he said

612
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,159
this and she said that or or whatever

613
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,840
and then you try to put structure on it

614
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,159
like that gives it then content or

615
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,640
context that they can then you know and

616
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,440
so on and so forth

617
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,840
dean

618
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,400
no i i don't have much to add to that

619
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,360
other than i i just don't think that

620
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,960
that this loop that we've we've just

621
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,480
selected this we said there was going to

622
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,640
be certain amount of randomness in the

623
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,039
last live stream and we've chosen this

624
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,840
now let's walk let's walk through it

625
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,640
i don't see it being difficult

626
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,840
to to follow that path and find examples

627
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,159
so we have a super ordinate right now

628
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,039
structurally we want to carry out

629
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,120
this directionality from the

630
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,240
representational side of things to the

631
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,159
non-representational side and and blue

632
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,919
if you're if your kid wants to turn the

633
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,520
book upside down

634
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,400
that's that's actually a feature right

635
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,080
because they're not already stuck in

636
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,880
this

637
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,600
only one way of doing it things so

638
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,918
yeah

639
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,919
let's complete the red

640
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:58,799
loop

641
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,480
and then then the green of the orange

642
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,320
will come into play okay so we started

643
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,159
with two people in conversation that's

644
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,159
organizational separation of cognition

645
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,760
this brings us to

646
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,640
the structural facet which is

647
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,600
where there's a structural resemblance

648
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,279
in the representations of the

649
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,279
conversants

650
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,360
so they're

651
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,240
maybe

652
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,320
it is the case where they're both

653
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,720
thinking about a similar

654
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,039
topology of variables so there's some

655
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,279
structural representation

656
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,279
but now let's

657
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,880
stay within the structural column go

658
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,120
from b to c okay so the two people are

659
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,279
in a conversation it's kind of like a

660
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,320
dance

661
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,799
so what if those two people's

662
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,640
representation

663
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,480
is so different

664
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,559
that it's actually not structurally

665
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,640
resembling so maybe one person is um

666
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,480
the more experienced in the discipline

667
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,240
and the other is less experienced like

668
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,559
one person's super good at fixing motors

669
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,679
the other person is just has no idea

670
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:02,480
so

671
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,000
the representationalist take would be

672
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,440
like well they're both thinking about

673
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,520
the motor but then when we start to see

674
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,320
like

675
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,559
a cognitive asymmetry

676
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,159
all of a sudden

677
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,120
we fall out of structural

678
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,159
representationalist between these two

679
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,600
systems

680
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,000
because their cognitive models don't

681
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,799
necessarily have similar structure

682
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,600
yes danielle

683
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,400
oh wait unmute and then go for it

684
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,720
so um i might be missing something here

685
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,320
but i thought that we

686
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,159
can only start to talk about the

687
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,720
structural dimension here once

688
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,320
in this example the two people in the

689
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,960
conversation are representing the the

690
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,039
same thing and then the question is

691
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,919
how much information or how how does

692
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,000
each of their representations do each of

693
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,440
their representations have to look

694
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,600
similar to one another but like

695
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,360
part of it has to be that they are

696
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,600
representing the same thing is that

697
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,080
a sort of necessary component

698
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,279
if they're not representing the same

699
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,240
thing then we're having a different

700
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,240
conversation

701
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,360
well

702
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,080
that may come to the

703
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,919
functional

704
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,159
um

705
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,480
that might come to the content related

706
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,240
like the novice

707
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,600
and the expert

708
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,919
the representations are both about the

709
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,520
engine

710
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,559
but

711
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,919
they're so structurally different

712
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,919
in their representation of the engine so

713
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,520
that although the content in the

714
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,200
aboutness of the representation is

715
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,279
similar so still qualifying as a

716
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,640
representation

717
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,720
in that sense

718
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,720
there is a structural

719
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,159
non-resemblance such that by that

720
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,039
criteria in that situation we've fallen

721
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,760
out of the representational cell b

722
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,679
into

723
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,440
something non-representational

724
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,960
potentially blue what do you think

725
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,799
so i think like two people in a

726
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,159
conversation

727
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,080
can be trying to represent the same

728
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,559
thing like like yes they both need to be

729
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,559
trying to represent have the same

730
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:11,919
representation like they're trying to

731
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,559
converge on a conversation a meaningful

732
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,279
conversation presumably um but they

733
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,880
don't always converge and then that's

734
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,360
where you get like misunderstandings or

735
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,520
or like you know we both think that we

736
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,799
think the same

737
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,480
we both agree that we're thinking that

738
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,000
we have the same structural

739
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,919
representation but perhaps they're

740
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,200
different and then and then the

741
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,240
communication breaks down

742
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,440
okay

743
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,399
so the the um the structures are so

744
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,440
different

745
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,640
that we're

746
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,120
recognizing it as a continuum from total

747
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,360
overlap of structural resemblance to

748
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,399
total

749
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,640
um non-overlap but it would be important

750
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,360
to specify that null hypothesis

751
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,640
so we've kind of

752
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,039
scooted into c

753
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,240
how do we stay in that space of like the

754
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,000
novice and the expert who have different

755
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
cognitive representations and then use

756
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,399
that to challenge even

757
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,200
organizational

758
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,200
representationalism

759
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,760
blue then

760
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,520
oh dean first and then

761
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,399
go ahead

762
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,559
right i just thought i want to just go

763
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,960
back to the to danielle's point so if

764
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,399
we're if we're structuring a

765
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,799
conversation normally we turn take

766
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,520
but if we're playing in a band

767
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,760
we're all playing at once and then we

768
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,240
stop playing so i think we can start

769
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,559
with structure too it's just deciding

770
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,520
how we want to signal

771
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,679
right so i i don't think it i don't

772
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,080
think there's a necessarily an order

773
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,080
that we have to start with organization

774
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,080
first we can actually start with

775
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,240
structure first as well

776
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,720
yeah and i think a conversation is a

777
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,039
particularly challenging example because

778
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,640
we're representing two things but we're

779
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,760
representing what the other person is

780
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,919
trying to say and then presumably what

781
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,440
the conversation is about is something

782
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,640
else in the world that we could be

783
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,080
representing exactly yeah

784
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,440
blue

785
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,559
so i think we're representing um a

786
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,640
degree of of information sharing and i

787
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,799
think that this is going to like lump

788
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,960
into autopilesis which i i've been

789
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,120
really wanting to to kind of

790
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,240
get into but but when we have um like

791
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,640
i'm my own person and i'm communicating

792
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,720
with danielle from you know 50 000 miles

793
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,840
away we both

794
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,600
feel like we're getting on the same page

795
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,919
when we actually like do get on the same

796
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,559
page like do we form some kind of like

797
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,039
separate cognitive unit like at what

798
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,000
degree of of model overlap is the degree

799
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,200
of information sharing so high that then

800
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,919
we

801
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:44,880
are

802
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,200
worthy of our own markov blanket like

803
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,960
we're sure that we understand that we

804
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,480
are the same unit

805
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,240
right and i think that this idea of

806
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,320
self-assembly and information sharing

807
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,240
and model overlap like i think that

808
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,120
there's

809
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,240
um

810
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,679
an important um path to traverse down

811
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,600
this way because if you don't have full

812
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,840
overlap of the model like you're

813
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,159
or or do you need full overlap to form a

814
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,880
self-assembling system to be you know to

815
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,559
form a higher level it's just an

816
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,200
interesting thought

817
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,880
that's kind of where the c to d

818
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,120
transition takes us

819
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,640
which would be like

820
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,080
so we have

821
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,039
um

822
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,200
the drummer is waiting for this and has

823
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,679
a model resembling this and then the

824
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,840
singer has a totally different structure

825
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,320
and then when we think about the whole

826
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,960
cognitive system it

827
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,840
it doesn't deny what we recognize in a

828
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,279
that there still is like the sensory

829
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,760
motor separation

830
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,320
but we've reached that point

831
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,480
by those

832
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,919
people

833
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,679
or roles being

834
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,840
part of a larger

835
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,000
non-separable extended cognitive system

836
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,440
so almost by recognizing the interaction

837
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,240
so here we focused on the separation

838
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,159
in a and that's what granted us the

839
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,480
representational um

840
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,200
cell but we've returned

841
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,559
to

842
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,000
seeing that

843
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,960
partial information encapsulation

844
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,679
within some type of broader structure

845
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,320
where none of the entities have like the

846
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,039
band level representation

847
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,640
so hopefully other people can think of

848
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,279
other like abcd examples

849
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,240
but

850
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,480
when we were at b

851
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,640
we kind of started branching off into

852
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,799
like

853
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,360
talking about the content

854
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,080
related things the aboutness

855
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,080
so here it's like there it two people do

856
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,760
have a structural

857
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,240
resemblance in their internal model

858
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,080
and it's about

859
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,960
the same thing but then what if one

860
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,559
person

861
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,480
sees the aboutness in such a different

862
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,440
way

863
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,519
that again we fall out of the

864
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,519
content-related

865
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,440
representation

866
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,799
and then how would we move from there

867
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,799
back to c

868
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,320
where all of a sudden the cognitive

869
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,640
models in a sense don't have structural

870
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,399
representations

871
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:19,919
uh resemblance

872
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,399
because

873
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,640
they're

874
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,919
about different things now

875
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,360
danielle

876
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,320
so would this be like in the case of

877
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,279
two two things that are so analogous

878
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,799
that they share a lot of structural

879
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,080
similarities and thinking of like

880
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,080
dendrite gentner's work that

881
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,039
um

882
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,799
you can actually draw lines between the

883
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,840
individual aspects of of the concepts

884
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,200
but they could be about totally

885
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,360
different things um but two people

886
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,080
talking about these things can can form

887
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,840
some sort of structural similarity in

888
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,080
their representations and it's just like

889
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,840
an entry point into being able to think

890
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,880
about all other things um but the

891
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,560
aboutness really has nothing to do with

892
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,639
it

893
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,239
um

894
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,960
dean then i might want to ask me on that

895
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,320
i don't know i don't know if this

896
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,599
answers that danielle but

897
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:21,040
from my

898
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,040
space i'm thinking

899
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,879
the difference between say a distracted

900
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,719
driver who's looking down at their phone

901
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,719
between the seats and somebody's got

902
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,560
that information and heads up display on

903
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,480
their windshield

904
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,719
right so so content twice but

905
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,760
structurally presented one as a one as a

906
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,320
distracted state and one as a contiguous

907
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,280
state

908
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,719
so i don't know if that answers your

909
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,159
point but i think

910
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,040
we could

911
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,960
we know the difference right

912
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,879
in terms of what where the where the

913
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,280
content is structured and how we're

914
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,320
trying to

915
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,839
contextualize

916
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:58,440
each each matter so

917
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,640
again staying at this sort of

918
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,640
educational

919
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,480
setting

920
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,440
what

921
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,720
is it important to see a transference

922
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:17,319
or a new emergence of

923
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,880
is it that the

924
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,160
structural model of the learner

925
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,359
is moving into more resemblance

926
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,480
with

927
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,240
the teacher

928
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,520
is it that the aboutness of the learner

929
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,720
is moving towards the same aboutness of

930
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,480
the teacher

931
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,119
um or let's just remind about what the

932
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,920
functional is

933
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,880
supporting vicarious use before or in

934
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,280
the absence of external events

935
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,400
so does

936
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,040
the teaching

937
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,240
[Music]

938
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,560
conversation

939
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,480
um will it be

940
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,400
a functional representation

941
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,359
when

942
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,680
vicariously without the teacher the

943
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,680
student can

944
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,800
carry out what the teacher could do

945
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,160
which might be

946
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,280
having aboutness or not

947
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,440
it might be

948
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,359
with a structural cognitive resemblance

949
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:14,560
or not

950
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,240
it might involve

951
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,520
total

952
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,920
informational isolation

953
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,599
putting us squarely in a or it might

954
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:22,800
involve some

955
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,079
type of

956
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,680
challenging of that

957
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,319
in d

958
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:32,640
the reason why there's not going to be i

959
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,960
think a precise answer because

960
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,800
as the paper

961
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,320
lays out

962
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,720
even for the same scenario people do

963
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,400
have different perspectives so it's not

964
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,760
like we're trying to take a scenario

965
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,560
then classify it into well that one's

966
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,480
like an a b e g

967
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,880
or an a c e h like

968
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,040
that

969
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,560
is probably not

970
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,880
what one of the outcomes could be

971
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,320
but these are all

972
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,000
perspectives that we could take on a

973
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,440
given

974
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,520
scenario um

975
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,440
and they do reveal interesting things

976
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,040
about

977
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,160
the systems of studies

978
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,040
anything else to add on this sort of

979
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,400
like looping around the cells or should

980
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,320
we

981
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,640
push on

982
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,560
push

983
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,880
push

984
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,920
okay blue what were you thinking here

985
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,560
i was just taking notes uh and so like

986
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,599
if

987
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,520
so maybe we should talk about content

988
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,720
related and

989
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,200
functional so i was just taking notes on

990
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,079
um

991
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,520
you know what these are organizational

992
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,680
like how are the representations

993
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,440
and i was trying to draw a picture so if

994
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,079
you i will draw my picture if um

995
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,000
if you will talk about maybe functional

996
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,200
representation like what does a

997
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,599
functional representation look like or

998
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,520
content related what is it what's inside

999
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,280
of those and then i will draw my picture

1000
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,119
and then you can show it all right

1001
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,640
sure so the content related

1002
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,839
is

1003
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,599
whether the generative models need to

1004
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,520
explicitly model

1005
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,920
the ways external states produce

1006
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,800
sensations

1007
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,359
environmental models or the ways actions

1008
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,560
produce sensations

1009
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,079
is it really important that internal

1010
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,839
states resemble

1011
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,960
external states or is it sufficient

1012
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,560
that they afford

1013
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,160
accurate action control

1014
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,680
so

1015
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,880
um

1016
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,560
let's just say there's a spotlight

1017
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,400
that's shining

1018
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,079
photons onto the eye

1019
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,560
the content of the cognitive

1020
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,340
representation

1021
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,880
[Music]

1022
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,800
would put us more

1023
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,359
um we'd be more in the representational

1024
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:02,400
camp

1025
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,400
if the cognitive model were truly

1026
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,160
explicitly modeling

1027
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,079
the ways in which

1028
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,240
the photons hit

1029
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,799
the retina

1030
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,839
maybe

1031
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,440
but this or is a bit challenging because

1032
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,160
the ways actions produce sensations that

1033
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,920
could be a model of like well if i blink

1034
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,240
it becomes darker and when i open my

1035
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,000
eyes it's lighter

1036
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,640
but that's a totally disjoint question

1037
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,520
from understanding how a spotlight works

1038
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,839
but those two scenarios of the

1039
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,920
spotlight's cognitive

1040
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,920
explicit modeling the environmental

1041
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,359
model

1042
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:48,880
or

1043
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,200
the sensory motor model of blinking and

1044
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,440
it becoming darker those are both

1045
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,839
content

1046
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,280
related and

1047
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,599
dean

1048
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,440
well i don't know if this helps or not

1049
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,079
but um

1050
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,599
one of the things that i used to bring

1051
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,400
up around this this idea

1052
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,319
was the

1053
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:14,160
was the the puzzle concept i.e

1054
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,800
so you got a box and it says a thousand

1055
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,079
piece puzzle

1056
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:18,960
and

1057
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,800
when you open up the box

1058
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,920
uh is that representational or is it not

1059
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,760
representational until you've figured

1060
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,079
out whether all thousand pieces have now

1061
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,359
been

1062
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,599
duly assembled right

1063
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,040
so from a from a content perspective do

1064
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,160
you have

1065
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,599
what you need

1066
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,119
in order to be able to tell the

1067
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,880
difference between something which is

1068
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,640
representative and that which is not

1069
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,400
so again i don't know if that's helpful

1070
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,880
in terms of sort of trying to see a

1071
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,680
difference between that say in structure

1072
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,680
like where it's placed

1073
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,359
relative to the context or not but that

1074
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,000
was the way i tried to

1075
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,640
surface it

1076
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,040
one

1077
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,560
evolution or

1078
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,079
handshake

1079
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,160
that hinges on that ore

1080
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,680
of the environmental models and the

1081
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,560
sensory motor models they do unpack a

1082
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,920
little bit

1083
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,800
so one approach consists in starting

1084
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,040
from the sensory motor models

1085
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,960
so that would be when i blink

1086
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,800
it becomes darker when my eyes are open

1087
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,079
it's lighter

1088
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:28,000
but progressively extends them to

1089
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,160
incorporate extra variables that

1090
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,520
describe external causes of sensation

1091
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,280
so um

1092
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,079
like

1093
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,760
if there's um

1094
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,079
a light on one side but not on the other

1095
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,200
side

1096
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,800
then it can be the case that that

1097
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,160
blinking is

1098
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,640
true no matter how you're turned

1099
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,960
but then that could be enriched or

1100
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,640
augmented with a model of

1101
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,480
parameters that describes external

1102
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,480
causes of sensation like there's a light

1103
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,920
over there

1104
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,319
and not over there and so actually that

1105
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,680
little loop that we just took

1106
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,440
was

1107
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,560
from the sensory motor b

1108
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,920
the sensory motor model in b

1109
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,839
moving to a representational model

1110
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:16,400
of

1111
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,480
uh the content like there's a light over

1112
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,800
there

1113
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,520
and then

1114
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,359
does that well at least the that was the

1115
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:26,720
bte

1116
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,920
move

1117
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,400
but then maybe that could do

1118
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,720
something else so maybe blue will

1119
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,720
clarify there but let's go back to just

1120
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,640
review functional

1121
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,839
like

1122
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:39,680
what is the functional and

1123
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,640
it's good to revisit these in the zero

1124
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,000
one 2

1125
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,160
3 4 5 because it's the contribution of

1126
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,280
the paper

1127
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,000
and maybe there are other

1128
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,920
facets other columns to add and there's

1129
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,200
just a lot of

1130
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,359
complexity even as this is

1131
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:59,400
so the functional one

1132
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,800
is about supporting vicarious use before

1133
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,280
or the in the absence of external events

1134
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,200
so in that story with the lights and the

1135
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,040
blinking

1136
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,760
it only ha that model only has to be

1137
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,119
instantiated

1138
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,000
while the in that room with the photons

1139
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,599
hitting the eye and the blinking

1140
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,000
happening

1141
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,400
however

1142
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,680
we can imagine a situation

1143
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,720
that's vicariously detached

1144
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,359
or before that setting like what would

1145
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,119
happen if there were a light over here

1146
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:34,560
and a light over here and it was the

1147
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,078
case that blinking made it darker

1148
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,920
and this is where they trace back to

1149
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,280
piaget

1150
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,839
that representations should vicariously

1151
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,680
stand for

1152
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,560
something external in their absence and

1153
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,599
afford vicarious operations

1154
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,760
so there's a light over on the left side

1155
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,599
you reach over and you unscrew it

1156
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:07,400
what is in your hands

1157
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,160
now that is

1158
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,399
um

1159
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,480
seeming to be in the functional

1160
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,440
facet because we're talking about

1161
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,319
the role the representation is playing

1162
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:25,440
and the fact that it is standing for

1163
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,880
something external in the absence

1164
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,319
there's no physical light that we're

1165
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:29,839
talking about it's not like we're

1166
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:31,440
unscrewing it and then verifying that

1167
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,240
it's in our hand

1168
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,280
who's for and against

1169
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,599
that

1170
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,280
what functional roles do internal models

1171
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,960
play during free energy minimization

1172
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,960
and does minimization require the

1173
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,440
internal manipulation of variables

1174
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,440
in ways that resemble vicarious

1175
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,319
operations in the classical piaget

1176
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,520
account of representation

1177
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,960
yes blue

1178
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,160
so

1179
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,000
this might be like i don't know maybe

1180
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,760
it's the easiest and also like the

1181
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,440
hardest to

1182
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,240
get

1183
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,000
a grip on

1184
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,280
so i think about um

1185
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,359
like do we so if we have a

1186
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,520
representation of internal variables

1187
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,040
that like are functional like a

1188
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,119
functional representation of

1189
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:37,280
in a functional internal representation

1190
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,480
is this like doing um

1191
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,079
like you manipulate the variables

1192
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:44,319
internally and then manipulate them

1193
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,400
externally like you plan to reach for

1194
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,640
the cup to take a drink of water

1195
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,920
and then you reach for the cup to take a

1196
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,520
drink of water but you have to have like

1197
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,960
the internal execution prior to or maybe

1198
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,200
simultaneous with the external execution

1199
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,280
um is that like

1200
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,480
functional representation like you plan

1201
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,880
the action and do the action

1202
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,640
maybe maybe separate or maybe together

1203
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,319
is that what functional representation

1204
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:14,160
looks like

1205
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,079
let's go with a reaching for the cup

1206
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:19,119
because as danielle noted like

1207
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:20,480
conversation

1208
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,280
improvised spontaneous conversation

1209
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,920
of reflexive entities is one of the

1210
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,200
hardest

1211
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,800
cases

1212
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,800
but it's the one that we have so that's

1213
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,680
awesome

1214
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,400
but we're going to be talking about a

1215
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,960
adaptive active inference agent reaching

1216
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,680
for a mere active inference agent

1217
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,040
so in the sims other paper we discussed

1218
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,560
now we're talking about the case of

1219
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,240
unidirectional

1220
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,720
integration rather than the multi-scale

1221
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,440
reciprocal integration so the person is

1222
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,599
separated from the cup

1223
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:55,599
there's a separation of the cognitive

1224
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:59,440
model of the agent from the cup

1225
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,760
the structural side if the internal

1226
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,680
model is

1227
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,040
cup-like

1228
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,680
or it features a cup variable touching a

1229
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,480
table variable and then another edge

1230
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,560
that is engaged of the hand touching the

1231
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,400
cup for example that might be a

1232
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,160
structural similarity

1233
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,040
but i think that's part of the debate is

1234
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,160
how could there be a structural

1235
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,760
similarity when

1236
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,000
it's not a cup in your brain which we

1237
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,839
kind of talked about last time like how

1238
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:26,640
could you have something that

1239
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,040
structurally resembles a car

1240
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,079
if

1241
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,960
it's your brain and body

1242
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,880
the contents related encoding

1243
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,800
environmental contingencies or sensory

1244
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,720
motor contingencies

1245
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,280
so it could be the case that a certain

1246
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,359
sensory motor action will result in

1247
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,520
picking up and grasping the cup whereas

1248
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,400
another sensory motor action

1249
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,240
is going to result in the shattering of

1250
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,400
the cup and that could be analyzed in

1251
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,680
terms of correctness

1252
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,319
the functional representational question

1253
00:47:58,319 --> 00:47:59,760
would be like

1254
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,240
the vicarious detachment

1255
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,079
of the sensory motor loop from the

1256
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:05,359
cognition

1257
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:07,680
so then it would be like

1258
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,720
if you were to pick up that cup

1259
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,599
then

1260
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,440
you dumped it what would happen and then

1261
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,960
someone says like well water would fall

1262
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,000
out

1263
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,760
so in that case

1264
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,040
it is like there's a functional

1265
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,960
representation

1266
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,400
whether or not

1267
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,280
it resembles the structure of the cup

1268
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,280
there's a functional representation

1269
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,800
because

1270
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,160
that

1271
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,119
idea of grasping the cup it's able to be

1272
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,640
operated on

1273
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,319
internally

1274
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:38,640
vicariously in the absence of direct

1275
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,079
stimuli related to the cup

1276
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,400
dean

1277
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,240
do you mind if i just read right from

1278
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,920
the paper for a second because i think

1279
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,240
it helps in terms of this the difference

1280
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,880
between the sort of the auto automatic

1281
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,119
automotive i don't know

1282
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:56,960
automaticity

1283
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,599
and reflective aspects of this action

1284
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:00,480
okay

1285
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,160
one important implication falling out

1286
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,920
falling out of this diagnosis is that

1287
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,319
when considering functional rural

1288
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:07,440
aspects

1289
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,079
it's often how the details of our chosen

1290
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:13,280
process theories are fleshed out

1291
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,760
and contextualized by the kinds of

1292
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,000
cognitive phenomena that we are

1293
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,359
attempting

1294
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,359
to account for

1295
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,680
for for that skew

1296
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,480
or that for that skew our interpretation

1297
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,200
of fep in one direction or another for

1298
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,280
example one may consider that there are

1299
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,359
core aspects of fep

1300
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,359
such as the possession of a markov

1301
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:37,680
blanket and more ancillary aspects and i

1302
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,640
think ancillary is the key here such as

1303
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,319
the possibility

1304
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:43,760
but not the

1305
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,319
necessity to engage in counter factual

1306
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:47,599
inference

1307
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,400
which is only required for planning

1308
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,480
and it is only the latter more ancillary

1309
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,160
aspects that call for

1310
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,559
a representational interpretation under

1311
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:59,040
a given process theory this would imply

1312
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,359
that when using functional rule as a

1313
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:03,280
sole criterion for representational

1314
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,480
processes

1315
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,599
only some fbp agents namely those

1316
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:09,520
that can engage in counter factual forms

1317
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,839
of inference would meet the criteria for

1318
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,440
representation

1319
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,680
it is only this subset of fep agents

1320
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,920
that would be equated to full-fledged

1321
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,559
predictive processing agents so there is

1322
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,520
an automaticity part to this

1323
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,520
where it's really not a markov blanket

1324
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,640
you just do it almost subconsciously and

1325
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,160
that's again the authors are trying to

1326
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,040
point this out yes if we fail

1327
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,880
i drop the cup and now i reflect on that

1328
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,839
that's the representational piece

1329
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:41,280
prior to that

1330
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,839
i was just going through the motions i

1331
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,079
didn't need a set of instructions

1332
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:48,800
telling me to reach out for the cup

1333
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,319
so that's just in the author's words

1334
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:54,640
thanks a lot for clarifying that it's

1335
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,079
like

1336
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:58,800
yes if one is reflexively

1337
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,319
uh grasping at it or accidentally

1338
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:04,559
then

1339
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,960
it then grasping the cup like if you're

1340
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,559
if you're groping around in a dark room

1341
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:14,720
and then you happen to grasp the cup

1342
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,240
it doesn't have to be representational

1343
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,280
because

1344
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,520
there isn't a counter factual

1345
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,839
so

1346
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,920
it and that's very interesting how like

1347
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,480
they say that it is ancillary

1348
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,480
so that's kind of like secondary or um

1349
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:35,599
not

1350
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:37,359
essential to it

1351
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:38,880
because we can imagine an active

1352
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,599
inference entity that's taking in

1353
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,599
sensory observations updating its

1354
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:45,680
generative model engaging in policy

1355
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,079
selection and then resulting in some

1356
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:49,200
action

1357
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,280
output impacting the niche and the cycle

1358
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,200
begins again

1359
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,359
that can be just like a single layer

1360
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:57,440
model that doesn't engage in counter

1361
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,760
factuals

1362
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,040
but

1363
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,440
they raise that notion

1364
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,880
that it's only

1365
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,280
the counterfactuals

1366
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,040
in cognition

1367
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:13,280
that actually like give us the space

1368
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,839
to have a functional representation

1369
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:18,079
it's like if the shell just represents

1370
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:19,599
the shell

1371
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:21,359
can't be anything else

1372
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:23,040
but then there's another kind of entity

1373
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,880
who can see the shell

1374
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:25,599
as

1375
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:27,040
financial

1376
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,800
or can see it in a different way and

1377
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,200
then it's those counterfactuals that

1378
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,559
enable

1379
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,480
the shell to play a functional

1380
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,720
representational role

1381
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,399
in that it stands for something else

1382
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,960
blue what is this

1383
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,599
imagery on the bottom

1384
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:48,640
so i just was like trying to really

1385
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,040
look at or like try to visualize what

1386
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,280
would um these different like

1387
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,040
representations really look like right

1388
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,359
so if we take like the idea of

1389
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:59,920
two a person and a cup even right okay

1390
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,760
so on the first one right we have

1391
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,559
organizational so like i am a thirsty

1392
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:05,760
body

1393
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,920
i'm contained within me there is the cup

1394
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,760
that contains water over there like i

1395
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,280
know my boundary i know the boundary of

1396
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,680
the cup and the representation looks

1397
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:14,800
like this

1398
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,760
um and then a structural representation

1399
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,280
um

1400
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,400
is just

1401
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,280
me

1402
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,800
and the

1403
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,839
cup and the my relationship between me

1404
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:28,079
and the cup right like so do i have to

1405
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,640
also have like like so so my real

1406
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,960
question here is

1407
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,920
do these perhaps build on one another so

1408
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,800
so here you have the structural and um

1409
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,480
then the next one would be content

1410
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,440
related do i also have to have this

1411
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,160
connecting line in the content related

1412
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,400
uh is that required like do i have to

1413
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,480
have an idea of the structure to

1414
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,400
understand the content

1415
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,599
and then um in the functional like do

1416
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,079
you need to know the content

1417
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:01,359
and the structure and the organizational

1418
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:03,599
to have to have an understanding of the

1419
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:05,359
function right do i need to know like

1420
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:07,520
for the content related like i know that

1421
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,280
there's water in the cup right i assume

1422
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,960
that there's water in the cup to find

1423
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,559
out i have to realize that there's an

1424
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:14,559
inside of me and outside of me and

1425
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:16,559
inside of the cup and outside of the cup

1426
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,079
i have to realize my relationship

1427
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:19,839
between me and the cup and then to find

1428
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,760
out the content like i have to go

1429
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,440
sample the cup like to see what's inside

1430
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,480
of it and i have to know what's inside

1431
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,720
of me and then the function like like

1432
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,800
can i only like i wonder if there's

1433
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,640
water in that cup like and then if i go

1434
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,400
to drink it and there's like whiskey in

1435
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,599
it or something like i'm not gonna

1436
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:36,480
understand the function until i have all

1437
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,240
those things layered on top of each

1438
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,720
other and so that's kind of really my

1439
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,799
question um here in daniel's drawing on

1440
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:45,040
my drawings

1441
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,799
but but um

1442
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:48,559
really like i just wonder if there's

1443
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:49,520
levels

1444
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,760
of increasing complexity between

1445
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:52,640
these

1446
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,200
different kinds of representations or if

1447
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,520
it's just merely the structure the

1448
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,960
organizational

1449
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,559
and i don't need these boundaries

1450
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:03,040
between self and cup

1451
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,359
in these other models maybe it's just

1452
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:07,359
the line without the circles in the

1453
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:10,319
structural or or the no external circles

1454
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:11,760
and content related so i just want to

1455
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,440
know like what you guys maybe think of

1456
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,920
that if there is a layering here because

1457
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,680
i was kind of layering them up but i

1458
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,680
don't know if that's really the right

1459
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,079
mental representation

1460
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:23,839
thanks blue

1461
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:26,078
dean

1462
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,079
um

1463
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:29,760
i'm not muted good

1464
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,920
i think that i think there's two parts

1465
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,480
to this one is that we

1466
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,559
are able to differentiate which is what

1467
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:38,960
the table allows for and i think that

1468
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,720
the second part is

1469
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,200
the the arrow the curved arrow that

1470
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,839
daniel drew which essentially

1471
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:47,599
represents

1472
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:51,040
boundary crossing number one

1473
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:51,839
so

1474
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:53,200
the difference between something that's

1475
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,520
static and something that is

1476
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,880
translatable

1477
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,720
and then the second part of it i think

1478
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,319
without going back down the rabbit hole

1479
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:03,280
that we almost fell into in in the point

1480
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,119
one of this when we started talking

1481
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,920
about free will and can and will and the

1482
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,040
orthogonal piece of that i think

1483
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:11,920
what it

1484
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,440
what it speaks to

1485
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,559
maybe

1486
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:18,880
is that it's not a question of free or

1487
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,160
or encapsulated it's it's a degree of

1488
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,160
dependency question when you when you

1489
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,119
throw that curved line on

1490
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:28,319
on this

1491
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:30,559
sort of tiled representation and start

1492
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:33,599
moving across a boundary so i don't want

1493
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,559
to call it degrees of dependency will up

1494
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,040
to a point of passing through zero but

1495
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,319
i'd like to

1496
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:42,079
because i think there is an aspect of

1497
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:45,200
that and that's why i think it's kind of

1498
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,440
it's kind of crazy if we just focus on

1499
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,839
the static things instead of the moving

1500
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,960
around the moving through four squares

1501
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,839
is what i really think gives our minds a

1502
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:58,559
good workout

1503
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:02,559
yep so here's another little um workout

1504
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:03,280
so

1505
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,520
blue had two circles

1506
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,880
in relationship

1507
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,480
so here

1508
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,839
the circle is going to reflect an

1509
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:13,040
adaptive active inference agent

1510
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,119
or the full-fledged predictive

1511
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:17,040
processing agent one that can engage in

1512
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,520
counterfactuals so the top is two

1513
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,680
adaptive entities in relationship and

1514
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,319
the triangle is going to reflect a mere

1515
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:26,960
active inference entity like a cup or

1516
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,799
just something that doesn't engage in

1517
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:30,400
counterfactuals

1518
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,839
so organizational is the separation of

1519
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:36,079
the systems so that's very similar

1520
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:37,839
because it's just describing there being

1521
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:42,079
a markov blanket separating the systems

1522
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:44,079
the structural representation is having

1523
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:46,079
vehicles that are structurally similar

1524
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:49,280
so it's simple er in the

1525
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,040
lower case

1526
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,880
triangle out there in the world

1527
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,640
is there a structural resemblance that

1528
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,880
would be very representational whereas

1529
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,680
if they were um cognitively imagining

1530
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,040
something different than a triangle that

1531
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,960
would have less resemblance

1532
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,280
but that gets challenging

1533
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,160
with

1534
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,920
adaptive adaptive because

1535
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,839
we're modeling ourselves modeling each

1536
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,359
other blah blah blah

1537
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:15,520
so here's them modeling the conversation

1538
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,480
and that's where they're sort of like

1539
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,559
very complex dynamics

1540
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:22,319
which is how can we have a structural

1541
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:23,920
similarity about a conversation with

1542
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,760
another person but

1543
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,079
um it's simpler in the adaptive mirror

1544
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:29,680
case

1545
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,599
the content related representations

1546
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:34,079
encode environmental contingencies or

1547
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,000
sensory motor contingencies so like in

1548
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,480
this case the triangle it is the case

1549
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,520
that it can

1550
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,640
rotate

1551
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,000
clockwise

1552
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,119
and so

1553
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,119
this entity

1554
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,720
does have a good content related

1555
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,160
representation

1556
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:52,559
if it can actually turn the dial to that

1557
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:53,760
way

1558
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,680
um and again that's a little bit more

1559
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,920
complex in the reciprocal

1560
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:58,720
case

1561
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,680
but in the unidirectional case

1562
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,559
um

1563
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:05,119
this red arrow is a content related

1564
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:07,359
representation of the actual motion in

1565
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:08,400
the world

1566
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,319
and then this last case is the

1567
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:12,000
functional representation

1568
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,480
and here it still is um

1569
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,079
it could be more

1570
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:17,280
structural

1571
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,160
so like more about the actual

1572
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,920
structure of the cognitive model or it

1573
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:24,319
could be more about the encoding of the

1574
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:25,839
contingencies

1575
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:28,640
but the key piece is this isolation

1576
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,200
which isn't a markovian isolation this

1577
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,040
is actually the true vicarious

1578
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,720
separation of

1579
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,640
so here the person or the entity is able

1580
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,160
to engage in

1581
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,119
either

1582
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:40,240
structural

1583
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,240
pondering of the triangle

1584
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,119
or

1585
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:46,079
functional pondering of a triangle in

1586
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:48,559
the absence of seeing the triangle or

1587
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:50,799
grasping the triangle

1588
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:53,599
and again though that's a little bit

1589
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:54,720
um

1590
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,960
complex when you have multiple

1591
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,079
counterfactual cognizers

1592
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:02,160
asking each other questions

1593
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,920
i just added a counter factual to you

1594
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,440
yeah exactly the red one is um

1595
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,359
then there's the blue one it could go a

1596
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:13,599
different way

1597
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:15,680
and then this is this is how we know

1598
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,920
that it's a true

1599
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,680
cognizer and a true functional

1600
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,440
representation yes great call thanks a

1601
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,960
lot blue because it has to do with a

1602
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,960
vicarious nature

1603
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,960
with not directly seeing it

1604
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:30,480
but it also has to do with

1605
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,520
that

1606
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,200
representation whether more structural

1607
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:36,000
triangular or more functional red arrow

1608
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,599
could be different so there's them

1609
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:39,440
having a counter factual

1610
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:39,720
um

1611
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,440
[Music]

1612
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,319
action contingency and here they're also

1613
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:45,440
imagining

1614
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,359
a counterfactual

1615
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:50,880
structural position

1616
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,920
okay i'm gonna go to a question from

1617
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,400
steven in the chat

1618
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,240
steven asked

1619
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,559
how do we resolve the use of a term

1620
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:03,440
functional as used in correlational

1621
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:04,640
dynamics

1622
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,400
so that's referring to some of our

1623
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,480
earlier discussions on like

1624
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,960
functional and effective connectivity in

1625
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,799
neuroimaging

1626
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:15,440
and the term functional in used

1627
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,839
uh and the term functional in terms of

1628
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:20,559
having cognitive counter factuals so how

1629
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:21,440
is

1630
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,839
the

1631
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:25,680
functional here

1632
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,520
related to

1633
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:30,240
effective and functional connectivity in

1634
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,319
neuroimaging

1635
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:36,200
and time series statistics

1636
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,200
i'll give a first thought

1637
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,799
it's not that it can't be linked or

1638
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:44,880
connected but they are different name

1639
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,839
spaces and they're totally different

1640
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:50,480
the functional connectivity in the time

1641
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:51,680
series

1642
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,359
is um

1643
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:55,520
about how changes in one variable

1644
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,599
through time influence another variable

1645
01:01:57,599 --> 01:01:59,599
through time or are associated with

1646
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:01,920
changes in the other one through time so

1647
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,920
it's not a mechanistic causal

1648
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,880
relationship per se but it's just that

1649
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,200
changes in one variable

1650
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,440
have an edge reflecting how changes in

1651
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,160
some other variable change

1652
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:17,599
that does not engage either of

1653
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,920
the pieces that we're highlighting here

1654
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:23,119
which is the vicarious or standing for

1655
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:24,319
nature

1656
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:27,359
nor the counterfactual nature

1657
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:29,839
so it is a different

1658
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:32,160
use of the term functional

1659
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,720
functional is an overloaded word

1660
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,960
and so yeah it's not that you couldn't

1661
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,240
have a paper

1662
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,160
that was looking at functional

1663
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,839
representation

1664
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:43,760
and using neuroimaging

1665
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:44,880
and using

1666
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,720
functional and effective connectivity of

1667
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:49,119
brain regions while

1668
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:51,200
individuals were engaged in functional

1669
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,720
representation

1670
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,119
but that would a little bit be like the

1671
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:57,760
star was the star of the movie it's just

1672
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:01,440
using a word in multiple senses

1673
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:02,960
in a way that

1674
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,400
may

1675
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,599
give some

1676
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:07,839
ambiguity to those who don't parse out

1677
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:11,680
the different senses extremely clearly

1678
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:14,079
is that fair to say or does anyone

1679
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:17,640
have a different thought

1680
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:20,480
functional can also mean

1681
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,319
teleological

1682
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:23,760
like the function of something

1683
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,400
essentially so there's many uses of

1684
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,799
function and i think it's um interesting

1685
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:30,799
that it has come up in these different

1686
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:33,520
spaces blue

1687
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,200
so i do agree that like they're they're

1688
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,280
disconnected but but i

1689
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,920
am able to perhaps see a relationship in

1690
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:45,680
like functional connectivity and also in

1691
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:48,559
counter factuals like so when things are

1692
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:51,359
functionally connected

1693
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:54,240
like one drives the other right

1694
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,039
um

1695
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:56,559
and then the counter factual is like

1696
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:58,079
when things are not functionally

1697
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:00,240
connected there's no

1698
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,799
there's no like you know corresponding

1699
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:04,799
correlation right

1700
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,559
so so

1701
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:07,920
in the

1702
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,839
exploration of functional connectivity

1703
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:11,920
you have to have all of the data points

1704
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:15,119
like over a time series so you have to

1705
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:15,920
um

1706
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,839
like you understand functional

1707
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:20,960
connectivity through the exploration of

1708
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,400
counter factuals

1709
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,119
does that make sense

1710
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,880
okay

1711
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,559
how about this functional connectivity

1712
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:29,680
the term

1713
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,839
it is a functional representation that

1714
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:33,920
cognitive scientists use

1715
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:34,960
because

1716
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,880
it could be otherwise

1717
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,160
they're engaging and they're saying

1718
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,240
region a and b have functional

1719
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:41,920
connectivity because i did the time

1720
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,240
series statistics in spm

1721
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:46,559
and we got this value

1722
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:48,559
and so that functional connectivity

1723
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:49,920
value

1724
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,839
is able to be

1725
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:54,480
used in subsequent internal cognitive

1726
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,240
representations

1727
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,799
it stands for something

1728
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:00,160
and it can be engaged with in a

1729
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,680
counter-factual way like what if it

1730
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,280
would have been stronger

1731
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,960
then what would our conclusion have been

1732
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,000
or what if it would have been weaker

1733
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,599
what would it have been um

1734
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:11,520
and then stephen wrote um these

1735
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,119
definitions these are definitions and

1736
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:15,520
ways to name could be where the ontology

1737
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,160
working group could have a future role

1738
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,440
yes

1739
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:22,400
ontology development in active inference

1740
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,640
and

1741
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:25,680
how

1742
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,920
will we even make the decisions of what

1743
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,799
terms to use in what senses

1744
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:33,839
disambiguate the uses and the different

1745
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:36,480
corpuses that we are looking at

1746
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:37,359
so

1747
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:38,400
pretty

1748
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,960
interesting this graphic actually i hope

1749
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,760
any of the authors or anyone who is like

1750
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,920
interested in this topic

1751
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:49,119
what do you think about these doodles

1752
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:52,240
do you agree disagree

1753
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:54,400
let's go to blue's question about

1754
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,880
autopoiesis what

1755
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,960
is like interesting or

1756
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,440
not about

1757
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:04,480
just really where it comes in and i

1758
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,000
think we kind of brought it up earlier

1759
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,400
in our um

1760
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,920
in the fairing of a model like like so

1761
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,400
is sharing of

1762
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,640
a generative model

1763
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:20,000
necessary for self-assembly or even the

1764
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,680
attempt to share

1765
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,920
a generative model it is that not a

1766
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:27,839
necessary component of auto cohesis

1767
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:29,920
and at what level like organizationally

1768
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,680
structurally content related

1769
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:34,400
functionally like at all the levels

1770
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,960
um i just wonder like how these things

1771
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,480
are related and when we were talking

1772
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,079
earlier about having a conversation and

1773
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:42,079
trying to make your models align with

1774
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:45,599
one another through information sharing

1775
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:47,760
and like we saw with um the

1776
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,079
computational boundary of itself about

1777
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:52,559
self-assembly and autopoiesis uh via

1778
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:54,720
mike levin um just about the

1779
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,880
informational sharing between

1780
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:00,000
subunits leads to the formation of a

1781
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,920
larger cognitive unit

1782
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,760
and so um

1783
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,880
i was just wondering about

1784
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,280
model relationships and forming a larger

1785
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,559
cognitive unit like we're talking about

1786
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:12,160
the conversation and then we form with

1787
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,559
complete overlap of yes we get it we

1788
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,880
grok we're there and then we form a

1789
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:19,200
larger cognitive unit

1790
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,760
and is that on all aspects is it just

1791
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,440
related to content structure

1792
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,839
organization or function or all of the

1793
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:26,960
above

1794
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,799
just what anybody thinks about that

1795
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:32,880
all right

1796
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:33,839
so

1797
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:35,680
and we saw this actually in matt sims

1798
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,400
earlier paper the biological symbiosis

1799
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,559
right

1800
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:43,440
yes

1801
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,359
the autopoetic system is capable of

1802
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:47,520
producing and maintaining itself by

1803
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:50,160
creating its own parts so it's kind of

1804
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:53,119
like the ship of theseus plus crew

1805
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:56,720
they're able to be modifying and

1806
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,400
reconstructing

1807
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:02,799
the material basis of the system

1808
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,400
on one hand that maintains an

1809
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,960
organizational separation of like the

1810
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:12,319
cell and the surrounding in terms of the

1811
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:14,000
realist interpretation of a markov

1812
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,399
blanket

1813
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,640
at the same time

1814
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:21,198
the autopoetic process

1815
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:23,439
does not need to have

1816
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:24,479
well

1817
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:26,238
it involves

1818
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:28,880
ingressing and outgressing material

1819
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,238
so that does

1820
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:32,479
blur

1821
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:34,319
the boundary

1822
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:36,399
and structurally

1823
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:38,080
it doesn't need to be the case that the

1824
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,719
autopoetic process of the cell

1825
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:42,799
has like a blueprint or a structural

1826
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:46,399
resemblance of the cell it could just be

1827
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:48,560
subunits that

1828
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,560
are non-representational

1829
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:53,120
they cannot engage

1830
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:53,439
um

1831
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:55,040
[Music]

1832
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,399
it doesn't even make sense to ask

1833
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:57,520
whether

1834
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:58,719
the

1835
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:00,319
cognitive model

1836
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:02,158
has structural similarity with the

1837
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:04,080
target

1838
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:06,319
because it's a non-cognitive entity and

1839
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:07,920
similarly

1840
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:11,440
on the functional side

1841
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:14,799
the enzymes can't engage in

1842
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:16,479
counterfactuals

1843
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:19,120
that you know synthesize the lipids and

1844
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,120
add them to the membrane

1845
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,358
so

1846
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:28,318
is information a representation

1847
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:33,279
i don't know i mean we're getting

1848
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:37,120
getting into the quantum now

1849
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:39,120
so um

1850
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:42,000
yeah where's where's information

1851
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,600
in this

1852
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,560
it comes up in the paper

1853
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:47,679
um

1854
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:50,238
18 17 times

1855
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:52,319
based on local information

1856
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:54,158
information comprises the generative

1857
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:56,480
model

1858
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:59,360
past and present information future

1859
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:02,080
information information gain no

1860
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,600
additional information about internal

1861
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,159
states that's the markov definition

1862
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:08,640
high mutual information

1863
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:09,760
can be

1864
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:10,110
um

1865
01:10:10,110 --> 01:10:11,520
[Music]

1866
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:14,080
in the context of a non-representational

1867
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,960
generalized synchrony like the pendulums

1868
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,800
that synchronize

1869
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:21,199
where is the information in this

1870
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:23,280
eightfold distinction

1871
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,280
so uh the author talks about here if i

1872
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,679
can read a quote quickly

1873
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:29,760
if one only appeals to the

1874
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,840
organizational aspect of representation

1875
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,840
the presence of environmental or sensory

1876
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,120
motor motor or complex or frugal model

1877
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:38,400
does not matter

1878
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,400
insofar as the internal variables of the

1879
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,239
model are understood to be separated

1880
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:44,080
from external reality by a markov

1881
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,760
blanket and the generative model is

1882
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,480
leveraged to infer the causal structure

1883
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:51,199
of external reality via self-evidencing

1884
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:53,280
however these differences matter if one

1885
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,679
considers structural aspects and the

1886
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:57,360
degree of resemblance between hidden

1887
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:00,080
variables and environmental dynamics as

1888
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,159
opposed to action or information

1889
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:04,960
gathering dynamics

1890
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,239
so

1891
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:08,080
i don't know here here the content of

1892
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,520
representations is used to draw a

1893
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:10,719
further distinction within the

1894
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:12,080
representational view between an

1895
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,840
internalist sometimes called

1896
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:16,480
intellectualist or encodist

1897
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:20,640
versus an action-oriented perspective

1898
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,800
so

1899
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,760
probably one of the most thrilling

1900
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,840
academic debates

1901
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,159
dean

1902
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:31,840
well

1903
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,840
please don't

1904
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,840
don't judge what i'm about to say next

1905
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:36,880
just

1906
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,199
bear with me be kind so in this

1907
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:40,960
representation for example where we've

1908
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,560
got this table

1909
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,480
if we were to look at those lines each

1910
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,239
one of those horizontal lines because

1911
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:47,840
there's three i see

1912
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,760
and each one of those vertical lines

1913
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,480
because there's four ic

1914
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:55,120
and we realized and we realized them as

1915
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:55,840
an

1916
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,719
a standard x y graph

1917
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:00,480
we know that there's a relationship

1918
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,800
between x and y that every one of those

1919
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,159
horizontal

1920
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:05,199
lines

1921
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:07,520
relative to y

1922
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:10,239
has a zero component to it

1923
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:12,159
and we know that every one of those

1924
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:15,120
vertical lines relative to x

1925
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,440
has a zero component to it

1926
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:19,520
so most people will look at the

1927
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,520
blackness of that relative to the white

1928
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,280
background and they'll just see

1929
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:25,679
something material separating

1930
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:26,960
but if we actually look at it

1931
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,920
graphically and we take daniel's idea of

1932
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:33,120
the tetrahedron every time we round

1933
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:36,000
an edge and change direction on that

1934
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,960
tetrahedron there is a zero element

1935
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:41,760
that allows for that boundary crossing

1936
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,920
that we again don't pay as much

1937
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,679
attention to

1938
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:48,000
and so from a from an autopoetic

1939
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,520
standpoint

1940
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,600
you can actually see where

1941
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,520
something like a mark-up blanket both

1942
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,280
separates

1943
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:56,159
and

1944
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:58,400
leaves the potential open

1945
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:01,760
for that transfer or that crossing

1946
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:02,840
or that

1947
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,880
transition so

1948
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,440
when we're modeling ourselves the last

1949
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:08,880
paragraph

1950
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:11,120
of the section five of the paper they

1951
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,159
wrote

1952
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:15,840
arriving at an fep as synthesis

1953
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:16,960
so

1954
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:17,890
some some

1955
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:19,360
[Music]

1956
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:22,719
non-zero number and zero

1957
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:25,520
view depends upon which representational

1958
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,360
criterion

1959
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:29,040
we are assuming

1960
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,040
when either considering fvp central

1961
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,960
constructs or considering specific

1962
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:35,920
cognitive phenomena through the lens of

1963
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,159
a process theory under fep

1964
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:40,719
do we include the zero piece of this or

1965
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:41,840
not

1966
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,600
tentatively

1967
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:44,640
fully

1968
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,840
or do we willfully ignore it

1969
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,920
hence in the end the debate about fvp

1970
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:52,640
may reveal more about us

1971
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:54,480
our criteria

1972
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,719
whether we want this to be a material

1973
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:59,440
thing and not not include the zero

1974
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:00,880
aspect of it

1975
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,640
and our interest in particular facets of

1976
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,159
cognition than does about the

1977
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:06,640
representational status of fep

1978
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,640
so i just want to kind of bring that

1979
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:11,360
again don't judge me because i i could

1980
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,440
be way wrong here and i may be over

1981
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:14,400
fitting

1982
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,719
but i think that that auto poetic part

1983
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:18,000
of it

1984
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,400
we can see both the separation and we

1985
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:24,080
can see the portal in a line

1986
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:26,880
if we choose to include both

1987
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:30,880
that's kind of what i wanted to bring up

1988
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:32,560
okay

1989
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:36,000
very interesting dean thanks

1990
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:39,760
here's the unfolded tetrahedra there's a

1991
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:40,800
few

1992
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,480
unfold there's a few

1993
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,640
shapes of paper that can be folded into

1994
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:47,360
a tetrahedra one looks more like a

1995
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:48,719
parallelogram

1996
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:50,880
and one looks more like an equilateral

1997
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,320
triangle which just kind of like folds

1998
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:56,080
up like the petals of a flower

1999
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:58,880
so these zero lines

2000
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:01,600
so there's the zero point

2001
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:02,480
of

2002
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:05,280
within a facet

2003
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:06,239
representational and

2004
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:07,840
non-representational that's almost like

2005
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,239
the two sides of the paper like how many

2006
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:12,159
triangles are here oh four

2007
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:13,520
how about eight

2008
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,679
how many units how many triangle units

2009
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:17,520
of paint do you need to paint this four

2010
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:20,640
no eight two sides so the zero is like

2011
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,640
the thickness of the paper and that's

2012
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:24,320
also when you fold it up that's like

2013
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,960
inside versus outside of the tet

2014
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:29,120
and then these zero

2015
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,120
y lines

2016
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,800
are like the movements

2017
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:36,239
from one face to another face

2018
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:39,199
where it's also thin enough as to be

2019
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:40,880
imperceptible

2020
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,280
especially when it's laid flat

2021
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,280
but it makes all the difference to move

2022
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:46,880
from one side

2023
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:49,520
to another

2024
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,080
how do we use

2025
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:56,320
moving through zero

2026
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,239
in this

2027
01:15:58,239 --> 01:16:00,080
eightfold

2028
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:01,840
or other

2029
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:04,320
cognitive models

2030
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,239
how do we use that to increase the

2031
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:08,159
efficacy or the fluidity or the

2032
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:10,159
accessibility

2033
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:11,120
of

2034
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:13,519
models

2035
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:16,800
does it does it help us in explaining

2036
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,960
that we're not locked out of that

2037
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:21,280
self-organization

2038
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,080
loop

2039
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:26,000
that we can actually participate in it

2040
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:29,360
is that the first thing that it tells us

2041
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:32,080
that we're not

2042
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:36,400
we're not locked out of that ability to

2043
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:39,199
self-generate

2044
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:43,120
that was a question that wasn't that i

2045
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:46,000
wasn't questioning it was it wasn't like

2046
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,840
an honest sincere question

2047
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,400
i think so

2048
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,000
one

2049
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,440
supportive or

2050
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:00,080
a complimentary component would be

2051
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:02,880
this is sort of a map this is like a

2052
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,880
cognitive map and someone could say this

2053
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,320
side of the paper is better than the

2054
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:07,600
other side

2055
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,080
and this is my favorite face

2056
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,800
but it's presented as part of a larger

2057
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,480
knowledge structure

2058
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:17,040
such that the learner could engage in

2059
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,800
counter factuals like what if we were on

2060
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,800
the other side of the paper or what if

2061
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,880
we were on a different face

2062
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:23,840
so

2063
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:26,320
this allows for example

2064
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:27,920
individuals to

2065
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,120
reflect

2066
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,640
their understanding of the lay of the

2067
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:31,600
land

2068
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:34,640
but also communicate their preferences

2069
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,400
and as the paper shows different

2070
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,760
individuals

2071
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:39,920
do have different outcomes in terms of

2072
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,600
their cognitive conclusions

2073
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,280
and that's what reveals the super

2074
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,520
fascinating thing about us

2075
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:48,000
and that's why the paper is modeling

2076
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,280
ourself

2077
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:50,960
what the free energy reveals about our

2078
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:54,080
implicit notions of representation not

2079
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,600
free energy principle modeling

2080
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,679
representation what the free energy

2081
01:17:57,679 --> 01:18:00,000
principle reveals about representation

2082
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,840
which would be a slightly different

2083
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:04,000
paper and title

2084
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:04,880
um

2085
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:05,679
so

2086
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:06,719
just

2087
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:07,920
the

2088
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:11,120
scholarship and the sense making phase

2089
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:14,159
that only very few have to engage in

2090
01:18:14,159 --> 01:18:16,960
like sims and pizzulo have

2091
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:20,000
is to make these

2092
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
maps

2093
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,560
and then

2094
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:26,800
bring

2095
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,360
the perspectives

2096
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:31,440
that were not

2097
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:34,080
integrated

2098
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,880
to be shown as just

2099
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:39,679
different locations in a phase space

2100
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:40,800
like

2101
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,120
we put four zeros but

2102
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:44,960
so it's not as simple as just like two

2103
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:46,640
numbers but you know if there was if it

2104
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,400
was just two topics being against each

2105
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:49,440
other

2106
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:50,320
every

2107
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:51,679
perspective could have like a position

2108
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:54,800
in that phase space

2109
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:58,239
and then what do we do with that

2110
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,560
yes danielle

2111
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,480
i guess i'm thinking about the ourselves

2112
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,480
part of modeling ourselves i'm not

2113
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:11,840
really thinking about um

2114
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,440
all humans and and the way that our

2115
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:16,080
minds work it's more of the the academic

2116
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,920
conversations that have been happening

2117
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,280
around the sort of intellectual

2118
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:20,880
tradition that's been happening around

2119
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,719
representation and so

2120
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:25,440
this the contribution of this paper as i

2121
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,199
see it is that look we've got this

2122
01:19:27,199 --> 01:19:29,600
framework that does a lot of work for us

2123
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,040
in a lot of different disciplines and if

2124
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:33,120
we apply it to this conversation this

2125
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,719
intellectual debate

2126
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:36,719
that's been happening we can reveal

2127
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:38,560
implicit assumptions of the debate

2128
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,400
itself and

2129
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,719
what emerges is that

2130
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:45,120
perhaps does an artifact of particular

2131
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,840
examples that have been used to

2132
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:51,199
understand representation um we

2133
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:53,760
see one side of the coin or another we

2134
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:55,920
can see these we pull on these different

2135
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:57,840
dimensions that are laid out in this

2136
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,120
paper so

2137
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,719
um i guess it's just important to think

2138
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:02,000
about and

2139
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,400
disagree if you if you disagree but um

2140
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,639
the the ourselves is really just about

2141
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:08,639
the way that philosophers and and

2142
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:10,159
cognitive scientists have been thinking

2143
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:11,440
about this nothing is

2144
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:12,400
true

2145
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,000
this is not revealing something about

2146
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,320
cognition per se it's it's more about

2147
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,639
the implicit assumptions that have been

2148
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:20,400
kind of unfolding and how

2149
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,320
how we're thinking about the

2150
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,799
discipline

2151
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:26,719
thanks for that

2152
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:29,199
um just like there was a sort of hinge

2153
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:31,760
on the functional being used in two

2154
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,280
different ways

2155
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,480
another

2156
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,560
sense of representation

2157
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,880
one that might be more

2158
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,880
commonly used outside of cognitive

2159
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:43,120
science would be like representation in

2160
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:45,360
terms of different perspectives or

2161
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,199
identities in

2162
01:20:47,199 --> 01:20:48,400
a group

2163
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,880
and then that made me think of

2164
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:53,120
nothing about us without us

2165
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:55,679
which is used in different contexts but

2166
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:57,760
basically has to do with participatory

2167
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:00,000
decision making that decisions are not

2168
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
being made

2169
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,239
in a way removed from the people who it

2170
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:05,760
influences

2171
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,400
and that has to do with representation

2172
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,639
no taxation without representation for

2173
01:21:10,639 --> 01:21:11,679
example

2174
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:15,280
and so cognitive science is actually in

2175
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:16,239
a

2176
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:18,239
nothing about us without us

2177
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:21,840
because if there's just an academic

2178
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:24,080
discussion especially an unexamined one

2179
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,840
with a lot of implicit baggage

2180
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:30,360
about a hyper-intellectualized

2181
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:33,199
hyper-abstracted scenario or like we

2182
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:35,280
like to study representational

2183
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:36,960
organizational cases where it's super

2184
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:38,320
clean these are the ones that we study

2185
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,400
these are the model systems these are

2186
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,320
the kind of careers that have been built

2187
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:44,880
in academia for example

2188
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:46,239
but it's about

2189
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:50,000
us in the broader sense like humans and

2190
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,199
then even us as cognitive entities

2191
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:55,120
and so

2192
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:58,400
it is the philosophers and the

2193
01:21:58,400 --> 01:21:59,920
literature

2194
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:03,520
that is in this paper

2195
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:06,480
as danielle kind of highlighted that's

2196
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,880
the modeling ourself

2197
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:11,679
the selves there are the participants in

2198
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:13,920
the discussion around

2199
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:16,800
representation which of course has been

2200
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,600
textual abstract

2201
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:20,520
english speaking

2202
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:21,600
[Music]

2203
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:23,360
qualitative

2204
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,520
other adjectives

2205
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,520
so it's another interesting

2206
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:30,800
connection there blue

2207
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:34,159
so definitely like the the subjectivity

2208
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:37,360
that danielle highlighted is

2209
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:40,480
a big part of perhaps why we have these

2210
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:42,000
organizational structural these

2211
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,840
different like viewpoints

2212
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,320
but um maybe something that i don't

2213
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,880
think is really emphasized too much in

2214
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,960
this paper

2215
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:53,760
is kind of the the realist versus

2216
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,239
instrumentalist viewpoint of active

2217
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:57,679
inference and so

2218
01:22:57,679 --> 01:23:01,679
um there's a pretty big argument

2219
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:04,159
um in the literature and i think

2220
01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:06,080
probably if the math is not the

2221
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:08,639
territory maybe gets into it the best

2222
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:10,880
maybe or in the most detail

2223
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,400
of the papers that we've studied here on

2224
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,639
this stream but um

2225
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:16,480
you know there's

2226
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,320
people that say like active inference is

2227
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:21,360
a way to model the cognitive process or

2228
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:23,679
the action perception process that we

2229
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:26,000
all undergo and then there are people

2230
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,960
who say that this is actually happening

2231
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,719
in a computational way

2232
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:33,760
in the brain it's not a model of it is

2233
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,520
how it works

2234
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:38,080
and so there's this ongoing um

2235
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:39,440
like

2236
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:42,000
vision fusion feud

2237
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,840
happening in the active inference

2238
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:45,280
community also and i just wanted to

2239
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,600
highlight that because um

2240
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:50,719
yeah because you may not know

2241
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:53,199
thanks a lot blue i pulled out a few

2242
01:23:53,199 --> 01:23:54,800
quotes because i

2243
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,480
also noticed that when we it was one of

2244
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:58,400
the earlier quotes when we were talking

2245
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,000
about the

2246
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,760
um i think

2247
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,400
organizational element

2248
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:05,520
so

2249
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:08,320
look at how often reality

2250
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,159
comes into play

2251
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:11,920
in these

2252
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,679
discussions so internal variables of a

2253
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:14,560
model

2254
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:15,600
okay so we're talking about

2255
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:18,400
instrumentalism right like models

2256
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:19,920
are understood to be separated from

2257
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:22,560
external reality by a markov blanket

2258
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:23,600
wait

2259
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,679
reality

2260
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:27,920
and the generative model

2261
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:29,520
model

2262
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:31,120
is leveraged to infer the causal

2263
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:32,800
structure of external

2264
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:35,280
reality

2265
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:37,440
so

2266
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:39,440
it it flips

2267
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:42,639
four times in that sentence

2268
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:43,600
from

2269
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,360
reality

2270
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:46,639
from model

2271
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:48,560
to reality

2272
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:50,800
back to model

2273
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:53,760
back to reality

2274
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:56,639
it's a very

2275
01:24:56,639 --> 01:24:59,600
it doesn't make it right or wrong

2276
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:02,400
it's just a very interesting epistemic

2277
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,960
artifact

2278
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:11,040
because within the reality of the model

2279
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:14,560
like the reality of the map

2280
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,320
it is the case that the internal

2281
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:20,159
variables are separated

2282
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:24,320
and if the model is trying to do

2283
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:28,239
determination on that level of reality

2284
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:31,679
like maps trying to infer maps

2285
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:34,480
that is reality

2286
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:35,760
but then

2287
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:39,120
that's not the sort of layer one

2288
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,199
external reality in the sense that many

2289
01:25:41,199 --> 01:25:44,400
people often mean or use it dean

2290
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,000
yeah i think danny if you take the words

2291
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,639
reality and model and push them out into

2292
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:50,000
even more

2293
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,239
extreme tales

2294
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:54,320
you could you could see the model you

2295
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:55,840
can see people who are pushing back

2296
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,760
against the model idea

2297
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:59,360
and they're arguing you're just too

2298
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:01,760
rigid right you're just too stuck and

2299
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,600
you can see people that are taking the

2300
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,600
non-representational

2301
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:10,480
sort of reality view the the variance

2302
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:13,760
uh maintained or retained view as say

2303
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,280
and you can see the people that are on

2304
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:17,199
the model end of the continuum saying

2305
01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:19,840
that's just chaos there's nothing about

2306
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:21,520
that that we can actually make sense of

2307
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:23,760
because the cognitive overload right now

2308
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,920
is just swamping me

2309
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:28,320
right and so i think what these i think

2310
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:29,920
what these authors were trying to do is

2311
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:31,840
say well

2312
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:34,159
can we move back and forth instead of

2313
01:26:34,159 --> 01:26:37,679
getting stuck on those really far out

2314
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:39,679
positions in terms of this

2315
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:42,400
in terms of this um

2316
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,159
way of being able to see when we have

2317
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:46,080
these densities

2318
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:48,800
right and then how do those densities

2319
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:51,440
how of those densities re-reset

2320
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:54,080
back to some sort of invariance and then

2321
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:57,080
re-reform

2322
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:00,080
right so i think that's and i hope that

2323
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,679
kind of speaks to what daniel was saying

2324
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:02,840
too

2325
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:05,840
because sure we can we can point out the

2326
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:08,639
most extreme example like at the very

2327
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:10,880
end of the continuum

2328
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:13,040
or we can actually talk about how we're

2329
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:15,360
going to draw these

2330
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:17,840
unit direction or bi-directional lines

2331
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:19,600
and boundary cross

2332
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:21,040
and i think that's what they were trying

2333
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:24,080
to open us our thinking up to but

2334
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:26,000
maybe maybe i'm just being pollyanna

2335
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,280
here because i really like the paper

2336
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:30,280
adam

2337
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:35,040
interesting point

2338
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:37,920
here's some realism is also used in

2339
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,520
another way which is kind of like it's a

2340
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,120
school of

2341
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:44,080
literature or a thread of literature

2342
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:46,400
and so then i found this paper affect of

2343
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:48,000
realism

2344
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,000
evoke realism beyond representation

2345
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,760
and so this is in the case of literary

2346
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:55,920
expression so that's an activity that

2347
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:58,960
cognitive entities are engaged in

2348
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:02,080
and we just see a lot of terms that we

2349
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:04,239
talk about in active

2350
01:28:04,239 --> 01:28:05,920
like agency

2351
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:07,199
affect

2352
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:08,880
process

2353
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:12,840
and here it's not about reality

2354
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:16,719
realism territory it's like realization

2355
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:18,800
and realization's an interesting word

2356
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,719
and i know verveiki and others use it as

2357
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:21,600
well

2358
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,199
because realization

2359
01:28:23,199 --> 01:28:24,880
it is about

2360
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:26,080
the model

2361
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:28,719
but when something is realized

2362
01:28:28,719 --> 01:28:32,080
it becomes real in the model

2363
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:34,080
but usually we wouldn't say that

2364
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:35,840
something is realized like oh i just

2365
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:37,040
realized that

2366
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:38,080
um

2367
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:40,159
zebras have nine legs

2368
01:28:40,159 --> 01:28:41,040
it's like

2369
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:43,360
you engaged in a counter factual

2370
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,520
but is it a realization

2371
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,600
if the model is updated in a way that

2372
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:48,960
isn't

2373
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:51,199
concordant with reality

2374
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:53,199
and i agree that the paper gives us a

2375
01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:54,880
lot of

2376
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:59,600
nuance to talk about these areas because

2377
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,840
we can talk about how

2378
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:04,000
well the isolation

2379
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,560
of the variables doesn't change or

2380
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,440
the structure of the legs and the zebra

2381
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:11,760
doesn't change or

2382
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:13,679
it can still run right

2383
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:16,639
so why not nine legs is it still a zebra

2384
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:18,880
like

2385
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,320
there's a lot of open

2386
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,960
threads but

2387
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:27,840
the way that they

2388
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:29,520
use

2389
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:32,239
model and reality

2390
01:29:32,239 --> 01:29:33,600
in light of a lot of the other

2391
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,320
discussions we've had is really

2392
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:39,320
illustrative

2393
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:43,120
blue

2394
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:45,840
so one of my favorite um things to think

2395
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,760
about in terms of like the realism

2396
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:50,080
versus the instrumentalism is the markov

2397
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:52,000
blanket and so like i don't was looking

2398
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,920
for the picture about like of the person

2399
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:56,000
sleeping under the markov blanket like

2400
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,120
like really as a partition for a system

2401
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:00,480
like

2402
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:03,679
do systems have markov blankets or are

2403
01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:04,880
they

2404
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:07,280
can they be modeled with markov blankets

2405
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:09,040
like and i always just like think of

2406
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:10,320
that cute little picture with the little

2407
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,400
person sleeping under the markup blanket

2408
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:13,840
like do i have a markup blanket wrapped

2409
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,520
around me um

2410
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:18,480
because that's really where it um tends

2411
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:21,199
to break down in my mind like yes

2412
01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:22,800
there's a boundary

2413
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,199
um but i'm not sure that it's

2414
01:30:25,199 --> 01:30:28,480
a pristine blanket or a pearl blanket or

2415
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,480
a markov blanket like

2416
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:34,639
maybe it's just skin um

2417
01:30:34,639 --> 01:30:36,960
yes dean

2418
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:39,840
uh i hate answering a

2419
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,440
question with another question but in

2420
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:43,360
the conclusion of the paper

2421
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:45,520
the authors speak specifically to the

2422
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:47,360
free energy principle can be very

2423
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:49,440
heuristic and so i'm wondering

2424
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:52,080
in the instrumentalist versus

2425
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:55,199
versus realist debate whether it has to

2426
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:57,199
necessarily get up to that abstract

2427
01:30:57,199 --> 01:30:59,440
level of markov blanket or whether we

2428
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:01,440
can just say that sandwich between those

2429
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:03,280
two are rules

2430
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:06,000
that we de-market that we

2431
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,639
we lay down and that we

2432
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:12,400
act have act as a as a parsing mechanism

2433
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,560
i don't know what do you think blue

2434
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,800
like our rules our rules things that we

2435
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:19,120
can just get our hands on right today

2436
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:20,480
instead of having to go all the way up

2437
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,480
to figuring out what a markov blanket is

2438
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,880
under this set of circumstances

2439
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:27,040
no i think definitely rules right so i

2440
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:29,840
mean we all agree that there are laws in

2441
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:31,600
physics like if you drop an apple it

2442
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,920
will fall to the floor it's like like we

2443
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:36,320
all abide by these rules uh they might

2444
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,880
not apply at every scale but um i i

2445
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,639
definitely think that a rule-based

2446
01:31:40,639 --> 01:31:42,560
construction or understanding like does

2447
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:45,360
that then bridge the realism versus

2448
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:46,910
instrumentalism debate perhaps

2449
01:31:46,910 --> 01:31:50,010
[Music]

2450
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:52,719
so

2451
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:55,120
building on the point that the ourselves

2452
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:57,040
in the title is

2453
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:58,800
the people reading

2454
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,400
the paper

2455
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,560
so not just like people in the psych

2456
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:04,560
department but it's the ourselves the

2457
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:09,440
people who are in that epistemic commons

2458
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:11,840
so

2459
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:12,960
that

2460
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:15,360
but also the

2461
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:19,199
contents related representations

2462
01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:22,800
in terms of correctness or truth

2463
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:25,199
so if that if the ourselves

2464
01:32:25,199 --> 01:32:29,839
are those who are pondering fep

2465
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,320
then

2466
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:34,320
the heuristic

2467
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,159
that they refer to we conclude by

2468
01:32:36,159 --> 01:32:37,840
highlighting the heuristic power of the

2469
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:39,920
fep to advance our understanding of the

2470
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:42,800
notion of internal representation

2471
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:45,199
it is pretty meta because we're

2472
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:47,920
representing the debate about people

2473
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:48,960
representing the debate about

2474
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:51,520
representation

2475
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:52,880
however

2476
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:57,440
the fact that it has a heuristic utility

2477
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:01,840
within the content related aspect at the

2478
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:04,560
very least

2479
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:08,880
it does have representational

2480
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:10,960
impact i'm not sure where that takes us

2481
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:12,400
there's probably other ways to take it

2482
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:14,639
but i think something about

2483
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:16,080
um

2484
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:19,199
the diversity of conclusions that people

2485
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:21,600
have and how that shines a light back on

2486
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:24,080
us or is a mirror

2487
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:25,360
and how

2488
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:27,760
the fep

2489
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:30,000
has

2490
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:31,840
been applied

2491
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:32,639
here

2492
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:34,480
in this paper

2493
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,880
as a heuristic for sense-making

2494
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:40,239
in this meta debate

2495
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:43,840
says something i hope danielle

2496
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:46,239
i i hope i'm addressing what you're

2497
01:33:46,239 --> 01:33:47,679
saying and not taking this in another

2498
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:48,960
direction but

2499
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:50,639
i i

2500
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:52,880
stepping back i'm thinking of fep as

2501
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:55,360
just one of many different tools of

2502
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:57,520
thought that we have that allow us to

2503
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:00,639
align our our representations and if it

2504
01:34:00,639 --> 01:34:03,360
is an effective tool we all start having

2505
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:05,440
a conversation that makes sense to each

2506
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:07,520
other that's mutually intelligible

2507
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:09,520
um

2508
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:11,679
in this case it is kind of meta because

2509
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:13,280
it's about how

2510
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:14,800
the academics the intellectual

2511
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:17,120
conversation about representations

2512
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:18,880
um have

2513
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,480
failed to converge on something there's

2514
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,400
this debate there are many layers of the

2515
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:25,120
debate and so what it reveals is that we

2516
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:27,199
haven't yet converged that the community

2517
01:34:27,199 --> 01:34:30,159
hasn't converged and so fep is

2518
01:34:30,159 --> 01:34:32,639
is this thing that we can use that

2519
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:34,639
reveals those things and allows us to

2520
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:36,400
then better because it's revealing these

2521
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:38,560
things we can all attend to those things

2522
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:40,000
that were implicit and are now made

2523
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,920
explicit we're converging

2524
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,920
our representations so i think that kind

2525
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:45,679
of addresses what you're saying it's

2526
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:47,679
about representations but it's also this

2527
01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:49,280
this tool like there are many other

2528
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:50,800
types of tools

2529
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,960
that allow us to

2530
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,239
realize what we've been taking for

2531
01:34:54,239 --> 01:34:55,920
granted and align our our

2532
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:58,800
representations

2533
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:01,600
thanks a lot dean

2534
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:04,480
yeah and just just add on to that

2535
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:06,480
if you're like me you think

2536
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:08,080
rules and tools are

2537
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:10,480
are interchangeable

2538
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:13,280
and the other thing you think is that

2539
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,679
if it's a heuristic it speaks kind of

2540
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:18,320
that to that vicarious function

2541
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:20,000
in terms of content

2542
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,320
so i i just want to throw that on top

2543
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:23,840
because i think there's some agreement

2544
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:27,159
around that

2545
01:35:29,119 --> 01:35:31,119
we use the rules to make that next very

2546
01:35:31,119 --> 01:35:33,679
like vicarious

2547
01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:34,719
play

2548
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:37,679
the next before we make the next move

2549
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:39,119
so

2550
01:35:39,119 --> 01:35:41,520
i mean anybody that doesn't are just

2551
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:43,920
kind of kidding themselves i think but

2552
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:46,719
maybe i'm wrong

2553
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:49,760
okay here's a little bit of fep in a

2554
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,360
heuristic

2555
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:54,880
case so we've talked about the helmholtz

2556
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,400
decomposition

2557
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:58,960
of vector fields like in

2558
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:00,960
stream number 32

2559
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:03,840
about how there's this pragmatic

2560
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:06,400
or sort of hill climbing or gradient

2561
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,320
descending component whether you take

2562
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:10,480
the optimistic biology climbing mountain

2563
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:12,000
probable go straight up the mountain of

2564
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,040
fitness or the physicist's

2565
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:16,719
gradient descent into the bottom of the

2566
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:17,840
well

2567
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:20,239
in either case there's that irrotational

2568
01:36:20,239 --> 01:36:22,000
component that's associated with

2569
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,280
pragmatism

2570
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:24,880
and then there's this epistemic

2571
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:26,880
component that's associated with the

2572
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:29,360
solenoidal isocontour so we've talked

2573
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:32,080
about that helmholtz decomposition

2574
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:35,040
so here's one way in which the fep is

2575
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:37,280
being heuristically applied

2576
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:39,040
so danielle said

2577
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:40,639
the academic conversation on

2578
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:43,920
representation has not converged and it

2579
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:47,440
it has not converged and it has also not

2580
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:48,800
even

2581
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:50,639
cohered

2582
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:53,360
like there isn't a shared ontology

2583
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:54,880
there's not a shared narrative there's

2584
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:57,040
not shared words or regime of attention

2585
01:36:57,040 --> 01:37:00,080
or what people are even focused on

2586
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:01,040
and so

2587
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:03,119
what the fep is doing

2588
01:37:03,119 --> 01:37:05,040
literally like they did here

2589
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:06,719
with this

2590
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:08,719
distinction

2591
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:12,480
it does a few things it it holds space

2592
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,400
for not overfitting like let's just say

2593
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:17,760
in 2055 all the people in the world or

2594
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:19,119
all the cognitive scientists they all

2595
01:37:19,119 --> 01:37:21,440
agreed oh great we converged

2596
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:23,199
let's lock that in

2597
01:37:23,199 --> 01:37:24,159
but

2598
01:37:24,159 --> 01:37:26,480
fep even then

2599
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:30,320
will remind us like not to over fit

2600
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:33,119
and also not to center one side of the

2601
01:37:33,119 --> 01:37:35,840
tetrahedra we could say this is the side

2602
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:38,159
that has these attributes or we focus on

2603
01:37:38,159 --> 01:37:40,400
this side for these reasons

2604
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:42,800
um and no one goes there to this other

2605
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:44,800
side or there's a reason why we don't go

2606
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:47,679
there or we take a journey we travel

2607
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:49,920
through there but we don't live there or

2608
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:52,480
something like that

2609
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:53,760
it

2610
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:56,480
brings a level of coherence to the

2611
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,560
discussion

2612
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:00,719
that

2613
01:38:00,719 --> 01:38:04,080
doesn't necessarily have the goal of

2614
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:06,960
perfect static convergence

2615
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:08,000
but

2616
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,320
still there'll be

2617
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:12,480
solenoidal flow

2618
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:16,000
and differences in opinion even then

2619
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:16,260
um

2620
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:17,520
[Music]

2621
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:21,199
who said the fbp wasn't useful

2622
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:26,159
well and maybe this is obvious but is is

2623
01:38:26,159 --> 01:38:28,800
that not what any good theory does like

2624
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:31,199
blue said well gravity is true because

2625
01:38:31,199 --> 01:38:33,119
if i drop an apple it will fall yeah so

2626
01:38:33,119 --> 01:38:35,040
the theory of gravity does the same

2627
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:36,800
thing it allows us to

2628
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:38,800
kind of converge our representations

2629
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,480
it's just that the theory of gravity is

2630
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:44,199
not itself about representation

2631
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:47,360
yes

2632
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:48,480
this

2633
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:50,719
this is like the hall of mirrors this

2634
01:38:50,719 --> 01:38:53,600
paper and conversation because it is

2635
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:55,840
like

2636
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:57,840
it's the group of people in the

2637
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:59,840
holobeers and they're all wearing mirror

2638
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:00,800
suits

2639
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:02,960
in a weird way but

2640
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:04,800
it is our

2641
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,320
gym

2642
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:08,239
for building

2643
01:39:08,239 --> 01:39:09,760
the kind of

2644
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:12,080
frameworks that then can reduce our

2645
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:14,560
uncertainty a ton

2646
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:17,199
potentially in similar cases

2647
01:39:17,199 --> 01:39:20,239
and the strange loop of reflexive

2648
01:39:20,239 --> 01:39:22,239
cognitive entities

2649
01:39:22,239 --> 01:39:24,840
is gonna be this

2650
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:27,040
open-ended fount

2651
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:28,800
for a long time to come

2652
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:31,440
but just like how we started here

2653
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:32,960
with a really

2654
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:35,360
complex reciprocal case of two adaptive

2655
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:36,560
entities

2656
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:38,880
but then it was a lot less ambiguous

2657
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:41,679
here

2658
01:39:41,679 --> 01:39:44,000
and i wonder if um

2659
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,280
active informed system design

2660
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:49,280
will frame an increasing

2661
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:51,119
amount of pieces especially in a digital

2662
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:52,400
world

2663
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:53,840
into this bottom

2664
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:55,040
tier

2665
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:56,320
offloading

2666
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:57,520
some of the

2667
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:59,679
repetitive tasks attention consuming

2668
01:39:59,679 --> 01:40:00,800
tasks

2669
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:02,320
anxiety producing

2670
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:04,239
stimuli

2671
01:40:04,239 --> 01:40:06,960
into these type of interactions

2672
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:09,199
which opens up new spaces for these

2673
01:40:09,199 --> 01:40:11,679
kinds of interactions

2674
01:40:11,679 --> 01:40:15,119
with the two adaptive entities

2675
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:22,159
to return to that having her possessing

2676
01:40:22,159 --> 01:40:23,840
a markov blanket just one quick point

2677
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:25,600
was which we already even read the quote

2678
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:27,600
which was a core aspect of fep such as

2679
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:30,000
the possession of a markov blanket

2680
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,360
so

2681
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:32,239
is

2682
01:40:32,239 --> 01:40:35,040
the markov blanket the system

2683
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:37,360
or does it have one those are both

2684
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:41,119
realist or is it modeled as having is it

2685
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:42,800
modeled as being those are

2686
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:45,520
instrumentalist ways of similar framings

2687
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:47,679
and how do we know what the core aspects

2688
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:49,040
are

2689
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:51,199
what

2690
01:40:51,199 --> 01:40:53,119
does that stem from

2691
01:40:53,119 --> 01:40:55,440
so there's a ton to learn and discuss

2692
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:57,759
there

2693
01:40:58,080 --> 01:40:59,600
and then let's look at any in just our

2694
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:02,719
last few minutes any of the other topics

2695
01:41:02,719 --> 01:41:03,679
and

2696
01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:05,280
if anybody wants to highlight one of

2697
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:07,440
these or also maybe

2698
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:10,080
as we jump off from

2699
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:11,679
36.2

2700
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:14,560
to 37 and beyond

2701
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:16,000
when we discuss

2702
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,239
free energy a user's guide but also we

2703
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:21,920
just continue on our paths like

2704
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:24,480
why does it matter

2705
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:25,920
not all these

2706
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:28,320
papers

2707
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:30,480
maybe make the argument for why this

2708
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:34,880
whole representation debate matters

2709
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:38,239
so what is the pragmatics

2710
01:41:38,239 --> 01:41:40,239
that make this meaningful make it

2711
01:41:40,239 --> 01:41:41,520
important to

2712
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:44,000
fund people working on it or the way

2713
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,760
that influences the technologies that

2714
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:48,480
we're developing

2715
01:41:49,119 --> 01:41:51,600
rather than just a pure

2716
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:53,840
info gain reduction of uncertainty

2717
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:55,440
question

2718
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:58,639
so any topics here

2719
01:41:58,639 --> 01:42:01,040
or any like thoughts on how this

2720
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:03,520
will or could or should

2721
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,440
influence our action selection going

2722
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:08,440
forward

2723
01:42:20,159 --> 01:42:22,800
i'm comfortable with long silences but

2724
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,159
i'm gonna

2725
01:42:24,159 --> 01:42:28,599
i'm gonna throw this out there i think

2726
01:42:29,199 --> 01:42:31,520
i think people will be able to use this

2727
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:34,080
tool to become more creative not just be

2728
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:36,480
able to reduce their minute minimum

2729
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:37,920
reduce or minimize

2730
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:40,000
their prediction errors

2731
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,800
but actually have the confidence is to

2732
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:44,480
come up with new

2733
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:45,920
and different ways of looking at

2734
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:48,239
problems that we probably didn't have in

2735
01:42:48,239 --> 01:42:49,199
our

2736
01:42:49,199 --> 01:42:50,480
in our toolkit

2737
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:52,480
before in terms of being able to come up

2738
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:53,360
with

2739
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:55,280
something different

2740
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:58,239
and so i think

2741
01:42:58,400 --> 01:42:59,440
um

2742
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:01,119
the first thing that it does is it

2743
01:43:01,119 --> 01:43:03,760
allows for a boundary crossing that

2744
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:04,560
that

2745
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:07,119
maybe we constructed in our minds before

2746
01:43:07,119 --> 01:43:07,920
but

2747
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:09,520
we're seeing less and less of it as

2748
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:11,440
being a a hard

2749
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:12,560
stop

2750
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:13,840
and there's now

2751
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:17,040
maybe a little bit more

2752
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:21,040
more say in whether to go or no or don't

2753
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:23,360
go so that's what i would think that

2754
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:26,719
this kind of work is is is maybe

2755
01:43:26,719 --> 01:43:28,719
opening up unless somebody comes and

2756
01:43:28,719 --> 01:43:30,480
shuts it down

2757
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:32,560
and i can't speak to what outside forces

2758
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:34,960
would find terribly threatening but i'm

2759
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:38,840
sure there are some out there

2760
01:43:39,199 --> 01:43:41,199
outside

2761
01:43:41,199 --> 01:43:43,440
blue

2762
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:45,360
so i'm not sure if this has any

2763
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:47,520
pragmatic value but i'm i'm certainly

2764
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:50,080
interested in um kind of really

2765
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:51,760
exploring like

2766
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:54,159
sensory motor engagement and structural

2767
01:43:54,159 --> 01:43:55,760
representation and maybe like

2768
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:58,320
synesthesia um i know daniel's been to

2769
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:00,080
meow wolf but like you know when you're

2770
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:01,600
playing these invisible like the

2771
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:04,000
invisible harp you know and like could

2772
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,080
you structure a room like draw a map in

2773
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:07,760
a room and your goal is to like kind of

2774
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:09,920
like an escape room but your goal is to

2775
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:12,239
find navigate your way through

2776
01:44:12,239 --> 01:44:14,159
uh based on sound right like you ting

2777
01:44:14,159 --> 01:44:15,360
the things and you have to find the

2778
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:16,639
right sound you play mary had a little

2779
01:44:16,639 --> 01:44:18,880
lamb and then you get to your prize at

2780
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:20,159
the end or you get to get out of the

2781
01:44:20,159 --> 01:44:22,719
room and so as i wonder creatively like

2782
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:25,040
that like um dean was saying like really

2783
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:28,320
these maps um these representations can

2784
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:30,560
we get literally out of our own

2785
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:33,040
representation and into

2786
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:34,400
the feeling of an alternate

2787
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:36,560
representation and what would that feel

2788
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:38,080
like or be like and that's also why i

2789
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:39,679
brought up like blindness like you know

2790
01:44:39,679 --> 01:44:41,280
if you ever wake up in like a totally

2791
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:42,639
like my power went out the other night

2792
01:44:42,639 --> 01:44:45,360
it was like black i mean no moon nothing

2793
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:46,960
like it was just like whoa total

2794
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:49,199
darkness right like no little blue light

2795
01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:51,920
from the plug or nothing right so

2796
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:55,199
um in these like total darkness

2797
01:44:55,199 --> 01:44:57,199
situations you have this representation

2798
01:44:57,199 --> 01:44:58,880
of like what does my house look like

2799
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,400
where's my flashlight like you have to

2800
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:02,800
be able to navigate yourself in a

2801
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:04,800
totally dark situation it's which is

2802
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:07,199
very foreign to go find a flashlight and

2803
01:45:07,199 --> 01:45:09,360
so i i like these kind of boundary

2804
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:11,520
pushing um

2805
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:13,600
experiences and because they really

2806
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:15,520
force us to

2807
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:18,480
examine our own model and perhaps allow

2808
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:20,239
us to explore the kind of models that

2809
01:45:20,239 --> 01:45:22,879
other people use

2810
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,800
thinking through other minds

2811
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:27,920
is

2812
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:31,360
this case with adaptive agents in

2813
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:32,880
dialogue

2814
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:34,880
and it's it's like thinking through

2815
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:35,840
other

2816
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:38,400
representations and

2817
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:41,520
this paper and discussion

2818
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:43,119
opens up

2819
01:45:43,119 --> 01:45:44,719
not to then

2820
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:48,960
simply converge but opens up and holds

2821
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:50,480
ways

2822
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:53,360
to think and act through other

2823
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:55,280
types of representations not just the

2824
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:57,520
same type but in a different cognitive

2825
01:45:57,520 --> 01:45:59,840
entity

2826
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:05,280
it comes up

2827
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:07,040
a lot

2828
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:09,840
and it'd be awesome to see how

2829
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:14,000
just as so many other themes that we've

2830
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:17,280
had raised by very prescient papers

2831
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:18,320
like

2832
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:21,600
14. math is not the territory 20

2833
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:23,440
emperor's new markov blanket and some of

2834
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:25,360
the further nuancing

2835
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:26,639
about

2836
01:46:26,639 --> 01:46:29,920
the markovian assumptions

2837
01:46:30,239 --> 01:46:31,600
this

2838
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:32,560
representational and

2839
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:34,800
non-representational and these words

2840
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:36,800
like organization structure content and

2841
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,000
function

2842
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,960
they will come up again and maybe

2843
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:43,040
they'll be citing

2844
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:44,159
this paper

2845
01:46:44,159 --> 01:46:45,920
maybe they won't

2846
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:47,440
but like

2847
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:49,920
it's almost like when we see in a future

2848
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:52,000
paper just one facet

2849
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
of the tet and they'll say here's how it

2850
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,239
is it's this one side it's like well no

2851
01:46:56,239 --> 01:46:57,840
there's other sides and we could be

2852
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:00,400
inside or we could be outside

2853
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:02,400
and someone could still say i prefer

2854
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:03,679
this one but

2855
01:47:03,679 --> 01:47:05,520
we know there's a bigger

2856
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:08,800
system that we can at least

2857
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:10,080
come to the

2858
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:13,360
table around dean

2859
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:15,360
i'm not

2860
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:16,480
i'm not

2861
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:18,080
marketing but it's going to come up in

2862
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:19,360
37.

2863
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:20,800
it's going to come up a bunch of times

2864
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:24,480
in 37 so that's just the next paper

2865
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:27,440
so anyway hold on your socks because if

2866
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:28,719
you think you have to wait for it to

2867
01:47:28,719 --> 01:47:30,320
come up again it's going to come back up

2868
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:31,920
again next week

2869
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:32,719
so

2870
01:47:32,719 --> 01:47:36,520
don't touch that dial

2871
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:42,639
thanks a lot for the awesome

2872
01:47:42,639 --> 01:47:45,520
sequence this was a

2873
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:47,520
somewhat

2874
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:49,840
complex or

2875
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:52,159
intellectual paper

2876
01:47:52,159 --> 01:47:54,159
i mean they're all written but this one

2877
01:47:54,159 --> 01:47:55,920
was like

2878
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:58,960
challenging topics a lot of different

2879
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:00,560
perspectives

2880
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:04,960
and then not only did they

2881
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:06,159
hold

2882
01:48:06,159 --> 01:48:07,360
it open

2883
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:09,440
for all of the different perspectives

2884
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:10,400
but then

2885
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:12,400
rather than pick a winner

2886
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:13,760
they flipped

2887
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:15,760
the table in the end

2888
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:16,800
and

2889
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:19,600
posed it not as an answered

2890
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:21,040
competition

2891
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:22,960
for us to then

2892
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:24,960
have

2893
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:27,520
um like domain specific clarity of

2894
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:28,960
action within

2895
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:31,199
but really a challenge

2896
01:48:31,199 --> 01:48:33,520
on multiple levels

2897
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:34,400
for

2898
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:35,600
researchers

2899
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:38,639
who are familiar with fep

2900
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:41,119
and not

2901
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,239
the big question we asked was can the

2902
01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:47,199
free energy principle help us advance or

2903
01:48:47,199 --> 01:48:49,360
even resolve the long lasting debate on

2904
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:51,440
internal representation in philosophy of

2905
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:53,759
mind

2906
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:57,440
we certainly asked

2907
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:00,560
so

2908
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:02,960
if anybody has any last comments they

2909
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:05,760
want to make

2910
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:06,800
on

2911
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:07,840
anything

2912
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:10,639
they're welcome to

2913
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:14,239
give somebody else the last word so i'll

2914
01:49:14,239 --> 01:49:16,960
get this in real quick i think that if

2915
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:19,679
we're still arguing about whether or not

2916
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:22,639
representation and modeling is heavily

2917
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:23,920
dependent

2918
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:26,239
like that there is a dependency

2919
01:49:26,239 --> 01:49:28,639
i think that the more

2920
01:49:28,639 --> 01:49:31,119
philosophical

2921
01:49:31,119 --> 01:49:32,560
views that we

2922
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:33,520
see

2923
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:36,400
come up around fep and active inference

2924
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:38,480
the harder and harder it is

2925
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:40,960
to make the case that we can

2926
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:44,159
remove that dependency or somehow just

2927
01:49:44,159 --> 01:49:48,480
see the scale-free aspects of this tool

2928
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:50,080
that there's actually a

2929
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:52,400
heavy dependency on what we're going to

2930
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:54,159
get out of representation or

2931
01:49:54,159 --> 01:49:56,400
non-representation

2932
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:58,800
based on our awareness or our

2933
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:01,199
realization that every time we cross a

2934
01:50:01,199 --> 01:50:02,239
boundary

2935
01:50:02,239 --> 01:50:04,800
that is just an independent act that's a

2936
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:07,360
highly dependent act so that'll be my

2937
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:10,598
last word

2938
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:14,960
so i just want to give a final comment

2939
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:17,520
you know we talk about instrumentalism

2940
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:19,840
and realism and then there's like the

2941
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:22,719
third axis right of utility

2942
01:50:22,719 --> 01:50:24,560
and i really think that this paper was

2943
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:27,840
super useful in prompting new questions

2944
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:29,840
and holding up these different views of

2945
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:32,000
representation and non-representation

2946
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:33,920
and in these different categories and

2947
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:36,159
and allowing us to really kind of

2948
01:50:36,159 --> 01:50:38,719
view them through like a partitioned

2949
01:50:38,719 --> 01:50:42,000
framework uh um that i think will drive

2950
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,679
future questions and um and really be

2951
01:50:45,679 --> 01:50:48,880
useful in helping researchers formulate

2952
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:51,440
their theories

2953
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:53,839
great

2954
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:58,400
danielle if you're still here

2955
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:00,560
thanks for joining for your first

2956
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:04,400
stream do you have any last comments

2957
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:07,520
oh this was a wonderful introduction

2958
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:09,920
i'm curious how representative it is of

2959
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:12,320
of other conversations it was super

2960
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:16,719
heady in in a really uh pleasant way

2961
01:51:16,719 --> 01:51:18,320
it was not representative or

2962
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:20,159
representational of other conversations

2963
01:51:20,159 --> 01:51:21,599
no

2964
01:51:21,599 --> 01:51:23,679
thanks a lot for the awesome convo

2965
01:51:23,679 --> 01:51:26,239
everyone's always welcome to join these

2966
01:51:26,239 --> 01:51:28,960
discussions or other lab activities so

2967
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:31,440
thanks again to the authors and all the

2968
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:33,440
participants here

2969
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:35,598
