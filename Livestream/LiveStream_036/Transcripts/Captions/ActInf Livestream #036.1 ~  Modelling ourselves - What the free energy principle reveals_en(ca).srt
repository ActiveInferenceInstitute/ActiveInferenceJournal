>>DANIEL FRIEDMAN: That was

2
00:00:21,895 --> 00:00:25,372
just Bleu's entry music. Hello and

3
00:00:25,405 --> 00:00:27,447
welcome, everyone, to ActInf Lab

4
00:00:27,492 --> 00:00:30,972
Livestream number 036 Dot One. It's

5
00:00:31,017 --> 00:00:34,025
January 19, 2022.

6
00:00:34,612 --> 00:00:37,357
Welcome to the ActInf lab. We are a

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,442
partner participatory online lab that is

8
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,517
communicating, learning, and practicing

9
00:00:41,577 --> 00:00:43,747
applied Active Inference Lab. You can

10
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,077
find us at the links here on this slide.

11
00:00:46,257 --> 00:00:48,402
This is a recorded and an archived

12
00:00:48,432 --> 00:00:49,927
livestream, so please provide us with

13
00:00:49,945 --> 00:00:51,502
feedback so that we can improve our

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,342
work. All backgrounds and perspectives

15
00:00:54,402 --> 00:00:56,587
are welcome and will be following good

16
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,527
video etiquette. For live streams. You

17
00:00:59,545 --> 00:01:01,672
can check Active Inference Lab.org to

18
00:01:01,705 --> 00:01:03,607
learn about how to participate in any

19
00:01:03,685 --> 00:01:06,622
active lab events which go beyond but

20
00:01:06,655 --> 00:01:09,337
also support the live streams. And also

21
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,902
the Coda site at the bottom will give

22
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,077
you access to the table with metadata on

23
00:01:14,095 --> 00:01:17,182
the past and ActInf Livestream. All

24
00:01:17,185 --> 00:01:21,202
right, today in Active stream number 36

25
00:01:21,295 --> 00:01:24,307
one, we're going to be discussing and

26
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:27,247
learning and seeing who joins for the

27
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,527
paper. Modeling ourselves. What the Free

28
00:01:29,545 --> 00:01:31,522
Energy Principle reveals about our

29
00:01:31,555 --> 00:01:33,592
implicit notions of representation by

30
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,147
Sims and Pazulo. 2021 we

31
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,600
went over some of the background in 360,

32
00:01:42,037 --> 00:01:45,327
and today we're just going to introduce

33
00:01:45,357 --> 00:01:46,822
ourselves, say hello, what we were

34
00:01:46,855 --> 00:01:49,072
excited about in the paper. And then we

35
00:01:49,105 --> 00:01:51,562
wrote down some things to discuss. But

36
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:54,552
I'm sure both of you have other random

37
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:56,302
things you wrote down. And anything that

38
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,372
people write in a live chat, we can also

39
00:01:58,555 --> 00:02:02,397
look at. So I'm Daniel. I'm a researcher

40
00:02:02,442 --> 00:02:05,472
in California, and I think I'm excited

41
00:02:05,517 --> 00:02:09,507
to just hear Dean's marginal comments

42
00:02:09,672 --> 00:02:11,692
and just see where it goes, because

43
00:02:11,815 --> 00:02:15,125
there's just a lot in this paper and so

44
00:02:17,212 --> 00:02:19,400
it'll be a thick one.

45
00:02:22,012 --> 00:02:25,477
>>> DEAN TICKLES: Well, I'm Dean. I'm here in

46
00:02:25,495 --> 00:02:28,957
Calgary, and I really didn't know

47
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,922
if I even had time to even look at this

48
00:02:30,955 --> 00:02:35,772
paper. And then I listened in on Daniel

49
00:02:35,817 --> 00:02:37,432
and Bleu's conversation in the zero,

50
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,150
and it piqued my interest. And so

51
00:02:41,887 --> 00:02:45,322
I read the paper and I was

52
00:02:45,355 --> 00:02:47,375
really happy to read this paper because

53
00:02:48,262 --> 00:02:52,117
where Daniel and Bleu kind of took

54
00:02:52,165 --> 00:02:55,337
a path to introducing the material,

55
00:02:56,212 --> 00:02:57,897
this is kind of familiar ground,

56
00:02:57,942 --> 00:03:00,247
familiar territory for me, which is very

57
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,557
unusual because most of the stuff that

58
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,552
we look at, I'm looking at it for the

59
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,332
first time. And so I'm really excited,

60
00:03:07,422 --> 00:03:09,097
and I don't want to detour anything that

61
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,657
you guys want to sort of look at. At the

62
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,197
.1, maybe at the .2 point of

63
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,917
this process, we can look at section

64
00:03:16,977 --> 00:03:18,997
five of this paper. What can we learn

65
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,782
from this debate? Because I think that

66
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,322
section five of this is super

67
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:26,827
interesting and not just trippy. You

68
00:03:26,845 --> 00:03:28,882
guys use the word trippy, which I

69
00:03:28,885 --> 00:03:32,197
thought was fantastic, quite a good

70
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,475
description. But I think we can pull

71
00:03:34,837 --> 00:03:38,302
parts of this out and look at them

72
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,177
and reassert them and reattach them in

73
00:03:40,195 --> 00:03:42,127
our own way and actually come up with

74
00:03:42,145 --> 00:03:45,697
something pretty amazing. I'll pass

75
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,787
it down to Bleu.

76
00:03:49,987 --> 00:03:52,497
>>> BLEU KNIGHT: Hi, everyone. I'm Bleu. I'm a researcher

77
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:56,422
in New Mexico. And this paper was

78
00:03:56,455 --> 00:03:59,272
great. Like Dean was saying, it was

79
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,747
familiar to me, but not because of my

80
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,250
background. I thought it really

81
00:04:05,887 --> 00:04:08,692
explained and summarized a lot of like

82
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,197
different points in the FEP active

83
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,347
Inference lab and how we use it to model

84
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:17,572
ourselves. And it pulled out

85
00:04:17,605 --> 00:04:20,677
a lot of really important questions, I

86
00:04:20,695 --> 00:04:23,227
think, that I'm looking forward to

87
00:04:23,245 --> 00:04:24,500
discussing with you guys.

88
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:31,897
>>> DANEL: So we wrote down some things to discuss,

89
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:35,667
but maybe let's start with just a blank

90
00:04:35,802 --> 00:04:39,022
slate. Dean, what do you think would be

91
00:04:39,055 --> 00:04:41,197
some approaches that we can take or some

92
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:44,150
starting points because we already have

93
00:04:44,512 --> 00:04:47,825
other cards up our sleeve. Cell.

94
00:04:48,337 --> 00:04:50,677
I don't want to be a guy holding up the

95
00:04:50,695 --> 00:04:53,067
flag and detouring your conversation.

96
00:04:53,202 --> 00:04:55,117
One of the things we might get to near

97
00:04:55,165 --> 00:04:58,147
closer to the end, hopefully, is the

98
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,400
authors speak to the possibility of,

99
00:05:04,912 --> 00:05:06,372
you know, when you set up your table.

100
00:05:06,417 --> 00:05:08,737
>>> DEAN: Daniel, one of the things that they

101
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,097
potentially talked about in the section

102
00:05:11,142 --> 00:05:14,587
five of the paper is the idea that the

103
00:05:14,725 --> 00:05:16,612
lines are a little bit fuzzy here,

104
00:05:16,675 --> 00:05:20,017
maybe they're broken. And the idea of,

105
00:05:20,065 --> 00:05:22,627
in some cases our ability to move from

106
00:05:22,645 --> 00:05:24,997
internal representation into the

107
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,397
representational. It's kind of a big

108
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,947
deal because you can have the debate

109
00:05:28,992 --> 00:05:30,937
that says here's the parts that would

110
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,127
align with a non representational view

111
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,502
and here's the parts that would align

112
00:05:35,532 --> 00:05:37,597
with a representational view. But then

113
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,742
they insert this part that says but

114
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:43,192
maybe we slip into and out action action

115
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,947
action action action, action oriented

116
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,902
representation into and out of the cue

117
00:05:46,932 --> 00:05:49,282
density. And so maybe at near closer to

118
00:05:49,285 --> 00:05:51,502
the end today, we can tap into that a

119
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,100
bit.

120
00:05:57,487 --> 00:06:01,037
>>> DANEL: Let's start with that grid.

121
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:04,927
Yeah, because this is the structure of

122
00:06:04,945 --> 00:06:09,972
the paper and the elucidating

123
00:06:10,092 --> 00:06:13,947
contribution. And also I think Dave

124
00:06:13,992 --> 00:06:15,367
left to YouTube comment or something

125
00:06:15,415 --> 00:06:17,272
like there's other dimension. So this is

126
00:06:17,305 --> 00:06:19,927
kind of pointing away towards an

127
00:06:19,945 --> 00:06:24,592
interesting approach to making

128
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,262
sense of some philosophical debates,

129
00:06:26,337 --> 00:06:27,802
kind of laying them out in tables like

130
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,552
this. So how

131
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,547
should we approach it? There's the

132
00:06:33,655 --> 00:06:34,777
representational and the

133
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:37,717
nonrepresentational perspectives or

134
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:41,122
stances or modes or archetypes that is

135
00:06:41,155 --> 00:06:43,672
definitely very blurry because of course

136
00:06:43,705 --> 00:06:45,577
it depends on what you mean by

137
00:06:45,595 --> 00:06:49,267
representation and that can have some

138
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:53,092
fundamental ambiguity and then that

139
00:06:53,215 --> 00:06:57,202
representational versus not continuum or

140
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:00,657
dialectic is then separated

141
00:07:00,747 --> 00:07:03,737
into a few domain.

142
00:07:05,212 --> 00:07:08,527
I think we could talk about what are the

143
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,102
similarities and differences because

144
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,652
some of it was a little nuanced and I

145
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,457
wondered if there was other categories

146
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:17,877
or they were organizational,

147
00:07:17,907 --> 00:07:19,447
structural, content related and

148
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,592
functional. So then this is your game

149
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,372
board of eight lower dimensional

150
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:27,562
projections that the thought can be in.

151
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,767
Or it's something like one of these

152
00:07:29,815 --> 00:07:32,462
eight octants.

153
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,587
And then a lot of the papers going

154
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,272
through some of the literature and

155
00:07:38,455 --> 00:07:42,275
rhetoric for and against each of these,

156
00:07:43,912 --> 00:07:48,137
using the FEP as kind of the interpret

157
00:07:48,562 --> 00:07:50,947
what is being interpreted to speak for

158
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,067
one of those eight cells. Whether either

159
00:07:54,115 --> 00:07:57,200
of you want to continue it there.

160
00:07:58,012 --> 00:07:59,902
Well, on the Action D, Maisto that

161
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,277
sensory motor stuff and yelly,

162
00:08:02,307 --> 00:08:05,872
bloomberg talks a good

163
00:08:05,905 --> 00:08:08,647
argument around the idea that, for

164
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,552
example, I could be in a flow state and

165
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,302
there is no model or plan that I'm

166
00:08:13,332 --> 00:08:15,322
necessarily following. And that's true

167
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,175
if we're talking about extension and

168
00:08:19,912 --> 00:08:23,377
embedded as two of those four Es, you

169
00:08:23,395 --> 00:08:25,972
don't necessarily have to move to that

170
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:30,217
place that requires something to work

171
00:08:30,265 --> 00:08:32,737
off of. You could just be flowing and

172
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,775
working in something, right?

173
00:08:36,262 --> 00:08:40,947
That rate of change is you extended.

174
00:08:41,142 --> 00:08:44,982
>>> DEAN: So there are times when you've

175
00:08:44,997 --> 00:08:46,642
you literally don't have to be working

176
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,850
off of a plan. You could also be moving

177
00:08:51,112 --> 00:08:54,682
from a blueprint to some kind

178
00:08:54,685 --> 00:08:56,697
of outcome that you want to achieve.

179
00:08:56,892 --> 00:09:00,172
And then it's pretty obvious then that

180
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:03,062
the representational piece has to exist.

181
00:09:04,312 --> 00:09:07,957
So maybe the argument isn't that

182
00:09:08,035 --> 00:09:11,947
both aren't at work. It's how we

183
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:15,802
cognition from a density out of a

184
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,297
density and then back into a density,

185
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:21,277
something to at least have a

186
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:24,802
conversation about. Because I

187
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,842
think Bleu was touching on this last

188
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,867
time too. She said, I just want somebody

189
00:09:28,915 --> 00:09:31,647
to be able to show me how these lines

190
00:09:31,692 --> 00:09:34,017
are in this sort of structured

191
00:09:34,077 --> 00:09:37,522
relationship exist. When I

192
00:09:37,555 --> 00:09:39,307
heard her say that, I was kind of like,

193
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,707
no, I think that's a fair question

194
00:09:41,785 --> 00:09:44,612
because those lines seem to be blurred.

195
00:09:49,312 --> 00:09:53,977
>>> BLEU: So something that came up yesterday is

196
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:57,697
the idea of free will. And I just

197
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,837
wonder how that might play into these

198
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,602
different grid boxes.

199
00:10:04,782 --> 00:10:08,527
Is there free will in all of

200
00:10:08,545 --> 00:10:12,202
these or in none of them? Or is that

201
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,187
even relative?

202
00:10:17,175 --> 00:10:20,490
>>> DANEL: Okay, let's write

203
00:10:20,507 --> 00:10:21,237
it down.

204
00:10:24,975 --> 00:10:28,905
One interesting thing about this is

205
00:10:28,952 --> 00:10:30,560
it has a little bit of that visual

206
00:10:30,605 --> 00:10:33,890
illusion with the black grid

207
00:10:33,995 --> 00:10:36,325
and the white dots at the junctions.

208
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,675
So it's kind of a interoceptive artifact

209
00:10:41,175 --> 00:10:44,435
just sort of messing with our visual

210
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,085
representation. And the visual

211
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,765
representations are when you see it,

212
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:52,425
you believe it that kind of focus system

213
00:10:52,487 --> 00:10:55,425
in a lot of the active literature and

214
00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:58,455
vision. Okay,

215
00:10:58,577 --> 00:11:02,145
so let's save

216
00:11:02,222 --> 00:11:05,055
free will and the blurriness for later

217
00:11:05,102 --> 00:11:06,465
and then come to some of the things we

218
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:08,712
wrote down for the previous list.

219
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,980
Okay, so in what sense can or

220
00:11:17,027 --> 00:11:20,130
are computational models or any other

221
00:11:20,177 --> 00:11:22,600
kind of models be fully observable?

222
00:11:28,462 --> 00:11:32,122
Can I give maybe a possible real

223
00:11:32,155 --> 00:11:34,852
life example that maybe speak starts to

224
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:39,097
speak to that? Sure. Okay, so in

225
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,812
the paper, the authors say,

226
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,897
however, these differences matter if one

227
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,027
considers structural aspects and the

228
00:11:46,045 --> 00:11:47,727
degree of resemblance between hidden

229
00:11:47,757 --> 00:11:50,612
variables and environmental dynamics.

230
00:11:51,637 --> 00:11:53,887
So I was thinking about your question,

231
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,687
and so I wrote this down. If dynamics,

232
00:11:57,037 --> 00:11:59,947
then the material I e, the content, the

233
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,107
structure, and the organization is going

234
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,897
to have a different change rate than the

235
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,672
function. So the first three columns are

236
00:12:07,705 --> 00:12:10,777
going to behave differently than the

237
00:12:10,795 --> 00:12:14,472
fourth. For example, the screwdriver

238
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,232
as tool remains very stable, hopefully

239
00:12:17,397 --> 00:12:19,567
relative to the spiral effect or

240
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:22,222
function that it can generate on the

241
00:12:22,255 --> 00:12:25,152
screw to the one driving the screw.

242
00:12:25,182 --> 00:12:28,447
There are now two rates to juggle the

243
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,502
assumptions that the tool applying the

244
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,047
function as a rule is stable and

245
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,227
consistent and the effect sought will

246
00:12:35,245 --> 00:12:37,347
be a form change, meaning action

247
00:12:37,392 --> 00:12:39,957
orientation, where a new representation

248
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:43,317
outcome happens. You quite literally

249
00:12:43,377 --> 00:12:46,102
start an end with a dance between the

250
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,747
stabilities and the dynamics leveraging

251
00:12:48,792 --> 00:12:51,972
off of each other. So back and forth.

252
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:54,282
So we need to keep open the possibility

253
00:12:54,372 --> 00:12:57,327
that the stable or the representational

254
00:12:57,507 --> 00:13:00,292
and the dynamic, which as Cell points

255
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,977
out, can be nonrepresentational as well,

256
00:13:03,145 --> 00:13:05,917
are both in play. And then I wrote here

257
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:07,327
because I've used the expression when in

258
00:13:07,345 --> 00:13:09,552
doubt, zoom in, zoom out. When Markov

259
00:13:09,582 --> 00:13:12,275
blanket zoom in, zoom out.

260
00:13:14,212 --> 00:13:17,757
So in terms of the computation,

261
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,682
there's actually two computations.

262
00:13:20,847 --> 00:13:24,147
One around what we think should remain

263
00:13:24,267 --> 00:13:28,025
relatively consistent and one which we

264
00:13:28,837 --> 00:13:32,137
then apply that consistency to

265
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,027
something that we actually want to see a

266
00:13:34,045 --> 00:13:36,512
rate change expedited.

267
00:13:37,537 --> 00:13:39,322
So there's actually I think there's two

268
00:13:39,355 --> 00:13:41,997
calculations here to the person that's

269
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:45,397
trying to figure out how

270
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,892
they're going to see

271
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,687
what's on the other side of the blanket.

272
00:13:56,287 --> 00:14:00,212
>>> DANEL: Very interesting. Lorenzo Laje.

273
00:14:07,612 --> 00:14:11,017
>>> BLEU: I like this idea of zooming in and out

274
00:14:11,065 --> 00:14:13,552
with a markup blanket and I think it

275
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:18,457
speaks to the way that agent

276
00:14:18,535 --> 00:14:21,922
are nested or anything is

277
00:14:21,955 --> 00:14:23,547
nested. I don't want to necessarily

278
00:14:23,592 --> 00:14:27,892
ascribe agency or free will to different

279
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,507
levels of organization, but I think

280
00:14:31,585 --> 00:14:33,667
when Markov blanket zoom in different

281
00:14:33,715 --> 00:14:35,272
Markov blankets, zoom out different

282
00:14:35,305 --> 00:14:38,947
Markov blanket. So for me it speaks to

283
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:42,277
multi scale systems and how

284
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,722
applying markup blankets is kind of

285
00:14:44,905 --> 00:14:48,097
scale friendly or imputed onto the

286
00:14:48,205 --> 00:14:49,400
system in question.

287
00:14:53,512 --> 00:14:56,437
One extension or maybe example of that,

288
00:14:56,575 --> 00:14:58,177
we've probably talked before, like the

289
00:14:58,195 --> 00:15:00,867
table, it's in the process biology,

290
00:15:01,002 --> 00:15:03,472
it's material that's tabling, but then

291
00:15:03,505 --> 00:15:06,502
that Attial is also process based. So

292
00:15:06,595 --> 00:15:10,032
sort of this multiscale process ontology

293
00:15:10,197 --> 00:15:12,487
and the identification of a given system

294
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,397
of interest. At stationarity like an

295
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:19,032
object that can be tracked, but there's

296
00:15:19,047 --> 00:15:20,592
objects that are too fast to be tracked

297
00:15:20,652 --> 00:15:22,252
and there's objects that are too slow to

298
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,477
be tracked below the just noticeable

299
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:27,127
difference. And so within a given

300
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:31,112
measurement or active inference regime,

301
00:15:31,537 --> 00:15:35,752
a given entity can have attention on

302
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,602
a given system of interest. It can't

303
00:15:37,632 --> 00:15:39,222
have attention on things that are slower

304
00:15:39,342 --> 00:15:41,142
or faster, like out of its frequency

305
00:15:41,202 --> 00:15:44,652
band. But that's discarding

306
00:15:44,682 --> 00:15:48,052
99% of the system to not

307
00:15:48,145 --> 00:15:51,042
consider outside of the frequency bands.

308
00:15:51,177 --> 00:15:55,175
It's like the observables are just one,

309
00:15:56,062 --> 00:15:59,692
they're very boundary and so the

310
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,432
slower things are, the larger things and

311
00:16:01,435 --> 00:16:02,697
the faster things are, the smaller

312
00:16:02,742 --> 00:16:05,752
things. So that's kind of

313
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:06,500
a nice.

314
00:16:09,487 --> 00:16:12,352
And. Let me just piggyback on that.

315
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,162
And if we're talking about specificity

316
00:16:15,237 --> 00:16:18,672
or scale friendly

317
00:16:18,867 --> 00:16:22,407
versus cosmic

318
00:16:22,497 --> 00:16:24,997
and scale free, that's also part of that

319
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:28,672
zoom in, zoom out exercise because there

320
00:16:28,705 --> 00:16:31,072
are quite literally elements of this

321
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,050
that are still scale free.

322
00:16:34,687 --> 00:16:37,562
Again, as they said, modeling ourselves.

323
00:16:38,737 --> 00:16:41,217
We can start from that position of scale

324
00:16:41,277 --> 00:16:43,477
free and then find the specifics, or we

325
00:16:43,495 --> 00:16:46,347
can find the specifics and ask ourselves

326
00:16:46,467 --> 00:16:50,375
how far out can we extend our

327
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:54,817
confidence that the stability will hold?

328
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,877
So that's, again, piggyback on what you

329
00:16:57,895 --> 00:17:00,732
just said, Daniel. There are all kinds

330
00:17:00,747 --> 00:17:02,977
of ways of interpretation zoom in and

331
00:17:02,995 --> 00:17:05,842
zoom out. And I think that's maybe

332
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:09,472
that's one of the insights that we

333
00:17:09,505 --> 00:17:12,697
get when we don't get ourselves hung up

334
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:16,632
on being a really radical enactivism.

335
00:17:16,797 --> 00:17:19,972
Even though I'm of the camp that says we

336
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:22,027
start out internal representation, an

337
00:17:22,045 --> 00:17:25,372
activity leaning side, and then the

338
00:17:25,405 --> 00:17:28,175
plans and the representations and the

339
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:31,187
effects of that are representational.

340
00:17:33,037 --> 00:17:35,525
All right, I'll think of an example that

341
00:17:36,112 --> 00:17:38,887
a wet lab example. So I'm thinking of

342
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:42,232
doing PCR or a wet lab technique where

343
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,527
you're not observing perhaps the

344
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,522
outcomes of what's happening for

345
00:17:46,555 --> 00:17:48,277
multiple steps. And even then it might

346
00:17:48,295 --> 00:17:50,977
be a color change or a number on a

347
00:17:50,995 --> 00:17:54,162
screen. And so then you get limited

348
00:17:54,237 --> 00:17:56,962
observables. Those are sometimes your

349
00:17:57,025 --> 00:17:59,107
degrees of manipulation, like in a

350
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,427
thermocycler that's changing the

351
00:18:00,445 --> 00:18:01,527
temperature. The only thing you're

352
00:18:01,557 --> 00:18:03,097
measuring during the reaction is the

353
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,717
temperature. Sometimes you might also

354
00:18:04,765 --> 00:18:06,472
look at like the optical property, but

355
00:18:06,505 --> 00:18:08,537
usually just changing the temperature.

356
00:18:09,112 --> 00:18:12,727
And then it's very representation like

357
00:18:12,895 --> 00:18:15,597
to have a mental or cognitive

358
00:18:15,717 --> 00:18:17,202
representation, which can include

359
00:18:17,232 --> 00:18:20,077
extended phenotype like the notebook and

360
00:18:20,095 --> 00:18:22,057
the computer. But that's pretty

361
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:24,627
representational to have counterfactuals

362
00:18:24,657 --> 00:18:26,752
about what molecules would do that have

363
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,862
never been visually observed.

364
00:18:30,187 --> 00:18:34,037
And so science becomes

365
00:18:34,837 --> 00:18:41,212
representational. And I think how

366
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,897
far does that reach back? And it kind of

367
00:18:44,005 --> 00:18:46,002
blurs off into increasingly internal

368
00:18:46,032 --> 00:18:48,277
representation forms. Not saying that

369
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:49,782
science is the most representational

370
00:18:49,872 --> 00:18:51,727
thing, but what are the most

371
00:18:51,745 --> 00:18:55,737
representational things? Back and forth

372
00:18:55,812 --> 00:18:59,397
on that is what I'm seeing with the 2ft

373
00:18:59,442 --> 00:19:02,182
in, 2ft out. But you just hit on a

374
00:19:02,185 --> 00:19:03,952
really important point because you said

375
00:19:04,045 --> 00:19:07,702
science becomes so what makes up

376
00:19:07,795 --> 00:19:11,525
the becomes like, what exists in

377
00:19:12,037 --> 00:19:15,342
that space prior

378
00:19:15,402 --> 00:19:18,562
to it us all agreeing that it's now

379
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:23,152
science. And I think that's what this I

380
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,997
think that's what this modeling as

381
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,377
opposed to us as model asks

382
00:19:28,407 --> 00:19:32,502
us to consider. You touched

383
00:19:32,532 --> 00:19:34,942
on the big deal here,

384
00:19:35,065 --> 00:19:38,617
Abductively. So what makes

385
00:19:38,665 --> 00:19:41,827
up that? What has to be present for us

386
00:19:41,845 --> 00:19:43,032
to be able to say, okay, now you've

387
00:19:43,047 --> 00:19:44,802
crossed a threshold and now we're

388
00:19:44,832 --> 00:19:46,037
talking science?

389
00:19:47,212 --> 00:19:50,392
Yes. It reminds me of the

390
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,802
paper of Brunberg anticipating brain

391
00:19:53,832 --> 00:19:57,425
is not a scientist. And we can just take

392
00:19:57,862 --> 00:20:00,457
the always prescient titles and content

393
00:20:00,535 --> 00:20:03,027
of these papers to be targeting

394
00:20:03,207 --> 00:20:06,972
attention point like is the Markov

395
00:20:07,017 --> 00:20:09,702
blanket a valid or useful construct?

396
00:20:09,807 --> 00:20:12,397
More recently, but back several years

397
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:16,672
ago, identifying some similarities or

398
00:20:16,705 --> 00:20:19,882
at least an area

399
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,947
of interaction with the

400
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:27,552
anticipatory and cybernetics of systems,

401
00:20:27,582 --> 00:20:30,397
which is pretty system agnostic, can

402
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:34,062
apply to very abstract representations

403
00:20:34,212 --> 00:20:36,802
as well as perhaps real systems. And

404
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,427
then the physical brain hypotheses and

405
00:20:39,445 --> 00:20:41,667
the inactivist and ecological

406
00:20:41,727 --> 00:20:44,992
perspectives on cognition with this

407
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,052
activity called science and the role of

408
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:52,117
a scientist. And so a few

409
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,075
ways to parse science. One is,

410
00:20:56,512 --> 00:20:59,367
as we heard from Majid Beni recently

411
00:20:59,502 --> 00:21:03,147
with model based science. So that's

412
00:21:03,192 --> 00:21:07,902
one relevant way that we learned

413
00:21:07,932 --> 00:21:09,747
about it and talked about this recently,

414
00:21:09,867 --> 00:21:11,902
like science being the application of

415
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,522
models, but then other systems

416
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:17,542
are perhaps doing something different.

417
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:20,182
Well, what is science? Anyone in the

418
00:21:20,185 --> 00:21:21,822
live chat should definitely respond,

419
00:21:21,867 --> 00:21:23,827
what is science? And also, I would like

420
00:21:23,845 --> 00:21:25,552
to hear what both of you think and how

421
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,517
that relates to anything we're talking

422
00:21:27,565 --> 00:21:31,192
about here or ever. So I always

423
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,752
think about science as the implication

424
00:21:32,845 --> 00:21:35,152
of the scientific method to anything,

425
00:21:35,245 --> 00:21:38,052
right? So observations, hypothesis,

426
00:21:38,157 --> 00:21:39,875
experiment, etc. Force.

427
00:21:40,762 --> 00:21:44,542
And because I think of science like

428
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:48,277
this, science itself is just a

429
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:51,582
model also, right? So we use science.

430
00:21:51,747 --> 00:21:54,477
We build a model of whatever phenomenon

431
00:21:54,507 --> 00:21:56,362
it is that we're trying to replicate or

432
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,337
observe or test or whatever. And we

433
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,422
do. We experiment with our model,

434
00:22:02,605 --> 00:22:05,922
essentially. So the scientific method

435
00:22:05,967 --> 00:22:08,172
itself is a model for doing science,

436
00:22:08,217 --> 00:22:11,317
and then the process of doing it is

437
00:22:11,365 --> 00:22:13,057
creating a model of the world. So it's

438
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,697
like nested models all the way down in

439
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,825
science in my world.

440
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,347
So, Bleu, can I ask you a quick

441
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:25,462
question? What do you think precedes the

442
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,262
engagement with what you're describing?

443
00:22:30,337 --> 00:22:32,225
Because the authors always say

444
00:22:32,587 --> 00:22:35,782
assumptions matter. What assumptions do

445
00:22:35,785 --> 00:22:38,497
you think goes into a person saying,

446
00:22:38,605 --> 00:22:39,652
okay, well, now I'm going to use

447
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:40,937
scientific method?

448
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:45,952
Are there things priors that we should

449
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,147
sort of pull out and examine that are

450
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,397
consistent when a person gets to a place

451
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,572
where they say, okay, I'm going to do

452
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:56,392
that? Yeah.

453
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:00,052
So there's a lot of stuff that's in the

454
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,102
scientific method. When I say the

455
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,742
scientific method, it encompasses things

456
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:07,242
like scientific bias and positive

457
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,622
control and a negative control. And so

458
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:11,377
all of these things are kind of this in

459
00:23:11,395 --> 00:23:13,672
this umbrella category. When I say

460
00:23:13,705 --> 00:23:16,647
scientific method and experimental

461
00:23:16,692 --> 00:23:19,852
design is not always simple, but

462
00:23:19,945 --> 00:23:24,042
definitely what precedes any science

463
00:23:24,177 --> 00:23:26,612
happening is simply observation.

464
00:23:27,187 --> 00:23:30,337
You have to be observant and to have

465
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,797
conversation. You have to have some

466
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,422
instrument with which to measure or

467
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:38,842
gauge the phenomena which you're trying

468
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:42,067
to examine, right, even if it's just

469
00:23:42,115 --> 00:23:45,472
your brain, which is probably the most

470
00:23:45,505 --> 00:23:47,602
powerful instrument of all of the

471
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,122
instruments, because it's fundamental to

472
00:23:50,155 --> 00:23:53,497
any testable instrument that

473
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:57,502
tests anything in the world like

474
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,227
that. So that's a lot of priors, I

475
00:23:59,245 --> 00:24:03,052
think. So is it fair to say then,

476
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:07,467
that to get to a place of adopting

477
00:24:07,527 --> 00:24:12,412
a scientific method, one might first

478
00:24:12,475 --> 00:24:14,077
possess before they can actually get

479
00:24:14,095 --> 00:24:18,142
into the formalities of that, a field

480
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:22,122
seeking curiosity and a way finding

481
00:24:22,242 --> 00:24:25,462
bias? And those are two different

482
00:24:25,525 --> 00:24:27,682
things, right? One is, I can be a

483
00:24:27,685 --> 00:24:30,052
spectator. The other one is, I've got to

484
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:32,277
get in the boat. I've got to get my skin

485
00:24:32,307 --> 00:24:34,297
in the game. Do you think that those two

486
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:38,392
things are necessary to

487
00:24:38,515 --> 00:24:42,247
adopt scientific method or to

488
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,162
commit to scientific method.

489
00:24:46,462 --> 00:24:49,732
So I'd like for you to unpack those a

490
00:24:49,735 --> 00:24:53,097
little bit more. Can you just describe

491
00:24:53,142 --> 00:24:54,997
what you mean about, like those two,

492
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:57,747
the way finding and the curiosity?

493
00:24:57,942 --> 00:24:59,232
Yeah, the field seeking curiosity.

494
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,507
Well, curiosity, I mean, it's kind of

495
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:04,017
got four parts. There's an epistemic

496
00:25:04,077 --> 00:25:07,872
piece, there's a sensing

497
00:25:07,917 --> 00:25:11,272
piece. I can't remember what the other

498
00:25:11,305 --> 00:25:13,642
two are right off the top of my head.

499
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,707
But bottom line is the curiosity, it's

500
00:25:16,722 --> 00:25:21,232
not sort of a monolith part

501
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:25,797
of that determination

502
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:29,937
because you don't know, but you're

503
00:25:30,012 --> 00:25:32,762
prepared to put in some time and effort

504
00:25:33,712 --> 00:25:36,922
to get past. Not knowing means that you

505
00:25:36,955 --> 00:25:39,157
can take one of two essential paths you

506
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,232
can find out. Right. You can go to a

507
00:25:42,235 --> 00:25:44,422
source that already knows where you can

508
00:25:44,455 --> 00:25:47,647
figure out based on sort of

509
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,552
collecting and curating evidence.

510
00:25:51,732 --> 00:25:55,475
So that's the field seeking piece

511
00:25:56,512 --> 00:25:58,492
wait. What'S the difference between

512
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,127
finding out and figuring out? Like, to

513
00:26:00,145 --> 00:26:01,477
me those are the same. So like, whether

514
00:26:01,495 --> 00:26:03,397
you're collecting evidence from Google

515
00:26:03,505 --> 00:26:06,667
or from that's epistemic. Right? But to

516
00:26:06,715 --> 00:26:10,912
figure out is to not

517
00:26:10,975 --> 00:26:14,587
have a source already, not a single

518
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:17,122
source of truth. That would be the

519
00:26:17,155 --> 00:26:20,422
difference. So one, you can

520
00:26:20,455 --> 00:26:22,492
find a truth source and then either

521
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,777
believe it or not. And the other is you

522
00:26:25,795 --> 00:26:29,362
have to develop your own truth through

523
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,252
it takes a lot more time because you

524
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,902
have to go around and gather a whole

525
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,377
bunch of other bits of information that

526
00:26:35,395 --> 00:26:37,912
aren't necessarily prepackaged for you.

527
00:26:37,975 --> 00:26:41,587
Does that make sense? Yes. And also,

528
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:45,172
like, what is truth? Right? I mean, you

529
00:26:45,205 --> 00:26:46,777
ultimately have to be the one that

530
00:26:46,795 --> 00:26:48,532
decides that, right? Whether to trust

531
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:50,900
and have confidence in something or not.

532
00:26:53,962 --> 00:26:57,697
Cool. Lots of really go

533
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,687
for it. No. Go ahead, Daniel.

534
00:27:00,862 --> 00:27:04,222
So let's pull one level back

535
00:27:04,405 --> 00:27:06,657
or two from one and a half fractal

536
00:27:06,672 --> 00:27:08,817
dimension. From the curiosity fourfold

537
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:12,007
distinction, there was like the personal

538
00:27:12,085 --> 00:27:13,927
factors. So the question was what

539
00:27:13,945 --> 00:27:15,277
precedes the type of engagement that

540
00:27:15,295 --> 00:27:18,177
might be called scientific? And there's

541
00:27:18,282 --> 00:27:20,257
some personal factors that are basically

542
00:27:20,335 --> 00:27:22,862
psychodynamic or like situational

543
00:27:23,437 --> 00:27:26,227
behavioral archetypes, but there are

544
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:29,122
things about individual people,

545
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,097
humans. What other kind of factors,

546
00:27:32,292 --> 00:27:34,222
even if the individual is the nexus of

547
00:27:34,255 --> 00:27:36,097
agency, what other factors come into

548
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,627
play? And like, what precedes the kind

549
00:27:37,645 --> 00:27:38,947
of engagement that might be called

550
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,017
scientific? If the person is our system

551
00:27:41,065 --> 00:27:43,492
of interest, how do we zoom in and out

552
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,375
from there?

553
00:27:46,837 --> 00:27:49,537
Cell that's my question. My question

554
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,037
isn't I don't have an answer

555
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,900
necessarily, but what I leave it to

556
00:27:54,562 --> 00:27:56,722
before the big bang kind of thinking,

557
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:59,902
we don't know. But is it possible that

558
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,477
there actually is something that we can

559
00:28:01,495 --> 00:28:04,957
put our finger on that leads someone to

560
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,902
have confidence in a scientific method

561
00:28:08,082 --> 00:28:12,350
and not just sort of remain kind of in a

562
00:28:12,787 --> 00:28:15,897
place of stasis and not be curious?

563
00:28:15,942 --> 00:28:17,182
Right? Because there's lots and lots of

564
00:28:17,185 --> 00:28:20,592
people who are kind of quite comfortable

565
00:28:20,652 --> 00:28:23,392
just going along with whatever is

566
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,702
happening around them but then there's

567
00:28:24,732 --> 00:28:29,452
others that appear to have a

568
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:32,302
potential for a deeper commitment. So

569
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,322
for example when we were talking prior

570
00:28:35,367 --> 00:28:38,600
to magic coming with us on with us,

571
00:28:39,412 --> 00:28:42,725
Bleu raised the specter that

572
00:28:43,537 --> 00:28:46,432
genes don't necessarily have to have

573
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:50,382
time in order to be considered

574
00:28:50,472 --> 00:28:53,452
prediction matter expertise because it

575
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,325
has both the cause and the effect

576
00:28:55,762 --> 00:28:58,962
included in the structure.

577
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:02,272
So that got me curious, right? For some

578
00:29:02,305 --> 00:29:05,122
people just making that statement or

579
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:08,197
asking that question blow right by them,

580
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:10,237
they wouldn't even give it a second

581
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,342
thought. But then for some people just

582
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,567
making that claim arrests them, slows

583
00:29:15,627 --> 00:29:18,577
them down and gets them asking questions

584
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:21,252
on their own. Now so that's why I'm

585
00:29:21,282 --> 00:29:23,617
asking this in the context of so why

586
00:29:23,665 --> 00:29:27,802
would somebody now go from I

587
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,547
don't care, I don't give a rats backside

588
00:29:29,592 --> 00:29:32,157
about science to I'm very passionate

589
00:29:32,172 --> 00:29:34,432
about science and I'm very interested in

590
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,837
learning this method.

591
00:29:38,587 --> 00:29:42,097
So I think science really is seen by

592
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:46,262
many as a kind of truth finding endeavor

593
00:29:47,662 --> 00:29:50,967
because whether it's through mining

594
00:29:51,027 --> 00:29:53,797
previous knowledge or generating new

595
00:29:53,905 --> 00:29:56,237
information, maybe knowledge,

596
00:29:57,937 --> 00:30:01,025
either one of those is definitely like a

597
00:30:02,587 --> 00:30:04,112
speaking of the truth.

598
00:30:05,812 --> 00:30:08,992
And in that way aren't we all just

599
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,657
looking to minimize our uncertainty,

600
00:30:12,747 --> 00:30:15,802
reduce our uncertainty? So I look at

601
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,737
science, it is an uncertainty reduction

602
00:30:19,387 --> 00:30:22,117
task. I mean that's the point of it

603
00:30:22,165 --> 00:30:25,337
perhaps. So I don't know what factors

604
00:30:27,712 --> 00:30:30,052
other than the fact that maybe we're in

605
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,675
a simulation like we could go there

606
00:30:33,412 --> 00:30:36,127
because that would precede the

607
00:30:36,145 --> 00:30:37,782
scientific endeavors that we undertake

608
00:30:37,797 --> 00:30:40,337
in our truth finding efforts.

609
00:30:41,662 --> 00:30:45,022
But really the knowledge of science as

610
00:30:45,055 --> 00:30:48,727
a way to determine truth I think might

611
00:30:48,745 --> 00:30:51,952
be part of it and maybe not everyone has

612
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:54,502
taught that I think about like, you

613
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,947
know, in western culture we're all like

614
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,797
indoctrinated with the scientific method

615
00:30:58,842 --> 00:31:00,577
from I don't know, fourth grade on or

616
00:31:00,595 --> 00:31:01,552
something like that, right,

617
00:31:01,645 --> 00:31:03,062
indoctrination.

618
00:31:06,037 --> 00:31:07,702
And then they give you the PhD at the

619
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,597
end when you're fully indoctrinated.

620
00:31:09,717 --> 00:31:11,257
But here's the thing Bleu and this is

621
00:31:11,335 --> 00:31:13,402
but you bring up a really cool point in

622
00:31:13,495 --> 00:31:15,472
fourth grade indoctrination. And I think

623
00:31:15,505 --> 00:31:17,377
one of the things you and I have kind of

624
00:31:17,395 --> 00:31:20,900
gone revolving back and forth is so,

625
00:31:21,937 --> 00:31:25,775
yes, science. And so somebody has said

626
00:31:26,362 --> 00:31:28,252
this has got some practical things and

627
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,177
some truth finding things. But I've

628
00:31:30,207 --> 00:31:33,662
always come back with great science

629
00:31:34,162 --> 00:31:37,717
plan. These are material things. My

630
00:31:37,765 --> 00:31:40,252
question has always been when? And you

631
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,832
bring up the well we've decided when

632
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:46,522
it's grade four but I'm not sure

633
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:49,432
that someone who's graph four least me

634
00:31:49,435 --> 00:31:52,492
see that'd be about 910 years of age.

635
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,592
It's the same sciences for somebody

636
00:31:54,715 --> 00:31:58,100
who's 29 30 or 39 40, right.

637
00:31:58,462 --> 00:32:02,092
So we can save clients now

638
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:05,525
but what I'm suggesting is that before

639
00:32:06,187 --> 00:32:08,547
the plan or the science there's

640
00:32:08,592 --> 00:32:10,372
something before that some really

641
00:32:10,405 --> 00:32:12,187
important things that we're just

642
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:16,827
assuming or willfully ignoring

643
00:32:17,007 --> 00:32:19,867
because now we're onto the plan, right?

644
00:32:19,915 --> 00:32:23,122
Because that's what has been reified and

645
00:32:23,305 --> 00:32:27,052
given the holy blessing sort of

646
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,072
thing. So I think you're hitting

647
00:32:30,117 --> 00:32:32,452
something that's critical and it's why

648
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,852
I'm disagreeing with you. So I don't

649
00:32:33,882 --> 00:32:35,197
think that the science that you're doing

650
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,877
when you're nine is that different from

651
00:32:36,895 --> 00:32:37,927
the science that you're doing when

652
00:32:37,945 --> 00:32:41,662
you're 39. And the perfect example

653
00:32:41,725 --> 00:32:45,132
of that is Feynman I was reading I don't

654
00:32:45,147 --> 00:32:46,957
remember, maybe it's in the meaning of

655
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,592
it all, like, maybe it's in that book,

656
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,847
but he talks about how, like,

657
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,832
for him, he just plays, right? And so a

658
00:32:54,835 --> 00:32:56,752
lot of his science is like, oh, I get to

659
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,627
make this toy and play with it and try

660
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:00,352
to look at it. And I keep playing with

661
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:02,150
it and I keep playing with it. And so

662
00:33:02,512 --> 00:33:04,107
this is something, I think, that's

663
00:33:04,197 --> 00:33:06,787
innate in us to just the figuring out

664
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:09,082
part, like the truth finding part. So

665
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,077
even as a baby, like, from the time you

666
00:33:11,095 --> 00:33:12,672
can sit up, like, what is this block?

667
00:33:12,717 --> 00:33:14,047
Like, what is this shape, what is this

668
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,372
flinky? Right? It's finding out and

669
00:33:16,405 --> 00:33:19,282
figuring out what are the affordance of

670
00:33:19,285 --> 00:33:22,597
the objects. Some of them are

671
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,372
imposed by the outside. Like, don't

672
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:27,247
stand on the chair because kids will use

673
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,912
chairs as tents and step tools.

674
00:33:31,687 --> 00:33:35,017
Some of it we impose some structure on.

675
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,807
You can't use this toy in that way, but

676
00:33:37,885 --> 00:33:39,547
really, like, kids will they don't know

677
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,722
they'll use anything anyway. Like they

678
00:33:41,755 --> 00:33:44,062
do all kinds of crazy things, like

679
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:48,275
they'll slide down a mountain on

680
00:33:49,162 --> 00:33:51,652
a trash bag or something, right? So they

681
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:54,972
don't know what the limits

682
00:33:55,017 --> 00:33:58,377
are and so they'll explore new limits.

683
00:33:58,407 --> 00:34:00,697
And I think that scientists, at least

684
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:02,122
the ones that really leave to do

685
00:34:02,155 --> 00:34:04,925
science, play a lot also.

686
00:34:06,187 --> 00:34:09,847
So, again, the trial and error piece can

687
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,572
be like the triangles piece. It can be

688
00:34:11,605 --> 00:34:14,107
scale free. And I would never push back

689
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,697
on that piece. The Epistemic

690
00:34:17,742 --> 00:34:19,942
and the specific is what you just

691
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,877
described. The other two parts of

692
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:24,127
curiosity are the distributed and the

693
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:27,007
sensing. And that's kind of the sort of

694
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:30,352
the more active part where

695
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:31,552
you have to kind of go out and do the

696
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,052
skin in the game. You have to get in,

697
00:34:33,145 --> 00:34:34,647
get in the boat across the South

698
00:34:34,692 --> 00:34:37,722
Pacific. You can be doing the epistemic,

699
00:34:37,767 --> 00:34:39,907
value the specific as well because you

700
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:44,377
can be taking samples, but you

701
00:34:44,395 --> 00:34:46,372
can kind of see that there's another

702
00:34:46,555 --> 00:34:49,747
side to this. So my question around the

703
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:54,612
when isn't around the ability

704
00:34:54,687 --> 00:34:57,217
to see the scale free part of it. My

705
00:34:57,265 --> 00:35:00,427
question is, if I'm a ten year old and

706
00:35:00,445 --> 00:35:03,292
there's something before the plan, how

707
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:06,132
sophisticated is that something relative

708
00:35:06,222 --> 00:35:08,752
to the something before the plan? As a

709
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:11,497
40 year old, I just don't think that the

710
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:14,122
experiences that a ten year old has and

711
00:35:14,155 --> 00:35:16,672
the resources that they necessarily draw

712
00:35:16,705 --> 00:35:19,752
upon are the same. So I do think there's

713
00:35:19,782 --> 00:35:22,182
also a specific and a scale friendly

714
00:35:22,347 --> 00:35:25,947
part to this. Would you push

715
00:35:25,992 --> 00:35:26,975
back on that?

716
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,705
I mean, I think that we all kind of just

717
00:35:33,752 --> 00:35:36,960
operate on whatever level. I do

718
00:35:36,992 --> 00:35:38,790
agree that the knowledge of a ten year

719
00:35:38,807 --> 00:35:40,695
old isn't the same as the knowledge of a

720
00:35:40,697 --> 00:35:44,715
40 year old, but I think we

721
00:35:44,732 --> 00:35:46,470
just operate at whatever level that

722
00:35:46,472 --> 00:35:48,420
we're at. Similarly, like a baby, you

723
00:35:48,422 --> 00:35:50,010
know, like they're just doing their own

724
00:35:50,042 --> 00:35:51,510
kind of truth finding. But so the

725
00:35:51,542 --> 00:35:53,565
process is the same. Like even though a

726
00:35:53,582 --> 00:35:56,250
priori may differ, I think the process

727
00:35:56,312 --> 00:35:59,925
is similar. This reminds me of

728
00:35:59,987 --> 00:36:02,610
indeed linguistics guest stream with

729
00:36:02,642 --> 00:36:04,860
Elliott Murphy, how there's the view of

730
00:36:04,892 --> 00:36:07,985
language as the construct, like subject,

731
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:10,125
verb, object, and then there's the

732
00:36:10,187 --> 00:36:12,425
language as learned by each learner.

733
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,185
And so I'm almost hearing like Bleu

734
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,965
saying it's the same process.

735
00:36:17,057 --> 00:36:19,665
Everyone's on the same trip, but of

736
00:36:19,682 --> 00:36:22,170
course recognizes that each learner is

737
00:36:22,172 --> 00:36:23,780
going to have individual factors,

738
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,310
including like, what they specifically

739
00:36:25,355 --> 00:36:28,137
know maybe has some correlations or

740
00:36:28,725 --> 00:36:30,885
whatever with age or with other

741
00:36:30,992 --> 00:36:34,935
features. And then that's I feel like

742
00:36:34,967 --> 00:36:36,195
maybe partially reflected with the

743
00:36:36,197 --> 00:36:42,915
specific of the curiosity is

744
00:36:42,932 --> 00:36:44,430
the nine year old and a four year old

745
00:36:44,477 --> 00:36:46,450
learning the same science.

746
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,145
It's either like pansy's or unisollopism

747
00:36:52,235 --> 00:36:54,135
scientism. Everybody's in their own

748
00:36:54,242 --> 00:36:56,145
scientific niche. And so it's just a

749
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:57,810
million different granules. And then the

750
00:36:57,842 --> 00:37:00,555
other hand, the other end of that

751
00:37:00,602 --> 00:37:03,840
extreme debate would be it's all one

752
00:37:03,932 --> 00:37:05,880
integrated, extended cognitive process,

753
00:37:05,927 --> 00:37:08,085
which I wrote some notes on. So Dean go

754
00:37:08,117 --> 00:37:09,765
for that and then we'll think about it

755
00:37:09,782 --> 00:37:11,255
as more of an extended continuum

756
00:37:11,315 --> 00:37:14,685
process. Yeah, and again, I'm not

757
00:37:14,717 --> 00:37:16,890
trying to I don't want to sort of

758
00:37:16,907 --> 00:37:18,987
shoehorn something in here.

759
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:24,345
So I would always hear from people in my

760
00:37:24,497 --> 00:37:27,175
history the expression,

761
00:37:27,975 --> 00:37:30,090
well, I know that's a problem there. I

762
00:37:30,107 --> 00:37:31,260
guess you're just going to have to get

763
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:32,460
creative. You're going to have to think

764
00:37:32,492 --> 00:37:36,605
outside the box. And being the insurgent

765
00:37:36,665 --> 00:37:40,065
and the non compliant person that I

766
00:37:40,082 --> 00:37:41,685
am, I would say I would come back with

767
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,515
and I was reporting to people I would

768
00:37:43,532 --> 00:37:45,435
come back with, so tell me about this

769
00:37:45,467 --> 00:37:49,050
box. What makes up the box, what makes

770
00:37:49,112 --> 00:37:52,335
up the process? And of course,

771
00:37:52,367 --> 00:37:54,210
that didn't make me very popular because

772
00:37:54,317 --> 00:37:58,040
nobody could get specific about what's

773
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:01,110
inside or what makes up that three

774
00:38:01,142 --> 00:38:02,337
dimension space.

775
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,015
And I think it's the same thing with we

776
00:38:06,032 --> 00:38:09,000
can say, well, there's a process. Well,

777
00:38:09,062 --> 00:38:12,540
tell me then why a

778
00:38:12,557 --> 00:38:15,915
ten year old thinks in the same way as a

779
00:38:15,932 --> 00:38:18,850
40 year old Dutch. What evidence?

780
00:38:19,725 --> 00:38:23,580
What are you hooking that assumption on?

781
00:38:23,777 --> 00:38:25,590
And again, I'm I'm not, not trying to be

782
00:38:25,607 --> 00:38:28,530
a pill here. I'm really curious. What

783
00:38:28,577 --> 00:38:31,890
would make a ten year old think the

784
00:38:31,907 --> 00:38:33,950
same way as somebody with an additional

785
00:38:34,025 --> 00:38:36,237
30 years of experience?

786
00:38:37,575 --> 00:38:39,625
They want uncertainty reduction.

787
00:38:41,175 --> 00:38:43,905
That's a generalization that I can agree

788
00:38:43,952 --> 00:38:45,695
with. But what about the specifics?

789
00:38:45,785 --> 00:38:48,060
I'll give a specific in general. I think

790
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:50,715
that for disciplinary education, some of

791
00:38:50,732 --> 00:38:52,695
the questions might be very. Similar.

792
00:38:52,847 --> 00:38:55,760
Like why is this leaving group superior

793
00:38:55,805 --> 00:38:58,620
to that one in organic chemistry? I

794
00:38:58,622 --> 00:39:00,380
think if somebody were very precocious

795
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,640
in ten and learning about the halodes as

796
00:39:02,657 --> 00:39:04,755
leaving groups or if they were learning

797
00:39:04,802 --> 00:39:07,530
about it in adult education, they would

798
00:39:07,577 --> 00:39:10,530
ask that question and then once they got

799
00:39:10,577 --> 00:39:12,720
the answer, they would have moved on in

800
00:39:12,722 --> 00:39:14,660
their learning in that disciplinary

801
00:39:14,855 --> 00:39:17,220
finding out way. Like here's the

802
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:19,140
periodic table, here's why the trend is

803
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:22,560
this way. So that's not the whole of

804
00:39:22,592 --> 00:39:26,580
education, but in that mode which

805
00:39:26,702 --> 00:39:29,450
many of us have come from and exist

806
00:39:29,525 --> 00:39:33,000
within, that was the education,

807
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:35,575
that's educational instruction.

808
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,825
So that's the instructionism component

809
00:39:38,975 --> 00:39:41,085
and then I think it becomes different as

810
00:39:41,117 --> 00:39:43,450
you move away from that spotlight.

811
00:39:44,475 --> 00:39:47,115
So then a few other comments about the

812
00:39:47,132 --> 00:39:48,870
specifics of how the different age would

813
00:39:48,872 --> 00:39:53,250
be different. There's the

814
00:39:53,312 --> 00:39:55,785
biology of how the individuals would be

815
00:39:55,817 --> 00:39:59,190
different, like in some

816
00:39:59,207 --> 00:40:01,095
of their cognitive features, whatever it

817
00:40:01,097 --> 00:40:02,775
meant for that person, from working

818
00:40:02,837 --> 00:40:05,690
memory to the specific long term

819
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,085
memories and other capabilities, they

820
00:40:08,117 --> 00:40:10,737
have perspectives they've learned about.

821
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,787
They're a different, complex system,

822
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,820
but they can be a complimentary part of

823
00:40:17,822 --> 00:40:20,705
the system. Like older people providing

824
00:40:20,765 --> 00:40:22,395
mentorship for younger people. But I

825
00:40:22,397 --> 00:40:24,945
think that's what kind of comes to some

826
00:40:24,947 --> 00:40:27,365
of these notes on science as an extended

827
00:40:27,395 --> 00:40:29,285
cognitive phenomena, which is partly

828
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:31,287
what has been got at.

829
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,012
So science has many different possible

830
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:39,615
goals and sometimes scientists in an ad

831
00:40:39,632 --> 00:40:41,085
hoc way will appeal to different

832
00:40:41,117 --> 00:40:43,050
components. Like science is correct

833
00:40:43,112 --> 00:40:45,095
because there's technology, like it's

834
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,125
demonstrable or it's useful,

835
00:40:48,225 --> 00:40:50,090
not always providing a Bull hypothesis

836
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,440
for what we would have if we had done

837
00:40:52,457 --> 00:40:54,060
something different. But there are all

838
00:40:54,092 --> 00:40:57,435
kinds of different ways to look

839
00:40:57,467 --> 00:41:00,540
at it. But it deals with individual

840
00:41:00,707 --> 00:41:03,240
cognition features and learning in

841
00:41:03,257 --> 00:41:05,055
action in their niche. But it also

842
00:41:05,102 --> 00:41:08,085
refers to broader phenomena. Like maybe

843
00:41:08,117 --> 00:41:09,960
a differentiating question is can one

844
00:41:09,992 --> 00:41:13,005
person on an island by themselves do

845
00:41:13,052 --> 00:41:14,835
science? And if the answer is like yes,

846
00:41:14,867 --> 00:41:16,890
they could explore a hypothesis test,

847
00:41:16,982 --> 00:41:19,605
then that's one perspective. Another

848
00:41:19,652 --> 00:41:21,405
perspective would be you're only doing

849
00:41:21,452 --> 00:41:23,655
science when you're using this

850
00:41:23,702 --> 00:41:25,805
interpretation of the scientific method

851
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,010
and you're using science as a body of

852
00:41:29,042 --> 00:41:30,240
knowledge, like you're using the

853
00:41:30,257 --> 00:41:33,390
literature with the dos. And some people

854
00:41:33,482 --> 00:41:35,640
go as far to say that you need to have a

855
00:41:35,657 --> 00:41:38,075
career in a certain specific institution

856
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,380
or a specific degree or a specific

857
00:41:40,502 --> 00:41:44,580
training or approach. So that

858
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:46,485
is clearly not applicable to the one

859
00:41:46,517 --> 00:41:49,140
person on the island. And not that one

860
00:41:49,157 --> 00:41:50,805
of them is better, but that whole

861
00:41:50,852 --> 00:41:52,760
apparatus, that's part of the extended

862
00:41:52,805 --> 00:41:55,140
niche. And then also there's at least in

863
00:41:55,157 --> 00:41:57,990
our case, the emphasis on the digital or

864
00:41:58,007 --> 00:42:00,237
at least informational stigma g.

865
00:42:00,825 --> 00:42:02,715
There's a cognition in science in a

866
00:42:02,732 --> 00:42:04,640
different way than there's many books

867
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:07,485
you could read on tying knots, probably

868
00:42:07,517 --> 00:42:09,175
a lot of YouTube channels.

869
00:42:10,725 --> 00:42:13,675
Is there a DOI for information on knots?

870
00:42:14,175 --> 00:42:18,705
Probably not, but that in

871
00:42:18,752 --> 00:42:20,865
science is a big emphasis. Reading and

872
00:42:20,882 --> 00:42:24,015
writing the literature, at least in the

873
00:42:24,032 --> 00:42:26,055
way that we know it today. But again,

874
00:42:26,102 --> 00:42:28,635
that could also perhaps not be as much

875
00:42:28,667 --> 00:42:30,990
of a core component anyway, just like if

876
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:34,545
you point it maybe now we'll bring it

877
00:42:34,547 --> 00:42:37,830
back to this paper. But science is

878
00:42:37,877 --> 00:42:40,835
kind of the representational paradigm

879
00:42:40,955 --> 00:42:42,870
and I think Dean's question is getting

880
00:42:42,947 --> 00:42:45,990
at what is before? What's the before and

881
00:42:46,007 --> 00:42:48,540
the after or the subconscious or the

882
00:42:48,557 --> 00:42:50,425
submerged of science.

883
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,610
And when we're talking about that

884
00:42:53,642 --> 00:42:55,190
representational piece and when we're

885
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:58,185
talking about science, we typically talk

886
00:42:58,217 --> 00:43:01,812
in terms of isms what is where is

887
00:43:02,175 --> 00:43:05,840
how is when we set up our hypothesis.

888
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,820
And I think, what this paper if we're

889
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,615
bringing it back to the paper, I think

890
00:43:09,632 --> 00:43:11,240
what section five of the paper speaks

891
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:12,615
to, especially when we're talking about

892
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:16,410
the functional dimension, is the if,

893
00:43:16,592 --> 00:43:19,515
the counterfactual, and how they talk in

894
00:43:19,532 --> 00:43:21,735
there about how I'm not sure if it was

895
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:24,245
Clark or Hohwy or one of them talks

896
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,255
about the fact that so a bacteria

897
00:43:26,315 --> 00:43:28,860
doesn't typically ask the question what

898
00:43:28,892 --> 00:43:29,487
if?

899
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:35,160
When it's sampling its environment. So

900
00:43:35,267 --> 00:43:37,750
that's pretty science.

901
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,785
Yes. And I think that relates a lot to

902
00:43:40,817 --> 00:43:43,530
Martin Boots's guest stream, I think

903
00:43:43,577 --> 00:43:46,650
twelve on the event based cognition and

904
00:43:46,712 --> 00:43:49,445
how if there is an event based structure

905
00:43:49,535 --> 00:43:52,980
to cognitive events then for any

906
00:43:53,027 --> 00:43:56,085
given parameter in that model it can be

907
00:43:56,117 --> 00:43:58,335
otherwise you could say like the ball is

908
00:43:58,367 --> 00:44:00,885
rolling off a table. The ball is not

909
00:44:00,917 --> 00:44:03,360
rolling off the table, the cup is

910
00:44:03,392 --> 00:44:04,935
rolling off the table. Like you can

911
00:44:04,967 --> 00:44:07,975
start to just do single mutations,

912
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,435
especially the important counterfactuals

913
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:13,900
for linguistic structures.

914
00:44:14,325 --> 00:44:18,410
And then that might be closer

915
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:20,025
to what we've seen discussed in other

916
00:44:20,087 --> 00:44:23,315
Sims papers as the adaptive active

917
00:44:23,345 --> 00:44:25,280
inference agent. Going back to earlier

918
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:27,585
paper citing that but just that was our

919
00:44:27,617 --> 00:44:29,355
previous discussion with Sims. This

920
00:44:29,402 --> 00:44:32,650
paper has sims, like the pendulum,

921
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,250
does not have a counterfactuals about

922
00:44:35,312 --> 00:44:39,500
whether it could go on a different axis.

923
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:41,780
It's mechanically constrained whereas

924
00:44:41,915 --> 00:44:45,285
cognitive structures can engage in

925
00:44:45,317 --> 00:44:48,837
counterfactuals play in a way that

926
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,840
the pinball machine can't. Even if the

927
00:44:51,857 --> 00:44:55,575
pinball machine has chaotic or other

928
00:44:55,637 --> 00:44:58,750
types of seemingly agency behavior.

929
00:45:02,925 --> 00:45:05,910
In that space, I can be at the top of

930
00:45:06,017 --> 00:45:09,390
the ski hill prior to a

931
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:12,635
gradient descent and I can be adaptive,

932
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,415
meaning I can close my eyes and do a

933
00:45:14,432 --> 00:45:16,980
visualization. And I can also be

934
00:45:17,102 --> 00:45:19,485
variational, meaning that I can try to

935
00:45:19,517 --> 00:45:22,325
recreate through my interoceptive

936
00:45:22,475 --> 00:45:26,220
sensors a sensation of floating pre,

937
00:45:26,297 --> 00:45:29,280
pushing off and engaging with that

938
00:45:29,327 --> 00:45:32,112
process. Right. So again,

939
00:45:34,125 --> 00:45:36,585
the win of this, I think is something

940
00:45:36,617 --> 00:45:38,255
that really matters. I think we gloss

941
00:45:38,315 --> 00:45:40,260
over it or we don't even pay any

942
00:45:40,292 --> 00:45:43,185
attention to it typically because we

943
00:45:43,217 --> 00:45:46,275
want to get to in the paper it's figure

944
00:45:46,337 --> 00:45:49,215
two. We want to get to figure two. But I

945
00:45:49,232 --> 00:45:52,512
think before there was a figure two,

946
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,365
before there was a plan or a

947
00:45:55,382 --> 00:45:58,965
representation, we might want to

948
00:45:58,982 --> 00:46:01,965
ask when plan if I'm engaging in

949
00:46:01,982 --> 00:46:04,185
counterfactual inference prior then

950
00:46:04,217 --> 00:46:06,720
doesn't everything in the diagram depend

951
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:10,155
on prospecting up the nodes in that

952
00:46:10,202 --> 00:46:13,050
representation? All right,

953
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,905
do I not have to provision up a format

954
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,885
that will be potentially something that

955
00:46:18,917 --> 00:46:23,330
others can comprehend as now organized?

956
00:46:23,465 --> 00:46:26,300
And don't I have to propose alternative

957
00:46:26,375 --> 00:46:29,100
paths? As Ines, like, all of those

958
00:46:29,162 --> 00:46:32,130
things are pre planned, all of those

959
00:46:32,177 --> 00:46:35,725
things have to be present prescience.

960
00:46:36,525 --> 00:46:38,262
So we can say,

961
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:41,415
well, I'm not paying attention to that

962
00:46:41,432 --> 00:46:45,080
now because I'm busy putting processing

963
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:48,180
something that I can now transfer to

964
00:46:48,302 --> 00:46:50,730
other readers and viewers of this

965
00:46:50,852 --> 00:46:54,255
diagram. But I think to ignore those

966
00:46:54,302 --> 00:46:56,100
things is to ignore the difference

967
00:46:56,162 --> 00:46:59,535
between a ten year old doing a science

968
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:01,065
experiment and a 40 year old doing a

969
00:47:01,082 --> 00:47:04,560
science experiment. Let me

970
00:47:04,592 --> 00:47:06,855
give one thought on that. It actually

971
00:47:06,902 --> 00:47:08,475
speaks to this question of whether

972
00:47:08,537 --> 00:47:10,590
science is the same for everybody or

973
00:47:10,682 --> 00:47:13,185
different for everybody. Is this the

974
00:47:13,217 --> 00:47:16,890
board exactly as laid out that everybody

975
00:47:17,057 --> 00:47:19,860
has to play by that's like the game of

976
00:47:19,892 --> 00:47:23,210
life, the board game, not the cellular

977
00:47:23,255 --> 00:47:25,335
automata simulator, but the board game.

978
00:47:25,367 --> 00:47:27,005
There's one path or there's limited

979
00:47:27,065 --> 00:47:29,565
points of agency and then everybody on

980
00:47:29,582 --> 00:47:32,625
the board on that layer, one is moving

981
00:47:32,687 --> 00:47:35,700
through life on the same or on a

982
00:47:35,762 --> 00:47:38,495
constrained set of trajectories. So it's

983
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:41,360
like are these the immutable railroads

984
00:47:41,405 --> 00:47:43,662
of decision making and thought?

985
00:47:44,175 --> 00:47:47,640
Or might other people have different

986
00:47:47,732 --> 00:47:51,135
connections or different decisions or

987
00:47:51,317 --> 00:47:53,880
totally different railroad stops or

988
00:47:53,927 --> 00:47:56,420
different dimension or just represented

989
00:47:56,435 --> 00:47:59,415
in a different format? Is it like,

990
00:47:59,507 --> 00:48:02,160
well, here are the battle lines that are

991
00:48:02,192 --> 00:48:03,480
always going to be the case for

992
00:48:03,527 --> 00:48:05,610
philosophy and there's going to be some

993
00:48:05,642 --> 00:48:07,380
people whose situation and

994
00:48:07,427 --> 00:48:09,555
neurodiversity leads them to be on this

995
00:48:09,602 --> 00:48:11,865
side or this quadrant or emphasize this

996
00:48:11,882 --> 00:48:14,070
component, the regime of attention? Or

997
00:48:14,147 --> 00:48:18,240
is even that layer shifting because

998
00:48:18,332 --> 00:48:21,990
there isn't any stability to be found in

999
00:48:22,157 --> 00:48:23,575
counterfactuals?

1000
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,162
There you go.

1001
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,887
Back to the questions.

1002
00:48:37,575 --> 00:48:39,270
It was a great early point about the

1003
00:48:39,272 --> 00:48:40,755
rates of change being different because

1004
00:48:40,802 --> 00:48:42,915
also that does at least talking about

1005
00:48:42,932 --> 00:48:45,015
rates of change kind of evoke numbers

1006
00:48:45,182 --> 00:48:48,087
gets the scientists excited because

1007
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:49,890
could there be like a number? Could

1008
00:48:49,907 --> 00:48:52,365
there be a sentiment score? Or could it

1009
00:48:52,382 --> 00:48:54,110
be like, this sentence is totally

1010
00:48:54,155 --> 00:48:55,955
consistent with both, or it's

1011
00:48:56,015 --> 00:48:57,615
inconsistent with this? Could we

1012
00:48:57,707 --> 00:49:00,585
annotate the literature and measure or

1013
00:49:00,692 --> 00:49:04,110
do surveys or actually measure those

1014
00:49:04,142 --> 00:49:06,585
rates of change in individuals on their

1015
00:49:06,617 --> 00:49:08,875
learning trajectory or in fields?

1016
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:12,030
How could it go from just being a really

1017
00:49:12,077 --> 00:49:15,615
insightful philosophy paper with a

1018
00:49:15,632 --> 00:49:18,735
lot of scholarship into being

1019
00:49:18,767 --> 00:49:21,900
something where we can use some numbers

1020
00:49:21,962 --> 00:49:24,660
or something? So I see the first three

1021
00:49:24,692 --> 00:49:27,162
columns, organization, structure and

1022
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,225
content as the more stable.

1023
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:34,590
I think you had another diagram where

1024
00:49:34,607 --> 00:49:38,100
you were showing that going out over

1025
00:49:38,162 --> 00:49:41,505
longer periods of time, right? So which

1026
00:49:41,552 --> 00:49:43,385
one do you think is the most rapidly

1027
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:45,475
changing function?

1028
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,105
Okay, so let's kind of recap them. So

1029
00:49:51,152 --> 00:49:53,745
organizational seems to be related to

1030
00:49:53,897 --> 00:49:57,765
the encapsulation the

1031
00:49:57,782 --> 00:49:59,800
organization like brain architectures

1032
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:02,865
features of the world such that the

1033
00:50:02,882 --> 00:50:05,310
representation is separated from what is

1034
00:50:05,342 --> 00:50:06,870
represented. So like you could have

1035
00:50:06,872 --> 00:50:08,730
representation of the sun but then

1036
00:50:08,777 --> 00:50:11,862
that's very far physically from the sun.

1037
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,760
The structural aspect is related to

1038
00:50:14,792 --> 00:50:17,385
representational vehicles toot toot that

1039
00:50:17,417 --> 00:50:19,365
are structurally similar to the state of

1040
00:50:19,382 --> 00:50:21,687
affairs in the world they stand for.

1041
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,530
So that is the abstract structure of the

1042
00:50:25,577 --> 00:50:28,865
representation having some congruence

1043
00:50:28,895 --> 00:50:32,915
or isomorphism or similarity

1044
00:50:33,095 --> 00:50:37,150
to what is being represented.

1045
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,915
This one is super dependent on the

1046
00:50:39,932 --> 00:50:41,190
definition of representation because

1047
00:50:41,207 --> 00:50:42,495
someone go well, you can't represent a

1048
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,565
car in your head because your head is

1049
00:50:44,582 --> 00:50:45,462
not a car.

1050
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:50,820
Content related having internal model

1051
00:50:50,822 --> 00:50:52,940
models that either encode environmental

1052
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:54,560
contingencies or sensory motor

1053
00:50:54,605 --> 00:50:58,560
contingencies, specification or

1054
00:50:58,592 --> 00:51:00,195
description of how the world is taken to

1055
00:51:00,197 --> 00:51:02,520
be turned analyzed in terms of

1056
00:51:02,522 --> 00:51:03,775
correctness or truth.

1057
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,665
So that seems to be more consistent with

1058
00:51:07,682 --> 00:51:09,990
the car content. You know, it's like the

1059
00:51:10,007 --> 00:51:12,975
YouTube content, the car content can be

1060
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:16,230
represented if it stands for something.

1061
00:51:16,352 --> 00:51:19,170
The content of that message was an

1062
00:51:19,172 --> 00:51:21,105
invitation to the birthday party. So

1063
00:51:21,152 --> 00:51:23,940
that is related to the information like

1064
00:51:23,957 --> 00:51:27,585
the memetics, especially in an

1065
00:51:27,692 --> 00:51:32,340
actionable way and

1066
00:51:32,357 --> 00:51:34,665
then the functional role. This is where

1067
00:51:34,682 --> 00:51:35,945
we're going to highlight and hopefully

1068
00:51:36,035 --> 00:51:37,365
Dean, I want to hear a little more about

1069
00:51:37,382 --> 00:51:39,440
why this one is different. Supports

1070
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:43,160
vicarious use before or in the absence

1071
00:51:43,205 --> 00:51:45,545
of external events, internal variables

1072
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,205
of model that was discussed in the paper

1073
00:51:47,252 --> 00:51:49,040
a lot in the context of sensory motor

1074
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:52,275
detachment and there have been some

1075
00:51:52,337 --> 00:51:54,465
blurry lines down there for sure, like

1076
00:51:54,557 --> 00:51:57,135
motor replay and preplay. So we know

1077
00:51:57,167 --> 00:52:00,500
that it is on the spectrum of existing

1078
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:02,990
that neural dynamics but cognitive

1079
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:06,860
dynamics involved during are involved

1080
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:09,210
echoes or anticipations of them are

1081
00:52:09,242 --> 00:52:12,435
involved in the before and in the after

1082
00:52:12,542 --> 00:52:14,460
as well as counterfactuals before and

1083
00:52:14,492 --> 00:52:16,605
after. So what is happening with

1084
00:52:16,652 --> 00:52:18,510
internal representation and then maybe

1085
00:52:18,542 --> 00:52:20,960
how does it relate to active and FEP?

1086
00:52:21,155 --> 00:52:25,490
Yeah, so I know enough about dreams

1087
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:27,765
and subconsciousness just us to get me

1088
00:52:27,782 --> 00:52:30,660
into trouble. But the first three when

1089
00:52:30,692 --> 00:52:33,030
we reorganize through our dreaming and

1090
00:52:33,077 --> 00:52:35,100
whatever those representations are or

1091
00:52:35,162 --> 00:52:38,337
internal representation spending on your

1092
00:52:38,775 --> 00:52:41,787
wish, those are all backwards looking

1093
00:52:42,525 --> 00:52:45,470
typically and then the functional that's

1094
00:52:45,485 --> 00:52:47,205
what segregates it out is it's forward

1095
00:52:47,252 --> 00:52:50,970
and backwards. So that's to me a huge

1096
00:52:51,047 --> 00:52:57,015
differentiator right there in

1097
00:52:57,032 --> 00:53:00,885
terms of how much or how long we

1098
00:53:00,917 --> 00:53:04,185
expect something to stabilize versus how

1099
00:53:04,217 --> 00:53:07,860
much we want to act on something and

1100
00:53:08,042 --> 00:53:09,990
generate that change or outcome that

1101
00:53:10,007 --> 00:53:12,990
we're seeking. That's why I get back to

1102
00:53:13,007 --> 00:53:16,635
that search field being different than a

1103
00:53:16,667 --> 00:53:17,425
framework.

1104
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:26,615
Okay, it's a lot to think about but it's

1105
00:53:26,645 --> 00:53:31,375
interesting. The organizational

1106
00:53:33,225 --> 00:53:36,465
maybe there's some dissenting view from

1107
00:53:36,482 --> 00:53:39,090
this but this is related to how the

1108
00:53:39,107 --> 00:53:42,612
system is arranged. So this one

1109
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:44,765
can be thought to be slowly changing

1110
00:53:44,795 --> 00:53:47,160
because we're talking about things which

1111
00:53:47,192 --> 00:53:48,660
means we're talking something that has

1112
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:50,765
persistence and so the organizational

1113
00:53:50,795 --> 00:53:52,140
aspects of systems tend to be the

1114
00:53:52,157 --> 00:53:54,960
slowest changing perhaps like the

1115
00:53:54,992 --> 00:53:57,795
organization of the servers changes on a

1116
00:53:57,797 --> 00:53:59,490
very slow timescale relative to the

1117
00:53:59,507 --> 00:54:03,485
processor. Then the structural aspect

1118
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,450
also it's very important that it has

1119
00:54:06,512 --> 00:54:08,910
persistent like storing a variable in

1120
00:54:08,942 --> 00:54:11,655
memory. Like you want things to stand

1121
00:54:11,702 --> 00:54:13,665
for each other for a long time. You kant

1122
00:54:13,682 --> 00:54:15,585
the DOI to be a representation of that

1123
00:54:15,617 --> 00:54:18,645
paper for a long time. Those are also

1124
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:21,345
related to like it's sort of the

1125
00:54:21,422 --> 00:54:23,760
functional side of organization like

1126
00:54:23,792 --> 00:54:25,245
form and function a little bit. But I

1127
00:54:25,247 --> 00:54:27,165
know function is used later. So not to

1128
00:54:27,182 --> 00:54:29,040
confuse the term function, but this is

1129
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,700
related to some of the performative

1130
00:54:31,775 --> 00:54:35,685
aspects of organization and

1131
00:54:35,717 --> 00:54:37,935
infrastructure and architecture. So

1132
00:54:37,967 --> 00:54:39,945
that's also like you don't want the

1133
00:54:39,947 --> 00:54:42,465
screwdriver to be a different thing in

1134
00:54:42,482 --> 00:54:45,360
your hands that's too slow. But maybe

1135
00:54:45,392 --> 00:54:46,665
it'd be cool if you could modify or

1136
00:54:46,682 --> 00:54:47,940
tweak the tool or like, you know,

1137
00:54:47,957 --> 00:54:49,470
unscrew it and bolt something in a

1138
00:54:49,472 --> 00:54:51,780
little slower to make it different. But

1139
00:54:51,827 --> 00:54:53,040
usually you don't want to change too

1140
00:54:53,057 --> 00:54:54,312
fast then.

1141
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:58,535
But what about the content related?

1142
00:54:58,655 --> 00:55:01,580
This seems to be also changing somewhat

1143
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:05,085
faster because environmental or

1144
00:55:05,117 --> 00:55:07,860
sensory motor contingencies that seems

1145
00:55:07,892 --> 00:55:10,110
like that could change on the fly and

1146
00:55:10,142 --> 00:55:12,360
then I agree that the functional role as

1147
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:15,560
defined here like vicarious detachment,

1148
00:55:15,605 --> 00:55:19,080
including counterfactual and self

1149
00:55:19,127 --> 00:55:22,425
modeling counterfactuals, this is like

1150
00:55:22,487 --> 00:55:26,345
some of the most rapidly mutating.

1151
00:55:26,435 --> 00:55:28,200
But what do you think about content also

1152
00:55:28,262 --> 00:55:31,100
changing fast? Well, I think whenever

1153
00:55:31,175 --> 00:55:33,480
image a mistake and I accidentally hit

1154
00:55:33,527 --> 00:55:37,040
the Deneve button on my notes, how upset

1155
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:38,910
I get because the stability of the

1156
00:55:38,942 --> 00:55:42,075
content is lost. So I actually

1157
00:55:42,137 --> 00:55:45,240
see it is still relatively stable as

1158
00:55:45,257 --> 00:55:47,330
opposed to something that's changing

1159
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:48,325
rapidly.

1160
00:55:51,525 --> 00:55:57,305
So these four columns

1161
00:55:57,365 --> 00:56:00,665
here, there is a different temporal

1162
00:56:00,695 --> 00:56:02,625
aspect which relates to what you asked

1163
00:56:02,687 --> 00:56:05,240
earlier about when representation.

1164
00:56:05,345 --> 00:56:07,980
So instead of the possessive do

1165
00:56:08,027 --> 00:56:11,055
organisms have representations or the

1166
00:56:11,102 --> 00:56:14,575
identitarian action, action oriented

1167
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:17,505
representation, the definitional, what

1168
00:56:17,552 --> 00:56:20,295
are representations? This is the

1169
00:56:20,372 --> 00:56:23,355
temporal or the dynamical when our

1170
00:56:23,402 --> 00:56:25,335
representations well, that's not

1171
00:56:25,367 --> 00:56:26,610
complete. You have to say what it is.

1172
00:56:26,642 --> 00:56:28,905
You can't just say when it is well,

1173
00:56:29,027 --> 00:56:30,375
couldn't you just flip the words?

1174
00:56:30,437 --> 00:56:32,390
Wouldn't it be just the other person's

1175
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:35,775
perspective? You can't talk about is

1176
00:56:35,837 --> 00:56:38,790
without when, so why is that one okay?

1177
00:56:38,882 --> 00:56:40,590
Why are there papers about what is a

1178
00:56:40,607 --> 00:56:43,140
representation? What is it like to be a

1179
00:56:43,157 --> 00:56:47,010
bat rather than when is it like.

1180
00:56:47,042 --> 00:56:49,515
I don't think it has to be or I think

1181
00:56:49,532 --> 00:56:52,680
it's both. The other thing that I think

1182
00:56:52,727 --> 00:56:55,875
we need to maybe think about is

1183
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:59,415
the first three tend to

1184
00:56:59,432 --> 00:57:02,685
be on a continuum that's orthogonal to

1185
00:57:02,717 --> 00:57:06,015
the fourth. I can organize, I can

1186
00:57:06,107 --> 00:57:10,137
structure and I can content build.

1187
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:14,160
Function now is orthogonal stat I

1188
00:57:14,192 --> 00:57:17,465
will because it's going it's

1189
00:57:17,495 --> 00:57:20,460
used before. So again, back to that

1190
00:57:20,492 --> 00:57:23,637
temporal aspect, it's both.

1191
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:26,130
And I wouldn't drop any of the four

1192
00:57:26,177 --> 00:57:28,215
columns. I'm just saying that I think

1193
00:57:28,232 --> 00:57:30,735
that the fourth column is maybe on a Y

1194
00:57:30,767 --> 00:57:33,540
axis relative to the first three that

1195
00:57:33,557 --> 00:57:36,175
are on the X plane.

1196
00:57:36,975 --> 00:57:40,662
Okay, a few notes here. So before or

1197
00:57:41,025 --> 00:57:43,800
in the absence of right now,

1198
00:57:43,937 --> 00:57:45,855
isn't it the case that usually

1199
00:57:46,052 --> 00:57:48,150
anticipation entails something being

1200
00:57:48,212 --> 00:57:50,835
both before and in the absence of I

1201
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:52,590
wonder what it will be like when my

1202
00:57:52,607 --> 00:57:54,785
friend comes over. That's in the absence

1203
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:57,440
of the event and it's a counterfactuals

1204
00:57:57,545 --> 00:57:59,445
before, but it may happen. It's a

1205
00:57:59,447 --> 00:58:01,335
prediction, it's an expectation and

1206
00:58:01,367 --> 00:58:03,090
maybe even active inference lab. It's a

1207
00:58:03,107 --> 00:58:05,940
preference. So I agree, like even the

1208
00:58:05,957 --> 00:58:08,235
way that the authors have written it,

1209
00:58:08,342 --> 00:58:11,145
these are related to architectural and

1210
00:58:11,297 --> 00:58:15,510
performative features of like

1211
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,405
basically functional or structural

1212
00:58:17,465 --> 00:58:20,460
definitions of representations, what

1213
00:58:20,492 --> 00:58:22,845
they are, what they do. And then this is

1214
00:58:22,922 --> 00:58:26,085
even uses temporal words as well as

1215
00:58:26,117 --> 00:58:28,410
counterfactual words, though and those

1216
00:58:28,442 --> 00:58:29,865
are probably like used elsewhere in the

1217
00:58:29,882 --> 00:58:31,587
paper. But that's a very interesting

1218
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,740
distinctions. And so it's like there's

1219
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:36,090
our map, but how easy is it to just lay

1220
00:58:36,107 --> 00:58:37,790
out the map and go, all right, here's

1221
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:39,925
Northern California, here's a map

1222
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:44,315
instead of the temporal aspect.

1223
00:58:44,495 --> 00:58:46,305
And I think that also shines a light

1224
00:58:46,352 --> 00:58:48,315
actually on another feature of what

1225
00:58:48,332 --> 00:58:49,965
people would call science, which is like

1226
00:58:50,057 --> 00:58:53,385
science the metric system. And then,

1227
00:58:53,492 --> 00:58:54,840
okay, you've gone too far with the

1228
00:58:54,857 --> 00:58:57,720
metric dime, but then pretty much on a

1229
00:58:57,722 --> 00:58:59,640
lot of the other fronts, except in the

1230
00:58:59,657 --> 00:59:03,162
United States, the metric system has

1231
00:59:03,675 --> 00:59:07,605
hold as how people are sense making

1232
00:59:07,727 --> 00:59:09,240
in terms of like distance and time and

1233
00:59:09,257 --> 00:59:12,915
other units and that's chronos like

1234
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:15,645
chronology and time in the decimal time.

1235
00:59:15,797 --> 00:59:17,690
And then kyros is like the timeliness

1236
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,080
and there's other ways to think about

1237
00:59:19,127 --> 00:59:21,990
time. So we kind of open it up and it

1238
00:59:22,007 --> 00:59:25,380
just makes me wonder, okay, what else is

1239
00:59:25,427 --> 00:59:27,975
handed with the map? Is there a time

1240
00:59:28,037 --> 00:59:30,840
object? How do we share time along with

1241
00:59:30,857 --> 00:59:34,230
the map? Is that attention is focus

1242
00:59:34,352 --> 00:59:37,935
times, time Ines all these

1243
00:59:37,967 --> 00:59:40,065
other things? So how do we convey the

1244
00:59:40,082 --> 00:59:42,840
temporal aspect instead of just this

1245
00:59:42,857 --> 00:59:45,570
gene regulatory network or this is the

1246
00:59:45,647 --> 00:59:48,765
map here or the map and the math and the

1247
00:59:48,782 --> 00:59:52,100
territory, how do we bring the temporal

1248
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:52,962
along?

1249
00:59:55,275 --> 00:59:58,860
I wonder about

1250
00:59:58,892 --> 01:00:01,185
the temporal also and especially now

1251
01:00:01,217 --> 01:00:03,585
that we're kind of delving into like

1252
01:00:03,617 --> 01:00:08,037
quantum aspects because the

1253
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:11,880
simultaneous existence of more than one

1254
01:00:12,077 --> 01:00:17,985
state right, is possible. And so is

1255
01:00:18,017 --> 01:00:21,195
it possible to be like building and

1256
01:00:21,347 --> 01:00:23,787
executing your model at the same time?

1257
01:00:24,525 --> 01:00:26,955
Is it input then output? Is it always

1258
01:00:27,002 --> 01:00:30,510
sequential or is there some kind of like

1259
01:00:30,692 --> 01:00:35,090
simultaneous happening that's

1260
01:00:35,195 --> 01:00:37,685
going on there? I don't know. Oh, Bleu.

1261
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:40,440
That's perfect. For the next question I

1262
01:00:40,457 --> 01:00:42,390
wanted to ask. So is one of the

1263
01:00:42,407 --> 01:00:44,700
assumptions here that there's a

1264
01:00:44,762 --> 01:00:48,240
continuum, like if then between

1265
01:00:48,332 --> 01:00:50,415
I can and I will, because this was a

1266
01:00:50,432 --> 01:00:52,200
debate that I got into with people

1267
01:00:52,337 --> 01:00:54,810
forever when I was in education, that

1268
01:00:54,842 --> 01:00:56,475
there's some sort of an assumption that

1269
01:00:56,537 --> 01:00:59,610
because I can, therefore I will. Well,

1270
01:00:59,642 --> 01:01:01,545
I wouldn't jump off a cliff even with a

1271
01:01:01,547 --> 01:01:03,990
parachute on. There's no will for me to

1272
01:01:04,007 --> 01:01:07,750
do that because that's just not my jam.

1273
01:01:08,325 --> 01:01:11,787
But orthogonally speaking, if

1274
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:15,890
organization is on the X and structural

1275
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,120
is on the X and content is on the X,

1276
01:01:18,197 --> 01:01:21,435
but functional is on the Y, now I can

1277
01:01:21,467 --> 01:01:24,465
separate the two things out. And as you

1278
01:01:24,482 --> 01:01:26,865
said, if I go back to the quantum level

1279
01:01:27,032 --> 01:01:30,390
now, I'm predecision branched in

1280
01:01:30,407 --> 01:01:32,865
that diagram, do you notice that the

1281
01:01:32,882 --> 01:01:35,180
diagram is basically unidirectional?

1282
01:01:35,315 --> 01:01:37,815
It's always heading to a particular

1283
01:01:37,907 --> 01:01:40,785
outcome. It's always I can make this

1284
01:01:40,817 --> 01:01:43,920
decision branch moment, therefore I will

1285
01:01:43,997 --> 01:01:46,365
arrive at representational or

1286
01:01:46,382 --> 01:01:49,710
nonrepresentational and I'm with

1287
01:01:49,742 --> 01:01:53,660
you. I'm not so sure that previous

1288
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:56,010
to this that it isn't bidirectional, it

1289
01:01:56,042 --> 01:01:59,040
isn't function, it isn't orthogonal. I

1290
01:01:59,057 --> 01:02:00,405
think it could be all three of those

1291
01:02:00,452 --> 01:02:01,062
things.

1292
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:05,702
Hello. Would you like to say anything or

1293
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:09,167
can I? All right. Two points

1294
01:02:09,215 --> 01:02:11,222
I would be remiss not to make. First,

1295
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:13,942
the Tetrahedron and fuller synergetics

1296
01:02:14,002 --> 01:02:16,072
gives us a mnemonic to have four spatial

1297
01:02:16,117 --> 01:02:19,702
dimensions. So this four column scheme,

1298
01:02:19,732 --> 01:02:21,577
all of them can be four intersecting

1299
01:02:21,607 --> 01:02:23,377
spatial dimensions. They're coordinated

1300
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:25,982
at 60 degrees, not 90 degrees. And then

1301
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:28,592
the second point is like this

1302
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:32,072
onedirectional maze reminded me a lot of

1303
01:02:32,105 --> 01:02:33,997
the way that people study decision

1304
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:37,117
making and path finding or figuring,

1305
01:02:37,177 --> 01:02:39,857
whichever 1 may be in ants, which is

1306
01:02:39,935 --> 01:02:42,617
there some laboratory maze, like a Y

1307
01:02:42,665 --> 01:02:46,127
maze or T maze or maybe some branch on a

1308
01:02:46,145 --> 01:02:49,622
tree in nature. And then for the

1309
01:02:49,655 --> 01:02:52,322
purposes of the science, so called the

1310
01:02:52,355 --> 01:02:54,952
paper, it's going to be like we counted

1311
01:02:54,982 --> 01:02:56,812
them as going down a certain branch,

1312
01:02:56,887 --> 01:02:58,802
making a decision at the node when they

1313
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:02,117
went 5 branch point and didn't return.

1314
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,727
So it's like this is the line that you

1315
01:03:04,745 --> 01:03:07,067
trip when it goes from zero to one on

1316
01:03:07,115 --> 01:03:09,457
that number. And that's what gets fed

1317
01:03:09,472 --> 01:03:11,702
into the scientific process and the

1318
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,127
method and observations of the

1319
01:03:13,145 --> 01:03:15,182
literature and the statistics and all of

1320
01:03:15,185 --> 01:03:17,327
that. But then if you're watching the

1321
01:03:17,345 --> 01:03:19,697
ant or if you look at the video, maybe

1322
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:22,442
they dwell at the node or they turn

1323
01:03:22,490 --> 01:03:25,127
around or they walk down one and then

1324
01:03:25,145 --> 01:03:26,867
they come back. Or like even they go far

1325
01:03:26,915 --> 01:03:29,357
down one and they come back. So it is

1326
01:03:29,435 --> 01:03:31,117
very interesting and it's a subtle

1327
01:03:31,177 --> 01:03:33,632
graphical point, but one that would be

1328
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:35,222
almost seen as like, what do you mean?

1329
01:03:35,255 --> 01:03:37,237
How could these be undirected edges?

1330
01:03:37,387 --> 01:03:39,542
Well, what if we say, hey, let's start

1331
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:42,377
at representational FEP, it's just where

1332
01:03:42,395 --> 01:03:44,925
we're going to start today, and then

1333
01:03:45,287 --> 01:03:47,252
let's pull back to the vicarious use of

1334
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:49,997
variables. Now where can we go from

1335
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:53,102
there to sensory motor detachment? Or we

1336
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,082
can take no and all of a sudden we're a

1337
01:03:55,085 --> 01:03:57,572
internal representation FEP because

1338
01:03:57,755 --> 01:04:00,362
they're only one step away, because

1339
01:04:00,425 --> 01:04:02,317
they're both outcomes of the decision

1340
01:04:02,377 --> 01:04:04,387
about the vicarious use of variables.

1341
01:04:04,537 --> 01:04:06,992
So I hope those are some interesting

1342
01:04:07,115 --> 01:04:08,882
points and I think that relates a lot to

1343
01:04:08,885 --> 01:04:10,262
the discussions that we've been having

1344
01:04:10,325 --> 01:04:12,912
in.edu about cyclic curriculum.

1345
01:04:13,487 --> 01:04:15,527
And you touched on it I'm going to just

1346
01:04:15,545 --> 01:04:17,942
bring it I'm gain to reduce it. Not over

1347
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:20,252
reduce it. I'm going to reduce it. To

1348
01:04:20,345 --> 01:04:22,967
your point, Daniel, there can be a yes,

1349
01:04:23,090 --> 01:04:25,577
there can be a no, and there can be a

1350
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:28,697
maybe. The maybe part is what's being

1351
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:30,000
left to out of this.

1352
01:04:31,637 --> 01:04:34,277
Cool. I'll read a comment from Serval in

1353
01:04:34,295 --> 01:04:38,012
the chat, who I was also thinking of

1354
01:04:38,075 --> 01:04:39,407
when we talked about like, science as a

1355
01:04:39,410 --> 01:04:41,867
human phenomena and all of that. I think

1356
01:04:41,915 --> 01:04:43,650
she'll have a lot to say on that.

1357
01:04:44,312 --> 01:04:47,700
Serval wrote, considering many world

1358
01:04:48,212 --> 01:04:49,552
hey, Dee, I'm going to read Serval's

1359
01:04:49,582 --> 01:04:51,842
comment. Considering many world type

1360
01:04:51,890 --> 01:04:54,542
theories, is it possible that can

1361
01:04:54,665 --> 01:04:57,472
entails will? It would be a distinctions

1362
01:04:57,517 --> 01:04:59,662
property, though, not a trajectory

1363
01:04:59,737 --> 01:05:00,375
property.

1364
01:05:06,137 --> 01:05:08,897
Okay. I have to think of that in terms

1365
01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:11,487
of how I set up entailment.

1366
01:05:15,512 --> 01:05:18,722
Maybe I'm not trying

1367
01:05:18,755 --> 01:05:21,032
to duck. I think there will be times

1368
01:05:21,185 --> 01:05:24,527
when my confidence, through my

1369
01:05:24,545 --> 01:05:27,137
ability to say that I've done something

1370
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,697
before, leads me to a lower threshold

1371
01:05:30,742 --> 01:05:33,752
around will. But then sometimes it

1372
01:05:33,770 --> 01:05:36,872
doesn't. So I'm not

1373
01:05:36,905 --> 01:05:39,047
trying to be evasive, but I can think of

1374
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:41,672
times when it can entail, and I can also

1375
01:05:41,705 --> 01:05:43,247
think of times when it very much does

1376
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:46,500
not. So will,

1377
01:05:47,237 --> 01:05:50,192
it's a short English word. It could

1378
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,442
refer to something that will happen,

1379
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,857
like the ball will go to the bottom of

1380
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:57,107
the bowl unless anything else stops it

1381
01:05:57,110 --> 01:05:59,972
from doing that, or it can refer to sort

1382
01:06:00,005 --> 01:06:03,375
of that motivational ecological energy,

1383
01:06:03,887 --> 01:06:06,952
which is related to agency. And so it's

1384
01:06:06,982 --> 01:06:11,767
kind of an interesting congealed

1385
01:06:11,827 --> 01:06:14,972
word because agency and will are

1386
01:06:15,005 --> 01:06:19,537
very related. And I'm

1387
01:06:19,612 --> 01:06:20,572
just trying to think if they're

1388
01:06:20,617 --> 01:06:23,297
positively related, like, to feel that

1389
01:06:23,330 --> 01:06:25,022
you have the choice is to have the

1390
01:06:25,055 --> 01:06:27,572
agency. And that can be seen as

1391
01:06:27,605 --> 01:06:30,052
willpower. Whereas willpower doesn't

1392
01:06:30,082 --> 01:06:31,727
come into play in situations where

1393
01:06:31,745 --> 01:06:33,827
there's no agency. If you just need to

1394
01:06:33,845 --> 01:06:36,047
sit in the seat on the airplane, it

1395
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:40,622
doesn't require any willpower agency for

1396
01:06:40,655 --> 01:06:43,577
that action to occur. So I'm just

1397
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:46,397
thinking about learning the

1398
01:06:46,430 --> 01:06:47,747
distributional property, like

1399
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:50,207
counterfactuals, do we engage with them

1400
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:54,142
as a possible cosmological reality,

1401
01:06:54,277 --> 01:06:56,417
like in the many world type theories or

1402
01:06:56,465 --> 01:07:00,837
just cognitive possibilities

1403
01:07:01,337 --> 01:07:03,617
so they can be engaged with without

1404
01:07:03,665 --> 01:07:06,997
taking on like a cosmological meaning?

1405
01:07:07,192 --> 01:07:09,247
And then what does that mean about RN

1406
01:07:09,292 --> 01:07:12,227
equals one trajectory, the specifics of

1407
01:07:12,245 --> 01:07:16,342
our kind of entity

1408
01:07:16,402 --> 01:07:19,922
in motion, and then the distinctions of

1409
01:07:20,105 --> 01:07:21,527
perhaps different types of

1410
01:07:21,545 --> 01:07:24,752
counterfactuals or different kinds of

1411
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:26,852
possible stochastic rollouts of the

1412
01:07:26,870 --> 01:07:28,487
system given really similar starting

1413
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:31,817
conditions. And that's where the will

1414
01:07:31,865 --> 01:07:34,247
can entail. The can. I can start out by

1415
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:36,947
asking what if? But I still have to

1416
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:41,025
select the can the which if

1417
01:07:42,437 --> 01:07:46,052
again, at some point we

1418
01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:48,787
can see a relationship of entailment.

1419
01:07:48,937 --> 01:07:52,727
But I think as a

1420
01:07:52,745 --> 01:07:55,507
quantum question, they're orthogonal.

1421
01:07:55,597 --> 01:07:58,252
Can and will are dot. One leads

1422
01:07:58,282 --> 01:08:00,000
necessarily to the other.

1423
01:08:02,162 --> 01:08:05,072
So just to kind of play on words and

1424
01:08:05,105 --> 01:08:08,087
loop back around to what I was talking

1425
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:12,157
about earlier, can is an affordance.

1426
01:08:12,247 --> 01:08:14,562
Right. So if you have an affordance,

1427
01:08:15,437 --> 01:08:17,417
that doesn't mean that you'll use it.

1428
01:08:17,465 --> 01:08:21,150
Right. And will I will choose

1429
01:08:21,587 --> 01:08:23,692
or implies that you have some agency.

1430
01:08:23,752 --> 01:08:27,722
Right. I choose to not start

1431
01:08:27,755 --> 01:08:29,027
a fight with a flight attendant while

1432
01:08:29,045 --> 01:08:30,427
I'm sitting in my seat on the airplane

1433
01:08:30,457 --> 01:08:32,177
or whatever, because you can do all

1434
01:08:32,195 --> 01:08:34,172
kinds of things. You get many

1435
01:08:34,205 --> 01:08:37,502
affordance. And I

1436
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,962
just wonder how this ties into these

1437
01:08:40,025 --> 01:08:41,347
representational and non

1438
01:08:41,392 --> 01:08:44,692
representational aspects of the FEP.

1439
01:08:44,752 --> 01:08:46,577
Like, really, when I was talking about

1440
01:08:46,595 --> 01:08:48,962
free will earlier, if interface states

1441
01:08:49,025 --> 01:08:52,177
are a direct representation of external

1442
01:08:52,207 --> 01:08:55,127
states, it seems to me like I kind of

1443
01:08:55,145 --> 01:08:59,132
feel like there's less options

1444
01:08:59,285 --> 01:09:02,827
there, whereas internal and external

1445
01:09:02,857 --> 01:09:05,732
states have coupled dynamics. That kind

1446
01:09:05,735 --> 01:09:09,837
of leaves some mystical

1447
01:09:10,412 --> 01:09:12,787
fluff outside that I can essentially

1448
01:09:12,862 --> 01:09:15,392
leverage with my own choice or something

1449
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:16,577
like that. I mean, I don't know what to

1450
01:09:16,595 --> 01:09:19,972
call it. Mystical fluff. But it leaves

1451
01:09:20,017 --> 01:09:21,782
something unfed. Right. Like there's a

1452
01:09:21,785 --> 01:09:24,182
coupling. It's like a hidden there's a

1453
01:09:24,185 --> 01:09:26,672
hidden states there that are only that.

1454
01:09:26,705 --> 01:09:29,222
That's where I can impose my will cell.

1455
01:09:29,255 --> 01:09:30,602
I'm going to put that fluff on a

1456
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:33,997
pedestal. I'm going to honor the fluff

1457
01:09:34,042 --> 01:09:36,092
because I do think that there are actual

1458
01:09:36,290 --> 01:09:40,322
times when the

1459
01:09:40,355 --> 01:09:43,022
ability not to be captured by our

1460
01:09:43,055 --> 01:09:46,117
observations is actually an advantage.

1461
01:09:46,252 --> 01:09:50,112
So mystical meh may be uncertain.

1462
01:09:50,462 --> 01:09:54,347
Yes. And are there advantages to that

1463
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:57,602
at times? Yes. So we can call it

1464
01:09:57,620 --> 01:10:00,502
fluff, but I think sometimes we don't

1465
01:10:00,532 --> 01:10:01,887
pay it enough respect.

1466
01:10:04,562 --> 01:10:07,277
I think that relates to the cloud of

1467
01:10:07,295 --> 01:10:10,202
unknowing, which is perhaps a text if

1468
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:12,047
somebody wants to go into a more

1469
01:10:12,155 --> 01:10:14,957
esoteric avenue. But I'd like to return

1470
01:10:15,035 --> 01:10:18,317
to the figure and ask what either of you

1471
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:21,197
thought about figure one. How does that

1472
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:24,152
play into this conversation we've been

1473
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:27,347
having? Like, what does this entity and

1474
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:30,107
action partitioning have to do with

1475
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:33,452
science? Is this partitioning unique to

1476
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:35,632
active inference or other partitioning

1477
01:10:35,647 --> 01:10:39,347
as possible? Does it could

1478
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:40,500
it be another way?

1479
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:45,630
I think this is a pretty stable

1480
01:10:45,690 --> 01:10:48,835
representation, and I think it

1481
01:10:48,867 --> 01:10:52,155
does honor to the scale

1482
01:10:52,215 --> 01:10:54,625
free aspects of what the free energy

1483
01:10:54,762 --> 01:10:58,330
principle is pointing to in terms

1484
01:10:58,377 --> 01:11:01,625
of a statistical pathway.

1485
01:11:05,425 --> 01:11:08,335
Yeah. I mean, how many debates and

1486
01:11:08,367 --> 01:11:10,210
uncertainties could be prevented by

1487
01:11:10,242 --> 01:11:12,310
saying this is a representation of an

1488
01:11:12,342 --> 01:11:15,265
entity and having people know what was

1489
01:11:15,282 --> 01:11:18,835
meant by representation. Right.

1490
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:20,560
Because it's like, I made this

1491
01:11:20,592 --> 01:11:23,725
representation of an entity. I think it

1492
01:11:23,787 --> 01:11:27,175
does this useful thing. Those points

1493
01:11:27,237 --> 01:11:29,600
cannot be false.

1494
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:32,962
They're assumptions by a person.

1495
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:37,165
And what would be disagreed with that?

1496
01:11:37,182 --> 01:11:38,740
It's not a representation. Someone would

1497
01:11:38,757 --> 01:11:40,485
say there's a more useful representation

1498
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:43,387
or more good, true, beautiful, simple,

1499
01:11:44,125 --> 01:11:46,960
but then let's see it and then we can

1500
01:11:46,992 --> 01:11:48,825
use science to compare representations

1501
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:50,812
because that would be okay.

1502
01:11:51,475 --> 01:11:54,240
Right. And then you said it does honor

1503
01:11:54,270 --> 01:11:57,655
to the scale free. So the only thing

1504
01:11:57,702 --> 01:11:59,440
that kind of hints otherwise is the

1505
01:11:59,457 --> 01:12:02,635
person. And the world kind of gives a

1506
01:12:02,667 --> 01:12:07,035
scale indicator

1507
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:10,030
for this model, but without that

1508
01:12:10,077 --> 01:12:14,230
iconography, it would be and

1509
01:12:14,277 --> 01:12:16,165
also adding in perhaps a legend or

1510
01:12:16,182 --> 01:12:18,787
description of what the edges mean

1511
01:12:19,375 --> 01:12:21,115
because it does say schematic of

1512
01:12:21,132 --> 01:12:24,465
reciprocal exchanges. And it uses

1513
01:12:24,495 --> 01:12:28,110
statistical vocabulary, but it also uses

1514
01:12:28,155 --> 01:12:30,940
actual, like, ontological vocabulary in

1515
01:12:30,957 --> 01:12:34,090
the terms of actuators. So are these the

1516
01:12:34,107 --> 01:12:35,515
physical things that are doing the

1517
01:12:35,532 --> 01:12:38,295
actuating, or are they the statistical

1518
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:40,735
or informational exchanges? Or is this

1519
01:12:40,767 --> 01:12:43,015
the representation, the form of a

1520
01:12:43,032 --> 01:12:45,475
scientist model? So we're only ever

1521
01:12:45,537 --> 01:12:47,035
talking about scientists using these

1522
01:12:47,067 --> 01:12:49,360
models so we're only ever talking about

1523
01:12:49,392 --> 01:12:50,895
that kind of nexus where we're referring

1524
01:12:50,910 --> 01:12:53,440
to both loosely and so it shouldn't be

1525
01:12:53,457 --> 01:12:56,680
interpreted as either

1526
01:12:56,727 --> 01:13:00,050
of them specifically it's just dialogue.

1527
01:13:00,475 --> 01:13:02,530
There's a lot of ways to interpret what

1528
01:13:02,577 --> 01:13:05,335
the edges are and they might have

1529
01:13:05,367 --> 01:13:06,910
similar different labelings and

1530
01:13:06,942 --> 01:13:09,565
different schemes. But it is

1531
01:13:09,582 --> 01:13:13,250
statistical, it is quantifiable.

1532
01:13:16,375 --> 01:13:18,990
It'S amenable, it's a qualitative

1533
01:13:19,095 --> 01:13:20,695
topological partitioning that is

1534
01:13:20,697 --> 01:13:24,160
amenable and beyond to certain

1535
01:13:24,267 --> 01:13:27,040
quantitative analysis. Like if you can

1536
01:13:27,057 --> 01:13:29,665
draw it like that, you might be able to

1537
01:13:29,682 --> 01:13:31,905
do a Bayesian graph and then there's

1538
01:13:31,965 --> 01:13:33,435
software toolkits and there's

1539
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:35,740
implementable algorithms and then there

1540
01:13:35,757 --> 01:13:37,537
might be some quite interesting

1541
01:13:38,125 --> 01:13:41,575
guarantees or tendencies with brain

1542
01:13:41,637 --> 01:13:43,630
architectures. For example, to perform

1543
01:13:43,677 --> 01:13:45,880
predictive processing or to have

1544
01:13:45,927 --> 01:13:48,775
learning anticipation of memory or to

1545
01:13:48,837 --> 01:13:51,165
engage in control or anticipatory

1546
01:13:51,195 --> 01:13:55,465
control. But that's definitely some

1547
01:13:55,482 --> 01:13:58,875
of the most core iconography that we've

1548
01:13:58,950 --> 01:14:02,905
seen. I mean, 50% of papers or what

1549
01:14:03,027 --> 01:14:06,425
cell find out Bleu have the action loop.

1550
01:14:08,275 --> 01:14:10,840
Because what's a little side hustle of

1551
01:14:10,857 --> 01:14:12,562
you Bleu got going here?

1552
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:17,700
We're trying to read more papers

1553
01:14:17,775 --> 01:14:20,830
together and learn about

1554
01:14:20,877 --> 01:14:24,430
them. Okay, but it's interesting

1555
01:14:24,552 --> 01:14:26,812
how often this has come up. And

1556
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:29,410
sometimes authors draw on the same

1557
01:14:29,517 --> 01:14:31,300
image, other times they do different.

1558
01:14:31,437 --> 01:14:34,015
And sometimes the arrows are just the

1559
01:14:34,032 --> 01:14:37,005
clock, like just a unidirectional flow.

1560
01:14:37,065 --> 01:14:38,710
Other times there are some bi

1561
01:14:38,742 --> 01:14:44,065
directional arrows and there

1562
01:14:44,082 --> 01:14:45,610
are several guest rooms on the more

1563
01:14:45,642 --> 01:14:48,090
technical aspects there. But let's

1564
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:49,570
return to the general questions.

1565
01:14:49,647 --> 01:14:50,935
Anyways, anything else to say on figure

1566
01:14:50,967 --> 01:14:53,440
one, though? Like just on this? Like

1567
01:14:53,457 --> 01:14:56,785
what is this and how is it? I think it

1568
01:14:56,817 --> 01:15:01,775
represents better the Pyfixating

1569
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:06,310
on the pot fly than it does on the

1570
01:15:06,342 --> 01:15:09,730
physics model. And so I think it's until

1571
01:15:09,777 --> 01:15:11,080
somebody, as you said, until somebody

1572
01:15:11,127 --> 01:15:12,580
comes along with a better

1573
01:15:12,627 --> 01:15:15,835
representation, one that seems to give

1574
01:15:15,867 --> 01:15:17,680
us the maximum amount of information

1575
01:15:17,802 --> 01:15:23,235
that we need versus the maximum

1576
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,645
that we can handle. I think this is a

1577
01:15:25,647 --> 01:15:28,960
good rep. Great and

1578
01:15:28,992 --> 01:15:31,400
very satisfying conclusion.

1579
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:38,505
Sorry I really think that what's

1580
01:15:38,565 --> 01:15:41,020
not shown in this representation and

1581
01:15:41,097 --> 01:15:43,585
what I feel like is always left out is

1582
01:15:43,617 --> 01:15:47,485
the fact that some

1583
01:15:47,517 --> 01:15:50,380
states are hidden, right? And so where

1584
01:15:50,427 --> 01:15:52,285
is the hiding here? What is hidden from

1585
01:15:52,317 --> 01:15:55,540
what in this? And so like the

1586
01:15:55,557 --> 01:15:58,690
sensory states we don't even know if we

1587
01:15:58,707 --> 01:16:00,190
perceive I mean we know that we all

1588
01:16:00,207 --> 01:16:02,365
perceive temperature differently some

1589
01:16:02,382 --> 01:16:04,135
people I'm cold in this room but many

1590
01:16:04,167 --> 01:16:05,890
people would be comfortable and some

1591
01:16:05,907 --> 01:16:07,980
people like. My favorite colors purple.

1592
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,810
My daughter's favorite color is yellow.

1593
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:12,835
So like we don't perceive things in the

1594
01:16:12,867 --> 01:16:15,310
same way. And so there's always

1595
01:16:15,417 --> 01:16:19,015
something hidden from everyone else.

1596
01:16:19,032 --> 01:16:20,890
And I think that this schematic kind of

1597
01:16:20,907 --> 01:16:23,310
leaves that out. I've seen the hidden

1598
01:16:23,355 --> 01:16:26,385
states represented well in other action

1599
01:16:26,430 --> 01:16:29,220
perception loops, but I think that it's

1600
01:16:29,235 --> 01:16:32,590
important to recognize what's obvious

1601
01:16:32,682 --> 01:16:35,890
and what's not. If I

1602
01:16:35,907 --> 01:16:38,280
could give one thought there, then Dean.

1603
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:40,510
So I think there's two levels of like

1604
01:16:40,542 --> 01:16:42,985
what are the hidden states from the

1605
01:16:43,017 --> 01:16:45,640
perspective of the internal states, the

1606
01:16:45,657 --> 01:16:47,815
system of interest, the external states

1607
01:16:47,907 --> 01:16:50,335
are hidden states implicitly or

1608
01:16:50,367 --> 01:16:52,360
explicitly modeled, but they're the ones

1609
01:16:52,392 --> 01:16:54,195
that are never directly observable.

1610
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,890
They're only observed through their

1611
01:16:56,907 --> 01:16:59,965
proxy sensory states and enacted or the

1612
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:01,425
transition frequencies are modified

1613
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:02,935
through policy selection, through

1614
01:17:02,967 --> 01:17:05,545
action. So within the model, within the

1615
01:17:05,547 --> 01:17:08,380
Tetrahedral, the hidden states are

1616
01:17:08,427 --> 01:17:10,090
relative to the internal states on the

1617
01:17:10,107 --> 01:17:11,860
other side of the Markov blanket. And

1618
01:17:11,892 --> 01:17:13,560
then there's like the implicit

1619
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:16,095
Tetrahedral, which is like us modeling

1620
01:17:16,185 --> 01:17:19,225
this four field partitioning and then

1621
01:17:19,287 --> 01:17:21,040
everything that's not included as a

1622
01:17:21,057 --> 01:17:23,260
variable in that statistical model is

1623
01:17:23,292 --> 01:17:26,860
like implicitly a hidden state. But then

1624
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:29,065
what is that? But then we'd have a

1625
01:17:29,082 --> 01:17:30,435
different model if it wasn't a hidden

1626
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,087
states.

1627
01:17:33,625 --> 01:17:35,725
And the other thing I think is that the

1628
01:17:35,787 --> 01:17:38,515
vertical line between sensory states and

1629
01:17:38,532 --> 01:17:40,705
active states, if you tip that 90

1630
01:17:40,752 --> 01:17:43,100
degrees, it would look like a blank,

1631
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:45,565
even though it has two points on the end

1632
01:17:45,582 --> 01:17:49,105
of it. And I think that blank is by

1633
01:17:49,152 --> 01:17:51,490
definition hidden states. It's to be

1634
01:17:51,507 --> 01:17:54,712
filled in. So I think again,

1635
01:17:56,650 --> 01:17:58,915
you can fill in the blank or you can

1636
01:17:58,932 --> 01:18:00,765
leave it blank and say because it's

1637
01:18:00,795 --> 01:18:03,725
blank, that is by definition hidden.

1638
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:07,885
So another related point, thanks for

1639
01:18:07,917 --> 01:18:11,565
bringing that up, Dean, is there's

1640
01:18:11,595 --> 01:18:13,705
one edge that's not shown here but has

1641
01:18:13,752 --> 01:18:16,260
featured very importantly in recent

1642
01:18:16,305 --> 01:18:18,760
discussions on active and that's the

1643
01:18:18,792 --> 01:18:22,075
sigma or the mapping function from

1644
01:18:22,137 --> 01:18:25,335
number 26 and number 32, a mapping

1645
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:29,040
function of internal states to external

1646
01:18:29,070 --> 01:18:32,365
states. Now look at Axel Constant and

1647
01:18:32,382 --> 01:18:34,615
Yellow Bernard's work to think about how

1648
01:18:34,632 --> 01:18:36,010
the niche is also doing like

1649
01:18:36,042 --> 01:18:37,645
anticipatory modeling of the individual.

1650
01:18:37,722 --> 01:18:39,250
So the other way, but let's just focus

1651
01:18:39,312 --> 01:18:41,860
on the entity and its mapping to

1652
01:18:41,892 --> 01:18:43,560
external states. It's predicting

1653
01:18:43,605 --> 01:18:46,690
external states or at least acting as

1654
01:18:46,707 --> 01:18:49,330
if, or can be modeled as if. So there is

1655
01:18:49,377 --> 01:18:52,275
an edge there that we've seen in modern

1656
01:18:52,350 --> 01:18:55,030
work, it's not drawn here, which

1657
01:18:55,077 --> 01:18:57,310
actually might suggest either the

1658
01:18:57,342 --> 01:18:58,905
inheritance of a legacy graphical

1659
01:18:58,965 --> 01:19:02,370
pattern or some preferences

1660
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:04,510
or conclusions about what these edges do

1661
01:19:04,542 --> 01:19:06,240
represent, again, even though they're

1662
01:19:06,270 --> 01:19:08,370
unlabeled. So that's one edge that we've

1663
01:19:08,385 --> 01:19:10,420
been hearing more about. And then I

1664
01:19:10,422 --> 01:19:12,010
think another edge that Dean just

1665
01:19:12,042 --> 01:19:14,875
highlighted is this one directly between

1666
01:19:14,937 --> 01:19:18,310
sensory and active states. And again,

1667
01:19:18,342 --> 01:19:21,340
the clock flow doesn't have this, the

1668
01:19:21,357 --> 01:19:23,325
one that's just internal action,

1669
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:26,290
external sense, that doesn't have the

1670
01:19:26,382 --> 01:19:30,315
sense action bridge. And it depends

1671
01:19:30,345 --> 01:19:33,787
a lot on what these things mean. But

1672
01:19:35,125 --> 01:19:38,280
it'd be cool to understand what is meant

1673
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:41,755
by the backwards connections as well as

1674
01:19:41,802 --> 01:19:45,040
by the vertical connections. And why are

1675
01:19:45,057 --> 01:19:48,445
there not backwards connections between

1676
01:19:48,597 --> 01:19:50,665
action and internal and sensory and

1677
01:19:50,682 --> 01:19:53,305
external? It's like it's really a four

1678
01:19:53,352 --> 01:19:56,760
by four matrix with some connections.

1679
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,740
And that's how we've seen it represented

1680
01:19:58,770 --> 01:20:01,987
as the sparse connectivity matrix in

1681
01:20:02,650 --> 01:20:06,805
number 32. And thinking about the way

1682
01:20:06,852 --> 01:20:08,440
that we model complex systems and

1683
01:20:08,457 --> 01:20:10,225
generate approximations that sometimes

1684
01:20:10,287 --> 01:20:11,865
can also retain some other features,

1685
01:20:11,895 --> 01:20:14,425
like the highly optimistic exponent. So

1686
01:20:14,562 --> 01:20:17,115
some thoughts there, Bleu. So we've

1687
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:19,810
definitely seen internal states and

1688
01:20:19,842 --> 01:20:22,290
sensory states like that reciprocality

1689
01:20:22,395 --> 01:20:26,062
happen, but I always wonder why,

1690
01:20:26,650 --> 01:20:28,380
especially since we did the mental

1691
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:32,320
action paper, how action states

1692
01:20:32,397 --> 01:20:35,035
don't influence internal states. And so

1693
01:20:35,067 --> 01:20:37,825
for me, when you take action, like when

1694
01:20:37,887 --> 01:20:40,620
you practice playing the piano,

1695
01:20:40,785 --> 01:20:42,970
that affects your internal states

1696
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:45,615
totally, not just through external

1697
01:20:45,645 --> 01:20:47,665
states or even mental action like where

1698
01:20:47,682 --> 01:20:49,890
you're doing nothing with external

1699
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:53,065
states, it's entirely internal. And so I

1700
01:20:53,082 --> 01:20:55,285
always wonder why that action and

1701
01:20:55,317 --> 01:20:59,710
internal is there, but I less so

1702
01:20:59,817 --> 01:21:02,310
wonder why there's not a reciprocal loop

1703
01:21:02,355 --> 01:21:03,915
between external states and sensory

1704
01:21:03,945 --> 01:21:06,540
states. Like I never want the sensory

1705
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:07,965
states to go back to the external

1706
01:21:07,995 --> 01:21:11,575
states. For me, that doesn't make sense.

1707
01:21:11,637 --> 01:21:13,315
And maybe you guys have an example where

1708
01:21:13,332 --> 01:21:15,310
it does make sense, but I always want

1709
01:21:15,342 --> 01:21:17,040
the action and internal states to loop

1710
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:19,100
together to have it bi directional.

1711
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:22,285
Here's one possibility on the sense back

1712
01:21:22,317 --> 01:21:24,010
to external, but it depends of course,

1713
01:21:24,042 --> 01:21:26,212
on a specific interpretation of those.

1714
01:21:26,725 --> 01:21:29,815
A photon. Let's just assume it's out

1715
01:21:29,832 --> 01:21:32,785
there. It hits the retina. If we talk

1716
01:21:32,817 --> 01:21:34,390
about the retina as a sense state,

1717
01:21:34,482 --> 01:21:36,490
using it very loosely, not the

1718
01:21:36,507 --> 01:21:38,170
statistical variable correlating to the

1719
01:21:38,172 --> 01:21:39,630
sense state, but the actual retina,

1720
01:21:39,765 --> 01:21:43,140
it's the absorption of the photon

1721
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:46,950
that changes the niche to be sensed.

1722
01:21:47,025 --> 01:21:48,405
Like if you're going to be sensing

1723
01:21:48,465 --> 01:21:51,160
molecules from the ants cuticle, you

1724
01:21:51,192 --> 01:21:54,190
have to take some you could sense from

1725
01:21:54,207 --> 01:21:55,555
the ground the Ines that have already

1726
01:21:55,602 --> 01:21:58,030
been deposited. But if you want some

1727
01:21:58,077 --> 01:22:00,340
from the thing, you have to take a

1728
01:22:00,357 --> 01:22:03,880
sample. And so that may whether

1729
01:22:03,927 --> 01:22:06,265
that would be better understood as being

1730
01:22:06,282 --> 01:22:07,555
an action in the niche is another

1731
01:22:07,602 --> 01:22:10,150
question. But like you do have to change

1732
01:22:10,212 --> 01:22:12,820
the external state to be have skin in

1733
01:22:12,822 --> 01:22:15,265
the game. No, and I just thought of it

1734
01:22:15,282 --> 01:22:17,235
as you're saying that like the observer

1735
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:20,320
phenomenon, right? So there's that too,

1736
01:22:20,397 --> 01:22:22,945
right? Just the act of sensing it chang.

1737
01:22:23,022 --> 01:22:26,185
Kim or is the observer phenomena, does

1738
01:22:26,217 --> 01:22:28,555
that come from sense? Does that come

1739
01:22:28,602 --> 01:22:32,155
from internal states? Does it come from

1740
01:22:32,202 --> 01:22:34,465
action states? Are the observers just

1741
01:22:34,482 --> 01:22:37,537
acting in a way that might fit in within

1742
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:40,810
an action state? But those are really

1743
01:22:40,842 --> 01:22:44,035
interesting questions. Dean. No,

1744
01:22:44,067 --> 01:22:45,535
I just think you're right. I think both

1745
01:22:45,567 --> 01:22:49,695
of you we're

1746
01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:51,595
getting closer. I don't think we'll ever

1747
01:22:51,672 --> 01:22:53,640
fly directly into the sun, but we're

1748
01:22:53,670 --> 01:22:56,287
getting warmer. Yeah.

1749
01:22:57,175 --> 01:22:59,485
Cell have another few minutes to talk.

1750
01:22:59,517 --> 01:23:00,915
This has been a really great discussion

1751
01:23:00,945 --> 01:23:03,265
that I look forward to relistening to it

1752
01:23:03,357 --> 01:23:05,005
and discussing more. Then, of course,

1753
01:23:05,052 --> 01:23:07,290
feel so appreciative that we have a dot

1754
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:11,287
two as well, so we

1755
01:23:11,725 --> 01:23:13,450
can return to some of our early ones

1756
01:23:13,512 --> 01:23:15,840
free will. Maybe save it for the dot

1757
01:23:15,870 --> 01:23:18,487
two. Or if we want to talk about it now,

1758
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:21,220
I think we've blurred and fuzzed some of

1759
01:23:21,222 --> 01:23:23,590
these lines a little bit, so we did kind

1760
01:23:23,607 --> 01:23:25,840
of get there. Let's see what else we had

1761
01:23:25,932 --> 01:23:27,370
down. And of course, if anyone in the

1762
01:23:27,372 --> 01:23:29,710
last 30 minutes has any questions, they

1763
01:23:29,742 --> 01:23:32,740
want to write. So Stephen wrote, I like

1764
01:23:32,757 --> 01:23:34,315
your method to work backwards in the

1765
01:23:34,332 --> 01:23:37,585
flow diagram. Start at representative or

1766
01:23:37,617 --> 01:23:39,580
nonrepresentative assumptions, or

1767
01:23:39,627 --> 01:23:41,515
perhaps conclusions like starting at

1768
01:23:41,532 --> 01:23:43,750
those endpoints as assumptions, then

1769
01:23:43,812 --> 01:23:45,610
looking for prediction errors in our

1770
01:23:45,642 --> 01:23:47,535
action perception. This maintains

1771
01:23:47,580 --> 01:23:49,405
uncertainty in ways that does not happen

1772
01:23:49,527 --> 01:23:51,735
when following the causal effective

1773
01:23:51,780 --> 01:23:52,625
correlations.

1774
01:23:56,450 --> 01:23:58,190
That's sort of like 20 Questions is

1775
01:23:58,207 --> 01:24:01,487
framed as a game of, oh,

1776
01:24:02,075 --> 01:24:03,760
I'm sorry, I didn't know that mentioning

1777
01:24:03,805 --> 01:24:06,000
common children's games was funny.

1778
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,975
That's framed as a game of going from

1779
01:24:09,037 --> 01:24:11,135
the most uncertain towards more

1780
01:24:11,242 --> 01:24:13,220
certainty. Like if you were asking

1781
01:24:13,297 --> 01:24:14,762
uninformative questions,

1782
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:18,365
what are you doing? If you're just

1783
01:24:18,382 --> 01:24:20,155
getting and that's information theory

1784
01:24:20,215 --> 01:24:21,785
kind of exemplified you're reducing the

1785
01:24:21,817 --> 01:24:27,160
set of what you can be guessing

1786
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:29,480
with the preference to win within 20

1787
01:24:29,527 --> 01:24:32,785
questions. And then this is, as Steven

1788
01:24:32,830 --> 01:24:35,135
is pointing out, kind of the other

1789
01:24:35,242 --> 01:24:38,660
dimension. But then what does that look

1790
01:24:38,692 --> 01:24:40,675
like? And that is almost inflating

1791
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:43,160
uncertainty, at least in the information

1792
01:24:43,342 --> 01:24:46,915
theory sense. So here's Stephen's

1793
01:24:46,945 --> 01:24:48,365
question and then either of you, if you

1794
01:24:48,382 --> 01:24:51,710
have a thought on this, do we model the

1795
01:24:51,742 --> 01:24:54,275
temporal DAGs in dynamical change

1796
01:24:54,337 --> 01:24:56,660
between sensory state in relation to

1797
01:24:56,692 --> 01:24:58,112
changes in action state?

1798
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:03,887
So maybe a related question would be how

1799
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:07,820
do active states and temporal lags play

1800
01:25:07,897 --> 01:25:11,530
into our modeling of action

1801
01:25:11,590 --> 01:25:13,050
exteroception and cognition?

1802
01:25:15,275 --> 01:25:17,030
That's why I kept saying, young people,

1803
01:25:17,077 --> 01:25:20,195
when in doubt, zoom in, zoom out. And it

1804
01:25:20,197 --> 01:25:22,415
wasn't just zoom in, zoom out in a sort

1805
01:25:22,432 --> 01:25:26,330
of in a visual sense.

1806
01:25:26,377 --> 01:25:27,890
You have to zoom in and zoom out on a

1807
01:25:27,907 --> 01:25:30,137
temporal sense as well.

1808
01:25:32,750 --> 01:25:34,985
You have to think about the unit of

1809
01:25:35,017 --> 01:25:38,585
analysis both as an

1810
01:25:38,617 --> 01:25:42,437
object, but also as

1811
01:25:43,175 --> 01:25:44,765
the length of time if something can

1812
01:25:44,782 --> 01:25:46,262
remain stable or not.

1813
01:25:50,337 --> 01:25:52,157
I don't think we're naturally inclined

1814
01:25:52,172 --> 01:25:55,602
to include the time frame as much as

1815
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:58,677
we're inclined to include the did it

1816
01:25:58,695 --> 01:26:02,237
chang kim, it float, did it burn?

1817
01:26:02,312 --> 01:26:05,247
Whatever it is that we're waiting to see

1818
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,947
what happens next, we don't tend to give

1819
01:26:07,980 --> 01:26:10,077
as much attention over to how long did

1820
01:26:10,095 --> 01:26:10,825
it take?

1821
01:26:13,662 --> 01:26:15,942
I'll give a complimentary thought,

1822
01:26:16,065 --> 01:26:18,327
which is more related to the kinds of

1823
01:26:18,345 --> 01:26:20,247
models that we've specifically seen in

1824
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:23,322
ActInf Lab, the deep temporal models or

1825
01:26:23,355 --> 01:26:25,872
sophisticated active inference in, for

1826
01:26:25,905 --> 01:26:28,947
example, a three time step model. At

1827
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:31,182
timestep one, it's doing inference. On

1828
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:34,167
one, two, and three, that's learning as

1829
01:26:34,215 --> 01:26:36,647
inference in anticipation. At timestep

1830
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:38,727
three, it can still be calculating the

1831
01:26:38,745 --> 01:26:40,532
model in light of incoming evidence

1832
01:26:40,622 --> 01:26:42,777
about time step one, two, and three,

1833
01:26:42,945 --> 01:26:45,567
which is related to memory and learning

1834
01:26:45,765 --> 01:26:48,347
and all these other sorts of socalled,

1835
01:26:48,392 --> 01:26:50,777
backwards looking types of inference.

1836
01:26:50,807 --> 01:26:52,727
So there's like, anticipation, there's

1837
01:26:52,757 --> 01:26:54,782
now casting, and then there's

1838
01:26:54,872 --> 01:26:57,897
reconstruction of your recent and long

1839
01:26:57,930 --> 01:27:00,492
term past and how that's related to

1840
01:27:00,615 --> 01:27:04,197
identity. So I think the question do

1841
01:27:04,230 --> 01:27:07,077
we or how do we model the temporal or

1842
01:27:07,095 --> 01:27:09,302
just the temporality of sense and action

1843
01:27:09,332 --> 01:27:12,417
states? The answer from model based

1844
01:27:12,465 --> 01:27:14,777
science is, what's the time horizon

1845
01:27:14,807 --> 01:27:17,097
parameter on the model that we ran? Oh,

1846
01:27:17,130 --> 01:27:20,127
it was 15 days. Okay, well, then we

1847
01:27:20,145 --> 01:27:23,502
modeled the temporal lag up to 15

1848
01:27:23,595 --> 01:27:26,402
days, and that is what we modeled.

1849
01:27:26,582 --> 01:27:30,025
And that is sort of where the

1850
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:33,512
scale free becomes the scale friendly,

1851
01:27:33,587 --> 01:27:36,177
becomes the scale specific, and then

1852
01:27:36,195 --> 01:27:39,372
that's the most that it contracts down

1853
01:27:39,405 --> 01:27:43,437
to is that one specific model as

1854
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,787
deployed by those researchers.

1855
01:27:48,312 --> 01:27:50,137
Here's another question from Stephen.

1856
01:27:51,762 --> 01:27:54,762
When do we sense and when do we act?

1857
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:57,147
When do our sense states update? When

1858
01:27:57,180 --> 01:27:58,977
does our generative models update, and

1859
01:27:58,995 --> 01:28:01,547
when do our action states update? I'll

1860
01:28:01,592 --> 01:28:03,222
start with the model based science one,

1861
01:28:03,255 --> 01:28:04,602
which is again, it would just be the

1862
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:06,777
specifics of how the pseudocode and the

1863
01:28:06,795 --> 01:28:08,327
actual computer code were written.

1864
01:28:08,432 --> 01:28:10,152
Which line of code updates first?

1865
01:28:10,245 --> 01:28:11,892
That's the narrow answer. But what about

1866
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:13,450
a more broader answer?

1867
01:28:17,562 --> 01:28:19,825
Does it depend on how open we are,

1868
01:28:22,812 --> 01:28:26,650
how confident we are in

1869
01:28:27,012 --> 01:28:30,637
staying in an uncertain, nonspecific

1870
01:28:31,512 --> 01:28:35,262
space? And can we necessarily know going

1871
01:28:35,325 --> 01:28:38,050
in how long that will be?

1872
01:28:38,787 --> 01:28:41,200
I don't know. I don't know how long.

1873
01:28:41,862 --> 01:28:44,367
And what about cognition, right? Like,

1874
01:28:44,415 --> 01:28:47,962
if we expand to that possibility,

1875
01:28:48,462 --> 01:28:50,052
I knew that was going to happen. I mean,

1876
01:28:50,070 --> 01:28:51,897
that happens to all of us. We all

1877
01:28:51,930 --> 01:28:53,427
emergence. That like, oh, I knew that

1878
01:28:53,445 --> 01:28:55,722
was going to happen. Like, if I step on

1879
01:28:55,755 --> 01:28:58,197
this ice cube, it's going to like this

1880
01:28:58,230 --> 01:28:59,847
ice pile, it's going to crack through to

1881
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:01,257
water or whatever. I knew that was going

1882
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:03,222
to happen. So we're able to kind of

1883
01:29:03,255 --> 01:29:06,027
perceive things before they happen. And

1884
01:29:06,045 --> 01:29:09,342
so I don't know, is there not

1885
01:29:09,390 --> 01:29:13,067
necessarily the temporal separation?

1886
01:29:13,127 --> 01:29:14,802
This makes me think back to, like,

1887
01:29:14,895 --> 01:29:16,877
Shannon Dobson and like, the flattening

1888
01:29:16,907 --> 01:29:19,392
of the time diamond, right? So really,

1889
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:23,342
like, is it necessary

1890
01:29:23,402 --> 01:29:25,557
that there is sequence here or can it

1891
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:27,287
just all be happening simultaneously?

1892
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:28,797
That kind of relates to what I was

1893
01:29:28,830 --> 01:29:31,497
asking earlier to you. Is there some

1894
01:29:31,530 --> 01:29:34,172
kind of simultaneous update sensing

1895
01:29:34,217 --> 01:29:36,927
action possibility? And I think that

1896
01:29:36,945 --> 01:29:39,897
there is. I mean, I don't think that not

1897
01:29:39,930 --> 01:29:42,357
in a computational model because code

1898
01:29:42,435 --> 01:29:46,227
just runs like it is, but I think in

1899
01:29:46,245 --> 01:29:48,625
our model it's possible. Yeah.

1900
01:29:49,737 --> 01:29:51,597
Okay, one more general and then more

1901
01:29:51,630 --> 01:29:54,462
specific comment. The 4D spatial model

1902
01:29:54,525 --> 01:29:56,847
tetrahedral cybernetics geometry. You

1903
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:59,147
have space and time, four dimensions

1904
01:29:59,267 --> 01:30:01,302
spatially represented rather than the

1905
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:03,002
XYZ. You have three spatial dimensions.

1906
01:30:03,032 --> 01:30:03,942
And then there's like, the special

1907
01:30:03,990 --> 01:30:06,192
question of how does t come into play.

1908
01:30:06,315 --> 01:30:08,562
So some is known there and some is not

1909
01:30:08,625 --> 01:30:11,607
known there, but when and where and how

1910
01:30:11,685 --> 01:30:14,532
are of course very linked. And if we

1911
01:30:14,535 --> 01:30:16,172
take model based science seriously,

1912
01:30:16,217 --> 01:30:18,822
then they're also very enabled and

1913
01:30:18,855 --> 01:30:20,697
constrained by the kinds of models we

1914
01:30:20,730 --> 01:30:22,827
have. So maybe it's related to how we

1915
01:30:22,845 --> 01:30:26,622
think about geometry and then the

1916
01:30:26,655 --> 01:30:27,937
sense and action.

1917
01:30:29,787 --> 01:30:31,752
Are they continuous or are they

1918
01:30:31,770 --> 01:30:35,597
discrete? We've Dean Decety Costa

1919
01:30:35,642 --> 01:30:37,352
at all like the synthesis of active

1920
01:30:37,382 --> 01:30:39,747
inference on discrete state spaces and

1921
01:30:39,780 --> 01:30:42,602
then we've also seen some of Alex

1922
01:30:42,632 --> 01:30:45,850
Shance's work on the continuous control

1923
01:30:46,212 --> 01:30:48,627
settings with like the mountain car,

1924
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:52,617
which is not just the discrete case.

1925
01:30:52,815 --> 01:30:58,302
So it's just interesting to see how some

1926
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:00,177
of the theory goes out in front and then

1927
01:31:00,195 --> 01:31:02,177
there's parallel Ines of mathematical

1928
01:31:02,207 --> 01:31:04,577
development with continuous and discrete

1929
01:31:04,607 --> 01:31:06,392
modeling like digital and analog

1930
01:31:06,452 --> 01:31:09,177
modeling. And sometimes those types of

1931
01:31:09,195 --> 01:31:11,067
modeling scientifically are very well

1932
01:31:11,115 --> 01:31:13,632
reconciled and other times they result

1933
01:31:13,710 --> 01:31:15,372
in pretty fundamentally different

1934
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:17,292
patterns. Like there are certain

1935
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:19,782
equations where the discretized form or

1936
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:21,387
the version that's computed without

1937
01:31:21,450 --> 01:31:23,157
really high precision numbers on a

1938
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:24,767
computer has really different behavior

1939
01:31:24,902 --> 01:31:27,177
than the other kinds of models, which

1940
01:31:27,345 --> 01:31:29,862
gets at the importance of thinking about

1941
01:31:29,925 --> 01:31:33,792
how the model is framed and then also

1942
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:35,402
applied. Because, like if the precision

1943
01:31:35,432 --> 01:31:37,482
of the processor matters for what the

1944
01:31:37,485 --> 01:31:40,002
paper discovers, then shouldn't that be

1945
01:31:40,020 --> 01:31:41,587
a part of the consideration?

1946
01:31:44,412 --> 01:31:45,175
Yeah.

1947
01:31:48,012 --> 01:31:50,962
Okay, here's a few of the other comments

1948
01:31:51,312 --> 01:31:54,672
for by the way we'll write down any

1949
01:31:54,705 --> 01:31:56,232
other questions. So if anyone in the

1950
01:31:56,235 --> 01:31:58,827
last few minutes has some questions they

1951
01:31:58,845 --> 01:32:00,897
can ask and we'll be just writing things

1952
01:32:00,930 --> 01:32:04,647
down, getting excited for dot two and

1953
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:06,402
if anybody wants to join who wasn't here

1954
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:08,575
today, they're also very welcome too.

1955
01:32:12,012 --> 01:32:14,142
How is representation related to

1956
01:32:14,190 --> 01:32:17,672
autopoeysis? So refresher autopoetic

1957
01:32:17,717 --> 01:32:19,722
system is capable of producing and

1958
01:32:19,755 --> 01:32:21,417
maintaining itself by creating its own

1959
01:32:21,465 --> 01:32:25,687
parts. So how does representation

1960
01:32:26,187 --> 01:32:28,287
differ? Or does it differ for a system

1961
01:32:28,350 --> 01:32:30,677
that is just engineered and secreted

1962
01:32:30,707 --> 01:32:33,812
into the niche like a computer versus

1963
01:32:33,887 --> 01:32:35,052
potentially something that is

1964
01:32:35,070 --> 01:32:37,167
reassembling its parts continually? Why

1965
01:32:37,215 --> 01:32:38,800
does that matter if it does?

1966
01:32:50,075 --> 01:32:52,640
Is that a thing to look at in .2?

1967
01:32:52,657 --> 01:32:55,565
Daniel, that sounds good. I'm not trying

1968
01:32:55,582 --> 01:32:57,760
to push it on, but I mean, the reality

1969
01:32:57,805 --> 01:33:01,235
is that we can take each of the

1970
01:33:01,267 --> 01:33:02,890
different segments, the organizational,

1971
01:33:02,920 --> 01:33:05,305
the structural, the content related,

1972
01:33:05,365 --> 01:33:07,645
and then put them through the auto

1973
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:10,760
poetic grinder and

1974
01:33:10,792 --> 01:33:12,980
see what pops out the other side. Okay,

1975
01:33:13,102 --> 01:33:15,275
great suggestion. Apply this to the four

1976
01:33:15,337 --> 01:33:16,200
columns.

1977
01:33:18,650 --> 01:33:20,840
What other things would be fun to

1978
01:33:20,857 --> 01:33:24,215
discuss in dot two or what

1979
01:33:24,232 --> 01:33:25,660
else can go through the four column

1980
01:33:25,705 --> 01:33:27,410
grinder? Or what would be any other

1981
01:33:27,442 --> 01:33:29,237
question that any of you have.

1982
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:40,810
In the .2? Also we can

1983
01:33:40,842 --> 01:33:44,185
spend a little bit of time on some

1984
01:33:44,217 --> 01:33:45,960
of the comments that were in the action

1985
01:33:46,005 --> 01:33:48,595
five of the paper, specifically around

1986
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:52,695
how we face state from potentially

1987
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:54,985
they didn't say that this is true, but

1988
01:33:55,017 --> 01:33:57,535
they said if this claim is true. We

1989
01:33:57,567 --> 01:33:59,760
could be faced from non

1990
01:33:59,805 --> 01:34:00,955
representational, internal

1991
01:34:01,002 --> 01:34:04,015
representation, maybe. Could we spend a

1992
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:06,340
little bit of time not just looking at

1993
01:34:06,357 --> 01:34:11,140
the autopoesis aspect of that, but how

1994
01:34:11,157 --> 01:34:14,335
does that density form in relationship

1995
01:34:14,442 --> 01:34:17,000
to this idea of modeling ourselves?

1996
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:21,112
Great question. Here's a question that

1997
01:34:21,550 --> 01:34:24,040
Steven wrote. So feel free to give a

1998
01:34:24,057 --> 01:34:27,337
thought on it. Or we can push it.

1999
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:31,300
It was will robotics or

2000
01:34:31,362 --> 01:34:34,860
neuro phenomenology help most in testing

2001
01:34:34,905 --> 01:34:37,015
these complex temporal dynamics in a

2002
01:34:37,032 --> 01:34:38,062
realist way?

2003
01:34:42,912 --> 01:34:44,367
I'm just going to say that's a great

2004
01:34:44,415 --> 01:34:46,017
question and I think we need the person

2005
01:34:46,065 --> 01:34:47,982
who asked the question to come on and

2006
01:34:48,135 --> 01:34:50,275
chat with us about that a little bit.

2007
01:34:52,887 --> 01:34:54,837
We're just delegating so hard here.

2008
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:58,062
Bleu, go ahead. So something

2009
01:34:58,125 --> 01:35:00,452
that I've brought up, I think in the dot

2010
01:35:00,482 --> 01:35:02,352
zero is like I would really like to

2011
01:35:02,370 --> 01:35:04,677
tease apart the similarities and

2012
01:35:04,695 --> 01:35:07,817
differences between structural aspects

2013
01:35:07,952 --> 01:35:10,922
and content related aspects.

2014
01:35:11,042 --> 01:35:14,577
I'm not entirely certain, like, that's a

2015
01:35:14,595 --> 01:35:18,852
fuzzy, blurred line for me there.

2016
01:35:18,945 --> 01:35:21,072
So maybe we could get into that a little

2017
01:35:21,105 --> 01:35:24,372
bit more. I agree. It's fuzzy for me

2018
01:35:24,405 --> 01:35:28,077
too. These are awesome questions too.

2019
01:35:28,245 --> 01:35:30,117
Thanks for learning it's all. Bleu cell.

2020
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:32,807
We have multiple pages. We have auto

2021
01:35:32,822 --> 01:35:36,302
policies from non

2022
01:35:36,332 --> 01:35:40,032
rep to rep and back and forth, whatever

2023
01:35:40,110 --> 01:35:41,822
else. How does that form in the concept

2024
01:35:41,867 --> 01:35:44,657
of self representation? I think there's

2025
01:35:44,672 --> 01:35:46,047
a few Hamlet quotes that will come into

2026
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:48,462
play there. Then Stevens question about

2027
01:35:48,525 --> 01:35:50,062
technology and realism,

2028
01:35:52,287 --> 01:35:54,487
structural and content action,

2029
01:35:55,287 --> 01:35:58,167
action oriented representation. The

2030
01:35:58,215 --> 01:36:00,002
neurobehavioral systems in the sensory

2031
01:36:00,032 --> 01:36:01,312
motor loop,

2032
01:36:04,350 --> 01:36:07,440
niche modification, stigma g and the

2033
01:36:07,457 --> 01:36:09,620
digital case, extended cognitive systems

2034
01:36:09,635 --> 01:36:13,595
that include digital and mirror

2035
01:36:13,685 --> 01:36:15,175
active klaas.

2036
01:36:16,425 --> 01:36:18,615
Stephan singing 80 songs in the chat, I

2037
01:36:18,632 --> 01:36:21,545
believe. Thinking through other minds

2038
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:23,490
and multi scale integration. One of

2039
01:36:23,507 --> 01:36:26,025
Simpsons other papers. How are they

2040
01:36:26,087 --> 01:36:29,180
related? Does the FEP exist

2041
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:31,525
independently or only in the mirror?

2042
01:36:33,075 --> 01:36:35,037
Lot of ways to answer that one.

2043
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:40,860
One part we could look into now

2044
01:36:40,967 --> 01:36:43,410
or maybe in the dot two would be the

2045
01:36:43,442 --> 01:36:45,615
free expected free energy and

2046
01:36:45,632 --> 01:36:48,090
variational. Free energy and how they

2047
01:36:48,107 --> 01:36:50,275
play different roles in the FEP.

2048
01:36:52,125 --> 01:36:53,685
These are also some things, like if

2049
01:36:53,717 --> 01:36:55,260
people are watching live or in the next

2050
01:36:55,292 --> 01:36:57,830
few DAGs, then they can write a comment

2051
01:36:57,890 --> 01:37:00,690
on it or get in touch with us. Like if

2052
01:37:00,707 --> 01:37:03,015
they want to submit a question or they

2053
01:37:03,032 --> 01:37:04,670
can come on and discuss it in the dot

2054
01:37:04,685 --> 01:37:08,875
two too. Variational and expected

2055
01:37:09,750 --> 01:37:13,740
free energy. There's a lot

2056
01:37:13,757 --> 01:37:16,760
of parts to the paper and action

2057
01:37:16,805 --> 01:37:19,440
oriented representation, we didn't get

2058
01:37:19,457 --> 01:37:22,530
to that slide in the dot zero, but just

2059
01:37:22,652 --> 01:37:24,740
what is action oriented representation?

2060
01:37:24,845 --> 01:37:26,225
We've talked internal representation

2061
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:29,490
today, but then did we talk about where

2062
01:37:29,507 --> 01:37:30,935
we implicitly talking about action

2063
01:37:30,980 --> 01:37:33,165
oriented representations? Are those a

2064
01:37:33,182 --> 01:37:35,412
sub class? How are they different.

2065
01:37:48,837 --> 01:37:51,662
In our system? In human cognition,

2066
01:37:51,737 --> 01:37:55,562
there are some hard coded

2067
01:37:55,637 --> 01:37:57,550
representations that we have,

2068
01:37:59,262 --> 01:38:02,367
like actionoriented, maybe one of them

2069
01:38:02,565 --> 01:38:04,947
like kinesthetic memory and also like

2070
01:38:04,980 --> 01:38:07,952
visual recognition systems. And it's

2071
01:38:07,982 --> 01:38:11,642
really interesting that and perhaps

2072
01:38:11,702 --> 01:38:14,875
easy to apply the FEP to

2073
01:38:15,612 --> 01:38:18,642
specific cognitive systems like

2074
01:38:18,690 --> 01:38:22,012
subsystems. But it's

2075
01:38:22,437 --> 01:38:24,702
really much more difficult when we have

2076
01:38:24,795 --> 01:38:27,002
multiple competing processes. Like we're

2077
01:38:27,032 --> 01:38:30,147
not just playing the piano and we're not

2078
01:38:30,180 --> 01:38:32,357
just looking at the piano keys. We're

2079
01:38:32,372 --> 01:38:33,702
doing both of those things at the same

2080
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:35,202
time and lots of other things. Like we

2081
01:38:35,220 --> 01:38:37,157
might be, you know, having some memory

2082
01:38:37,247 --> 01:38:39,357
of one time that we heard the song that

2083
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:40,797
we're playing or something like that.

2084
01:38:40,830 --> 01:38:43,272
So it's really interesting to think

2085
01:38:43,305 --> 01:38:46,872
about representation and all the ways

2086
01:38:46,905 --> 01:38:48,797
that it exists also even in memory,

2087
01:38:48,842 --> 01:38:50,887
right? Like the memory representation

2088
01:38:54,462 --> 01:38:57,747
not a hard coded thing.

2089
01:38:57,780 --> 01:39:00,822
It's really squishy and it's subject to

2090
01:39:00,855 --> 01:39:02,652
change through time. And we might

2091
01:39:02,670 --> 01:39:05,277
remember a situation like you can tell

2092
01:39:05,295 --> 01:39:06,857
me your phone number right now and I'll

2093
01:39:06,872 --> 01:39:08,847
remember it in five minutes, but in five

2094
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:12,702
days, no, or something like that. So I

2095
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:14,997
don't know. It's really interesting to

2096
01:39:15,030 --> 01:39:18,012
think about the FEP and how it can apply

2097
01:39:18,075 --> 01:39:20,892
in this overarching way where there are

2098
01:39:20,940 --> 01:39:24,112
multiple computing goals and priorities.

2099
01:39:28,512 --> 01:39:30,072
One thought I hope I'm not

2100
01:39:30,105 --> 01:39:32,637
misrepresenting an empirical result was

2101
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:36,462
in fruit fly the Drosophila. They found

2102
01:39:36,525 --> 01:39:39,767
that shortterm memories didn't require

2103
01:39:39,827 --> 01:39:42,252
protein synthesis like just second to

2104
01:39:42,270 --> 01:39:44,757
seconds. Some sound or some symbol could

2105
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:46,977
be associated with a preferred or

2106
01:39:47,070 --> 01:39:50,522
repulsive outcome. But preventing

2107
01:39:50,567 --> 01:39:52,377
protein synthesis block the

2108
01:39:52,395 --> 01:39:54,452
consolidation of memory and perhaps

2109
01:39:54,482 --> 01:39:56,652
that's similar to other systems. And so

2110
01:39:56,670 --> 01:39:59,642
there's kind of like the resonant neural

2111
01:39:59,702 --> 01:40:04,572
structures that are just using the

2112
01:40:04,605 --> 01:40:06,850
system's connections as they are.

2113
01:40:07,437 --> 01:40:10,007
That's sort of one perhaps faster mode

2114
01:40:10,022 --> 01:40:12,237
of cognition that's like running around

2115
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:15,567
figure two. And then there's a

2116
01:40:15,765 --> 01:40:19,982
restructuring that requires changing

2117
01:40:20,072 --> 01:40:22,227
the model like structure learning. But

2118
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:24,147
that also connects to realism because

2119
01:40:24,180 --> 01:40:27,132
we're talking about the synapses and the

2120
01:40:27,210 --> 01:40:30,402
neurogenesis like of specific cells that

2121
01:40:30,420 --> 01:40:32,967
could be maybe measured and then the

2122
01:40:33,015 --> 01:40:35,397
neurophysiology and the behavior can be

2123
01:40:35,505 --> 01:40:37,572
observed as well. If we have

2124
01:40:37,605 --> 01:40:39,937
interoceptive framework like Active,

2125
01:40:42,237 --> 01:40:44,022
it also relates to Dean's comment about

2126
01:40:44,055 --> 01:40:47,082
the scales the Timescales will Chang Kim

2127
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:49,002
neural circuits cannot be changing at a

2128
01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:52,067
time scale faster than neural firing.

2129
01:40:52,202 --> 01:40:54,627
So how does the spiking component or the

2130
01:40:54,645 --> 01:40:56,667
other sensory transduction or other

2131
01:40:56,715 --> 01:40:58,572
chemical components, how do those

2132
01:40:58,605 --> 01:41:01,687
overlapping active states coordinate?

2133
01:41:02,487 --> 01:41:04,317
This reminds me to Daniel of something

2134
01:41:04,365 --> 01:41:05,787
that we talked about, like the very

2135
01:41:05,850 --> 01:41:08,082
first time we met because it was a

2136
01:41:08,085 --> 01:41:10,302
recent experiment at that time about the

2137
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:13,442
memory transfer between snails via

2138
01:41:13,502 --> 01:41:17,292
interactions of RNA. So that was

2139
01:41:17,340 --> 01:41:20,267
like an interesting possible memory

2140
01:41:20,327 --> 01:41:23,622
storage and I'm not sure what else has

2141
01:41:23,730 --> 01:41:25,352
developed from that. But also we've

2142
01:41:25,382 --> 01:41:29,097
talked about ants and how

2143
01:41:29,130 --> 01:41:31,527
they leave. Like, you told me that

2144
01:41:31,545 --> 01:41:32,877
they're just throwing up RNA, like

2145
01:41:32,895 --> 01:41:34,077
they're throwing up all the time all

2146
01:41:34,095 --> 01:41:35,672
over the place and maybe leaving

2147
01:41:35,792 --> 01:41:39,027
chemical RNA traces for each other. We

2148
01:41:39,045 --> 01:41:40,487
talked about that too. So maybe I don't

2149
01:41:40,987 --> 01:41:42,612
know if you want to expand on that or

2150
01:41:42,675 --> 01:41:44,102
does that tie into this protein

2151
01:41:44,132 --> 01:41:47,800
synthesis thing.

2152
01:41:48,987 --> 01:41:52,242
One, I found that it was a recent ant

2153
01:41:52,290 --> 01:41:55,247
paper where basically the act of mating,

2154
01:41:55,292 --> 01:41:56,622
which we won't describe on this

2155
01:41:56,655 --> 01:41:59,522
familyfriendly discussion directly,

2156
01:41:59,567 --> 01:42:02,202
infuses neurotransmitters into the

2157
01:42:02,220 --> 01:42:04,122
recipient, and that changes their

2158
01:42:04,155 --> 01:42:05,547
behavior and induces all these other

2159
01:42:05,580 --> 01:42:08,667
hormonal changes. And so the realism of

2160
01:42:08,715 --> 01:42:11,007
cognition, like the embodiment and the

2161
01:42:11,010 --> 01:42:14,637
physicality of these systems, it is

2162
01:42:14,775 --> 01:42:16,752
perturbable by infusions of

2163
01:42:16,770 --> 01:42:19,997
neurotransmitters in other neural

2164
01:42:20,042 --> 01:42:22,722
systems and in us. So that's sort of

2165
01:42:22,755 --> 01:42:26,222
where realism can't be eradicated amidst

2166
01:42:26,267 --> 01:42:29,125
all of these representations because

2167
01:42:29,562 --> 01:42:32,352
things do hit our head and molecules do

2168
01:42:32,370 --> 01:42:34,392
diffuse it's, kind of like grounding it.

2169
01:42:34,515 --> 01:42:36,147
And that's, I think, why it's such an

2170
01:42:36,180 --> 01:42:39,402
interesting and integrative area with

2171
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:42,717
a lot of contention, because the four E

2172
01:42:42,765 --> 01:42:46,975
side is holding down that real side

2173
01:42:48,087 --> 01:42:51,507
and then the science side, socalled, is

2174
01:42:51,585 --> 01:42:53,502
holding down the abstractions and the

2175
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:56,492
representations. And then cognitive

2176
01:42:56,552 --> 01:42:58,837
science especially is applied to humans

2177
01:42:59,187 --> 01:43:01,527
is kind of where it meets in the middle.

2178
01:43:01,620 --> 01:43:03,297
It's like, well, yeah, you're talking

2179
01:43:03,330 --> 01:43:05,102
about embedded cognition and active

2180
01:43:05,132 --> 01:43:07,847
cognition, but that's your cognition

2181
01:43:08,042 --> 01:43:11,500
that's modeling. And so then you get

2182
01:43:12,087 --> 01:43:16,907
all kinds of fun viewpoints and ideas

2183
01:43:16,997 --> 01:43:20,747
because of how mixed

2184
01:43:20,792 --> 01:43:23,425
and complex that area is.

2185
01:43:27,987 --> 01:43:30,972
Thanks Bleu and Dean and those who

2186
01:43:31,005 --> 01:43:33,192
participated in Chat for this really

2187
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:36,282
great discussion. I hope you can

2188
01:43:36,435 --> 01:43:39,132
digest it and learn in the next week and

2189
01:43:39,210 --> 01:43:40,722
reflect on some of these questions. And

2190
01:43:40,755 --> 01:43:43,497
anyone can ask more questions or start

2191
01:43:43,530 --> 01:43:44,997
to prepare some thoughts so that they

2192
01:43:45,030 --> 01:43:46,752
can also be involved, because this is

2193
01:43:46,770 --> 01:43:49,600
really fun. All right,

2194
01:43:50,187 --> 01:43:52,912
one question. Yes. Statement.

2195
01:43:55,062 --> 01:43:56,972
Every one of these live streams. I don't

2196
01:43:57,017 --> 01:43:59,442
know ultimately how it's decided which

2197
01:43:59,490 --> 01:44:01,002
order that we do them in, but the fact

2198
01:44:01,020 --> 01:44:03,552
that we've gone from Connor's paper to

2199
01:44:03,570 --> 01:44:06,222
Madiz paper to this one, whether it was

2200
01:44:06,255 --> 01:44:08,967
done with some sort of intent and

2201
01:44:09,015 --> 01:44:12,192
looking back to the future or it was

2202
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:14,172
just, okay, well, I think we'll do this

2203
01:44:14,205 --> 01:44:16,947
one next and see what happens. I think

2204
01:44:16,980 --> 01:44:19,272
the order of these last free papers in

2205
01:44:19,305 --> 01:44:22,962
particular has been pretty

2206
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:25,227
just. The order in which we've looked at

2207
01:44:25,245 --> 01:44:28,197
them has generated a whole bunch of

2208
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:31,975
interesting ideas, including sort of

2209
01:44:32,337 --> 01:44:34,992
the idea of intransitivity in the last

2210
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:38,397
paper now potentially influencing how

2211
01:44:38,430 --> 01:44:41,817
we've discussed this paper. So, again,

2212
01:44:41,865 --> 01:44:43,197
I don't know how much prethought goes

2213
01:44:43,230 --> 01:44:44,877
into that, but if there was some

2214
01:44:44,895 --> 01:44:46,422
prethought that went into putting these

2215
01:44:46,455 --> 01:44:48,175
papers in this particular order,

2216
01:44:49,062 --> 01:44:52,872
it's been very helpful. And one

2217
01:44:52,905 --> 01:44:56,622
other thing. If I find something

2218
01:44:56,730 --> 01:44:59,427
happy because it's true, I'm going to

2219
01:44:59,445 --> 01:45:02,712
laugh. And if I find something happy

2220
01:45:02,775 --> 01:45:04,392
because it's playing a game like 20

2221
01:45:04,440 --> 01:45:06,672
Questions or any game, I'm going to

2222
01:45:06,705 --> 01:45:10,227
laugh. So if I can't be if

2223
01:45:10,245 --> 01:45:13,947
I can't enjoy and really

2224
01:45:14,055 --> 01:45:17,277
appreciate the sophistication of the

2225
01:45:17,295 --> 01:45:18,827
conversation here, I probably wouldn't

2226
01:45:18,857 --> 01:45:21,777
show up. So thanks to both of you. You

2227
01:45:21,795 --> 01:45:23,427
can make me read academic papers, but

2228
01:45:23,445 --> 01:45:26,502
you can't make me have fun. But just to

2229
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:29,487
give it one closing answer information

2230
01:45:29,625 --> 01:45:31,622
for anybody who wants to get involved

2231
01:45:31,667 --> 01:45:34,127
with the discussions, here's our Coda

2232
01:45:34,232 --> 01:45:37,047
for the.com unit. And so here's the live

2233
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:38,322
stream table, the one that gets

2234
01:45:38,355 --> 01:45:40,767
represented on The Viewable, public one.

2235
01:45:40,890 --> 01:45:43,047
So we have all the papers planned, like

2236
01:45:43,155 --> 01:45:46,947
in this case up till 373-8394 up

2237
01:45:46,980 --> 01:45:49,077
through the end of March. So we try to

2238
01:45:49,095 --> 01:45:50,397
plan the papers in advance so that

2239
01:45:50,430 --> 01:45:52,272
people can have time to read them and

2240
01:45:52,305 --> 01:45:54,522
commit to collaborating on the Dot zero

2241
01:45:54,630 --> 01:45:56,727
background video. And then we have

2242
01:45:56,745 --> 01:45:59,127
papers to potentially discuss. And so

2243
01:45:59,145 --> 01:46:01,197
here people add papers and then they

2244
01:46:01,230 --> 01:46:04,742
click a heart. And Dean, we just sorted

2245
01:46:04,802 --> 01:46:08,492
by hearts and then we picked the papers

2246
01:46:08,627 --> 01:46:12,027
that were on the four top papers and we

2247
01:46:12,045 --> 01:46:13,167
said, okay, we're going to read these

2248
01:46:13,215 --> 01:46:16,600
four for 36, seven, eight, nine,

2249
01:46:19,887 --> 01:46:23,612
those. And then we emailed the authors

2250
01:46:23,762 --> 01:46:25,902
and so we have different papers and we

2251
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:27,222
said Cell, what dates might work,

2252
01:46:27,255 --> 01:46:28,947
because we always will prefer to

2253
01:46:28,980 --> 01:46:30,492
schedule a paper that we want to read

2254
01:46:30,540 --> 01:46:32,352
when the authors want to join. And so

2255
01:46:32,370 --> 01:46:34,752
that's kind of our first, like the way

2256
01:46:34,770 --> 01:46:37,152
that we pull papers out, like we set the

2257
01:46:37,170 --> 01:46:40,032
dates for the Quantum Free Energy

2258
01:46:40,110 --> 01:46:42,447
discussions in March and then we work

2259
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:44,472
backwards from there. And then just try

2260
01:46:44,505 --> 01:46:46,450
to not do two,

2261
01:46:48,837 --> 01:46:51,477
not even overlapping papers, just try to

2262
01:46:51,495 --> 01:46:54,987
provide rhythm and novelty and

2263
01:46:55,125 --> 01:46:58,302
philosophy and technical details. So

2264
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:00,267
it's sort of a local decision making

2265
01:47:00,465 --> 01:47:03,417
based upon the votes that people provide

2266
01:47:03,465 --> 01:47:05,887
who are participating in the.com unit.

2267
01:47:06,462 --> 01:47:08,697
And pretty random. Yeah. And just what

2268
01:47:08,730 --> 01:47:10,572
people surface? I was going to say

2269
01:47:10,605 --> 01:47:13,167
that's a pretty serendipitous order then

2270
01:47:13,215 --> 01:47:16,302
that's fantastic. It's fine. And if

2271
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:18,792
anybody watching or listening wants to

2272
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:20,962
suggest a paper for the Livestream,

2273
01:47:21,387 --> 01:47:24,267
please do so. Yeah, alright.

2274
01:47:24,390 --> 01:47:26,862
Thank you, Dean. And Bleu. So see you

2275
01:47:26,925 --> 01:47:28,557
all next week for the Dot two.
