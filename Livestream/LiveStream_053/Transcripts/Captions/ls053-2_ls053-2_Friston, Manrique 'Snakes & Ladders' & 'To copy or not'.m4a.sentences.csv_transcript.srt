1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,865
Hector: To copy or not to copy?

2
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:09,070
That is the question from chimpanzees to

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:09,070
the foundation of human technological

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:09,070
culture recently appeared in Physics of

5
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:09,070
Life Reviews.

6
00:00:01,977 --> 00:00:12,386
Let me see if this works.

7
00:00:11,247 --> 00:00:14,500
Yeah, sorry.

8
00:00:12,395 --> 00:00:24,584
So it all starts with a jigsaw puzzle and

9
00:00:24,584 --> 00:00:24,584
the puzzle is why a highly innovative

10
00:00:24,584 --> 00:00:24,584
species like chimpanzees do not live in a

11
00:00:24,584 --> 00:00:24,584
complex technological world.

12
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:32,391
So we know chimpanzees are very

13
00:00:32,391 --> 00:00:32,391
inventive, they are very creative, they

14
00:00:32,391 --> 00:00:32,391
are insightful, they can learn socially.

15
00:00:25,603 --> 00:00:42,395
But what we don't see in the same extent

16
00:00:42,395 --> 00:00:42,395
or similar extent we see in humans is the

17
00:00:42,395 --> 00:00:42,395
accumulation of complexity across

18
00:00:42,395 --> 00:00:42,395
generations.

19
00:00:33,441 --> 00:00:56,697
So you can see here in these images we

20
00:00:56,697 --> 00:00:56,697
have one of the more complex and

21
00:00:56,697 --> 00:00:56,697
demanding tasks that chimpanzees perform

22
00:00:56,697 --> 00:00:56,697
cracking nuts open and they can combine

23
00:00:56,697 --> 00:00:56,697
different tools, they can use it in the

24
00:00:56,697 --> 00:00:56,697
appropriate order.

25
00:00:43,405 --> 00:00:58,935
So this means they are very insightful.

26
00:00:56,704 --> 00:01:13,823
And yet if we compare it with a rocket

27
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:13,823
that can bring civilization to Mars, it

28
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:13,823
is clear that the accumulation of

29
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:13,823
technology across generation works very

30
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:13,823
differently humans and other non human

31
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:13,823
species.

32
00:00:58,951 --> 00:01:25,032
So the basic question, or the $1 million

33
00:01:25,032 --> 00:01:25,032
question is why does innovation fail to

34
00:01:25,032 --> 00:01:25,032
translate into technological cumulative

35
00:01:25,032 --> 00:01:25,032
complexity in chimpanzees?

36
00:01:14,995 --> 00:01:41,610
Does it owe to a limited capacity to copy

37
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:41,610
with fidelity or what we referred as true

38
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:41,610
imitation, which dean reproducing not

39
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:41,610
only the end result that will be

40
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:41,610
emulating or emulation, but also the

41
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:41,610
steps that lead to that end result?

42
00:01:25,074 --> 00:01:52,073
So according to this view, failure to

43
00:01:52,073 --> 00:01:52,073
copy innovation with faithful accuracy

44
00:01:52,073 --> 00:01:52,073
hampers their intra and intergenerational

45
00:01:52,073 --> 00:01:52,073
spread and any ensuing ratcheting up

46
00:01:52,073 --> 00:01:52,073
effects.

47
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:59,146
So possibly when copying with fidelity is

48
00:01:59,146 --> 00:01:59,146
impeded, innovative performances are

49
00:01:59,146 --> 00:01:59,146
unlikely to leave their protagonists.

50
00:01:52,074 --> 00:02:13,220
And this brings us back to the discussion

51
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:13,220
we had the other day in the Snakes and

52
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:13,220
others paper, where we said that after 2

53
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:13,220
million years ago, iliomo produced these

54
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:13,220
almond shame bifaciliflaked stones.

55
00:01:59,147 --> 00:02:28,376
But these kind of artifacts that we don't

56
00:02:28,376 --> 00:02:28,376
even dare to call them tools were not

57
00:02:28,376 --> 00:02:28,376
copied by conspecific observers because

58
00:02:28,376 --> 00:02:28,376
perhaps they were not attributing to them

59
00:02:28,376 --> 00:02:28,376
any kind of functional use.

60
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:36,457
So perhaps they were not seen as tools

61
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:36,457
and were the result of manual inactions.

62
00:02:28,377 --> 00:02:52,611
So to ratchet up complexity, it is

63
00:02:52,611 --> 00:02:52,611
important that inventions that these

64
00:02:52,611 --> 00:02:52,611
tools are copied with sufficient fidelity

65
00:02:52,611 --> 00:02:52,611
so that they retain the fundamental

66
00:02:52,611 --> 00:02:52,611
features or attributes that make them

67
00:02:52,611 --> 00:02:52,611
functional.

68
00:02:40,490 --> 00:03:10,738
So following the steps of demonstrated

69
00:03:10,738 --> 00:03:10,738
tool manufactured by an expert model to

70
00:03:10,738 --> 00:03:10,738
the letter is the simplest, fastest and

71
00:03:10,738 --> 00:03:10,738
cheapest way to make sure that copies of

72
00:03:10,738 --> 00:03:10,738
the original artifact are accurate as

73
00:03:10,738 --> 00:03:10,738
here cheapest we refer to in terms of

74
00:03:10,738 --> 00:03:10,738
expenditure of energy.

75
00:02:52,612 --> 00:03:26,892
So if the copies are functional, hence

76
00:03:26,892 --> 00:03:26,892
useful, they keep circulating in the

77
00:03:26,892 --> 00:03:26,892
group community longer and this gives

78
00:03:26,892 --> 00:03:26,892
increased opportunities for one or more

79
00:03:26,892 --> 00:03:26,892
individuals different from the original

80
00:03:26,892 --> 00:03:26,892
inventor to add in complexity.

81
00:03:11,745 --> 00:03:40,039
So, for example, one individual invents a

82
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:40,039
bulldog spur and hundred years later the

83
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:40,039
smelting of copa is discovered and

84
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:40,039
another individual adds to it to disperse

85
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:40,039
a sharp copa point and so on.

86
00:03:26,894 --> 00:03:54,172
So here is an interesting concept of

87
00:03:54,172 --> 00:03:54,172
ratchet effect that would explain in part

88
00:03:54,172 --> 00:03:54,172
why humans have built such complex

89
00:03:54,172 --> 00:03:54,172
cultural and technological work.

90
00:03:43,062 --> 00:03:59,220
So the idea of the ratchet effect is that

91
00:03:59,220 --> 00:03:59,220
no generation starts from scratch.

92
00:03:54,173 --> 00:04:06,237
Instead, inventions and cultural products

93
00:04:06,237 --> 00:04:06,237
created by one generation are kept in

94
00:04:06,237 --> 00:04:06,237
mind and transmitted to the next

95
00:04:06,237 --> 00:04:06,237
generation.

96
00:03:59,221 --> 00:04:12,295
This way, every generation is better off

97
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:12,295
supposedly, than the one that preceded

98
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:12,295
it.

99
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:14,316
So here we can think of books.

100
00:04:12,297 --> 00:04:23,406
Books are a wonderful way of keeping

101
00:04:23,406 --> 00:04:23,406
information, sharing it across

102
00:04:23,406 --> 00:04:23,406
generations and among the same generation

103
00:04:23,406 --> 00:04:23,406
also.

104
00:04:14,316 --> 00:04:32,493
So thus, technological complexity and

105
00:04:32,493 --> 00:04:32,493
success in humans is not dependent solely

106
00:04:32,493 --> 00:04:32,493
on the geniality of one or few

107
00:04:32,493 --> 00:04:32,493
individuals.

108
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:40,577
It is a joint endeavor where many

109
00:04:40,577 --> 00:04:40,577
individuals contribute their specific

110
00:04:40,577 --> 00:04:40,577
expertise and skills to produce

111
00:04:40,577 --> 00:04:40,577
increasingly complex artifacts.

112
00:04:32,494 --> 00:04:52,689
And again, we can think in establishing a

113
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:52,689
colony in Mars, no single human alive

114
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:52,689
could achieve that alone, or would have

115
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:52,689
the required expertise to achieve that

116
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:52,689
alone.

117
00:04:40,578 --> 00:04:55,722
But altogether we can perhaps manage

118
00:04:55,722 --> 00:04:55,722
that.

119
00:04:52,690 --> 00:05:01,721
So we need this kind of shared knowledge

120
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:01,721
and accumulated across generations, of

121
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:01,721
course.

122
00:04:55,722 --> 00:05:17,880
So why it is some behaviors or innovation

123
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:17,880
are copied or not can be explained at the

124
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:17,880
level of social dynamics, but also at the

125
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:17,880
level of the brain or giving a more

126
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:17,880
mechanistic explanation.

127
00:05:03,744 --> 00:05:37,081
So explanation of why copinoffs are

128
00:05:37,081 --> 00:05:37,081
behavior and sympathies does not occur

129
00:05:37,081 --> 00:05:37,081
with frequency, have been often kept at

130
00:05:37,081 --> 00:05:37,081
the level of social dynamics where

131
00:05:37,081 --> 00:05:37,081
factors such as social prestige,

132
00:05:37,081 --> 00:05:37,081
dominance, et cetera, are said to be key

133
00:05:37,081 --> 00:05:37,081
to explaining whether or not an invention

134
00:05:37,081 --> 00:05:37,081
is adopted by observers and this approval

135
00:05:37,081 --> 00:05:37,081
against the brain to a subsidiary role.

136
00:05:17,881 --> 00:05:48,193
Here, Michael and I, what we attempt is

137
00:05:48,193 --> 00:05:48,193
to identify what the minimum cognitive

138
00:05:48,193 --> 00:05:48,193
requirements are that can give rise to

139
00:05:48,193 --> 00:05:48,193
innovations and their horizontal and

140
00:05:48,193 --> 00:05:48,193
vertical transmission.

141
00:05:37,082 --> 00:05:58,292
And we also attempted to differentiate

142
00:05:58,292 --> 00:05:58,292
the cognitive ingredients necessary for

143
00:05:58,292 --> 00:05:58,292
innovation from those that need to be in

144
00:05:58,292 --> 00:05:58,292
place for the adoption of an innovation.

145
00:05:48,197 --> 00:06:10,354
So we wanted to establish a clear

146
00:06:10,354 --> 00:06:10,354
demarcation between the brains of the

147
00:06:10,354 --> 00:06:10,354
ones that innovate and the brains of

148
00:06:10,354 --> 00:06:10,354
those who observe an innovation, because

149
00:06:10,354 --> 00:06:10,354
we think this is important to be analyzed

150
00:06:10,354 --> 00:06:10,354
separately.

151
00:05:58,295 --> 00:06:26,515
So in order to see which are the

152
00:06:26,515 --> 00:06:26,515
mechanisms at the level of the brain that

153
00:06:26,515 --> 00:06:26,515
would allow for one innovation to be

154
00:06:26,515 --> 00:06:26,515
copied, we invoked the lens of the free

155
00:06:26,515 --> 00:06:26,515
energy principle according to active

156
00:06:26,515 --> 00:06:26,515
inference.

157
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:28,532
Under the free energy principle.

158
00:06:26,516 --> 00:06:54,797
It is through there being limited to a

159
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:54,797
restricted number of states that is the

160
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:54,797
attracting set that organisms minimize

161
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:54,797
the variational free energy of the

162
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:54,797
internal states and resist entropic

163
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:54,797
dissipation minimizing variation of free

164
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:54,797
energy reduces prediction sensation

165
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:54,797
discrepancies prediction errors that can

166
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:54,797
be corrected by active sampling of

167
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:54,797
predictive sensory inputs and perceptive

168
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:54,797
modification ActInf prediction.

169
00:06:28,534 --> 00:07:06,859
This is sometimes expressed in terms of

170
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:06,859
perceptual inference, that is, changing

171
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:06,859
predictions to match sensations and

172
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:06,859
active inference reactively changing

173
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:06,859
sensations to match predictions.

174
00:06:55,802 --> 00:07:16,959
So innovation, in a way might represent

175
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:16,959
potential misfirings from otherwinian

176
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:16,959
perspective.

177
00:07:09,883 --> 00:07:31,109
So minimizing variation of free energy

178
00:07:31,109 --> 00:07:31,109
can be achieved through action sensing

179
00:07:31,109 --> 00:07:31,109
creatures can act active inference in

180
00:07:31,109 --> 00:07:31,109
order to fulfill their predictions and

181
00:07:31,109 --> 00:07:31,109
thereby reduce discrepancy between the

182
00:07:31,109 --> 00:07:31,109
latter and sample reality being limited

183
00:07:31,109 --> 00:07:31,109
to restricted number of states.

184
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:41,205
What we could refer to as the attracting

185
00:07:41,205 --> 00:07:41,205
set is therefore synonymous with

186
00:07:41,205 --> 00:07:41,205
minimizing variation of energy and hence

187
00:07:41,205 --> 00:07:41,205
maximizing adaptive fitness.

188
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:55,347
Here innovation represent an anomaly and

189
00:07:55,347 --> 00:07:55,347
innovators are unorthodox actors or

190
00:07:55,347 --> 00:07:55,347
protagonists who entertain new courses of

191
00:07:55,347 --> 00:07:55,347
action or plans new phenotypical

192
00:07:55,347 --> 00:07:55,347
responses that have not been previously

193
00:07:55,347 --> 00:07:55,347
entertained.

194
00:07:42,216 --> 00:08:04,372
And according to this interpretation of

195
00:08:04,372 --> 00:08:04,372
the free energy principle it is at the

196
00:08:04,372 --> 00:08:04,372
level of policy selection where

197
00:08:04,372 --> 00:08:04,372
innovators stand apart from the crowd.

198
00:07:56,351 --> 00:08:20,536
Their policy selection is in a sense

199
00:08:20,536 --> 00:08:20,536
faulty insofar as their ensuing

200
00:08:20,536 --> 00:08:20,536
behavioral outcomes are in mark contrast

201
00:08:20,536 --> 00:08:20,536
to those of their fellow actors who

202
00:08:20,536 --> 00:08:20,536
deploy orthodox responses that reduce

203
00:08:20,536 --> 00:08:20,536
discrepancies between predictions and

204
00:08:20,536 --> 00:08:20,536
sensations thereby reducing the

205
00:08:20,536 --> 00:08:20,536
prediction error.

206
00:08:04,373 --> 00:08:33,661
Here when we talk of misfiring we don't

207
00:08:33,661 --> 00:08:33,661
do it in a kind of negative sense it's

208
00:08:33,661 --> 00:08:33,661
just to express that these new behaviors,

209
00:08:33,661 --> 00:08:33,661
these innovations necessarily will

210
00:08:33,661 --> 00:08:33,661
produce more surprise.

211
00:08:20,537 --> 00:08:36,696
Okay.

212
00:08:35,688 --> 00:08:39,729
Seeing surprising things with this

213
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:39,729
phrase.

214
00:08:36,698 --> 00:08:46,794
I'm kind of paraphrasing Andy Clark in a

215
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:46,794
paper in Behavioral Brain Sciences.

216
00:08:40,732 --> 00:08:55,886
He referred to seeing surprising things

217
00:08:55,886 --> 00:08:55,886
to being able to lend credibility to

218
00:08:55,886 --> 00:08:55,886
essential information that is not in

219
00:08:55,886 --> 00:08:55,886
accordance to prior beliefs.

220
00:08:46,795 --> 00:09:07,946
So the family authority density is

221
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:07,946
entertained by an individual irrespective

222
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:07,946
to the systems the brains prior bias and

223
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:07,946
beliefs equivalent, roughly speaking, to

224
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:07,946
its phenotypical repertoire.

225
00:08:56,891 --> 00:09:18,056
This means by definition that innovative

226
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:18,056
behavior is both unlikely to be evinced

227
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:18,056
in any given phenotype and crucially

228
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:18,056
difficult to recognize when observed by

229
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:18,056
nava.

230
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:36,230
Should an innovator's behavior diverge

231
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,230
markedly from ActInf inference of

232
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,230
plausible policies used usually by an

233
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,230
observer to predict another's behavior it

234
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,230
may be beyond the capacity of the

235
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,230
latter's generative model to recognize

236
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,230
it, that is, to make sense of it.

237
00:09:19,065 --> 00:09:49,359
So large discrepancies pose a threat to

238
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:49,359
the brain because one updating involves

239
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:49,359
making energetic demands and two risk

240
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:49,359
reducing adaptive fitness by

241
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:49,359
inappropriately changing the generative

242
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:49,359
models.

243
00:09:36,232 --> 00:09:57,448
And here we need to think that the

244
00:09:57,448 --> 00:09:57,448
generative model has been selected also

245
00:09:57,448 --> 00:09:57,448
in a specific economy so changing it

246
00:09:57,448 --> 00:09:57,448
might have risked.

247
00:09:49,360 --> 00:10:08,490
Okay, so what is required for a brain to

248
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:08,490
entertain generative models that involve

249
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:08,490
unusual or bizarre behaviors?

250
00:09:57,448 --> 00:10:32,730
The hierarchical predictive

251
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:32,730
interpretation of the brain or

252
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:32,730
hierarchically mechanistic mind an

253
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:32,730
inference machine sorry implies that each

254
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:32,730
level of the hierarchy of several

255
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:32,730
neuronal circuits conveys predictions or

256
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:32,730
conditional expectations that suppress

257
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:32,730
errors at the level below while

258
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:32,730
concurrently conveying errors that permit

259
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:32,730
the revision of the expectations at the

260
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:32,730
level above.

261
00:10:08,496 --> 00:10:44,854
Plausibly dynamical precision weighting

262
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:44,854
enables the system, that is the brain to

263
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:44,854
readjust the confidence afforded to top

264
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:44,854
down expectations as opposed to bottom up

265
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:44,854
prediction error.

266
00:10:32,734 --> 00:11:01,967
In other words, in order to entertain a

267
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:01,967
prior that an unlikely hypothesis might

268
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:01,967
explain best and behavior weakness it is

269
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:01,967
first necessary to relax the precision or

270
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:01,967
commitment to prior beliefs thus enabling

271
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:01,967
new or impossible hypotheses to explain

272
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:01,967
novel behavior.

273
00:10:44,857 --> 00:11:08,034
And here I introduce some things we

274
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:08,034
discussed the other day.

275
00:11:02,978 --> 00:11:23,180
Professor Friston talk of attenuation of

276
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:23,180
sensory information in relation to

277
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:23,180
Sacade, which is kind of switching off

278
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:23,180
this sensory information we are being

279
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:23,180
aware of and that would be the opposite

280
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:23,180
as being impressionable.

281
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:28,232
So I'm quoting Professor Friston here.

282
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:31,263
If I can copy that means I am

283
00:11:31,263 --> 00:11:31,263
impressionable.

284
00:11:28,234 --> 00:11:34,290
I will accumulate new evidence very

285
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:34,290
quickly.

286
00:11:31,264 --> 00:11:41,365
I have the capacity to assign greater

287
00:11:41,365 --> 00:11:41,365
evidence or precision to sensory evidence

288
00:11:41,365 --> 00:11:41,365
and suspend the precision to my prior

289
00:11:41,365 --> 00:11:41,365
beliefs.

290
00:11:34,291 --> 00:12:03,526
This is something he mentioned in the

291
00:12:03,526 --> 00:12:03,526
Least Action inference recording 53.1.1

292
00:12:03,526 --> 00:12:03,526
and to end this introduction, one concept

293
00:12:03,526 --> 00:12:03,526
we introduced in our paper which is

294
00:12:03,526 --> 00:12:03,526
central to our discussion is that of

295
00:12:03,526 --> 00:12:03,526
sounds abundant surprising.

296
00:11:43,380 --> 00:12:14,634
So this is a new concept we introduced to

297
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:14,634
refer to the levels of mismatch between

298
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:14,634
prior beliefs or top down predictions and

299
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:14,634
sensory information that a species can

300
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:14,634
tolerate.

301
00:12:03,527 --> 00:12:24,735
So first and foremost the focus of the

302
00:12:24,735 --> 00:12:24,735
said BS concept is on the observers and

303
00:12:24,735 --> 00:12:24,735
their ability to make sense of unobserved

304
00:12:24,735 --> 00:12:24,735
innovation.

305
00:12:14,636 --> 00:12:39,882
Encoding and subsequent copying of an

306
00:12:39,882 --> 00:12:39,882
innovation depends on the degree of

307
00:12:39,882 --> 00:12:39,882
disparity or surprisal between

308
00:12:39,882 --> 00:12:39,882
predictable behaviors, namely those

309
00:12:39,882 --> 00:12:39,882
typical of the species and the perceptual

310
00:12:39,882 --> 00:12:39,882
incoming information about novel

311
00:12:39,882 --> 00:12:39,882
behaviors.

312
00:12:25,742 --> 00:12:48,971
If the said BS is wide, it means that a

313
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:48,971
species can give credit to the

314
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:48,971
information received through its senses

315
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:48,971
that challenges the prior beliefs.

316
00:12:39,884 --> 00:13:00,032
In short, a species can register, encode

317
00:13:00,032 --> 00:13:00,032
and potentially reproduce innovative

318
00:13:00,032 --> 00:13:00,032
behavior, observing code specifics that

319
00:13:00,032 --> 00:13:00,032
deviate markedly from customary

320
00:13:00,032 --> 00:13:00,032
prototypical behaviors.

321
00:12:48,973 --> 00:13:06,099
The species is highly impressionable if

322
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:06,099
we use the words that Professor Friston

323
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:06,099
used the other day.

324
00:13:00,034 --> 00:13:18,211
So if the CBS is narrow, then a species

325
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:18,211
ability to change prior beliefs to

326
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:18,211
accommodate new evidence regarding

327
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:18,211
innovative practices of serving on

328
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:18,211
specifics is compromised.

329
00:13:07,101 --> 00:13:23,264
I just went up and avoid any kind of

330
00:13:23,264 --> 00:13:23,264
misunderstanding.

331
00:13:19,227 --> 00:13:33,365
Want to make clear that our sons abundant

332
00:13:33,365 --> 00:13:33,365
surprises have nothing to do with the son

333
00:13:33,365 --> 00:13:33,365
of Latin solutions by tena, albeit we are

334
00:13:33,365 --> 00:13:33,365
discussing similar topics.

335
00:13:23,264 --> 00:13:56,598
So the son of Latin solutions that was

336
00:13:56,598 --> 00:13:56,598
introduced by Tania Kai and Tomo Acelo

337
00:13:56,598 --> 00:13:56,598
refers to solutions to a problem, for

338
00:13:56,598 --> 00:13:56,598
instance extractive foraging that can be

339
00:13:56,598 --> 00:13:56,598
achieved by an individual in isolation

340
00:13:56,598 --> 00:13:56,598
during his her lifetime and hence is not

341
00:13:56,598 --> 00:13:56,598
likely to be the product of commodity

342
00:13:56,598 --> 00:13:56,598
culture involving social learning when

343
00:13:56,598 --> 00:13:56,598
observed in the wild.

344
00:13:33,366 --> 00:14:06,630
And for those readers interested in this

345
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:06,630
concept, they can go to the original

346
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:06,630
paper I'm showing here.

347
00:13:57,601 --> 00:14:14,711
And also there is recent paper by Andrea

348
00:14:14,711 --> 00:14:14,711
Whiten who is professor in St.

349
00:14:06,632 --> 00:14:20,772
Andrews that discusses this concept and

350
00:14:20,772 --> 00:14:20,772
that has replication by other authors.

351
00:14:14,711 --> 00:14:23,806
So it might be a good update for those

352
00:14:23,806 --> 00:14:23,806
interested also.

353
00:14:20,772 --> 00:14:28,855
And with that I finish this short

354
00:14:28,855 --> 00:14:28,855
presentation and we can enter

355
00:14:28,855 --> 00:14:28,855
discussion.

356
00:14:23,808 --> 00:14:32,893
Let me stop sharing screen I think.

357
00:14:28,859 --> 00:14:39,968
Daniel: Okay now thank you Hector, I will

358
00:14:39,968 --> 00:14:39,968
bring up the notes again.

359
00:14:32,893 --> 00:14:46,031
And to Michael, Carl or Dean, whomever

360
00:14:46,031 --> 00:14:46,031
would like to provide a first response

361
00:14:46,031 --> 00:14:46,031
please.

362
00:14:39,969 --> 00:14:59,168
Michael: Well, I don't really have a

363
00:14:59,168 --> 00:14:59,168
great deal more to add, I think.

364
00:14:54,118 --> 00:15:04,149
Hello?

365
00:15:03,142 --> 00:15:06,171
Daniel: Yes, please continue.

366
00:15:04,156 --> 00:15:08,191
Michael: What's happened here?

367
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:09,207
Daniel: You're all good?

368
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,223
Hector: Michael, we are here.

369
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,231
Michael?

370
00:15:11,223 --> 00:15:13,241
Michael: Hello?

371
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:14,253
Can you hear me?

372
00:15:13,243 --> 00:15:15,262
Daniel: Yes, we hear you.

373
00:15:14,253 --> 00:15:15,267
Continue.

374
00:15:15,262 --> 00:15:16,277
Hector: Yes, we can.

375
00:15:15,268 --> 00:15:18,294
Michael: I'm not quite sure what's

376
00:15:18,294 --> 00:15:18,294
happened here.

377
00:15:16,277 --> 00:15:22,337
We seem to have snakes and ladders up on

378
00:15:22,337 --> 00:15:22,337
the up on the screen.

379
00:15:18,295 --> 00:15:28,394
As I said, I don't think I can add much

380
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:28,394
more to what Hector has just said.

381
00:15:23,347 --> 00:15:34,453
I think it makes a very succinct summary

382
00:15:34,453 --> 00:15:34,453
of our paper.

383
00:15:29,405 --> 00:16:02,679
And I would like to certainly

384
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:02,679
congratulate Hector for making what seems

385
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:02,679
to me and a very original and perceptive

386
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:02,679
observation that it is the observers whom

387
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:02,679
we have to thank for the copying and

388
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:02,679
therefore for the handing down of

389
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:02,679
technological achievements by early

390
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:02,679
humans.

391
00:15:34,456 --> 00:16:13,786
Whereas too often the emphasis has been

392
00:16:13,786 --> 00:16:13,786
laid on the person responsible for making

393
00:16:13,786 --> 00:16:13,786
a technological innovation.

394
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:23,880
But of course, unless somebody copies

395
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:23,880
that, or at least unless it registers in

396
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:23,880
the mind of somebody else, it is unlikely

397
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:23,880
ever to get copied.

398
00:16:14,795 --> 00:16:34,993
And although this seems to be a fairly

399
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:34,993
obvious observation, it seems to have

400
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:34,993
escaped most of those who have published

401
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:34,993
on the matter hitherto.

402
00:16:23,881 --> 00:16:41,062
And I think this is a very original

403
00:16:41,062 --> 00:16:41,062
contribution on Hector's pot, which

404
00:16:41,062 --> 00:16:41,062
deserves to be complemented.

405
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:45,100
And really, that's all I wish to say.

406
00:16:41,064 --> 00:16:54,198
I think I'd like to throw this open to

407
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:54,198
other people and if I can illuminate or

408
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:54,198
elucidate any matters, I'm happy to do

409
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:54,198
so.

410
00:16:45,101 --> 00:17:00,191
But I think this is really very much, to

411
00:17:00,191 --> 00:17:00,191
put it mildly, Hector's brainchild.

412
00:16:54,198 --> 00:17:03,224
And congratulations.

413
00:17:00,193 --> 00:17:06,258
Hector: Thanks, Michael.

414
00:17:05,249 --> 00:17:07,264
You're very kind.

415
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:15,347
But this is our child and you know a lot

416
00:17:15,347 --> 00:17:15,347
you have a lot to contribute, so, I mean,

417
00:17:15,347 --> 00:17:15,347
I can only learn.

418
00:17:07,264 --> 00:17:17,367
But thank you anyway.

419
00:17:16,353 --> 00:17:21,403
Awesome.

420
00:17:20,396 --> 00:17:23,428
Daniel: Carl or Dean?

421
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:28,474
Dean: Go ahead, Carl.

422
00:17:27,461 --> 00:17:31,504
Karl: Right.

423
00:17:30,496 --> 00:17:43,628
So I just wanted to reiterate Michael's

424
00:17:43,628 --> 00:17:43,628
admiration for both the idea but also the

425
00:17:43,628 --> 00:17:43,628
very fluent Andy Clark articulation of

426
00:17:43,628 --> 00:17:43,628
it.

427
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:54,739
It was nice for me to see that presented

428
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:54,739
so succinctly because the clarity of the

429
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:54,739
ideas really is really very evident.

430
00:17:46,656 --> 00:18:12,859
It struck me there is sort of two themes

431
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:12,859
that we could discuss, which is the

432
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:12,859
emergence of more complicated solutions

433
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:12,859
to accurately engaging with and modeling

434
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:12,859
our world.

435
00:17:56,752 --> 00:18:16,891
I think that was a sort of generic theme

436
00:18:16,891 --> 00:18:16,891
in the first part of the presentation.

437
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:43,016
But then very quickly we moved to this

438
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:43,016
kernel idea, this core idea that the

439
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:43,016
dissemination and the transgenerational

440
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:43,016
propagation that could be read as some

441
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:43,016
kind of cultural niche construction in a

442
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:43,016
sort of evo, devo context depends upon

443
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:43,016
being able to recognize a particular

444
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:43,016
behavior and thereby copy and imitate.

445
00:18:16,891 --> 00:18:46,019
I think that was the key thing.

446
00:18:43,016 --> 00:19:01,028
And for me, just understanding the

447
00:19:01,028 --> 00:19:01,028
mechanics of that from the point of view

448
00:19:01,028 --> 00:19:01,028
of belief, updating and active inference

449
00:19:01,028 --> 00:19:01,028
was, I think, a really useful thing.

450
00:18:46,019 --> 00:19:29,056
And as Hector beautifully articulated,

451
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:29,056
the ability to recognize something new

452
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:29,056
and update one's generative model or

453
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:29,056
posterior beliefs depends very

454
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:29,056
sensitively on the confidence or the

455
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:29,056
precision that you ascribe sensory

456
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:29,056
evidence in relation to the precisions

457
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:29,056
with which you hold your pride belief.

458
00:19:01,028 --> 00:19:31,058
And I think that's absolutely crucial.

459
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:53,080
And I sort of highlight that issue

460
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,080
because it is exactly the same issue that

461
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,080
you will find when applying active

462
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,080
inference from the free energy principle

463
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,080
to psychiatry and the different ways in

464
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,080
which we can I can't remember, Hector,

465
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,080
what was your word?

466
00:19:31,058 --> 00:19:56,083
Misfire in neither a good nor a bad

467
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:56,083
sense.

468
00:19:53,080 --> 00:20:03,084
But certainly there are certain

469
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:03,084
psychiatric syndromes that could be

470
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:03,084
regarded as misfiring.

471
00:19:56,083 --> 00:20:16,097
And of course there's a very close

472
00:20:16,097 --> 00:20:16,097
association with innovation and

473
00:20:16,097 --> 00:20:16,097
creativity and manic depressive psychosis

474
00:20:16,097 --> 00:20:16,097
famed in terms of various historical

475
00:20:16,097 --> 00:20:16,097
figures in the arts.

476
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:41,122
And that, I think is again brings us back

477
00:20:41,122 --> 00:20:41,122
to this key notion of getting that

478
00:20:41,122 --> 00:20:41,122
balance, the balance of the precision of

479
00:20:41,122 --> 00:20:41,122
our prior constructs, what we have

480
00:20:41,122 --> 00:20:41,122
accrued through experience dependent

481
00:20:41,122 --> 00:20:41,122
learning and the precision afforded

482
00:20:41,122 --> 00:20:41,122
evidence that this is how the world is

483
00:20:41,122 --> 00:20:41,122
actually working and how I am actually

484
00:20:41,122 --> 00:20:41,122
working, getting that balance right.

485
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:44,125
And that's a really difficult job.

486
00:20:42,123 --> 00:20:52,133
Sometimes in computational psychiatry we

487
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:52,133
try to explain this in terms of a

488
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:52,133
statistician.

489
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:57,138
In order to get the balance right, you

490
00:20:57,138 --> 00:20:57,138
have to be able to estimate these

491
00:20:57,138 --> 00:20:57,138
precisions.

492
00:20:53,134 --> 00:21:08,143
And this exactly the same spirit that a

493
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:08,143
statistician, when making an inference,

494
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:08,143
doing a t test, has to estimate not just

495
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:08,143
active inference in the group means, but

496
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:08,143
also the standard error.

497
00:20:57,138 --> 00:21:16,151
And it's often much more difficult to

498
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:16,151
estimate the standard error than it is to

499
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:16,151
estimate the difference in the group

500
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:16,151
means.

501
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:20,155
And that standard error is the inverse

502
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:20,155
precision.

503
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:28,163
It's the weight that you afford, the

504
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:28,163
meaning, the significance of some

505
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:28,163
quantitative difference, say a prediction

506
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:28,163
error.

507
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:30,165
So you see this theme.

508
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:32,167
There are two parts to inference.

509
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:37,172
The first order part is just the

510
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:37,172
prediction error or the surprise.

511
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:42,177
But then you have to assign how

512
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:42,177
newsworthy is that?

513
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:51,186
You have to actually modulate that with

514
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:51,186
its precision so you can multiply by the

515
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:51,186
precision or divide by the standard error

516
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:51,186
to get the actual thing that matters.

517
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:53,188
That's going to change your mind.

518
00:21:51,186 --> 00:22:09,198
And there's a whole literature on

519
00:22:09,198 --> 00:22:09,198
different kinds of people in the context

520
00:22:09,198 --> 00:22:09,198
of neurodiversity that have an impairment

521
00:22:09,198 --> 00:22:09,198
in being able, or possibly have an

522
00:22:09,198 --> 00:22:09,198
impairment in being able to estimate that

523
00:22:09,198 --> 00:22:09,198
precision.

524
00:21:53,188 --> 00:22:15,204
I'm thinking here of the poster child of

525
00:22:15,204 --> 00:22:15,204
this kind of formulation, which is

526
00:22:15,204 --> 00:22:15,204
autism.

527
00:22:09,198 --> 00:22:24,213
And the idea being that there is an early

528
00:22:24,213 --> 00:22:24,213
developmental failure to attenuate

529
00:22:24,213 --> 00:22:24,213
sensory precision.

530
00:22:15,204 --> 00:22:37,226
So they are, and continually during their

531
00:22:37,226 --> 00:22:37,226
early development, severe people with

532
00:22:37,226 --> 00:22:37,226
severe autism unable to ignore any of

533
00:22:37,226 --> 00:22:37,226
their sensations.

534
00:22:24,213 --> 00:22:48,237
And as a consequence, everything is

535
00:22:48,237 --> 00:22:48,237
surprising, everything is arousing,

536
00:22:48,237 --> 00:22:48,237
everything is in danger of revising any

537
00:22:48,237 --> 00:22:48,237
beliefs very, very quickly.

538
00:22:39,228 --> 00:23:01,244
So they're highly impressionable to the

539
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:01,244
extent they can't build deeply coherent

540
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:01,244
models of their lived world or indeed the

541
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:01,244
other artifacts such as mum, that

542
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:01,244
constitutes their world.

543
00:22:49,237 --> 00:23:21,263
So I'm just wondering whether a species

544
00:23:21,263 --> 00:23:21,263
that has the same kind of latitude in

545
00:23:21,263 --> 00:23:21,263
terms of either biasing, attention or

546
00:23:21,263 --> 00:23:21,263
precision to sensory evidence versus

547
00:23:21,263 --> 00:23:21,263
accumulated prior beliefs would display

548
00:23:21,263 --> 00:23:21,263
the same kind of misfiring.

549
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:22,265
So you can go from one end.

550
00:23:21,264 --> 00:23:31,274
An autistic species will be overly

551
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:31,274
impressionable, it'll be too evolvable,

552
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:31,274
it won't be able to remember anything

553
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:31,274
from generation to generation.

554
00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:45,288
The converse is somebody who you can

555
00:23:45,288 --> 00:23:45,288
imagine from a psychiatric perspective

556
00:23:45,288 --> 00:23:45,288
has committed unduly to very precise

557
00:23:45,288 --> 00:23:45,288
beliefs about the way the world works.

558
00:23:32,274 --> 00:23:51,294
And you can think of this in terms of

559
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:51,294
compulsive, obsessional disorder or

560
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:51,294
perhaps even depression.

561
00:23:45,288 --> 00:23:53,296
The world is an awful place.

562
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:54,297
That is true.

563
00:23:53,296 --> 00:24:00,297
Therefore there's no point in going out

564
00:24:00,297 --> 00:24:00,297
and challenging the evidence that the

565
00:24:00,297 --> 00:24:00,297
world is an awful place.

566
00:23:54,297 --> 00:24:09,306
So I guess it's going to stay inside and

567
00:24:09,306 --> 00:24:09,306
feel isolated and not move or say very

568
00:24:09,306 --> 00:24:09,306
much so.

569
00:24:00,297 --> 00:24:12,309
That would be an example who somebody is

570
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:12,309
not very impressionable.

571
00:24:09,306 --> 00:24:18,315
In fact, their pathology, their misfiring

572
00:24:18,315 --> 00:24:18,315
prevents them from acquiring any evidence

573
00:24:18,315 --> 00:24:18,315
to revise those beliefs.

574
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:28,325
So if you imagine a species had that same

575
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:28,325
kind of second order misfiring, this is

576
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:28,325
not the misfiring of the innovative

577
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:28,325
sword.

578
00:24:18,315 --> 00:24:42,339
This is a failure to infer the second

579
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:42,339
order statistics, the reliability, the

580
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:42,339
precision, the variance, the entropy of

581
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:42,339
the content of the things that they're

582
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:42,339
trying to innovate or make sense of.

583
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:52,349
You're left with this notion of a species

584
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:52,349
that just cannot respond to selective

585
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:52,349
pressures.

586
00:24:42,339 --> 00:25:00,351
For selectability, they can't respond by

587
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:00,351
adjusting their evolvability simply

588
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:00,351
because they're fixed in their way.

589
00:24:52,349 --> 00:25:08,359
So for the environmental eco niche

590
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:08,359
changes in any fundamental way, they're

591
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:08,359
not going to be able to respond to that.

592
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:16,367
So I think there are many examples of

593
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:16,367
this sort of key, if you like.

594
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:31,382
Yes, I think it would be called a

595
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:31,382
pathology in the sense that in a volatile

596
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:31,382
environment you would need to optimize

597
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:31,382
the precision afforded sensory evidence

598
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:31,382
in order to make the best sense and

599
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:31,382
understand and engage with that

600
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:31,382
environment.

601
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:34,385
And if you get that wrong, there will be

602
00:25:34,385 --> 00:25:34,385
a pathology.

603
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:46,397
And I think basically Hector's

604
00:25:46,397 --> 00:25:46,397
formulation really drills down and really

605
00:25:46,397 --> 00:25:46,397
focuses on the actual mechanism of this

606
00:25:46,397 --> 00:25:46,397
kind of pathology.

607
00:25:34,385 --> 00:25:59,410
It's all about the transcultural spread

608
00:25:59,410 --> 00:25:59,410
of generative models and sense making in

609
00:25:59,410 --> 00:25:59,410
terms of engaging either with artifacts

610
00:25:59,410 --> 00:25:59,410
or indeed with conspecifics.

611
00:25:46,397 --> 00:26:06,411
I repeat, it's such an easy thing to get

612
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:06,411
wrong as evinced in psychiatry.

613
00:26:00,405 --> 00:26:22,427
There are so many instances of

614
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:22,427
neurodiversity expressed clinically that

615
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:22,427
I think reflects this singular dimension

616
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:22,427
in terms of the ability to get that

617
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:22,427
balance, to get that balance right.

618
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:34,439
And I remember we discussed last time

619
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:34,439
again in terms of impressionability and

620
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:34,439
selection for selectability and the like,

621
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:34,439
the same kind of mechanism unfolding in

622
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:34,439
terms of evolutionary mechanics.

623
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:56,461
But at the level I think we're talking

624
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:56,461
about today, in terms of pursuing plans

625
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:56,461
and novel ways of doing things that may

626
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:56,461
or may not be recognized due to a failure

627
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:56,461
or not of being able to suspend the

628
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:56,461
precision or prior beliefs.

629
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:59,464
I think that was a central theme.

630
00:26:56,461 --> 00:27:16,475
I'll just close with an interesting

631
00:27:16,475 --> 00:27:16,475
comment that in terms of the kind of

632
00:27:16,475 --> 00:27:16,475
misfiring that Hector was implying

633
00:27:16,475 --> 00:27:16,475
basically a novel way of doing things,

634
00:27:16,475 --> 00:27:16,475
being the unique province of those kinds

635
00:27:16,475 --> 00:27:16,475
of creatures that can plan possibly

636
00:27:16,475 --> 00:27:16,475
deeper into the future.

637
00:26:59,464 --> 00:27:41,500
There's a really interesting sort of link

638
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:41,500
back to this precision notion in the

639
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:41,500
sense that if you try to simulate the

640
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:41,500
depth of planning of any sentient

641
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:41,500
artifact, then the degree to which they

642
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:41,500
are able to look into the future depends

643
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:41,500
upon the precision of their beliefs about

644
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:41,500
the succession of contingencies.

645
00:27:18,477 --> 00:27:46,505
What will happen if this happens and then

646
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:46,505
what will happen if that happens.

647
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:54,513
So just technically the precision of the

648
00:27:54,513 --> 00:27:54,513
transitions amongst worldly states of

649
00:27:54,513 --> 00:27:54,513
affairs as you roll out into the future.

650
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:57,516
And again, you have to estimate that

651
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:57,516
precision.

652
00:27:54,513 --> 00:28:03,516
So there's another, if you like, point at

653
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:03,516
which precision gets into the game.

654
00:27:58,517 --> 00:28:12,525
But in this instance it's not the

655
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:12,525
precision of the sensory evidence but the

656
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:12,525
Markov decision about the ways things

657
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:12,525
unfold.

658
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:14,527
And what will happen if I do that?

659
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:24,537
If you have a low precision there, then

660
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:24,537
you don't plan very far into the future

661
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:24,537
because you lose certainty and confidence

662
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:24,537
very, very quickly after just a few

663
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:24,537
moves.

664
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:41,554
Whereas if you have very precise beliefs

665
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:41,554
about the state transitions and the

666
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:41,554
consequences of various actions or

667
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:41,554
sequential policies, then you can roll

668
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:41,554
out confidently much further into the

669
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:41,554
future and perhaps find that innovative

670
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:41,554
solution.

671
00:28:24,537 --> 00:29:14,581
So again, we come back mechanistically to

672
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:14,581
phenotypes that have differing degrees of

673
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:14,581
precision in this instance get into the

674
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:14,581
game in terms of bounding the depth of

675
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:14,581
the planning or the temple horizons that

676
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:14,581
you can entertain when scoring different

677
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:14,581
plans in order to actually select the

678
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:14,581
best action at the moment.

679
00:28:41,554 --> 00:29:23,590
So for me that insight is really useful

680
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:23,590
because I can see how one could simulate

681
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:23,590
that quite easy easily in sort of toy

682
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:23,590
situations.

683
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:28,595
So those are my thoughts inspired by

684
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:28,595
Hector's.

685
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:30,597
Excellent presentation.

686
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:34,601
Daniel: Thank you.

687
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,602
Carl.

688
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:37,604
Dean, what say you?

689
00:29:35,602 --> 00:29:45,612
Dean: Well, if it's okay, I'd like to

690
00:29:45,612 --> 00:29:45,612
sort of step back for a second.

691
00:29:39,606 --> 00:30:03,624
And because we were privileged to be able

692
00:30:03,624 --> 00:30:03,624
to look at the two papers almost

693
00:30:03,624 --> 00:30:03,624
simultaneously, I know chronologically

694
00:30:03,624 --> 00:30:03,624
we've split it up into weeks but as

695
00:30:03,624 --> 00:30:03,624
readers we were able to kind of look at

696
00:30:03,624 --> 00:30:03,624
both papers side by each.

697
00:29:45,612 --> 00:30:14,635
I kind of want to take a bit of a

698
00:30:14,635 --> 00:30:14,635
Hofstead or strange loop two sided

699
00:30:14,635 --> 00:30:14,635
condition mobius we've got that all those

700
00:30:14,635 --> 00:30:14,635
representations in a lot of our live

701
00:30:14,635 --> 00:30:14,635
stream introductions.

702
00:30:03,624 --> 00:30:32,653
So if we were to assume that because Carl

703
00:30:32,653 --> 00:30:32,653
pointed out, not everybody can

704
00:30:32,653 --> 00:30:32,653
accommodate two things at once

705
00:30:32,653 --> 00:30:32,653
perspective, if we can assume that, that

706
00:30:32,653 --> 00:30:32,653
doesn't overwhelm my question to the

707
00:30:32,653 --> 00:30:32,653
authors is do they see their own

708
00:30:32,653 --> 00:30:32,653
journey?

709
00:30:15,636 --> 00:30:50,671
As a one paper or artifact artifact

710
00:30:50,671 --> 00:30:50,671
morphing into the next or and as we were

711
00:30:50,671 --> 00:30:50,671
pulled out and taken up by this

712
00:30:50,671 --> 00:30:50,671
relationship between epistemic and

713
00:30:50,671 --> 00:30:50,671
pragmatic values when uptaking an active

714
00:30:50,671 --> 00:30:50,671
inference perspective?

715
00:30:32,653 --> 00:30:52,673
That's part one of the question.

716
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:59,679
Part two is the former is kind of a

717
00:30:59,679 --> 00:30:59,679
sequential, mechanical, technical side of

718
00:30:59,679 --> 00:30:59,679
things.

719
00:30:52,673 --> 00:31:04,679
The latter is the combinatorial plus

720
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:04,679
meaning entailed and entangled.

721
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:20,695
So more where am I relative so combined

722
00:31:20,695 --> 00:31:20,695
that's a relative depth of field as

723
00:31:20,695 --> 00:31:20,695
setting, as establishing morphing, we

724
00:31:20,695 --> 00:31:20,695
want to call it that as active inference

725
00:31:20,695 --> 00:31:20,695
strategy is applied.

726
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:33,708
How do the authors see or potentially see

727
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:33,708
this perspective combining meaning the

728
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:33,708
sequential and or the combinatorial

729
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:33,708
affecting not effecting but affecting

730
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:33,708
what we believe?

731
00:31:20,695 --> 00:31:40,715
Because I'm a big believer that we can't

732
00:31:40,715 --> 00:31:40,715
just sort of strip the feelings part of

733
00:31:40,715 --> 00:31:40,715
this out.

734
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:53,728
I think that's whether we're talking

735
00:31:53,728 --> 00:31:53,728
chimpanzees or whether we're talking the

736
00:31:53,728 --> 00:31:53,728
emotions of sliding down a snake those

737
00:31:53,728 --> 00:31:53,728
are part of this thing that we're looking

738
00:31:53,728 --> 00:31:53,728
at.

739
00:31:40,715 --> 00:32:03,732
Daniel: I'll just give one short note on

740
00:32:03,732 --> 00:32:03,732
that in the paper sophisticated affect of

741
00:32:03,732 --> 00:32:03,732
inference.

742
00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:14,743
They simulated counterfactual futures

743
00:32:14,743 --> 00:32:14,743
projections about futures which are

744
00:32:14,743 --> 00:32:14,743
inactive inference, action oriented.

745
00:32:05,734 --> 00:32:20,749
All futures are analyzed and inferred

746
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:20,749
about with respect to policy selection by

747
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:20,749
the agents.

748
00:32:14,743 --> 00:32:56,785
And one of the patterns already apparent

749
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:56,785
in even the simple simulations were that

750
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:56,785
even if a very small fraction of

751
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:56,785
counterfactuals have like death as an

752
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:56,785
outcome or highly negative outcomes it

753
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:56,785
can increase the variance estimator on

754
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:56,785
possible futures greatly leading to

755
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:56,785
essentially ruminative behavior and

756
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:56,785
affective anxiety around the legitimately

757
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:56,785
warranted variance in possible outcomes.

758
00:32:21,749 --> 00:33:26,809
So I see a key piece of this puzzle to be

759
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:26,809
entertaining progressively wider time

760
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:26,809
cones of possible futures in a

761
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:26,809
prospective capacity and entertaining

762
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:26,809
progressively wider time cones in the

763
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:26,809
past of causal mechanisms and somehow

764
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:26,809
negotiating that affect barometer in the

765
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:26,809
moment as the eye of the needle.

766
00:32:56,785 --> 00:33:44,827
Hector michael, where do you see affect

767
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:44,827
coming into the snakes and ladders to

768
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:44,827
copy and not to copy set?

769
00:33:34,817 --> 00:33:49,832
Michael: Well, may I make one or two

770
00:33:49,832 --> 00:33:49,832
comments?

771
00:33:46,829 --> 00:34:21,858
First of all, in addition to what

772
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:21,858
Professor Fiston has told us about autism

773
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:21,858
and so on, I think it's worth mentioning,

774
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:21,858
in the connection of the question that

775
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:21,858
Daniel has just raised, to say that there

776
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:21,858
is clearly a difference in the evolution

777
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:21,858
during the life cycle of early humans on

778
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:21,858
the one hand and great apes and probably

779
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:21,858
most human forerunners on the other.

780
00:33:50,833 --> 00:35:08,899
The extension of the human life cycle,

781
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:08,899
the extension beyond childhood, and in

782
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:08,899
particular, as I mentioned last time, the

783
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:08,899
adolescent growth spur to which we have,

784
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:08,899
but which may not have existed in early

785
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:08,899
hormone, even one and a half million

786
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:08,899
years ago, I'm sure is relevant to making

787
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:08,899
the evolutionary step between, let us

788
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:08,899
say, the surprise that perhaps a

789
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:08,899
chimpanzee has if she observes a dead

790
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:08,899
bird and then regards this as

791
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:08,899
counterintuitive.

792
00:34:22,859 --> 00:35:13,904
Because birds ought not to be lying on

793
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:13,904
the ground throws it up into the air.

794
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:25,916
But this is an individual spontaneous

795
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:25,916
reaction which is not handed on as part

796
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:25,916
of a behavioral repertoire amongst the

797
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:25,916
species.

798
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:53,944
And on the other hand, when we begin to

799
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:53,944
see the reproduction of, as it were,

800
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:53,944
counterintuitive behavioral sequences

801
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:53,944
such as taking a lot of flakes

802
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:53,944
repetitively by hand from a piece of

803
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:53,944
stone using another stone to produce an

804
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:53,944
almond shaped hand axe fairly regularly

805
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:53,944
flaked on both sides.

806
00:35:26,917 --> 00:36:08,953
Something which is not found before homo

807
00:36:08,953 --> 00:36:08,953
appears in the archaeological and

808
00:36:08,953 --> 00:36:08,953
paleoanthropological record but which is

809
00:36:08,953 --> 00:36:08,953
not something that seems to be a regular

810
00:36:08,953 --> 00:36:08,953
part of human behavior.

811
00:35:54,945 --> 00:36:30,975
It is almost as if the individual who

812
00:36:30,975 --> 00:36:30,975
made that was doing it as a kind of

813
00:36:30,975 --> 00:36:30,975
spontaneous thought of what might happen

814
00:36:30,975 --> 00:36:30,975
if I was to do this part of the deep

815
00:36:30,975 --> 00:36:30,975
generation of the hierarchically

816
00:36:30,975 --> 00:36:30,975
mechanistic mind which Professor Friston

817
00:36:30,975 --> 00:36:30,975
has told us about.

818
00:36:09,954 --> 00:36:35,980
A deep generation that, however, may have

819
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:35,980
been a misfiring.

820
00:36:30,975 --> 00:37:02,001
It may have been simply a person

821
00:37:02,001 --> 00:37:02,001
spontaneous event which is not easily

822
00:37:02,001 --> 00:37:02,001
recognized by others, particularly if

823
00:37:02,001 --> 00:37:02,001
their, shall we say, to put it mildly,

824
00:37:02,001 --> 00:37:02,001
their mental development is stunted due

825
00:37:02,001 --> 00:37:02,001
to the early adulthood and the lack of

826
00:37:02,001 --> 00:37:02,001
any adolescence, adolescence in

827
00:37:02,001 --> 00:37:02,001
particular.

828
00:36:35,980 --> 00:37:13,012
And, of course, the development of the

829
00:37:13,012 --> 00:37:13,012
neuronal architecture of the brain which

830
00:37:13,012 --> 00:37:13,012
in modern people continues until our mid

831
00:37:13,012 --> 00:37:13,012
20s.

832
00:37:04,003 --> 00:37:47,046
If this was not to have occurred, as it

833
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:47,046
does not, of course, in even in great

834
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:47,046
apes, then there would have been perhaps

835
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:47,046
a problem here about the deep, generative

836
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:47,046
potential of an individual ever being

837
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:47,046
recognized, such that it isn't just what

838
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:47,046
might happen if I was to do this with a

839
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:47,046
piece of stone, but what might happen if

840
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:47,046
I was to copy what that other individual

841
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:47,046
is doing with a piece of stone.

842
00:37:13,012 --> 00:37:50,049
And this, I think, is the stumbling

843
00:37:50,049 --> 00:37:50,049
block.

844
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:55,054
This is what has led to the snakes and

845
00:37:55,054 --> 00:37:55,054
ladders picture.

846
00:37:50,049 --> 00:38:14,067
It is what I think has led to the very

847
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:14,067
slow adaptation of technological

848
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:14,067
cumulative technological handing down

849
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:14,067
from between generations or between

850
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:14,067
individuals of a generation and between

851
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:14,067
generations.

852
00:37:55,054 --> 00:38:23,076
And it may well have been the case that

853
00:38:23,076 --> 00:38:23,076
it was not until demographical as well.

854
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:57,110
Of course, as paleobiological changes had

855
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:57,110
evolved in the Guinness homo that there

856
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:57,110
was sufficient intercourse not merely

857
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:57,110
sexual but social such that these

858
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:57,110
questions continued to be asked ever more

859
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:57,110
frequently and with the appearance of

860
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:57,110
better and ever more fluent communication

861
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:57,110
would allow what we now regard as human

862
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:57,110
culture.

863
00:38:23,076 --> 00:39:09,116
Specifically human nature which I think

864
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:09,116
has differentiated us ever more from the

865
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:09,116
great apes.

866
00:38:59,111 --> 00:39:13,120
Those are my thoughts on the matter.

867
00:39:11,118 --> 00:39:22,129
Daniel: Thank you, Michael, Carl or

868
00:39:22,129 --> 00:39:22,129
anyone else, please.

869
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:33,140
Karl: Can I just speak to the question

870
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:33,140
about affect and what Michael has just

871
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:33,140
treated as two?

872
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:58,164
So one way of conceiving of affect and

873
00:39:58,164 --> 00:39:58,164
valence and the emotional aspects of

874
00:39:58,164 --> 00:39:58,164
choosing different plans or making sense

875
00:39:58,164 --> 00:39:58,164
of my own bodily sensations is to think

876
00:39:58,164 --> 00:39:58,164
of it in terms of precision estimation.

877
00:39:35,142 --> 00:40:16,177
So one way of a very generic way of

878
00:40:16,177 --> 00:40:16,177
thinking about negatively effectively

879
00:40:16,177 --> 00:40:16,177
charged states of mind would be those

880
00:40:16,177 --> 00:40:16,177
states of mind in which there is

881
00:40:16,177 --> 00:40:16,177
irreducible or unresolvable uncertainty.

882
00:39:58,165 --> 00:40:26,187
So to put simply, to be uncertain about

883
00:40:26,187 --> 00:40:26,187
what is going to happen to me or what I

884
00:40:26,187 --> 00:40:26,187
should do is to be in a state of angst.

885
00:40:16,177 --> 00:40:46,207
And that can be linked to notions such as

886
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:46,207
anxiety and with some extra nuances,

887
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:46,207
other feelings such as a low affect and

888
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:46,207
indeed if that is pervasive a low mood or

889
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:46,207
depression.

890
00:40:26,187 --> 00:41:05,220
But I think the key thing here and indeed

891
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:05,220
many people have developed a calculus of

892
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:05,220
emotion based upon whether your average

893
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:05,220
level of uncertainty is increasing or

894
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:05,220
decreasing or is high and low and adding

895
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:05,220
these things together to get an ontology

896
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:05,220
of emotional states or a purely sort of

897
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:05,220
inference perspective.

898
00:40:46,207 --> 00:41:28,243
There are another body of thought and

899
00:41:28,243 --> 00:41:28,243
literature which links emotions to the

900
00:41:28,243 --> 00:41:28,243
literally gut feelings interception so

901
00:41:28,243 --> 00:41:28,243
that certain emotional states are just

902
00:41:28,243 --> 00:41:28,243
hypotheses about the way that I am

903
00:41:28,243 --> 00:41:28,243
feeling now that best explain the myriad

904
00:41:28,243 --> 00:41:28,243
of extraceptive interceptive sensations.

905
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:39,254
So I think there is a mechanics of affect

906
00:41:39,254 --> 00:41:39,254
in certainly interceptive inference and

907
00:41:39,254 --> 00:41:39,254
possibly more generally in terms of

908
00:41:39,254 --> 00:41:39,254
active inference.

909
00:41:28,243 --> 00:41:53,268
However, there is another aspect of

910
00:41:53,268 --> 00:41:53,268
things that we the feelings that we might

911
00:41:53,268 --> 00:41:53,268
associate when we feel compelled to do

912
00:41:53,268 --> 00:41:53,268
things.

913
00:41:40,255 --> 00:42:03,272
And I'm thinking here not about the

914
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:03,272
irreducible or irresolvable uncertainty,

915
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:03,272
but about uncertainty that can be

916
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:03,272
resolved.

917
00:41:53,268 --> 00:42:33,302
I'm thinking here when Hekter mentioned

918
00:42:33,302 --> 00:42:33,302
Andy Clark's treatment of surprise, there

919
00:42:33,302 --> 00:42:33,302
is also the truism that we expect to be

920
00:42:33,302 --> 00:42:33,302
surprised and technically that can be

921
00:42:33,302 --> 00:42:33,302
explained in terms of the imperatives for

922
00:42:33,302 --> 00:42:33,302
choosing those actions that will resolve

923
00:42:33,302 --> 00:42:33,302
uncertainty about the way the world

924
00:42:33,302 --> 00:42:33,302
works.

925
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:36,305
So this is just an expression of

926
00:42:36,305 --> 00:42:36,305
novelty.

927
00:42:33,302 --> 00:42:51,320
So if we anticipate, if we anticipate

928
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:51,320
that we are going to be surprised by some

929
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:51,320
outcome, what we are saying is that that

930
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:51,320
outcome is going to be informative and

931
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:51,320
that it will reduce some uncertainty.

932
00:42:36,305 --> 00:42:54,323
Technically it has a high expected

933
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:54,323
information gain.

934
00:42:51,320 --> 00:43:16,339
So I'm speaking here as a statistician

935
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:16,339
and using terms that would underlie the

936
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:16,339
Bayesian principles, optimal experimental

937
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:16,339
design that we do these experiments

938
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:16,339
specifically in order to get surprising

939
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:16,339
outcomes that are by definition going to

940
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:16,339
resolve my uncertainty about my different

941
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:16,339
hypotheses.

942
00:42:54,323 --> 00:43:48,371
So if we think about the misfires that

943
00:43:48,371 --> 00:43:48,371
are innovations, these are effectively by

944
00:43:48,371 --> 00:43:48,371
definition novel behaviors and they are

945
00:43:48,371 --> 00:43:48,371
the fact that people or certain people

946
00:43:48,371 --> 00:43:48,371
and certain creatures engage in novelty

947
00:43:48,371 --> 00:43:48,371
seeking is entirely sensible from the

948
00:43:48,371 --> 00:43:48,371
point of view of the free energy

949
00:43:48,371 --> 00:43:48,371
principle because novelty seeking just is

950
00:43:48,371 --> 00:43:48,371
an expression of curiosity.

951
00:43:16,339 --> 00:44:01,378
It is just an expression of choosing

952
00:44:01,378 --> 00:44:01,378
those outcomes that are going to yield

953
00:44:01,378 --> 00:44:01,378
rich information that has technically a

954
00:44:01,378 --> 00:44:01,378
high self information or an expected

955
00:44:01,378 --> 00:44:01,378
information gain.

956
00:43:48,371 --> 00:44:23,400
So this is another view of, if you like,

957
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:23,400
the effective aspect that we are

958
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:23,400
compelled and expect ourselves and will

959
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:23,400
possibly explain ourselves as being

960
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:23,400
excited in a positive way and the

961
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:23,400
opportunity to resolve uncertainty

962
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:23,400
because we see an opportunity to do

963
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:23,400
something novel.

964
00:44:02,379 --> 00:44:26,403
What is behind that door, what is inside

965
00:44:26,403 --> 00:44:26,403
this present?

966
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:28,405
What would happen if I did that?

967
00:44:26,403 --> 00:44:44,421
And that's an entirely natural and by

968
00:44:44,421 --> 00:44:44,421
natural I mean something that is easily

969
00:44:44,421 --> 00:44:44,421
naturalized under the physics of self

970
00:44:44,421 --> 00:44:44,421
organization of any system that has or

971
00:44:44,421 --> 00:44:44,421
entails an implicit generative model of

972
00:44:44,421 --> 00:44:44,421
the consequences of its own action.

973
00:44:28,405 --> 00:45:19,450
So I thought it was a lovely link between

974
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:19,450
that kind of affect written into the

975
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:19,450
imperative to seek novelty, to seek

976
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:19,450
surprises in the future, and what Michael

977
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:19,450
was saying about well, yes, in order to

978
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:19,450
do that, you have to suspend your prior

979
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:19,450
convictions because if you a priori

980
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:19,450
think, you know everything.

981
00:44:44,421 --> 00:45:26,457
There is no novelty, there is no

982
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:26,457
imperative for expiration, and you just

983
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:26,457
do the same thing time and time again.

984
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:49,480
But if you can recognize that there is

985
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:49,480
reducible uncertainty and choose those

986
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:49,480
actions that have the greatest expected

987
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:49,480
information gain, then you will

988
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:49,480
necessarily succumb to novelty seeking

989
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:49,480
behavior and thereby discover those

990
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:49,480
misfire innovations.

991
00:45:26,457 --> 00:46:02,487
And it may be that the story that Michael

992
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:02,487
was telling was that we are built to be

993
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:02,487
curious creatures for much longer.

994
00:45:51,482 --> 00:46:24,509
We are built to be able to respond to

995
00:46:24,509 --> 00:46:24,509
novelty and to find those innovative

996
00:46:24,509 --> 00:46:24,509
novel ways of behaving so that we remain,

997
00:46:24,509 --> 00:46:24,509
we retain that childlike curiosity as

998
00:46:24,509 --> 00:46:24,509
part of our epigenetic epigenetic

999
00:46:24,509 --> 00:46:24,509
neurodevelopmental programming for much

1000
00:46:24,509 --> 00:46:24,509
longer than other species.

1001
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:34,519
So I think that matches very nicely with

1002
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:34,519
the basic thesis that Hector was

1003
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:34,519
proposing during the presentation.

1004
00:46:25,509 --> 00:46:48,533
It all comes back to getting the

1005
00:46:48,533 --> 00:46:48,533
precision of your prior beliefs, right

1006
00:46:48,533 --> 00:46:48,533
and suspending very precise prior beliefs

1007
00:46:48,533 --> 00:46:48,533
in order to explore hypotheses.

1008
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:59,544
And that exploration just is in terms of

1009
00:46:59,544 --> 00:46:59,544
engaging in novel innovative behaviors

1010
00:46:59,544 --> 00:46:59,544
that you know, will resolve your

1011
00:46:59,544 --> 00:46:59,544
uncertainty.

1012
00:46:48,533 --> 00:47:10,549
So if that's right, sort of engenders a

1013
00:47:10,549 --> 00:47:10,549
question why is there an evolutionary

1014
00:47:10,549 --> 00:47:10,549
pressure for this kind of eternal

1015
00:47:10,549 --> 00:47:10,549
childhood?

1016
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:20,559
So I want to ask Michael and Hector,

1017
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:20,559
because Michael had certainly brought in

1018
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:20,559
language and cultural niche

1019
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:20,559
construction.

1020
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:40,578
My guess would be that there will be a

1021
00:47:40,578 --> 00:47:40,578
circular causality between the cultural

1022
00:47:40,578 --> 00:47:40,578
eco niche and the phenotypes that trying

1023
00:47:40,578 --> 00:47:40,578
to adapt to that cultural eco niche such

1024
00:47:40,578 --> 00:47:40,578
that they are required.

1025
00:47:22,561 --> 00:47:51,590
Or the phenotypes that have the greatest

1026
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:51,590
adaptive fitness are those that retain a

1027
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:51,590
greater curiosity in the context of the

1028
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:51,590
culture in which they find themselves.

1029
00:47:40,579 --> 00:48:02,595
And part of that will be necessary to

1030
00:48:02,595 --> 00:48:02,595
actually understand the communication and

1031
00:48:02,595 --> 00:48:02,595
the signs and the semiotics afforded by

1032
00:48:02,595 --> 00:48:02,595
their conspecifics, which could be read

1033
00:48:02,595 --> 00:48:02,595
just as language.

1034
00:47:51,590 --> 00:48:25,618
So my question is, did this innovative,

1035
00:48:25,618 --> 00:48:25,618
does innovative tool use, does it emerge

1036
00:48:25,618 --> 00:48:25,618
stochastically or at certain points along

1037
00:48:25,618 --> 00:48:25,618
with communication and language, or are

1038
00:48:25,618 --> 00:48:25,618
they not correlated?

1039
00:48:02,595 --> 00:48:34,627
And if they are correlated in terms of

1040
00:48:34,627 --> 00:48:34,627
historically, what are their thinkings

1041
00:48:34,627 --> 00:48:34,627
about the direction of causality?

1042
00:48:25,618 --> 00:48:47,640
Does the fact that you remain curious and

1043
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:47,640
innovative for much longer lead to

1044
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:47,640
language that we can engage in novel

1045
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:47,640
communicative behaviors?

1046
00:48:34,627 --> 00:49:08,655
Or is it that we need to remain curious

1047
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:08,655
and open minded in terms of thinking

1048
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:08,655
about or entertaining novel plans and

1049
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:08,655
innovative plans simply because we have

1050
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:08,655
to make sense of a world that is rich in

1051
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:08,655
information because there is language

1052
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:08,655
that has been culturally inherited?

1053
00:48:48,641 --> 00:49:09,656
Or is it both?

1054
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:11,658
Is there both top down and bottom up?

1055
00:49:09,656 --> 00:49:33,680
Causation so two questions language, tool

1056
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:33,680
use and copying and the coupling between

1057
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:33,680
the sort of evolutionary and the

1058
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:33,680
phylogenetic and the sort of phenotypic

1059
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:33,680
levels when it comes to things like

1060
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:33,680
language.

1061
00:49:11,658 --> 00:49:43,690
Michael: Well, I wonder if I could come

1062
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:43,690
in here, Daniel is it okay if I address

1063
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:43,690
Carl's questions?

1064
00:49:34,681 --> 00:49:46,693
Daniel: Yes, in whatever order you like.

1065
00:49:44,691 --> 00:49:47,694
Michael: Thank you.

1066
00:49:46,693 --> 00:50:02,703
Well, in the first place, there is a

1067
00:50:02,703 --> 00:50:02,703
voluminous literature on the relationship

1068
00:50:02,703 --> 00:50:02,703
between language and the origins of tool

1069
00:50:02,703 --> 00:50:02,703
making and tool use, really.

1070
00:49:48,695 --> 00:50:10,711
And there's a lot of unresolved argument

1071
00:50:10,711 --> 00:50:10,711
about whether the two came together very

1072
00:50:10,711 --> 00:50:10,711
early in human evolution.

1073
00:50:02,703 --> 00:50:32,732
Let's say between 1 million and 2,000,001

1074
00:50:32,732 --> 00:50:32,732
and a half million years ago, as I

1075
00:50:32,732 --> 00:50:32,732
originally thought some years ago, or

1076
00:50:32,732 --> 00:50:32,732
whether in fact, language as we know it,

1077
00:50:32,732 --> 00:50:32,732
or shall we say fluent communication at

1078
00:50:32,732 --> 00:50:32,732
least only developed much later, as I'm

1079
00:50:32,732 --> 00:50:32,732
coming out to believe now.

1080
00:50:11,711 --> 00:50:46,746
And as Noam Chomsky has said for many,

1081
00:50:46,746 --> 00:50:46,746
many years, I don't want to get involved

1082
00:50:46,746 --> 00:50:46,746
in that because really we would need two

1083
00:50:46,746 --> 00:50:46,746
or three programs and a lot of literature

1084
00:50:46,746 --> 00:50:46,746
to compare and contrast.

1085
00:50:32,733 --> 00:50:54,755
Rather, I would query whether we have an

1086
00:50:54,755 --> 00:50:54,755
eternal childhood.

1087
00:50:47,748 --> 00:51:04,759
On the contrary, I think that

1088
00:51:04,759 --> 00:51:04,759
physiological, childhood is slowed down.

1089
00:50:56,757 --> 00:51:28,783
And when the adolescent growth spurt

1090
00:51:28,783 --> 00:51:28,783
arises after about the age of, let's say,

1091
00:51:28,783 --> 00:51:28,783
nine years old at some times, or perhaps

1092
00:51:28,783 --> 00:51:28,783
somewhat later at others, is when we see

1093
00:51:28,783 --> 00:51:28,783
a major change in behavior which is no

1094
00:51:28,783 --> 00:51:28,783
longer childish, but neither is it

1095
00:51:28,783 --> 00:51:28,783
adult.

1096
00:51:04,759 --> 00:51:31,786
Of course, we need to go into that.

1097
00:51:29,784 --> 00:51:37,792
We all know that adolescents can be very

1098
00:51:37,792 --> 00:51:37,792
impetuous but they can also be extremely

1099
00:51:37,792 --> 00:51:37,792
anxious.

1100
00:51:31,786 --> 00:52:16,825
And this brings us to the angst that Cole

1101
00:52:16,825 --> 00:52:16,825
has mentioned, and which I certainly felt

1102
00:52:16,825 --> 00:52:16,825
as an adolescent facing the weekly driver

1103
00:52:16,825 --> 00:52:16,825
voucher examinations in human anatomy in

1104
00:52:16,825 --> 00:52:16,825
the dissecting room, which in those days,

1105
00:52:16,825 --> 00:52:16,825
we all had to undergo, at least in the

1106
00:52:16,825 --> 00:52:16,825
United Kingdom, as I can sure call the

1107
00:52:16,825 --> 00:52:16,825
members and which always put me into a

1108
00:52:16,825 --> 00:52:16,825
state of extreme nervousness and has

1109
00:52:16,825 --> 00:52:16,825
given me a lifelong worry about the lack

1110
00:52:16,825 --> 00:52:16,825
of accuracy, let alone precision.

1111
00:51:37,792 --> 00:52:37,846
In anatomical description and

1112
00:52:37,846 --> 00:52:37,846
identification and a concern with the

1113
00:52:37,846 --> 00:52:37,846
statistical variability in human anatomy

1114
00:52:37,846 --> 00:52:37,846
or aspects of it, or anatomy in general,

1115
00:52:37,846 --> 00:52:37,846
necessarily human and its relation to

1116
00:52:37,846 --> 00:52:37,846
process.

1117
00:52:16,825 --> 00:52:39,848
In other words, to physiology.

1118
00:52:37,846 --> 00:53:01,864
And I feel myself much more, despite

1119
00:53:01,864 --> 00:53:01,864
having lectured in human anatomy much

1120
00:53:01,864 --> 00:53:01,864
more aligned to physiology and I spent

1121
00:53:01,864 --> 00:53:01,864
some time doing neurophysiological stuff

1122
00:53:01,864 --> 00:53:01,864
many, many years ago at Oxford and in

1123
00:53:01,864 --> 00:53:01,864
gettingham then in the classification

1124
00:53:01,864 --> 00:53:01,864
this has to be that way.

1125
00:52:39,848 --> 00:53:08,871
And as we were taught as medical students

1126
00:53:08,871 --> 00:53:08,871
always think, Doctor, about the most

1127
00:53:08,871 --> 00:53:08,871
obvious rather than the most obscure.

1128
00:53:02,865 --> 00:53:11,874
But we have to have the whole range

1129
00:53:11,874 --> 00:53:11,874
before us.

1130
00:53:08,871 --> 00:53:49,912
And this brings in the whole problem of

1131
00:53:49,912 --> 00:53:49,912
do we think in terms of very right or

1132
00:53:49,912 --> 00:53:49,912
wrong, concrete facts about stuff in

1133
00:53:49,912 --> 00:53:49,912
general, or do we think in terms of the

1134
00:53:49,912 --> 00:53:49,912
statistical Lagrange of variability,

1135
00:53:49,912 --> 00:53:49,912
whether it is in terms of occurrences,

1136
00:53:49,912 --> 00:53:49,912
let's say, related to quasant type

1137
00:53:49,912 --> 00:53:49,912
distributions, or to continuous

1138
00:53:49,912 --> 00:53:49,912
variables, which can be, let's say,

1139
00:53:49,912 --> 00:53:49,912
related to gaussian type distributions.

1140
00:53:11,874 --> 00:54:02,919
And unfortunately, it was only much later

1141
00:54:02,919 --> 00:54:02,919
in life that I discovered that in fact

1142
00:54:02,919 --> 00:54:02,919
modern statistics allows these two

1143
00:54:02,919 --> 00:54:02,919
approaches to be compared and contrasted

1144
00:54:02,919 --> 00:54:02,919
in a uniform manner.

1145
00:53:49,912 --> 00:54:10,927
I didn't know that 50 years ago, alas,

1146
00:54:10,927 --> 00:54:10,927
which shows my ignorance.

1147
00:54:02,919 --> 00:54:21,938
Still, I would come back to the whole

1148
00:54:21,938 --> 00:54:21,938
business of the growth curve of humans.

1149
00:54:11,928 --> 00:54:32,949
This clearly has altered when we look at

1150
00:54:32,949 --> 00:54:32,949
chimpanzees and other great apes,

1151
00:54:32,949 --> 00:54:32,949
basically they don't have much of

1152
00:54:32,949 --> 00:54:32,949
anything approaching our adolescence.

1153
00:54:21,938 --> 00:54:35,952
They don't have this slowing down of

1154
00:54:35,952 --> 00:54:35,952
growth.

1155
00:54:32,949 --> 00:54:52,968
And then a recuperation of the velocity

1156
00:54:52,968 --> 00:54:52,968
of growth combined with, most important,

1157
00:54:52,968 --> 00:54:52,968
not merely anatomical and physiological

1158
00:54:52,968 --> 00:54:52,968
changes but also those of the mind.

1159
00:54:35,952 --> 00:55:22,993
The ability to innovate, the ability to

1160
00:55:22,993 --> 00:55:22,993
have lateral thinking or the ability

1161
00:55:22,993 --> 00:55:22,993
which I have noticed in some young people

1162
00:55:22,993 --> 00:55:22,993
I've met with Asperger's Syndrome, to be

1163
00:55:22,993 --> 00:55:22,993
able to concentrate in great detail on

1164
00:55:22,993 --> 00:55:22,993
particular matters which are

1165
00:55:22,993 --> 00:55:22,993
extraordinarily arcane, such as Sanskrit

1166
00:55:22,993 --> 00:55:22,993
literature in people.

1167
00:54:53,969 --> 00:55:24,995
That are not of a South Asian heritage.

1168
00:55:22,993 --> 00:55:37,008
Whereas in dealing with other people,

1169
00:55:37,008 --> 00:55:37,008
their other colleagues, they appear to

1170
00:55:37,008 --> 00:55:37,008
be, shall we say, gauche.

1171
00:55:25,996 --> 00:55:45,016
And this is of course well known,

1172
00:55:45,016 --> 00:55:45,016
however, and indicates the range of

1173
00:55:45,016 --> 00:55:45,016
variability.

1174
00:55:38,009 --> 00:56:06,031
But it is the change which we all undergo

1175
00:56:06,031 --> 00:56:06,031
in not merely physical, but also

1176
00:56:06,031 --> 00:56:06,031
intellectual ability and inquisitiveness

1177
00:56:06,031 --> 00:56:06,031
which could get us into trouble when we

1178
00:56:06,031 --> 00:56:06,031
are in our adolescence and as young men

1179
00:56:06,031 --> 00:56:06,031
and women.

1180
00:55:46,017 --> 00:56:29,054
Given the continual and continuous

1181
00:56:29,054 --> 00:56:29,054
changes in our Neuronal architecture, at

1182
00:56:29,054 --> 00:56:29,054
least until our mid 20s these days, which

1183
00:56:29,054 --> 00:56:29,054
I think distinguishes and has

1184
00:56:29,054 --> 00:56:29,054
distinguished the evolution of Homo in

1185
00:56:29,054 --> 00:56:29,054
general and Homo sapiens in particular.

1186
00:56:07,032 --> 00:57:04,083
But I wouldn't rule out Neanderthals or

1187
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:04,083
even Homo erectus and which I think has

1188
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:04,083
been cumulative and undoubtedly, although

1189
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:04,083
we have no idea, undoubtedly enhanced by

1190
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:04,083
increased and ever more complicated

1191
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:04,083
communication during the past probably

1192
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:04,083
half a million and certainly quarter of a

1193
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:04,083
million years.

1194
00:56:29,054 --> 00:57:10,089
This curiosity what would happen if we

1195
00:57:10,089 --> 00:57:10,089
did this?

1196
00:57:06,085 --> 00:57:11,090
What would happen if we did that?

1197
00:57:10,089 --> 00:57:34,113
But even so, things are not rapidly

1198
00:57:34,113 --> 00:57:34,113
grasped and we see that in different

1199
00:57:34,113 --> 00:57:34,113
parts of the world, particularly in

1200
00:57:34,113 --> 00:57:34,113
modern populations even that have been

1201
00:57:34,113 --> 00:57:34,113
long separated from each other, not

1202
00:57:34,113 --> 00:57:34,113
everything is developed at the same

1203
00:57:34,113 --> 00:57:34,113
rate.

1204
00:57:12,091 --> 00:57:37,116
A couple of well known examples are.

1205
00:57:35,114 --> 00:58:01,134
For example, the wheel which first

1206
00:58:01,134 --> 00:58:01,134
appears probably on the Eurasian Stephen

1207
00:58:01,134 --> 00:58:01,134
about 5000 years ago and was used for

1208
00:58:01,134 --> 00:58:01,134
traction and then appears quite

1209
00:58:01,134 --> 00:58:01,134
independently in pre Columbian

1210
00:58:01,134 --> 00:58:01,134
Mesoamerica about 2000 years ago and was

1211
00:58:01,134 --> 00:58:01,134
not used even though it would have been

1212
00:58:01,134 --> 00:58:01,134
very useful for even anything as simple

1213
00:58:01,134 --> 00:58:01,134
as a wheelbarrow.

1214
00:57:37,116 --> 00:58:08,141
But simply to move around images, whether

1215
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:08,141
they were dolls or toys or gods, we have

1216
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:08,141
no idea.

1217
00:58:01,134 --> 00:58:26,159
And another one, taken from the same two

1218
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:26,159
areas of the world is the metallurgy of

1219
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:26,159
copper, which appears about, well,

1220
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:26,159
perhaps over 6000 years ago in Eurasia

1221
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:26,159
and possibly 2000 years ago independently

1222
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:26,159
in the New World.

1223
00:58:09,142 --> 00:58:30,163
And yet other things happen too.

1224
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:44,177
For example, in Australia we find modern

1225
00:58:44,177 --> 00:58:44,177
people were making hand axes when these

1226
00:58:44,177 --> 00:58:44,177
had long ceased to be made by anybody

1227
00:58:44,177 --> 00:58:44,177
outside Australia.

1228
00:58:30,163 --> 00:58:49,182
Some of them may even be only a few

1229
00:58:49,182 --> 00:58:49,182
thousand years old.

1230
00:58:44,177 --> 00:59:55,242
So this appearance and disappearance and

1231
00:59:55,242 --> 00:59:55,242
reappearance is something which has not

1232
00:59:55,242 --> 00:59:55,242
gone away and must be related somehow to

1233
00:59:55,242 --> 00:59:55,242
our ability for this deep generation of

1234
00:59:55,242 --> 00:59:55,242
our inquisitiveness, our curiosity, and

1235
00:59:55,242 --> 00:59:55,242
indeed, our ability to not to see the

1236
00:59:55,242 --> 00:59:55,242
most obvious thing around us the desire

1237
00:59:55,242 --> 00:59:55,242
to see only one simple solution which so

1238
00:59:55,242 --> 00:59:55,242
irritated me when my teachers in

1239
00:59:55,242 --> 00:59:55,242
department when I was a medical student,

1240
00:59:55,242 --> 00:59:55,242
believed that there was only one right

1241
00:59:55,242 --> 00:59:55,242
answer as to how many heads this muscle

1242
00:59:55,242 --> 00:59:55,242
had or how many vertebrae there were in

1243
00:59:55,242 --> 00:59:55,242
this or that part of the vertebral

1244
00:59:55,242 --> 00:59:55,242
column, let alone in the skull.

1245
00:58:50,183 --> 00:59:59,245
And we know how very variable these

1246
00:59:59,245 --> 00:59:59,245
matters can be.

1247
00:59:55,242 --> 01:00:24,563
So there is this tension between the

1248
01:00:24,563 --> 01:00:24,563
desire for things to be seen in one light

1249
01:00:24,563 --> 01:00:24,563
only in a one dimensional way and our

1250
01:00:24,563 --> 01:00:24,563
natural inquisitiveness this deep deeply

1251
01:00:24,563 --> 01:00:24,563
generated desire to say what would happen

1252
01:00:24,563 --> 01:00:24,563
if it was like this?

1253
00:59:59,246 --> 01:00:28,915
How has it come to be like that?

1254
01:00:26,728 --> 01:00:31,266
Why is everything different and not the

1255
01:00:31,266 --> 01:00:31,266
same?

1256
01:00:28,952 --> 01:00:36,772
I can't put it any other way with that

1257
01:00:36,772 --> 01:00:36,772
I've said quite enough.

1258
01:00:33,433 --> 01:00:41,238
Daniel: Thank you Michael Dean.

1259
01:00:39,057 --> 01:00:44,558
Dean: Thanks Daniel.

1260
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:47,864
So again, this is for the authors.

1261
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:57,831
This has been really helpful to me as

1262
01:00:57,831 --> 01:00:57,831
observers because that's highlighted very

1263
01:00:57,831 --> 01:00:57,831
clearly in the papers.

1264
01:00:49,002 --> 01:01:06,130
I see both papers speaking to something

1265
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:06,130
that I would describe as condition set

1266
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:06,130
meaning in the papers.

1267
01:00:58,939 --> 01:01:25,094
Examples limit the game to the game

1268
01:01:25,094 --> 01:01:25,094
metaphor at least to this type where

1269
01:01:25,094 --> 01:01:25,094
there's a limited number of tiles and a

1270
01:01:25,094 --> 01:01:25,094
clear continuation until a conclusion or

1271
01:01:25,094 --> 01:01:25,094
recognize the limit of the species to nut

1272
01:01:25,094 --> 01:01:25,094
cracking.

1273
01:01:06,135 --> 01:01:40,541
So there's a real clear idea and Michael

1274
01:01:40,541 --> 01:01:40,541
and Hector have both spoken to so what

1275
01:01:40,541 --> 01:01:40,541
was the growth limit of the brain's

1276
01:01:40,541 --> 01:01:40,541
capacity, et cetera.

1277
01:01:26,146 --> 01:02:06,153
What I'm curious about, and I don't know

1278
01:02:06,153 --> 01:02:06,153
if there's Michael or Hector or have a

1279
01:02:06,153 --> 01:02:06,153
real clear answer to this but I'm

1280
01:02:06,153 --> 01:02:06,153
wondering what and when was maybe the

1281
01:02:06,153 --> 01:02:06,153
range of time that we see the unlocking

1282
01:02:06,153 --> 01:02:06,153
or sort of combinatorial explosion or

1283
01:02:06,153 --> 01:02:06,153
not?

1284
01:01:40,554 --> 01:02:19,289
I guess what I'm asking is is there a

1285
01:02:19,289 --> 01:02:19,289
move that we can clearly see as being

1286
01:02:19,289 --> 01:02:19,289
something that differentiates playing

1287
01:02:19,289 --> 01:02:19,289
which we know happens in a lot of species

1288
01:02:19,289 --> 01:02:19,289
and gaming?

1289
01:02:06,159 --> 01:02:25,342
Because as I said at the end of 53.1 I

1290
01:02:25,342 --> 01:02:25,342
wondered if it was going to be game on.

1291
01:02:20,291 --> 01:02:32,414
And so I'm curious what the authors think

1292
01:02:32,414 --> 01:02:32,414
about is there a difference between

1293
01:02:32,414 --> 01:02:32,414
playing and gaming?

1294
01:02:25,347 --> 01:02:38,478
Meaning that there's now an actual

1295
01:02:38,478 --> 01:02:38,478
introduction of strategy in this?

1296
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:58,677
So maybe another way of asking is is

1297
01:02:58,677 --> 01:02:58,677
there a moment when you guys can point to

1298
01:02:58,677 --> 01:02:58,677
it and say this was kind of when we saw a

1299
01:02:58,677 --> 01:02:58,677
reducing or maybe a relaxing of a limit

1300
01:02:58,677 --> 01:02:58,677
forward world.

1301
01:02:40,493 --> 01:03:26,895
Michael: I wonder whether in fact, this

1302
01:03:26,895 --> 01:03:26,895
difference is really quite as great as

1303
01:03:26,895 --> 01:03:26,895
Dean suggests and whether it maybe have

1304
01:03:26,895 --> 01:03:26,895
something to do with the ability in

1305
01:03:26,895 --> 01:03:26,895
working memory and other aspects of

1306
01:03:26,895 --> 01:03:26,895
memory in dealing with or in developing.

1307
01:03:01,647 --> 01:03:51,140
Logical mathematical ability to plan or

1308
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:51,140
in planning and in communicating this

1309
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:51,140
ability such that the planning is no

1310
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:51,140
longer on an individual level, but is

1311
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:51,140
participatory, and therefore a game.

1312
01:03:27,903 --> 01:04:20,374
In other words, and perhaps Hector can

1313
01:04:20,374 --> 01:04:20,374
answer this question but I would suggest

1314
01:04:20,374 --> 01:04:20,374
that this developed slowly, gradually and

1315
01:04:20,374 --> 01:04:20,374
by no means in a continual, let alone a

1316
01:04:20,374 --> 01:04:20,374
continuous manner in homo but not in

1317
01:04:20,374 --> 01:04:20,374
earlier in a way not in earlier and other

1318
01:04:20,374 --> 01:04:20,374
hominid species do we see?

1319
01:03:51,142 --> 01:04:56,736
And this I would ask Hector do we really

1320
01:04:56,736 --> 01:04:56,736
see, let us say, chimpanzees or other

1321
01:04:56,736 --> 01:04:56,736
great apes developing the kind of logical

1322
01:04:56,736 --> 01:04:56,736
math ability to make very simple

1323
01:04:56,736 --> 01:04:56,736
combinatorial associations between

1324
01:04:56,736 --> 01:04:56,736
objects or behavioral activities and

1325
01:04:56,736 --> 01:04:56,736
developing this into a communal game

1326
01:04:56,736 --> 01:04:56,736
which involves other individuals in the

1327
01:04:56,736 --> 01:04:56,736
group.

1328
01:04:20,375 --> 01:05:27,984
Because, as Hector has remarked on

1329
01:05:27,984 --> 01:05:27,984
various occasions and informed me when we

1330
01:05:27,984 --> 01:05:27,984
see things like nut dragon in small

1331
01:05:27,984 --> 01:05:27,984
groups of chimpanzees, it by no means is

1332
01:05:27,984 --> 01:05:27,984
copied by all of them, let alone copied

1333
01:05:27,984 --> 01:05:27,984
or emulated by all of them, and by no

1334
01:05:27,984 --> 01:05:27,984
means even when it is with faithful

1335
01:05:27,984 --> 01:05:27,984
accuracy and precision in the manual

1336
01:05:27,984 --> 01:05:27,984
operations that are required.

1337
01:04:56,737 --> 01:05:36,076
So I would ask Hector, do we see these

1338
01:05:36,076 --> 01:05:36,076
associations being transformed into

1339
01:05:36,076 --> 01:05:36,076
games?

1340
01:05:27,988 --> 01:05:42,132
Hector: Okay, that's a tricky question.

1341
01:05:40,109 --> 01:06:03,288
What we know with chimpanzees is that

1342
01:06:03,288 --> 01:06:03,288
they have promised to do these second

1343
01:06:03,288 --> 01:06:03,288
orbital relationships which is like

1344
01:06:03,288 --> 01:06:03,288
hierarchical ordering of for instance, if

1345
01:06:03,288 --> 01:06:03,288
I have a set of objects, I can classify

1346
01:06:03,288 --> 01:06:03,288
them attending to the color, for

1347
01:06:03,288 --> 01:06:03,288
instance.

1348
01:05:45,167 --> 01:06:07,329
Jims could do that, okay, if only color

1349
01:06:07,329 --> 01:06:07,329
is involved.

1350
01:06:03,289 --> 01:06:10,358
But I can classify them by color and

1351
01:06:10,358 --> 01:06:10,358
shape.

1352
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:13,388
So this is another order of hierarchy.

1353
01:06:10,358 --> 01:06:18,434
So I can pick things that are square and

1354
01:06:18,434 --> 01:06:18,434
red and put them together.

1355
01:06:13,388 --> 01:06:41,667
So this ability to abstract a kind of

1356
01:06:41,667 --> 01:06:41,667
ordering category so that I have

1357
01:06:41,667 --> 01:06:41,667
relations of relations like in analogic

1358
01:06:41,667 --> 01:06:41,667
and reasoning when I can focus on one

1359
01:06:41,667 --> 01:06:41,667
dimension or in another simultaneously so

1360
01:06:41,667 --> 01:06:41,667
I can shift my focus from one dimension

1361
01:06:41,667 --> 01:06:41,667
to another in order to classify things.

1362
01:06:18,436 --> 01:06:48,732
This, I think, is quite human like for

1363
01:06:48,732 --> 01:06:48,732
instance, the Wisconsin Car Shorting

1364
01:06:48,732 --> 01:06:48,732
test.

1365
01:06:41,668 --> 01:06:53,785
So I can shift from one dimension to

1366
01:06:53,785 --> 01:06:53,785
another to classify objects or cards.

1367
01:06:48,733 --> 01:06:57,828
And this is something that chimps would

1368
01:06:57,828 --> 01:06:57,828
have more problems to do.

1369
01:06:53,787 --> 01:07:01,807
So they might classify in a first order

1370
01:07:01,807 --> 01:07:01,807
categories.

1371
01:06:58,829 --> 01:07:04,834
Like I put things that have same color.

1372
01:07:01,807 --> 01:07:06,853
They could learn to do that.

1373
01:07:04,836 --> 01:07:08,872
That wouldn't be a big problem.

1374
01:07:06,855 --> 01:07:19,988
But I guess if they have to use two

1375
01:07:19,988 --> 01:07:19,988
dimensions together to classify their

1376
01:07:19,988 --> 01:07:19,988
objects they would have more problems

1377
01:07:19,988 --> 01:07:19,988
because this involves considering more

1378
01:07:19,988 --> 01:07:19,988
than one dimension simultaneously.

1379
01:07:08,873 --> 01:07:21,008
I'm not sure I'm making sense here.

1380
01:07:19,989 --> 01:07:31,109
This is the Jonas Langer work that he did

1381
01:07:31,109 --> 01:07:31,109
it with kids and that's remarkable work

1382
01:07:31,109 --> 01:07:31,109
that Jonas Langer did.

1383
01:07:21,009 --> 01:07:45,240
And then there were these people in Rome,

1384
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:45,240
I think it was Poti at the lab of biopark

1385
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:45,240
in Rome that replicated that with

1386
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:45,240
chimpanzees.

1387
01:07:32,109 --> 01:07:55,346
I think it was Espinosi who replicated it

1388
01:07:55,346 --> 01:07:55,346
and found that chimpanzees were more

1389
01:07:55,346 --> 01:07:55,346
compromised in order to have this kind of

1390
01:07:55,346 --> 01:07:55,346
classifications of relations.

1391
01:07:45,244 --> 01:08:02,354
And I think that's a very remarkable

1392
01:08:02,354 --> 01:08:02,354
ability that we develop.

1393
01:07:56,357 --> 01:08:05,385
So I don't know if I answered your

1394
01:08:05,385 --> 01:08:05,385
question, Michael.

1395
01:08:02,356 --> 01:08:46,797
Daniel: Perhaps that comparison of two

1396
01:08:46,797 --> 01:08:46,797
dimensions, color and shape and then the

1397
01:08:46,797 --> 01:08:46,797
snakes and ladders overlay that lets us

1398
01:08:46,797 --> 01:08:46,797
take the hypotenuse is that abductive

1399
01:08:46,797 --> 01:08:46,797
jump enabled developmentally and neuro

1400
01:08:46,797 --> 01:08:46,797
epigenetically by all of these different

1401
01:08:46,797 --> 01:08:46,797
features which happen over much slower

1402
01:08:46,797 --> 01:08:46,797
timescales especially considering the

1403
01:08:46,797 --> 01:08:46,797
actual millisecond timescale associated

1404
01:08:46,797 --> 01:08:46,797
with recognition.

1405
01:08:10,431 --> 01:08:49,822
Those other changes are so much slower.

1406
01:08:46,799 --> 01:09:11,986
But the ability to move diagonally on the

1407
01:09:11,986 --> 01:09:11,986
grid through the rows and the columns and

1408
01:09:11,986 --> 01:09:11,986
turn that into movement on a manifold is

1409
01:09:11,986 --> 01:09:11,986
the ability, looked at from the either

1410
01:09:11,986 --> 01:09:11,986
row or column perspective to move in both

1411
01:09:11,986 --> 01:09:11,986
at once.

1412
01:08:49,823 --> 01:09:41,289
But by condensing those two dimensions

1413
01:09:41,289 --> 01:09:41,289
into one there can be new kinds of

1414
01:09:41,289 --> 01:09:41,289
cognitive movements and then applying

1415
01:09:41,289 --> 01:09:41,289
that cognitivist lens also evolutionary

1416
01:09:41,289 --> 01:09:41,289
transitions even without the complex

1417
01:09:41,289 --> 01:09:41,289
cumulative feedback with the ecocultural

1418
01:09:41,289 --> 01:09:41,289
niche merely in the abductive moment.

1419
01:09:11,988 --> 01:09:56,436
And just one other piece I wanted to

1420
01:09:56,436 --> 01:09:56,436
return to is that every variable can have

1421
01:09:56,436 --> 01:09:56,436
a precision estimator or not in the

1422
01:09:56,436 --> 01:09:56,436
generative models, in active inference,

1423
01:09:56,436 --> 01:09:56,436
every variable can be fixed.

1424
01:09:42,292 --> 01:10:00,418
And so the model can just be persistently

1425
01:10:00,418 --> 01:10:00,418
surprised with no updating.

1426
01:09:56,438 --> 01:10:06,471
Or one can have any kind of prior or

1427
01:10:06,471 --> 01:10:06,471
hyper prior and so on.

1428
01:10:01,421 --> 01:10:08,494
And that enables learning.

1429
01:10:06,475 --> 01:10:18,594
And that's what enables not just

1430
01:10:18,594 --> 01:10:18,594
estimation of the mean or the center of

1431
01:10:18,594 --> 01:10:18,594
gravity, the expectation of but also the

1432
01:10:18,594 --> 01:10:18,594
variance, the whole distribution.

1433
01:10:08,495 --> 01:10:44,852
And then by applying that kind of

1434
01:10:44,852 --> 01:10:44,852
precision on everything view which, as

1435
01:10:44,852 --> 01:10:44,852
Michael brought up, is exactly what

1436
01:10:44,852 --> 01:10:44,852
modern statistics does you can't do

1437
01:10:44,852 --> 01:10:44,852
inference with a Ttest unless you have

1438
01:10:44,852 --> 01:10:44,852
the mean and the variance won't go into

1439
01:10:44,852 --> 01:10:44,852
any more details on the statistics.

1440
01:10:18,598 --> 01:10:48,899
But every variable has the center of

1441
01:10:48,899 --> 01:10:48,899
gravity, mean estimator and the variance

1442
01:10:48,899 --> 01:10:48,899
estimator.

1443
01:10:44,852 --> 01:10:57,983
And so we talked about precision on

1444
01:10:57,983 --> 01:10:57,983
sensory information the mapping between

1445
01:10:57,983 --> 01:10:57,983
observations and hidden state estimates.

1446
01:10:49,901 --> 01:11:03,984
And then also there's this action action

1447
01:11:03,984 --> 01:11:03,984
oriented representation, how things will

1448
01:11:03,984 --> 01:11:03,984
unfold.

1449
01:10:58,990 --> 01:11:11,063
And you might be able to update your

1450
01:11:11,063 --> 01:11:11,063
precision on sensory evidence by seeing

1451
01:11:11,063 --> 01:11:11,063
something different.

1452
01:11:03,988 --> 01:11:21,164
But updating your precision on how things

1453
01:11:21,164 --> 01:11:21,164
will unfold is oriented around taking

1454
01:11:21,164 --> 01:11:21,164
actions.

1455
01:11:13,083 --> 01:11:41,360
Dean: Daniel, you must have some

1456
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:41,360
questions.

1457
01:11:39,342 --> 01:11:48,438
I can't be the only one floating

1458
01:11:48,438 --> 01:11:48,438
questions and having my zone of bounded

1459
01:11:48,438 --> 01:11:48,438
surprise of being expanded here.

1460
01:11:41,362 --> 01:11:54,495
Daniel: I have questions.

1461
01:11:52,472 --> 01:11:55,508
I can ask you a question.

1462
01:11:54,496 --> 01:11:57,519
Or Michael or Hector.

1463
01:11:55,508 --> 01:11:57,527
Or Carl.

1464
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:58,538
Please feel free.

1465
01:11:57,528 --> 01:12:25,741
Hector: If you would like to pick up with

1466
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:25,741
something that Professor Priest mentioned

1467
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:25,741
before that was kind of intriguing

1468
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:25,741
because it is true that some great

1469
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:25,741
artists like Bangkok and others were very

1470
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:25,741
creative and also I don't know if it's

1471
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:25,741
appropriate to say they were in the verge

1472
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:25,741
of psychosis.

1473
01:12:02,519 --> 01:12:29,780
I don't know if it's appropriate because

1474
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:29,780
I don't have any statistics.

1475
01:12:25,742 --> 01:12:36,855
But I'm thinking is being innovative is

1476
01:12:36,855 --> 01:12:36,855
this again this misfiring?

1477
01:12:29,781 --> 01:12:39,880
So I would like to separate two things.

1478
01:12:36,856 --> 01:12:42,911
One is how innovative you are.

1479
01:12:39,886 --> 01:12:52,012
And I'm thinking in the echoes, if you

1480
01:12:52,012 --> 01:12:52,012
are well adapted to an environment, it's

1481
01:12:52,012 --> 01:12:52,012
not a good idea that you try different

1482
01:12:52,012 --> 01:12:52,012
things all the time.

1483
01:12:42,916 --> 01:13:04,078
Because imagine that you have some place

1484
01:13:04,078 --> 01:13:04,078
where there are nice berries, you have

1485
01:13:04,078 --> 01:13:04,078
discovered a safe path to that place and

1486
01:13:04,078 --> 01:13:04,078
if you keep to that path, you go to the

1487
01:13:04,078 --> 01:13:04,078
berries, you get there, you feed, so

1488
01:13:04,078 --> 01:13:04,078
that's good for you.

1489
01:12:52,014 --> 01:13:07,103
Imagine you want to try something new.

1490
01:13:05,083 --> 01:13:13,165
So you are very innovative and one day

1491
01:13:13,165 --> 01:13:13,165
you decide to try another path to the

1492
01:13:13,165 --> 01:13:13,165
berries, a shortcut.

1493
01:13:07,103 --> 01:13:21,241
So you have one risk that you can face

1494
01:13:21,241 --> 01:13:21,241
new dangers because this path is new, you

1495
01:13:21,241 --> 01:13:21,241
don't know what is waiting for you

1496
01:13:21,241 --> 01:13:21,241
there.

1497
01:13:13,166 --> 01:13:27,301
The other risk you face is that you can

1498
01:13:27,301 --> 01:13:27,301
get lost and then you could spend the

1499
01:13:27,301 --> 01:13:27,301
energy you need to survive.

1500
01:13:21,243 --> 01:13:47,504
So in a way I don't think that being

1501
01:13:47,504 --> 01:13:47,504
innovative is good in itself, but we have

1502
01:13:47,504 --> 01:13:47,504
the risk if we are too conservative that

1503
01:13:47,504 --> 01:13:47,504
the environment changes and if the

1504
01:13:47,504 --> 01:13:47,504
environment changes significantly, we are

1505
01:13:47,504 --> 01:13:47,504
not well adapted because we don't have

1506
01:13:47,504 --> 01:13:47,504
alternative behaviors that are adaptive

1507
01:13:47,504 --> 01:13:47,504
to the new environment.

1508
01:13:27,303 --> 01:13:59,624
So I guess with this happens like

1509
01:13:59,624 --> 01:13:59,624
psychological traits, nobody has

1510
01:13:59,624 --> 01:13:59,624
extremes, so we don't have people with

1511
01:13:59,624 --> 01:13:59,624
extreme psychological personalities.

1512
01:13:47,506 --> 01:14:06,631
I mean we have pathologies but the

1513
01:14:06,631 --> 01:14:06,631
selection has favored kind of

1514
01:14:06,631 --> 01:14:06,631
intermediate levels.

1515
01:13:59,625 --> 01:14:11,681
And Professor Fries and correction on

1516
01:14:11,681 --> 01:14:11,681
this, he knows more about

1517
01:14:11,681 --> 01:14:11,681
psychopathology.

1518
01:14:06,638 --> 01:14:16,730
But I guess it happened with innovation

1519
01:14:16,730 --> 01:14:16,730
that we need some kind of balance.

1520
01:14:11,683 --> 01:14:42,998
And what is intriguing for me is how

1521
01:14:42,998 --> 01:14:42,998
humans escape that balance in terms of

1522
01:14:42,998 --> 01:14:42,998
how they manage to be creative and

1523
01:14:42,998 --> 01:14:42,998
innovative at times because we repeat

1524
01:14:42,998 --> 01:14:42,998
many routines but still we can be very

1525
01:14:42,998 --> 01:14:42,998
creative and we have selected so we have

1526
01:14:42,998 --> 01:14:42,998
been successful enough to our echo

1527
01:14:42,998 --> 01:14:42,998
niche.

1528
01:14:16,735 --> 01:14:45,028
And I'm just thinking in this conte

1529
01:14:45,028 --> 01:14:45,028
factors idea.

1530
01:14:42,999 --> 01:15:00,112
So I think this might have played a major

1531
01:15:00,112 --> 01:15:00,112
role, the ability to have conte factors

1532
01:15:00,112 --> 01:15:00,112
because perhaps instead of risking my

1533
01:15:00,112 --> 01:15:00,112
life every time I innovate, I can

1534
01:15:00,112 --> 01:15:00,112
rehearse what will happen.

1535
01:14:46,030 --> 01:15:08,192
And as Professor Friston mentioned

1536
01:15:08,192 --> 01:15:08,192
before, if I have a good precision, I can

1537
01:15:08,192 --> 01:15:08,192
imagine things that will unfold.

1538
01:15:00,113 --> 01:15:18,292
If the genetic model is very deep, I can

1539
01:15:18,292 --> 01:15:18,292
think ahead many steps and see how I will

1540
01:15:18,292 --> 01:15:18,292
fare in the future.

1541
01:15:08,198 --> 01:15:23,346
So I can kind of rehearse things in my

1542
01:15:23,346 --> 01:15:23,346
head before I put them into practice in

1543
01:15:23,346 --> 01:15:23,346
the real world.

1544
01:15:18,294 --> 01:15:32,433
And it might help me to be innovative but

1545
01:15:32,433 --> 01:15:32,433
with a kind of bounded risk or control

1546
01:15:32,433 --> 01:15:32,433
risk.

1547
01:15:23,347 --> 01:15:53,640
I don't know if this makes sense, but I

1548
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:53,640
think it must be some kind of balance

1549
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:53,640
between if I can rehearse things in my

1550
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:53,640
head, I'm very good and predicting things

1551
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:53,640
that will evolve or unfold many steps

1552
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:53,640
ahead, I can see how I will fare and then

1553
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:53,640
I can risk to be novative.

1554
01:15:32,434 --> 01:15:56,673
I don't know I mean, I'm being very

1555
01:15:56,673 --> 01:15:56,673
speculative here, okay?

1556
01:15:53,641 --> 01:16:00,658
So I just want to make clear that I'm

1557
01:16:00,658 --> 01:16:00,658
being very speculative.

1558
01:15:56,673 --> 01:16:04,695
Karl: Please.

1559
01:16:04,691 --> 01:16:05,703
Daniel: Carl?

1560
01:16:04,695 --> 01:16:08,733
Karl: Yeah, I'd like to speak to that.

1561
01:16:05,707 --> 01:16:17,827
Yes, you may be speculating, but I think

1562
01:16:17,827 --> 01:16:17,827
those observations are very vertical and

1563
01:16:17,827 --> 01:16:17,827
very useful.

1564
01:16:09,743 --> 01:16:21,869
I mean, you've brought a number of

1565
01:16:21,869 --> 01:16:21,869
fundamental issues to the table.

1566
01:16:18,832 --> 01:16:30,958
First of all, the importance of being

1567
01:16:30,958 --> 01:16:30,958
able to plan to have a generative model

1568
01:16:30,958 --> 01:16:30,958
of the consequences of actions is not the

1569
01:16:30,958 --> 01:16:30,958
gift of all species.

1570
01:16:21,869 --> 01:16:44,091
And in some instances, in your words,

1571
01:16:44,091 --> 01:16:44,091
when the environment doesn't change, that

1572
01:16:44,091 --> 01:16:44,091
would be an undue complexity cost to

1573
01:16:44,091 --> 01:16:44,091
carry around a brain with a generative

1574
01:16:44,091 --> 01:16:44,091
model of the consequences of my actions

1575
01:16:44,091 --> 01:16:44,091
if I don't need it.

1576
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:47,127
If I was a virus or an insect, I wouldn't

1577
01:16:47,127 --> 01:16:47,127
need that.

1578
01:16:44,091 --> 01:16:50,154
It would be very inefficient.

1579
01:16:48,136 --> 01:17:01,202
So that sort of lends or brings you to a

1580
01:17:01,202 --> 01:17:01,202
picture that our world is sufficiently

1581
01:17:01,202 --> 01:17:01,202
complex and changing at pace.

1582
01:16:50,157 --> 01:17:08,278
Committing to very simple, underlying

1583
01:17:08,278 --> 01:17:08,278
expressive generative models is not an

1584
01:17:08,278 --> 01:17:08,278
option.

1585
01:17:02,219 --> 01:17:28,470
And one really important way of making

1586
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:28,470
them more expressive is to increase that

1587
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:28,470
temporal horizon or temporal depth so

1588
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:28,470
that we can, in accord with things like

1589
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:28,470
simulation theory, roll out into the

1590
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:28,470
future and now become the kind of

1591
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:28,470
phenotypes that can select among a number

1592
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:28,470
of plausible policies.

1593
01:17:09,279 --> 01:17:43,627
And I think that would be one bright line

1594
01:17:43,627 --> 01:17:43,627
between lots of different genres and

1595
01:17:43,627 --> 01:17:43,627
different species that could be just

1596
01:17:43,627 --> 01:17:43,627
drawn on a dimension, which is just the

1597
01:17:43,627 --> 01:17:43,627
depth of planning that my generative

1598
01:17:43,627 --> 01:17:43,627
model will support.

1599
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:57,760
And we talked previously about that being

1600
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:57,760
constrained by the precision afforded in

1601
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:57,760
a given context my beliefs about how I

1602
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:57,760
would roll out into the future.

1603
01:17:44,637 --> 01:18:25,982
So I think that's just from my

1604
01:18:25,982 --> 01:18:25,982
perspective at least, that's a really

1605
01:18:25,982 --> 01:18:25,982
important observation that the depth of

1606
01:18:25,982 --> 01:18:25,982
planning is a very important functional

1607
01:18:25,982 --> 01:18:25,982
characteristic of the generative models

1608
01:18:25,982 --> 01:18:25,982
that are implicit in phenotypic behavior

1609
01:18:25,982 --> 01:18:25,982
and possibly in terms of what kinds of

1610
01:18:25,982 --> 01:18:25,982
models are subject to selective pressure

1611
01:18:25,982 --> 01:18:25,982
at an evolutionary or indeed at an eva,

1612
01:18:25,982 --> 01:18:25,982
divo level.

1613
01:17:57,761 --> 01:18:46,019
The other, I think, key insight that you

1614
01:18:46,019 --> 01:18:46,019
bring to the table here relates to what

1615
01:18:46,019 --> 01:18:46,019
affords the right balance between novelty

1616
01:18:46,019 --> 01:18:46,019
seeking, exploratory behavior and the

1617
01:18:46,019 --> 01:18:46,019
risks that that would entail.

1618
01:18:26,997 --> 01:19:01,028
And I think that from a purely sort of

1619
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:01,028
mathematical point of view, is a really

1620
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:01,028
important observation just to sort of

1621
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:01,028
join the dots with other ways of

1622
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:01,028
understanding how the universe works.

1623
01:18:46,019 --> 01:19:08,035
That particular question is very usefully

1624
01:19:08,035 --> 01:19:08,035
framed in terms of constraints.

1625
01:19:02,029 --> 01:19:21,048
So the free energy principle from which

1626
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:21,048
ActInf inference inherits is one way of

1627
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:21,048
or is dual to something called the

1628
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:21,048
maximum entropy principle under

1629
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:21,048
constraint.

1630
01:19:09,036 --> 01:19:29,056
So this was brought to physics in the

1631
01:19:29,056 --> 01:19:29,056
20th century by a foundational thinker,

1632
01:19:29,056 --> 01:19:29,056
E.

1633
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:29,056
T.

1634
01:19:29,056 --> 01:19:45,072
James, who basically rewrote physics in

1635
01:19:45,072 --> 01:19:45,072
terms of probability theory and said that

1636
01:19:45,072 --> 01:19:45,072
basically everything of interest, at

1637
01:19:45,072 --> 01:19:45,072
least physically conforms to a

1638
01:19:45,072 --> 01:19:45,072
constrained maximum entropy principle.

1639
01:19:29,056 --> 01:19:49,076
So that actually is just an expression.

1640
01:19:45,072 --> 01:20:12,093
Or tends the free energy principle in the

1641
01:20:12,093 --> 01:20:12,093
sense that the constraints, from the

1642
01:20:12,093 --> 01:20:12,093
point of view of free energy principle

1643
01:20:12,093 --> 01:20:12,093
are just what is brought to the table by

1644
01:20:12,093 --> 01:20:12,093
a generative model and the entropy

1645
01:20:12,093 --> 01:20:12,093
pertains to the entropy of belief.

1646
01:19:49,076 --> 01:20:43,124
So you've got this dialectic simply at

1647
01:20:43,124 --> 01:20:43,124
the level of the physics of measurement

1648
01:20:43,124 --> 01:20:43,124
and inference, which means that I'm

1649
01:20:43,124 --> 01:20:43,124
always trying to explain any measurement

1650
01:20:43,124 --> 01:20:43,124
such that my predictions are as accurate

1651
01:20:43,124 --> 01:20:43,124
as possible, but at the same time having

1652
01:20:43,124 --> 01:20:43,124
the maximum latitude so that I don't

1653
01:20:43,124 --> 01:20:43,124
overcommit in accord with Ockham's

1654
01:20:43,124 --> 01:20:43,124
principle.

1655
01:20:12,093 --> 01:20:57,138
So mathematically, what that means is the

1656
01:20:57,138 --> 01:20:57,138
entropy of my beliefs has to be as big as

1657
01:20:57,138 --> 01:20:57,138
possible, provided provided I have an

1658
01:20:57,138 --> 01:20:57,138
accurate given the constraint, that my

1659
01:20:57,138 --> 01:20:57,138
account or my measurement has to be an

1660
01:20:57,138 --> 01:20:57,138
accurate measurement.

1661
01:20:43,124 --> 01:21:06,141
So that may sound, if you like,

1662
01:21:06,141 --> 01:21:06,141
completely unconnected to whether I

1663
01:21:06,141 --> 01:21:06,141
choose to wander away from the Berry

1664
01:21:06,141 --> 01:21:06,141
path.

1665
01:20:58,139 --> 01:21:17,152
But in fact, exactly the same math

1666
01:21:17,152 --> 01:21:17,152
supplies to these quantities either the

1667
01:21:17,152 --> 01:21:17,152
constrained entropy or the variational

1668
01:21:17,152 --> 01:21:17,152
free energy in the future.

1669
01:21:06,141 --> 01:21:22,157
And what happens is you get exactly the

1670
01:21:22,157 --> 01:21:22,157
same dialectic.

1671
01:21:17,152 --> 01:21:37,172
You have two pressures, on one hand, to

1672
01:21:37,172 --> 01:21:37,172
comply with Ockham's principle or

1673
01:21:37,172 --> 01:21:37,172
Ockham's razor, and on the other hand, to

1674
01:21:37,172 --> 01:21:37,172
keep all your options open.

1675
01:21:22,157 --> 01:21:49,184
Which, in a sense is exactly do I comply

1676
01:21:49,184 --> 01:21:49,184
with the constraints that I know I'm

1677
01:21:49,184 --> 01:21:49,184
going to get my berries and I'm not going

1678
01:21:49,184 --> 01:21:49,184
to be eaten myself by a predator?

1679
01:21:38,173 --> 01:21:53,188
Or do I keep my options open and try that

1680
01:21:53,188 --> 01:21:53,188
other path?

1681
01:21:50,185 --> 01:21:59,194
So this whole dialectic is just baked

1682
01:21:59,194 --> 01:21:59,194
into the physics of any self organizing

1683
01:21:59,194 --> 01:21:59,194
system.

1684
01:21:53,188 --> 01:22:04,193
And practically it emerges in a number of

1685
01:22:04,193 --> 01:22:04,193
ways.

1686
01:22:00,189 --> 01:22:22,211
One way of writing down the free energy

1687
01:22:22,211 --> 01:22:22,211
or the constrained entropy, from James's

1688
01:22:22,211 --> 01:22:22,211
point of view, expected, given a

1689
01:22:22,211 --> 01:22:22,211
particular policy, do I go down this path

1690
01:22:22,211 --> 01:22:22,211
or that path is in terms of ambiguity and

1691
01:22:22,211 --> 01:22:22,211
risk, using exactly your words.

1692
01:22:04,193 --> 01:22:31,220
So the risk is just the relative entropy

1693
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:31,220
or the divergence or discrepancy between

1694
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:31,220
what I think will happen and what I

1695
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:31,220
expect to happen to me.

1696
01:22:22,211 --> 01:22:33,222
So I expect not to be eaten.

1697
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:35,224
And that's the key constraint at hand

1698
01:22:35,224 --> 01:22:35,224
here.

1699
01:22:33,222 --> 01:22:37,226
So it's not about rewards anymore.

1700
01:22:36,225 --> 01:22:54,243
We're throwing away the notion of

1701
01:22:54,243 --> 01:22:54,243
rewards, and we're now replacing it with

1702
01:22:54,243 --> 01:22:54,243
a multidimensional construct, which is

1703
01:22:54,243 --> 01:22:54,243
all the constraints in the ways of being,

1704
01:22:54,243 --> 01:22:54,243
like having a certain temperature or not

1705
01:22:54,243 --> 01:22:54,243
being very cold or very hot, not being

1706
01:22:54,243 --> 01:22:54,243
eaten, not being dead, just keeping

1707
01:22:54,243 --> 01:22:54,243
within my characteristic states.

1708
01:22:37,226 --> 01:23:03,246
So you write down those characteristic

1709
01:23:03,246 --> 01:23:03,246
states in terms of constraints, and those

1710
01:23:03,246 --> 01:23:03,246
constraints basically preclude certain

1711
01:23:03,246 --> 01:23:03,246
states of being.

1712
01:22:55,244 --> 01:23:16,259
And then I just compare, what will my

1713
01:23:16,259 --> 01:23:16,259
states be if I do this, and how far away

1714
01:23:16,259 --> 01:23:16,259
is that anticipation from my prior

1715
01:23:16,259 --> 01:23:16,259
constraints?

1716
01:23:03,246 --> 01:23:18,261
And that literally is called risk.

1717
01:23:16,259 --> 01:23:26,269
It's the KL divergence between your

1718
01:23:26,269 --> 01:23:26,269
policy dependent predictive posterior and

1719
01:23:26,269 --> 01:23:26,269
your prior preferences that have the

1720
01:23:26,269 --> 01:23:26,269
constraints.

1721
01:23:18,261 --> 01:23:28,271
The other thing is the ambiguity.

1722
01:23:27,269 --> 01:23:42,285
And that simply reduces to making sure

1723
01:23:42,285 --> 01:23:42,285
that you make moves in a way that

1724
01:23:42,285 --> 01:23:42,285
underwrites an unambiguous precise

1725
01:23:42,285 --> 01:23:42,285
mapping.

1726
01:23:29,272 --> 01:23:47,290
Between what you see and what caused your

1727
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:47,290
sensation.

1728
01:23:43,285 --> 01:23:55,298
So you avoid dark rooms basically you

1729
01:23:55,298 --> 01:23:55,298
avoid the dark, you avoid dark alleys,

1730
01:23:55,298 --> 01:23:55,298
you don't go where you can't see what's

1731
01:23:55,298 --> 01:23:55,298
happening.

1732
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:57,300
So that's the ambiguity.

1733
01:23:55,298 --> 01:24:02,299
So together the expected free energy is

1734
01:24:02,299 --> 01:24:02,299
equal to risk plus ambiguity.

1735
01:23:57,300 --> 01:24:10,307
And when red light that then the balance

1736
01:24:10,307 --> 01:24:10,307
between the risk and the ambiguity.

1737
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:25,322
Or another way of carving this up is in

1738
01:24:25,322 --> 01:24:25,322
terms of expected information gain and

1739
01:24:25,322 --> 01:24:25,322
expected cost or its complement expected

1740
01:24:25,322 --> 01:24:25,322
value where the value is just to what

1741
01:24:25,322 --> 01:24:25,322
degree am I complying with my

1742
01:24:25,322 --> 01:24:25,322
constraints?

1743
01:24:10,307 --> 01:24:42,339
Enables you to now write down the balance

1744
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:42,339
that resolves to a certain extent

1745
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:42,339
dissolves that dialectic by the precision

1746
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:42,339
of your prior preferences, your

1747
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:42,339
constraints.

1748
01:24:28,325 --> 01:25:01,352
So if you're the kind of creature or

1749
01:25:01,352 --> 01:25:01,352
child or insect that has very precise

1750
01:25:01,352 --> 01:25:01,352
beliefs about the kinds of outcomes I

1751
01:25:01,352 --> 01:25:01,352
expect to anticipate and I may have very

1752
01:25:01,352 --> 01:25:01,352
precise beliefs about my body temperature

1753
01:25:01,352 --> 01:25:01,352
for example, but I may have very less

1754
01:25:01,352 --> 01:25:01,352
precise beliefs about where I am in terms

1755
01:25:01,352 --> 01:25:01,352
of latitude.

1756
01:24:42,339 --> 01:25:10,361
I could be in Alabama, I could be in

1757
01:25:10,361 --> 01:25:10,361
Newcastle and London, I could still be me

1758
01:25:10,361 --> 01:25:10,361
but I can't be two degrees centigrade and

1759
01:25:10,361 --> 01:25:10,361
still be me.

1760
01:25:01,352 --> 01:25:16,367
So some constraints are very precisely

1761
01:25:16,367 --> 01:25:16,367
specified and other constraints are less

1762
01:25:16,367 --> 01:25:16,367
precisely specified.

1763
01:25:10,361 --> 01:25:36,387
So the risk is determined by the

1764
01:25:36,387 --> 01:25:36,387
precision of your prior beliefs about

1765
01:25:36,387 --> 01:25:36,387
your characteristic states, the precision

1766
01:25:36,387 --> 01:25:36,387
of the constraints you bring to the table

1767
01:25:36,387 --> 01:25:36,387
as a phenotype and some of these will be

1768
01:25:36,387 --> 01:25:36,387
innate and completely subpersonal.

1769
01:25:16,367 --> 01:25:38,389
It's wired into your homeostasis.

1770
01:25:36,387 --> 01:25:52,403
Some will be learnable, some may even be

1771
01:25:52,403 --> 01:25:52,403
sort of oppositional, we can talk about

1772
01:25:52,403 --> 01:25:52,403
them but whatever they have to be there

1773
01:25:52,403 --> 01:25:52,403
because they define basically what kind

1774
01:25:52,403 --> 01:25:52,403
of thing you think you are and how you

1775
01:25:52,403 --> 01:25:52,403
act accordingly.

1776
01:25:39,390 --> 01:26:15,420
So the balance between whether to go down

1777
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:15,420
another path as opposed to the berry path

1778
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:15,420
is going to depend upon this particular

1779
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:15,420
creature of phenotype and specifically

1780
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:15,420
the precision of their prior preferences

1781
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:15,420
in terms of what outcomes they would a

1782
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:15,420
priori entertain.

1783
01:25:52,403 --> 01:26:28,433
And if they have very very precise

1784
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:28,433
preferences over not being eaten and

1785
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:28,433
there's even a marginal small probability

1786
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:28,433
of being eaten if they stray from the

1787
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:28,433
current path, then they won't explore.

1788
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:49,454
If, on the other hand, they have a

1789
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:49,454
slightly more liberal expectation about

1790
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:49,454
being about the encounters with a

1791
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:49,454
predator, for example, then they will be

1792
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:49,454
more likely to engage in novelty seeking

1793
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:49,454
and exploratory behavior.

1794
01:26:28,433 --> 01:27:09,468
Perhaps put this even more simply, this

1795
01:27:09,468 --> 01:27:09,468
is the exploration exploitation dilemma

1796
01:27:09,468 --> 01:27:09,468
ripped in terms of the physics of self

1797
01:27:09,468 --> 01:27:09,468
organization under planning and it all

1798
01:27:09,468 --> 01:27:09,468
reduces again to precision.

1799
01:26:51,456 --> 01:27:30,489
And in this instance it's the precision

1800
01:27:30,489 --> 01:27:30,489
of the constraints articulated as your

1801
01:27:30,489 --> 01:27:30,489
prior preferences, your characteristic

1802
01:27:30,489 --> 01:27:30,489
states, the kinds of states that you

1803
01:27:30,489 --> 01:27:30,489
believe characterize you, that if you

1804
01:27:30,489 --> 01:27:30,489
stray from you cease to exist basically.

1805
01:27:09,468 --> 01:27:36,495
I don't think what you said was

1806
01:27:36,495 --> 01:27:36,495
speculation.

1807
01:27:34,493 --> 01:27:59,518
I think they're all fundamentals of

1808
01:27:59,518 --> 01:27:59,518
behavior and actually from an

1809
01:27:59,518 --> 01:27:59,518
ethnological perspective they speak to

1810
01:27:59,518 --> 01:27:59,518
the heart of choice behavior and why we

1811
01:27:59,518 --> 01:27:59,518
do the things we do and why it is always

1812
01:27:59,518 --> 01:27:59,518
in the background, the game of saying do

1813
01:27:59,518 --> 01:27:59,518
I explore or do I play it safe?

1814
01:27:36,495 --> 01:28:02,515
Daniel: Awesome.

1815
01:28:01,514 --> 01:28:03,516
Thank you, Carl.

1816
01:28:02,515 --> 01:28:06,519
Dean: Dean, think you're muted, Daniel.

1817
01:28:03,516 --> 01:28:08,521
Daniel: Thank you, Carl.

1818
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:09,522
Go ahead, Dean.

1819
01:28:08,521 --> 01:28:14,527
Dean: I just like to run with what Carl

1820
01:28:14,527 --> 01:28:14,527
was saying.

1821
01:28:11,524 --> 01:28:25,538
This is mostly for Hector and Michael

1822
01:28:25,538 --> 01:28:25,538
here's a case in point.

1823
01:28:17,530 --> 01:28:33,546
All the collective wisdom on the side of

1824
01:28:33,546 --> 01:28:33,546
a volcano can suddenly be arrested and

1825
01:28:33,546 --> 01:28:33,546
yet there is still a pompeii today.

1826
01:28:26,538 --> 01:28:40,553
I wonder what you gentlemen think that

1827
01:28:40,553 --> 01:28:40,553
says about certain species zone of

1828
01:28:40,553 --> 01:28:40,553
founded surprise.

1829
01:28:33,546 --> 01:29:15,582
Daniel: Dean, does this refer to the

1830
01:29:15,582 --> 01:29:15,582
fixed materiality alone of the ruins of

1831
01:29:15,582 --> 01:29:15,582
pompeii of which no more will ever exist

1832
01:29:15,582 --> 01:29:15,582
in the archaeological context, being able

1833
01:29:15,582 --> 01:29:15,582
to be unpacked into this collective

1834
01:29:15,582 --> 01:29:15,582
wisdom?

1835
01:28:53,566 --> 01:29:36,603
Dean: I'm just curious because we are

1836
01:29:36,603 --> 01:29:36,603
talking about regular irregularities and

1837
01:29:36,603 --> 01:29:36,603
regular irregularities, these seismic

1838
01:29:36,603 --> 01:29:36,603
events occur in the timeline and I'm just

1839
01:29:36,603 --> 01:29:36,603
curious what we think then as we reflect

1840
01:29:36,603 --> 01:29:36,603
on that and still adopt that kind of risk

1841
01:29:36,603 --> 01:29:36,603
mindset.

1842
01:29:15,582 --> 01:29:41,608
As I said, I would just want to run with

1843
01:29:41,608 --> 01:29:41,608
what Carl was suggesting.

1844
01:29:36,603 --> 01:29:44,611
I don't know that there's an equivalent.

1845
01:29:42,609 --> 01:30:01,622
I don't know if chimpanzees would do what

1846
01:30:01,622 --> 01:30:01,622
humans have done, like see the evidence

1847
01:30:01,622 --> 01:30:01,622
and still park themselves right in the

1848
01:30:01,622 --> 01:30:01,622
path of danger.

1849
01:29:45,612 --> 01:30:07,628
I'm just curious what they think about

1850
01:30:07,628 --> 01:30:07,628
that in terms of the timeline aspect of

1851
01:30:07,628 --> 01:30:07,628
this.

1852
01:30:01,622 --> 01:30:21,642
Daniel: Hector or Michael?

1853
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:22,643
Go ahead.

1854
01:30:21,642 --> 01:30:26,647
Dean: I think you're muted now, Hector.

1855
01:30:24,645 --> 01:30:31,652
Hector: Sorry, my Mika is off.

1856
01:30:30,651 --> 01:30:36,657
So it's a kind of difficult question.

1857
01:30:33,654 --> 01:30:54,675
Dean, I'm not sure if I understood

1858
01:30:54,675 --> 01:30:54,675
correctly, but as you're referring to the

1859
01:30:54,675 --> 01:30:54,675
tone of bandager price and linking what

1860
01:30:54,675 --> 01:30:54,675
Professor Christian said before, if I'm

1861
01:30:54,675 --> 01:30:54,675
to take any road, which is I don't know

1862
01:30:54,675 --> 01:30:54,675
what awaits for me there.

1863
01:30:36,657 --> 01:30:55,676
Okay.

1864
01:30:54,675 --> 01:31:11,686
But if I'm very good at making guesses or

1865
01:31:11,686 --> 01:31:11,686
inferring what might happen based on

1866
01:31:11,686 --> 01:31:11,686
information I have gathered before, so

1867
01:31:11,686 --> 01:31:11,686
I'm good at anticipating what might

1868
01:31:11,686 --> 01:31:11,686
unfold.

1869
01:30:55,676 --> 01:31:12,687
Okay.

1870
01:31:11,686 --> 01:31:20,695
Because I have this complex machinery,

1871
01:31:20,695 --> 01:31:20,695
let's call it working memory, which is a

1872
01:31:20,695 --> 01:31:20,695
construct, I have a powerful working

1873
01:31:20,695 --> 01:31:20,695
memory, so I can entertain many

1874
01:31:20,695 --> 01:31:20,695
possibilities.

1875
01:31:12,687 --> 01:31:35,710
And there is something that kind of

1876
01:31:35,710 --> 01:31:35,710
ringed a bell when Professor Friston was

1877
01:31:35,710 --> 01:31:35,710
talking of precision, which is the

1878
01:31:35,710 --> 01:31:35,710
concept of metacognition.

1879
01:31:21,696 --> 01:31:41,716
So metacognition refers to thinking about

1880
01:31:41,716 --> 01:31:41,716
my own thinking.

1881
01:31:36,711 --> 01:31:42,717
Right.

1882
01:31:41,716 --> 01:31:48,723
And it has two clear aspects.

1883
01:31:43,718 --> 01:31:53,728
One is how sure am I about my knowledge?

1884
01:31:48,723 --> 01:31:59,734
For instance, I'm sure I know something

1885
01:31:59,734 --> 01:31:59,734
even when I cannot remember.

1886
01:31:53,728 --> 01:32:02,731
This is the tip of the tongue effect.

1887
01:31:59,734 --> 01:32:08,737
I can give you an answer and be 100% sure

1888
01:32:08,737 --> 01:32:08,737
this answer is correct.

1889
01:32:03,732 --> 01:32:14,743
I can be 80% sure, 50% sure, so I can

1890
01:32:14,743 --> 01:32:14,743
evaluate how much sure I am about

1891
01:32:14,743 --> 01:32:14,743
something.

1892
01:32:08,737 --> 01:32:19,748
Okay, so this, I think is really a bit

1893
01:32:19,748 --> 01:32:19,748
like precision.

1894
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:27,756
So if I make some expect plans and I

1895
01:32:27,756 --> 01:32:27,756
think what might unfold, I can be very

1896
01:32:27,756 --> 01:32:27,756
sure this will happen or not.

1897
01:32:19,748 --> 01:32:29,758
And this probably has to do with my

1898
01:32:29,758 --> 01:32:29,758
metacognition.

1899
01:32:27,756 --> 01:32:36,765
So how sure I am about what will happen

1900
01:32:36,765 --> 01:32:36,765
and that might help me to decide whether

1901
01:32:36,765 --> 01:32:36,765
I go or not.

1902
01:32:29,758 --> 01:32:53,782
And coming back to your sonoband

1903
01:32:53,782 --> 01:32:53,782
surprise, I'm not sure if I'm digressing,

1904
01:32:53,782 --> 01:32:53,782
but perhaps I can preempt this surprise

1905
01:32:53,782 --> 01:32:53,782
if I have a good precision or good

1906
01:32:53,782 --> 01:32:53,782
metacognition.

1907
01:32:39,768 --> 01:33:04,787
So if I'm sure that I can rehearse things

1908
01:33:04,787 --> 01:33:04,787
in my head and see how they will unfold,

1909
01:33:04,787 --> 01:33:04,787
they won't be that surprising later.

1910
01:32:53,782 --> 01:33:19,802
So I'm just speculating perhaps this

1911
01:33:19,802 --> 01:33:19,802
ability to have contractors, to have this

1912
01:33:19,802 --> 01:33:19,802
kind of rehearsing in my head and this

1913
01:33:19,802 --> 01:33:19,802
depth of generality models can preempt

1914
01:33:19,802 --> 01:33:19,802
your surprise.

1915
01:33:04,787 --> 01:33:21,804
And here I'm speculating clearly.

1916
01:33:19,802 --> 01:33:32,815
So I don't know if I answer your question

1917
01:33:32,815 --> 01:33:32,815
about pompeii because I'm not sure I

1918
01:33:32,815 --> 01:33:32,815
understood, but just bring some ideas

1919
01:33:32,815 --> 01:33:32,815
that might be useful.

1920
01:33:21,804 --> 01:33:34,817
But again, they are speculative.

1921
01:33:32,815 --> 01:33:51,834
Karl: It'd be nice just to link that

1922
01:33:51,834 --> 01:33:51,834
notion of metacognition and having

1923
01:33:51,834 --> 01:33:51,834
beliefs about beliefs, the precision of a

1924
01:33:51,834 --> 01:33:51,834
belief about the likelihood of being

1925
01:33:51,834 --> 01:33:51,834
eaten by a predator.

1926
01:33:38,821 --> 01:34:01,838
I think that's what Daniel was speaking

1927
01:34:01,838 --> 01:34:01,838
to before when he was talking about the

1928
01:34:01,838 --> 01:34:01,838
hierarchical depth of models and their

1929
01:34:01,838 --> 01:34:01,838
increasing complexification.

1930
01:33:52,835 --> 01:34:27,864
One really important way of making a

1931
01:34:27,864 --> 01:34:27,864
model more expressive and context

1932
01:34:27,864 --> 01:34:27,864
sensitive is to induce a hierarchy of

1933
01:34:27,864 --> 01:34:27,864
exactly the sort that Hector was talking

1934
01:34:27,864 --> 01:34:27,864
about in terms of this metacognitive

1935
01:34:27,864 --> 01:34:27,864
aspect, but not just content, but

1936
01:34:27,864 --> 01:34:27,864
crucially, again, coming back to the

1937
01:34:27,864 --> 01:34:27,864
confidence and the precision, I think

1938
01:34:27,864 --> 01:34:27,864
that's a really central concept.

1939
01:34:01,838 --> 01:34:49,885
I was just thinking, if you had to commit

1940
01:34:49,885 --> 01:34:49,885
to what kinds of epigenetically specified

1941
01:34:49,885 --> 01:34:49,885
constraints you would associate with the

1942
01:34:49,885 --> 01:34:49,885
genome, in what space would they live?

1943
01:34:28,865 --> 01:35:04,895
And my guess is that most of it is about

1944
01:35:04,895 --> 01:35:04,895
the constraints, and within that it's

1945
01:35:04,895 --> 01:35:04,895
going to be the constraints on the

1946
01:35:04,895 --> 01:35:04,895
precisions, that there are certain sort

1947
01:35:04,895 --> 01:35:04,895
of innate ranges of outcomes that I will

1948
01:35:04,895 --> 01:35:04,895
entertain.

1949
01:34:49,886 --> 01:35:15,906
And in principle at least, you can

1950
01:35:15,906 --> 01:35:15,906
actually just write down an entire

1951
01:35:15,906 --> 01:35:15,906
generative model in terms of constraints

1952
01:35:15,906 --> 01:35:15,906
and in terms of precisions.

1953
01:35:04,895 --> 01:35:43,934
In the sense that if the generative model

1954
01:35:43,934 --> 01:35:43,934
is universally expressive and everything

1955
01:35:43,934 --> 01:35:43,934
goes, then you can sort of carve out an

1956
01:35:43,934 --> 01:35:43,934
apt structural form for that jarrative

1957
01:35:43,934 --> 01:35:43,934
model just by shrinking some of 99.9% of

1958
01:35:43,934 --> 01:35:43,934
this overly expressive, generative model

1959
01:35:43,934 --> 01:35:43,934
to zero with very, very precise

1960
01:35:43,934 --> 01:35:43,934
constraints.

1961
01:35:15,906 --> 01:35:46,937
Perhaps I'll turn this into a question.

1962
01:35:44,935 --> 01:36:14,959
If you were trying to simulate artificial

1963
01:36:14,959 --> 01:36:14,959
life in its most generic sense, if you're

1964
01:36:14,959 --> 01:36:14,959
trying to simulate tool use, for example,

1965
01:36:14,959 --> 01:36:14,959
the emergence of tool use in a synthetic

1966
01:36:14,959 --> 01:36:14,959
population, and you had to actually write

1967
01:36:14,959 --> 01:36:14,959
down what could be asked via genetically

1968
01:36:14,959 --> 01:36:14,959
or epigenetically to each subsequent

1969
01:36:14,959 --> 01:36:14,959
generation, what kinds of things would

1970
01:36:14,959 --> 01:36:14,959
you specify?

1971
01:35:47,938 --> 01:36:27,972
Dean: That's kind of my question.

1972
01:36:25,970 --> 01:36:34,979
In the same sense, where do we draw those

1973
01:36:34,979 --> 01:36:34,979
arbitrary lines?

1974
01:36:28,973 --> 01:36:46,991
I mean, it's the thing that comes up

1975
01:36:46,991 --> 01:36:46,991
again and again as we continue to sort of

1976
01:36:46,991 --> 01:36:46,991
see the next sedimentary layer of papers

1977
01:36:46,991 --> 01:36:46,991
discussing this, right?

1978
01:36:34,979 --> 01:37:03,002
But the fact that it can be moving and

1979
01:37:03,002 --> 01:37:03,002
the fact that there is a rate constant

1980
01:37:03,002 --> 01:37:03,002
that you mentioned in the last Livestream

1981
01:37:03,002 --> 01:37:03,002
that has to be working, functioning and

1982
01:37:03,002 --> 01:37:03,002
effective.

1983
01:36:46,991 --> 01:37:28,027
And then there's still this question of

1984
01:37:28,027 --> 01:37:28,027
what are we attending to and what are we

1985
01:37:28,027 --> 01:37:28,027
still available to all at once and how do

1986
01:37:28,027 --> 01:37:28,027
we organize that in a way that it most

1987
01:37:28,027 --> 01:37:28,027
closely, as you say precisely that's the

1988
01:37:28,027 --> 01:37:28,027
best way of describing it, what's really

1989
01:37:28,027 --> 01:37:28,027
going on.

1990
01:37:04,003 --> 01:37:35,034
And that seems to me at least to be a

1991
01:37:35,034 --> 01:37:35,034
moving target.

1992
01:37:29,028 --> 01:37:41,040
Daniel: Just one quick speculative

1993
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:41,040
mapping as well.

1994
01:37:37,036 --> 01:38:02,055
First, instead of just stacking bricks

1995
01:38:02,055 --> 01:38:02,055
with content on content on content

1996
01:38:02,055 --> 01:38:02,055
intercalating layers of content

1997
01:38:02,055 --> 01:38:02,055
estimation with metacognitive estimation

1998
01:38:02,055 --> 01:38:02,055
is what allows the extendability of the

1999
01:38:02,055 --> 01:38:02,055
multilayer predictive processing type

2000
01:38:02,055 --> 01:38:02,055
architectures.

2001
01:37:41,040 --> 01:38:22,075
It's actually like the back and forth or

2002
01:38:22,075 --> 01:38:22,075
the interplay between the content

2003
01:38:22,075 --> 01:38:22,075
estimators and the variance estimators

2004
01:38:22,075 --> 01:38:22,075
that allows that model to not just be

2005
01:38:22,075 --> 01:38:22,075
described in terms of its center of

2006
01:38:22,075 --> 01:38:22,075
gravity but also in terms of its full

2007
01:38:22,075 --> 01:38:22,075
distribution.

2008
01:38:02,055 --> 01:38:51,104
And then to Carl's question about what is

2009
01:38:51,104 --> 01:38:51,104
being passed down genetically and

2010
01:38:51,104 --> 01:38:51,104
epigenetically and thinking about those

2011
01:38:51,104 --> 01:38:51,104
terms even generically like in the

2012
01:38:51,104 --> 01:38:51,104
context of perhaps source code and a

2013
01:38:51,104 --> 01:38:51,104
configuration file or some other mapping

2014
01:38:51,104 --> 01:38:51,104
of what is inscribed from a classical

2015
01:38:51,104 --> 01:38:51,104
information genetic perspective and then

2016
01:38:51,104 --> 01:38:51,104
what is contextually and more rapidly

2017
01:38:51,104 --> 01:38:51,104
transmitted?

2018
01:38:22,075 --> 01:39:21,128
There's an interesting angle I could see

2019
01:39:21,128 --> 01:39:21,128
it this way or potentially the opposite

2020
01:39:21,128 --> 01:39:21,128
but there's a shorter term epigenetic

2021
01:39:21,128 --> 01:39:21,128
firing rate and then a slower updating of

2022
01:39:21,128 --> 01:39:21,128
neuromodulatory like genetic

2023
01:39:21,128 --> 01:39:21,128
possibilities kind of opening and closing

2024
01:39:21,128 --> 01:39:21,128
valves over a slower timescale and then

2025
01:39:21,128 --> 01:39:21,128
of course these are nested within another

2026
01:39:21,128 --> 01:39:21,128
one.

2027
01:38:52,105 --> 01:39:49,156
So this can also itself be a firing rate

2028
01:39:49,156 --> 01:39:49,156
in other ways but just focusing on this

2029
01:39:49,156 --> 01:39:49,156
direction the inscribed constraints are

2030
01:39:49,156 --> 01:39:49,156
like the width of the aperture and then

2031
01:39:49,156 --> 01:39:49,156
the actual flow of the photons through

2032
01:39:49,156 --> 01:39:49,156
the lens is an instantaneous firing rate

2033
01:39:49,156 --> 01:39:49,156
that's happening way faster than the

2034
01:39:49,156 --> 01:39:49,156
aperture can be dilated or not.

2035
01:39:21,128 --> 01:40:07,168
And so merely the fact that there are

2036
01:40:07,168 --> 01:40:07,168
multiple concurrent timescales and the

2037
01:40:07,168 --> 01:40:07,168
associated interplay of their rate

2038
01:40:07,168 --> 01:40:07,168
constants tells us a lot about this kind

2039
01:40:07,168 --> 01:40:07,168
of learning architecture.

2040
01:39:49,156 --> 01:40:16,177
What we do without understanding is the

2041
01:40:16,177 --> 01:40:16,177
action question and related to our

2042
01:40:16,177 --> 01:40:16,177
preferences and precisions.

2043
01:40:09,170 --> 01:40:44,205
However, it seems pretty key that to

2044
01:40:44,205 --> 01:40:44,205
alternate estimates about content with

2045
01:40:44,205 --> 01:40:44,205
metacognitive type estimates and to

2046
01:40:44,205 --> 01:40:44,205
package that set of two belief

2047
01:40:44,205 --> 01:40:44,205
distributions dean invariants to package

2048
01:40:44,205 --> 01:40:44,205
those also as one so it can be handled as

2049
01:40:44,205 --> 01:40:44,205
a composite one.

2050
01:40:17,178 --> 01:41:04,219
Karl: And just to point out that learning

2051
01:41:04,219 --> 01:41:04,219
rates are the manifestation of that

2052
01:41:04,219 --> 01:41:04,219
second order specification, that

2053
01:41:04,219 --> 01:41:04,219
precision.

2054
01:40:54,215 --> 01:41:11,226
So they are the same thing at every time

2055
01:41:11,226 --> 01:41:11,226
scale.

2056
01:41:04,219 --> 01:41:49,264
So you could articulate the developmental

2057
01:41:49,264 --> 01:41:49,264
stages for example, use the word

2058
01:41:49,264 --> 01:41:49,264
rejuvenation but certainly the changes

2059
01:41:49,264 --> 01:41:49,264
say in late adolescent as a programmed

2060
01:41:49,264 --> 01:41:49,264
learning rate for learnability that can

2061
01:41:49,264 --> 01:41:49,264
be read at some level as a precision

2062
01:41:49,264 --> 01:41:49,264
because the precisions are just the rate

2063
01:41:49,264 --> 01:41:49,264
constants that link the state to the rate

2064
01:41:49,264 --> 01:41:49,264
of change of state and that basically is

2065
01:41:49,264 --> 01:41:49,264
just a learning rate at many, many

2066
01:41:49,264 --> 01:41:49,264
different levels.

2067
01:41:11,226 --> 01:41:55,270
So I think there's a sort of uniform way

2068
01:41:55,270 --> 01:41:55,270
of putting together these different

2069
01:41:55,270 --> 01:41:55,270
notions.

2070
01:41:50,264 --> 01:42:06,275
Some useful notions here from machine

2071
01:42:06,275 --> 01:42:06,275
learning are sort of the notion of

2072
01:42:06,275 --> 01:42:06,275
learning to infer.

2073
01:41:56,271 --> 01:42:16,285
So I was just thinking about an answer to

2074
01:42:16,285 --> 01:42:16,285
my own question and clearly you can't

2075
01:42:16,285 --> 01:42:16,285
write down a generative model that's

2076
01:42:16,285 --> 01:42:16,285
going to be able to get up and go to

2077
01:42:16,285 --> 01:42:16,285
school in the morning.

2078
01:42:07,276 --> 01:42:38,306
All you can do is to create a self

2079
01:42:38,306 --> 01:42:38,306
organizing Blob that has exactly the

2080
01:42:38,306 --> 01:42:38,306
right learning rates so that it has

2081
01:42:38,306 --> 01:42:38,306
exactly the right learnability so that it

2082
01:42:38,306 --> 01:42:38,306
can acquire a generative model and learn

2083
01:42:38,306 --> 01:42:38,306
through experience dependent plasticity

2084
01:42:38,306 --> 01:42:38,306
that model of its little lived world.

2085
01:42:17,286 --> 01:42:44,313
Of course, that little lived world has

2086
01:42:44,313 --> 01:42:44,313
been constructed by other grown up

2087
01:42:44,313 --> 01:42:44,313
babies.

2088
01:42:38,307 --> 01:42:58,327
So we get back to this circular causality

2089
01:42:58,327 --> 01:42:58,327
that evolution is trying to provide you

2090
01:42:58,327 --> 01:42:58,327
with the right ability, learning rates,

2091
01:42:58,327 --> 01:42:58,327
precisions and structural constraints on

2092
01:42:58,327 --> 01:42:58,327
your generative model.

2093
01:42:45,314 --> 01:43:05,328
But your generative models, from

2094
01:43:05,328 --> 01:43:05,328
evolution's point of view are actually

2095
01:43:05,328 --> 01:43:05,328
creating the environment that has to be

2096
01:43:05,328 --> 01:43:05,328
learned.

2097
01:42:59,327 --> 01:43:10,333
So to my mind there's a very beautiful

2098
01:43:10,333 --> 01:43:10,333
circular causality here.

2099
01:43:05,328 --> 01:43:17,340
As fast as you're learning, you're

2100
01:43:17,340 --> 01:43:17,340
actually creating new worlds in which to

2101
01:43:17,340 --> 01:43:17,340
learn.

2102
01:43:11,334 --> 01:43:22,345
I guess we're seeing that at the moment

2103
01:43:22,345 --> 01:43:22,345
with advances in technology and the

2104
01:43:22,345 --> 01:43:22,345
like.

2105
01:43:18,341 --> 01:43:38,360
Which brings me back to my question about

2106
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:38,360
the sort of the top down versus bottom up

2107
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:38,360
causation about what is a good model of

2108
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:38,360
this world, what is a good phenotype?

2109
01:43:24,347 --> 01:44:16,393
Daniel: In our final 15 minutes or so

2110
01:44:16,393 --> 01:44:16,393
here, how do we move beyond the 53.2

2111
01:44:16,393 --> 01:44:16,393
either to the authors, their directions

2112
01:44:16,393 --> 01:44:16,393
and excitements about the work, or

2113
01:44:16,393 --> 01:44:16,393
anyone's exhortations or raising of

2114
01:44:16,393 --> 01:44:16,393
possibilities for other ways it can be

2115
01:44:16,393 --> 01:44:16,393
developed?

2116
01:43:46,369 --> 01:45:15,446
Michael: I wonder if it's worth bearing

2117
01:45:15,446 --> 01:45:15,446
in mind that increasing technological,

2118
01:45:15,446 --> 01:45:15,446
not necessarily complexity, but at least

2119
01:45:15,446 --> 01:45:15,446
variability may well have permitted a

2120
01:45:15,446 --> 01:45:15,446
reduction in selection pressure on the

2121
01:45:15,446 --> 01:45:15,446
phenotype and evidently affecting both

2122
01:45:15,446 --> 01:45:15,446
the genotype and epigenetic variability.

2123
01:44:35,412 --> 01:46:00,485
I say this because I would like to draw

2124
01:46:00,485 --> 01:46:00,485
attention to the graph which I presented

2125
01:46:00,485 --> 01:46:00,485
last week, which was taken from Professor

2126
01:46:00,485 --> 01:46:00,485
Philip Tobias work on early humans,

2127
01:46:00,485 --> 01:46:00,485
showing an increasing range of variation

2128
01:46:00,485 --> 01:46:00,485
in the cranial capacity of bipedal

2129
01:46:00,485 --> 01:46:00,485
hominids from the australopithesines

2130
01:46:00,485 --> 01:46:00,485
through to Homo sapiens, suggesting a

2131
01:46:00,485 --> 01:46:00,485
reduction in selection pressure for

2132
01:46:00,485 --> 01:46:00,485
particular well, for the size of the

2133
01:46:00,485 --> 01:46:00,485
brain.

2134
01:45:16,446 --> 01:46:33,518
Basically, I find it hard not to relate

2135
01:46:33,518 --> 01:46:33,518
this to the advantages that slowly accrue

2136
01:46:33,518 --> 01:46:33,518
to tool use and thereby, of course, the

2137
01:46:33,518 --> 01:46:33,518
variability and variation of tool making,

2138
01:46:33,518 --> 01:46:33,518
thereby reducing the risk, or some of the

2139
01:46:33,518 --> 01:46:33,518
risks, existential risks.

2140
01:46:00,485 --> 01:47:01,540
That otherwise plague or have plagued are

2141
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:01,540
the homininins, whether extant, whether

2142
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:01,540
the ancestors were extant great apes, or

2143
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:01,540
indeed the earlier forms of bipedal

2144
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:01,540
hominin ansaurs, of pithes, Paranthropus,

2145
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:01,540
Kenyanthropus, et cetera.

2146
01:46:36,521 --> 01:47:04,543
Well, who knows?

2147
01:47:02,541 --> 01:47:21,560
But it's perhaps not totally irrelevant

2148
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:21,560
that this variability has grown over the

2149
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:21,560
past couple of million years and is now

2150
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:21,560
very wide.

2151
01:47:05,544 --> 01:47:52,591
As I mentioned last week, this, I think,

2152
01:47:52,591 --> 01:47:52,591
is in contradistinction to the way in

2153
01:47:52,591 --> 01:47:52,591
which selection pressures have been

2154
01:47:52,591 --> 01:47:52,591
highly discriminatory in, for example,

2155
01:47:52,591 --> 01:47:52,591
producing, let's say, the wide range of

2156
01:47:52,591 --> 01:47:52,591
Darwin's famous Galapagos finches, just

2157
01:47:52,591 --> 01:47:52,591
to give a well known example.

2158
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:59,598
Daniel: Thank you, Carl.

2159
01:47:57,596 --> 01:48:18,611
Karl: Coming back to this theme of

2160
01:48:18,611 --> 01:48:18,611
selection for selectability and the

2161
01:48:18,611 --> 01:48:18,611
notion of precision or learning rates

2162
01:48:18,611 --> 01:48:18,611
cast in terms of mutation rates.

2163
01:48:02,595 --> 01:48:36,629
So my favorite example of and I'm sure

2164
01:48:36,629 --> 01:48:36,629
there are better ones nowadays when I was

2165
01:48:36,629 --> 01:48:36,629
reading around this subject, my favorite

2166
01:48:36,629 --> 01:48:36,629
example was the story told by Ernst Mayor

2167
01:48:36,629 --> 01:48:36,629
about Drosophila fruit flies being reared

2168
01:48:36,629 --> 01:48:36,629
in volatile versus non volatile

2169
01:48:36,629 --> 01:48:36,629
environments.

2170
01:48:18,611 --> 01:48:49,642
So you're rearing generation after

2171
01:48:49,642 --> 01:48:49,642
generation at a fairly fixed temperature

2172
01:48:49,642 --> 01:48:49,642
and then an equivalent set of generations

2173
01:48:49,642 --> 01:48:49,642
where they varied the temperature a few

2174
01:48:49,642 --> 01:48:49,642
degrees plus and minus.

2175
01:48:36,629 --> 01:49:12,659
And what those showed was that the

2176
01:49:12,659 --> 01:49:12,659
mutation rate of the Drosophila in the

2177
01:49:12,659 --> 01:49:12,659
volatile changing environment was greater

2178
01:49:12,659 --> 01:49:12,659
than the mutation rate the genetic

2179
01:49:12,659 --> 01:49:12,659
mutation rate in the less volatile

2180
01:49:12,659 --> 01:49:12,659
population or transgenerational

2181
01:49:12,659 --> 01:49:12,659
populations which I thought was a

2182
01:49:12,659 --> 01:49:12,659
beautiful example of selection for

2183
01:49:12,659 --> 01:49:12,659
selectability itself.

2184
01:48:50,642 --> 01:49:30,677
That increased variation, certainly, or

2185
01:49:30,677 --> 01:49:30,677
its phenotypic expression of implicit

2186
01:49:30,677 --> 01:49:30,677
increased genomic variability was itself

2187
01:49:30,677 --> 01:49:30,677
an adaptive response to the rate of

2188
01:49:30,677 --> 01:49:30,677
change of the environment.

2189
01:49:12,659 --> 01:49:49,696
So my question is, is there a similar

2190
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:49,696
sort of picture or view of variation in

2191
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:49,696
either phenotypic or genetic

2192
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:49,696
characteristics over a longer time scale

2193
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:49,696
in sort of human evolution?

2194
01:49:30,677 --> 01:50:15,716
And if there is, is there any evidence

2195
01:50:15,716 --> 01:50:15,716
that there is in the past century or so,

2196
01:50:15,716 --> 01:50:15,716
perhaps this is a bit of an ambitious

2197
01:50:15,716 --> 01:50:15,716
ask, but is there any evidence that there

2198
01:50:15,716 --> 01:50:15,716
has been a sort of phase transition in

2199
01:50:15,716 --> 01:50:15,716
the variability and the evolvability and

2200
01:50:15,716 --> 01:50:15,716
the associated phenotypic variation?

2201
01:49:49,696 --> 01:50:47,748
Daniel: The empirical or an empirical

2202
01:50:47,748 --> 01:50:47,748
research agenda would be to make a

2203
01:50:47,748 --> 01:50:47,748
hierarchical active inference model and

2204
01:50:47,748 --> 01:50:47,748
perform dynamic causal modeling on

2205
01:50:47,748 --> 01:50:47,748
different variability characters across

2206
01:50:47,748 --> 01:50:47,748
levels of phenotypic and genotypic

2207
01:50:47,748 --> 01:50:47,748
integration and have that model in use.

2208
01:50:23,724 --> 01:50:55,756
But a very provocative and interesting

2209
01:50:55,756 --> 01:50:55,756
question, Carl.

2210
01:50:50,751 --> 01:51:05,760
And to what extent is it happening with

2211
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:05,760
our cellular architecture?

2212
01:51:01,756 --> 01:51:33,788
And to what extent are these processes

2213
01:51:33,788 --> 01:51:33,788
happening with our niche, given these

2214
01:51:33,788 --> 01:51:33,788
unique, cumulative cultural generative

2215
01:51:33,788 --> 01:51:33,788
model generative, process thinking

2216
01:51:33,788 --> 01:51:33,788
through other minds, increasingly the

2217
01:51:33,788 --> 01:51:33,788
production of artifacts that enable not

2218
01:51:33,788 --> 01:51:33,788
just offloading, but outsourcing these do

2219
01:51:33,788 --> 01:51:33,788
represent unique cognitive niches.

2220
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:56,811
And so it will be quite interesting to

2221
01:51:56,811 --> 01:51:56,811
investigate, perhaps if we each want to

2222
01:51:56,811 --> 01:51:56,811
have some closing round thoughts, perhaps

2223
01:51:56,811 --> 01:51:56,811
Dean, with the first word thank you.

2224
01:51:34,789 --> 01:51:57,812
Dean: Because you know I hate having the

2225
01:51:57,812 --> 01:51:57,812
last one.

2226
01:51:56,811 --> 01:51:59,814
Karl: I'm just curious.

2227
01:51:57,812 --> 01:52:04,813
Dean: Gentlemen, thank you first again

2228
01:52:04,813 --> 01:52:04,813
for your generosity.

2229
01:51:59,814 --> 01:52:14,823
I'm just curious, now that you've dipped

2230
01:52:14,823 --> 01:52:14,823
your toes in this active inference

2231
01:52:14,823 --> 01:52:14,823
institute Livestream world, what are your

2232
01:52:14,823 --> 01:52:14,823
impressions?

2233
01:52:04,813 --> 01:52:18,826
Was it helpful at all?

2234
01:52:16,825 --> 01:52:28,837
Hector: Who is next?

2235
01:52:27,836 --> 01:52:36,845
So I think it has been very useful and

2236
01:52:36,845 --> 01:52:36,845
mostly very fun.

2237
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:42,851
I mean, I've enjoyed a lot to have this

2238
01:52:42,851 --> 01:52:42,851
discussion with all of you, so it's been

2239
01:52:42,851 --> 01:52:42,851
very enjoyable.

2240
01:52:36,845 --> 01:52:54,863
And just for the future, I'm just

2241
01:52:54,863 --> 01:52:54,863
wondering if there is such a thing like

2242
01:52:54,863 --> 01:52:54,863
preempting surprise based on these

2243
01:52:54,863 --> 01:52:54,863
counterfactuals.

2244
01:52:43,852 --> 01:53:07,870
I guess maybe it's already written and

2245
01:53:07,870 --> 01:53:07,870
discussed and it's all clear, but I

2246
01:53:07,870 --> 01:53:07,870
wonder that this might be an interesting

2247
01:53:07,870 --> 01:53:07,870
idea to explore if I can preemptive

2248
01:53:07,870 --> 01:53:07,870
surprise before I act, before even

2249
01:53:07,870 --> 01:53:07,870
acting.

2250
01:52:54,863 --> 01:53:11,874
But that's kind of maybe that's resolved

2251
01:53:11,874 --> 01:53:11,874
already.

2252
01:53:08,871 --> 01:53:14,877
Anyway, it has been fun.

2253
01:53:12,875 --> 01:53:16,879
Thank you all, honestly.

2254
01:53:14,877 --> 01:53:20,883
Daniel: Thank you.

2255
01:53:19,882 --> 01:53:26,888
That makes me think about saying, I don't

2256
01:53:26,888 --> 01:53:26,888
mean to surprise you, but that's actually

2257
01:53:26,888 --> 01:53:26,888
going to increase.

2258
01:53:20,883 --> 01:53:29,891
It's like, oh, boy, has someone been

2259
01:53:29,891 --> 01:53:29,891
injured?

2260
01:53:26,889 --> 01:53:35,897
But what is the show not tell of

2261
01:53:35,897 --> 01:53:35,897
preempting surprise?

2262
01:53:29,892 --> 01:54:00,917
So that with a linear string in time,

2263
01:54:00,917 --> 01:54:00,917
there is the path from the old berry

2264
01:54:00,917 --> 01:54:00,917
patch to the new berry patch such that it

2265
01:54:00,917 --> 01:54:00,917
appears to be within a nested

2266
01:54:00,917 --> 01:54:00,917
hierarchical model, the path of least

2267
01:54:00,917 --> 01:54:00,917
ActInf to follow, though in a less nested

2268
01:54:00,917 --> 01:54:00,917
model, it would be quite surprising.

2269
01:53:35,898 --> 01:54:18,935
Michael or Carl, your kind of closing

2270
01:54:18,935 --> 01:54:18,935
thoughts or questions as we bring this

2271
01:54:18,935 --> 01:54:18,935
set of 53 to a close.

2272
01:54:07,924 --> 01:54:30,947
Karl: Well, I'll let Michael have the

2273
01:54:30,947 --> 01:54:30,947
last word and just speak to what you just

2274
01:54:30,947 --> 01:54:30,947
said in Hector's comment.

2275
01:54:19,936 --> 01:54:39,956
I think there's a lot of interest in that

2276
01:54:39,956 --> 01:54:39,956
notion sort of trying to preempt

2277
01:54:39,956 --> 01:54:39,956
surprise, a simple reading of risk

2278
01:54:39,956 --> 01:54:39,956
minimization.

2279
01:54:30,947 --> 01:54:50,966
You're just basically not engaging in

2280
01:54:50,966 --> 01:54:50,966
policies that are going to result in

2281
01:54:50,966 --> 01:54:50,966
surprising outcomes, where surprise is

2282
01:54:50,966 --> 01:54:50,966
just a violation of prior preferences.

2283
01:54:39,956 --> 01:54:57,974
At that level, I think that sort of

2284
01:54:57,974 --> 01:54:57,974
almost a truism.

2285
01:54:51,968 --> 01:55:24,995
But there's an interesting sort of

2286
01:55:24,995 --> 01:55:24,995
implication of that which leads to

2287
01:55:24,995 --> 01:55:24,995
notions of the way that we choose to

2288
01:55:24,995 --> 01:55:24,995
behave epistemically in terms of avoiding

2289
01:55:24,995 --> 01:55:24,995
information that would be very

2290
01:55:24,995 --> 01:55:24,995
surprising, sometimes articulate in terms

2291
01:55:24,995 --> 01:55:24,995
of optimism bias, sometimes in terms of

2292
01:55:24,995 --> 01:55:24,995
wishful thinking, but the kind of paradox

2293
01:55:24,995 --> 01:55:24,995
that you get when we are Bayesian optimal

2294
01:55:24,995 --> 01:55:24,995
creatures.

2295
01:54:57,974 --> 01:55:30,001
And yet we don't want to open the letter

2296
01:55:30,001 --> 01:55:30,001
from the GP giving us our most recent

2297
01:55:30,001 --> 01:55:30,001
cancer results.

2298
01:55:24,995 --> 01:55:40,010
Or we don't want to open that letter,

2299
01:55:40,010 --> 01:55:40,010
find out whether we fail to get that job

2300
01:55:40,010 --> 01:55:40,010
or pass that exam or indeed the anatomy

2301
01:55:40,010 --> 01:55:40,010
dissection vivor.

2302
01:55:30,001 --> 01:55:43,014
There are certain things that we avoid.

2303
01:55:40,011 --> 01:55:45,016
There are certain surprises that we

2304
01:55:45,016 --> 01:55:45,016
avoid.

2305
01:55:43,014 --> 01:55:54,025
Put it another way, there are certain

2306
01:55:54,025 --> 01:55:54,025
ways of preempting surprise by avoiding

2307
01:55:54,025 --> 01:55:54,025
knowing stuff that we might find

2308
01:55:54,025 --> 01:55:54,025
surprising.

2309
01:55:45,016 --> 01:56:02,027
And that's an emerging literature now,

2310
01:56:02,027 --> 01:56:02,027
which takes you a little bit outside your

2311
01:56:02,027 --> 01:56:02,027
comfort zone, but it's a fascinating

2312
01:56:02,027 --> 01:56:02,027
literature.

2313
01:55:54,025 --> 01:56:16,041
You'll find things like trends in

2314
01:56:16,041 --> 01:56:16,041
cognitive science and the like in answer

2315
01:56:16,041 --> 01:56:16,041
to Dean's question about these sessions,

2316
01:56:16,041 --> 01:56:16,041
because this is not my first session, but

2317
01:56:16,041 --> 01:56:16,041
this does exemplify it.

2318
01:56:03,028 --> 01:56:17,042
Yeah, it's for fun.

2319
01:56:16,041 --> 01:56:24,049
We're amongst friends and indulging

2320
01:56:24,049 --> 01:56:24,049
ourselves and those people who care to

2321
01:56:24,049 --> 01:56:24,049
listen to us.

2322
01:56:18,043 --> 01:56:28,053
So I think the next thing to do is the

2323
01:56:28,053 --> 01:56:28,053
next horizon.

2324
01:56:24,049 --> 01:56:34,059
Although I do think dynamic calls and

2325
01:56:34,059 --> 01:56:34,059
modeling of evolutionary trajectories is

2326
01:56:34,059 --> 01:56:34,059
an excellent idea.

2327
01:56:28,053 --> 01:56:40,065
I suspect the heavy lifting now is to get

2328
01:56:40,065 --> 01:56:40,065
the ideas that we've been talking about

2329
01:56:40,065 --> 01:56:40,065
out there.

2330
01:56:34,059 --> 01:56:46,071
I think that's what Michael and Hector

2331
01:56:46,071 --> 01:56:46,071
have to do, basically, is just keep on

2332
01:56:46,071 --> 01:56:46,071
telling the story.

2333
01:56:40,065 --> 01:56:50,075
And in my experience, it usually takes

2334
01:56:50,075 --> 01:56:50,075
about five to ten years before people

2335
01:56:50,075 --> 01:56:50,075
start listening.

2336
01:56:46,071 --> 01:57:00,079
Daniel: Thank you, Carl, Michael, with

2337
01:57:00,079 --> 01:57:00,079
the last word.

2338
01:56:56,081 --> 01:57:06,085
Michael: Well, these sessions have been

2339
01:57:06,085 --> 01:57:06,085
fun and most illuminating.

2340
01:57:02,081 --> 01:57:19,098
There is a lot to be done on the whole

2341
01:57:19,098 --> 01:57:19,098
matter of whether there have been phase

2342
01:57:19,098 --> 01:57:19,098
transitions in the evolution of what we

2343
01:57:19,098 --> 01:57:19,098
might call evolvability in again as homo

2344
01:57:19,098 --> 01:57:19,098
over the past 2 million years.

2345
01:57:07,086 --> 01:57:43,122
There are big arguments amongst human

2346
01:57:43,122 --> 01:57:43,122
evolution specialists between whether

2347
01:57:43,122 --> 01:57:43,122
there was a unitary evolutionary whether

2348
01:57:43,122 --> 01:57:43,122
a unitary evolutionary model is

2349
01:57:43,122 --> 01:57:43,122
acceptable, or as lumpers like myself

2350
01:57:43,122 --> 01:57:43,122
would like to believe, or whether, in

2351
01:57:43,122 --> 01:57:43,122
fact there was a big bush.

2352
01:57:20,099 --> 01:57:56,135
With a lot of dead end, separate,

2353
01:57:56,135 --> 01:57:56,135
unsuccessful species like

2354
01:57:56,135 --> 01:57:56,135
Homoflorisiensis, Homo, Luciano.

2355
01:57:43,122 --> 01:57:59,138
Hector: Or.

2356
01:57:59,138 --> 01:58:06,139
Michael: Even perhaps Neanderthals, with

2357
01:58:06,139 --> 01:58:06,139
whom I've had a lot of contact, having

2358
01:58:06,139 --> 01:58:06,139
excavated about 15 of them.

2359
01:57:59,138 --> 01:58:35,168
And these arguments are highly relevant

2360
01:58:35,168 --> 01:58:35,168
to the matter of cognitive evolution and

2361
01:58:35,168 --> 01:58:35,168
indeed as to whether the record of

2362
01:58:35,168 --> 01:58:35,168
artifacts and tools can indeed inform us

2363
01:58:35,168 --> 01:58:35,168
that I believe it can about just how and

2364
01:58:35,168 --> 01:58:35,168
how slowly I would say, evolution

2365
01:58:35,168 --> 01:58:35,168
proceeded.

2366
01:58:07,140 --> 01:58:40,173
Of course, the splitters believe it

2367
01:58:40,173 --> 01:58:40,173
happened in leaps, jumps and leaps.

2368
01:58:36,169 --> 01:58:48,181
I'm rather convinced Darwinist, I believe

2369
01:58:48,181 --> 01:58:48,181
that things happen very, very slowly and

2370
01:58:48,181 --> 01:58:48,181
that we have to concentrate.

2371
01:58:41,174 --> 01:59:10,197
And with this I conclude on especially

2372
01:59:10,197 --> 01:59:10,197
the neuro epigenetic modification of

2373
01:59:10,197 --> 01:59:10,197
genetic expression as affecting not

2374
01:59:10,197 --> 01:59:10,197
merely morphology and physiology, but

2375
01:59:10,197 --> 01:59:10,197
also, I would say, cognition.

2376
01:58:48,181 --> 01:59:48,235
And in the matter in hand, of course, the

2377
01:59:48,235 --> 01:59:48,235
ability or not, that our supplysals

2378
01:59:48,235 --> 01:59:48,235
affect onlookers and other people

2379
01:59:48,235 --> 01:59:48,235
permitting, let's say, modification of

2380
01:59:48,235 --> 01:59:48,235
behavior with far wider results than

2381
01:59:48,235 --> 01:59:48,235
those that occur in many other species,

2382
01:59:48,235 --> 01:59:48,235
including some of those of our closest

2383
01:59:48,235 --> 01:59:48,235
permanent relatives.

2384
01:59:10,197 --> 01:59:52,239
Thank you very much for organizing this

2385
01:59:52,239 --> 01:59:52,239
session, Daniel and Dean.

2386
01:59:48,235 --> 01:59:55,242
It's been a pleasure to take part.

2387
01:59:52,239 --> 02:00:04,406
I'm sorry that I have this terrible

2388
02:00:04,406 --> 02:00:04,406
appearance, but I really can't do much

2389
02:00:04,406 --> 02:00:04,406
about that at the moment.

2390
01:59:56,243 --> 02:00:06,418
I hope.

2391
02:00:05,895 --> 02:00:08,402
Well ask for a few days.

2392
02:00:06,456 --> 02:00:10,159
Bye.

2393
02:00:10,117 --> 02:00:11,258
Daniel: Thank you all.

2394
02:00:10,164 --> 02:00:13,447
Dean: Michael, at least you have an

2395
02:00:13,447 --> 02:00:13,447
excuse.

2396
02:00:11,273 --> 02:00:15,631
I have no excuse at all.

2397
02:00:13,451 --> 02:00:21,198
All right.

2398
02:00:20,100 --> 02:00:23,400
Daniel: Till next time.

2399
02:00:21,283 --> 02:00:24,528
Long live the mean.

2400
02:00:23,411 --> 02:00:25,689
Long live the variance.

2401
02:00:24,539 --> 02:00:27,894
Hector: Thank you.

2402
02:00:26,795 --> 02:00:29,086
Bye, everybody.
