00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,040
Daniel: Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:12,351
It's March 17, 2023.

3
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:14,551
We're here in ActInf Livestream

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,727
Number 53.0.

5
00:00:14,555 --> 00:00:18,982
Welcome to the active institute.

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:25,604
We're a participatory online institute

7
00:00:25,604 --> 00:00:25,604
that is communicating, learning and

8
00:00:25,604 --> 00:00:25,604
practicing applied active inference.

9
00:00:18,995 --> 00:00:27,840
You can find us at the links on the

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:27,840
slide.

11
00:00:25,613 --> 00:00:33,436
This is a recorded and archived live

12
00:00:33,436 --> 00:00:33,436
stream, so please provide feedback so we

13
00:00:33,436 --> 00:00:33,436
can improve our work.

14
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:36,716
All backgrounds and perspectives are

15
00:00:36,716 --> 00:00:36,716
welcome.

16
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:48,925
We'll be following video etiquette for

17
00:00:48,925 --> 00:00:48,925
live streams, head over active

18
00:00:48,925 --> 00:00:48,925
inference.org to learn more about the

19
00:00:48,925 --> 00:00:48,925
institute and getting involved with

20
00:00:48,925 --> 00:00:48,925
learning groups and projects.

21
00:00:36,731 --> 00:00:58,989
We're here in Acdam stream number 53.0,

22
00:00:58,989 --> 00:00:58,989
and our goal is to learn and discuss a

23
00:00:58,989 --> 00:00:58,989
pair of papers.

24
00:00:49,031 --> 00:01:11,620
The first paper is Snakes and Ladders in

25
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:11,620
Paleoanthropology from Cognitive Surprise

26
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:11,620
to Skillfulness a Million Years Ago by

27
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:11,620
Hector Manrique, Carl Friston and Michael

28
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:11,620
Walker.

29
00:00:59,008 --> 00:01:26,133
The article was posted to Sci Archive in

30
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:26,133
2022 and the second paper is to copy or

31
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:26,133
not to copy, that is the question from

32
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:26,133
Chimpanzees to the foundation of Human

33
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:26,133
Technological Culture.

34
00:01:11,662 --> 00:01:31,646
This paper is with Menrique and Walker as

35
00:01:31,646 --> 00:01:31,646
authors.

36
00:01:26,175 --> 00:01:35,047
Fristenless it was also uploaded to Psy

37
00:01:35,047 --> 00:01:35,047
Archive.

38
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:43,819
And recently, as we have been delighted

39
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:43,819
to discover, the paper has been accepted

40
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:43,819
in Physics of Life reviews.

41
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:49,043
However, the quotes that we're drawing

42
00:01:49,043 --> 00:01:49,043
from and reading from today are drawn

43
00:01:49,043 --> 00:01:49,043
from the Psy Archive version.

44
00:01:43,827 --> 00:01:57,124
Just so people know and like all the

45
00:01:57,124 --> 00:01:57,124
videos, we're here to make an

46
00:01:57,124 --> 00:01:57,124
introduction for some of the dean and the

47
00:01:57,124 --> 00:01:57,124
materials.

48
00:01:49,043 --> 00:02:00,097
It's not a review or a final word.

49
00:01:57,125 --> 00:02:15,247
In this 53.0 video, we're going to

50
00:02:15,247 --> 00:02:15,247
introduce ourselves, say hello, and then

51
00:02:15,247 --> 00:02:15,247
we are going to call it like we see it

52
00:02:15,247 --> 00:02:15,247
with the aims and claims abstract roadmap

53
00:02:15,247 --> 00:02:15,247
keywords.

54
00:02:01,102 --> 00:02:25,339
And there are no figures or formalisms in

55
00:02:25,339 --> 00:02:25,339
these papers, but I think we'll have

56
00:02:25,339 --> 00:02:25,339
enough bounded surprise to navigate

57
00:02:25,339 --> 00:02:25,339
nonetheless.

58
00:02:15,248 --> 00:02:30,390
So let us begin with introductions and

59
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,390
then we'll head into big questions.

60
00:02:25,341 --> 00:02:30,399
So. Dean.

61
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:34,429
Dean: Thanks, Danny.

62
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,433
I'm Dean.

63
00:02:34,429 --> 00:02:35,445
I'm here in Calgary.

64
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:43,523
I'm not going to do much around the warm

65
00:02:43,523 --> 00:02:43,523
up question piece because I've got a big

66
00:02:43,523 --> 00:02:43,523
question coming up, so I'll pass it over

67
00:02:43,523 --> 00:02:43,523
to you.

68
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:47,560
Daniel: I'm Daniel, I'm in California and

69
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:47,560
agreed.

70
00:02:43,527 --> 00:02:50,591
Please lead in with your big questions.

71
00:02:47,562 --> 00:02:58,674
Dean: Well, I'm going to start by just

72
00:02:58,674 --> 00:02:58,674
sort of highlighting the big questions

73
00:02:58,674 --> 00:02:58,674
that the authors have, if that's okay.

74
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:59,688
I'll just read them out.

75
00:02:58,674 --> 00:03:10,733
So for the Snakes and Ladder paper, there

76
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:10,733
were a number of questions that sort of

77
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:10,733
enabled the authors to go forward with

78
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:10,733
their ideas.

79
00:03:00,632 --> 00:03:11,747
Two questions arise.

80
00:03:10,734 --> 00:03:25,884
First, what is it that could provoke

81
00:03:25,884 --> 00:03:25,884
cognitive awareness as to the possibility

82
00:03:25,884 --> 00:03:25,884
of fashioning stone hand axes in relation

83
00:03:25,884 --> 00:03:25,884
to the affordances of raw materials and

84
00:03:25,884 --> 00:03:25,884
potential advantages for minimizing

85
00:03:25,884 --> 00:03:25,884
bioenergetic effort?

86
00:03:11,749 --> 00:03:34,970
Secondly, what does this say about the

87
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:34,970
irregular appearance of this regular

88
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:34,970
technique in the Pleistocene spatial

89
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:34,970
temporal record?

90
00:03:25,885 --> 00:03:53,163
Also, how was remembered awareness

91
00:03:53,163 --> 00:03:53,163
retrieved from personal, short and long

92
00:03:53,163 --> 00:03:53,163
term memory transmitted as knowledge to

93
00:03:53,163 --> 00:03:53,163
others in whose memories it could become

94
00:03:53,163 --> 00:03:53,163
embedded with a degree of fidelity

95
00:03:53,163 --> 00:03:53,163
sufficient to enable intergenerational or

96
00:03:53,163 --> 00:03:53,163
intercommunal diffusion?

97
00:03:34,973 --> 00:03:57,202
How far was observational learning

98
00:03:57,202 --> 00:03:57,202
involved?

99
00:03:53,165 --> 00:04:01,189
Do you want me to read the CRNC, or do

100
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:01,189
you want to do that yourself?

101
00:03:57,203 --> 00:04:07,241
Daniel: All right, I'll read the

102
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:07,241
questions from the authors in Copy or not

103
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:07,241
to Copy.

104
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:13,309
They wrote, Why do chimpanzees not live

105
00:04:13,309 --> 00:04:13,309
in a complex technological world?

106
00:04:07,242 --> 00:04:20,369
Why does innovation fail to translate

107
00:04:20,369 --> 00:04:20,369
into technological cumulative

108
00:04:20,369 --> 00:04:20,369
complexity?

109
00:04:14,311 --> 00:04:24,411
Does it owe to a limited capacity to copy

110
00:04:24,411 --> 00:04:24,411
with fidelity?

111
00:04:20,371 --> 00:04:26,438
What is the implication for innovations?

112
00:04:24,413 --> 00:04:42,591
What ingredients must be present from a

113
00:04:42,591 --> 00:04:42,591
free energy principle standpoint in

114
00:04:42,591 --> 00:04:42,591
innovators minds brains and in observers

115
00:04:42,591 --> 00:04:42,591
mind slash brains for innovation to take

116
00:04:42,591 --> 00:04:42,591
root in a community and be transmitted

117
00:04:42,591 --> 00:04:42,591
between generations?

118
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:49,669
Dean: Yeah, great questions.

119
00:04:47,648 --> 00:05:27,980
Now, how do we want well, we know how we

120
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:27,980
want to do this, but one of the things

121
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:27,980
before we get too far along is we, as

122
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:27,980
hosts today, really want to honor the

123
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:27,980
fact that a lot of time has been spent

124
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:27,980
making sure that the ideas that the

125
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:27,980
authors want to bring into the public

126
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:27,980
domain are very clear and that we don't

127
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:27,980
read a whole bunch into it.

128
00:04:50,675 --> 00:05:29,005
Now, we're not going to speculate.

129
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:32,035
We're not going to go off on any kind of

130
00:05:32,035 --> 00:05:32,035
tangent here.

131
00:05:29,006 --> 00:05:43,142
We're going to try to focus strictly on

132
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:43,142
the arguments that they are putting

133
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:43,142
forward, because they're putting forward

134
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:43,142
some pretty strong and I think, well

135
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:43,142
evidenced arguments.

136
00:05:32,035 --> 00:05:51,225
So although there's lots of questions

137
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:51,225
being asked, they're also trying to

138
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:51,225
provide a few very defendable answers.

139
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:53,249
Daniel: Absolutely.

140
00:05:53,241 --> 00:06:02,278
That is to prelude the questions that we,

141
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:02,278
Dean and I and Ali are asking.

142
00:05:54,257 --> 00:06:18,431
And then we're going to dive largely into

143
00:06:18,431 --> 00:06:18,431
verbatim quotations from the texts, and

144
00:06:18,431 --> 00:06:18,431
we'll have a dessert session where we

145
00:06:18,431 --> 00:06:18,431
bring up some future topics and ideas.

146
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:21,469
What big question brought you into this?

147
00:06:19,444 --> 00:06:25,503
Dean: 53 dean okay, so apologies.

148
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:31,566
There's going to be a lot of reading

149
00:06:31,566 --> 00:06:31,566
today, so if you don't like my voice,

150
00:06:31,566 --> 00:06:31,566
you're going to just read this and hit

151
00:06:31,566 --> 00:06:31,566
the pause button.

152
00:06:25,504 --> 00:06:36,610
But anyway, the attention topical

153
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:36,610
transition is paper one to paper two.

154
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:43,681
And we're not really spending a lot of

155
00:06:43,681 --> 00:06:43,681
time right now saying which came first

156
00:06:43,681 --> 00:06:43,681
because we think of them as a pair.

157
00:06:36,611 --> 00:06:53,779
The shift between snakes and ladders

158
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:53,779
model of evolution and learning

159
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:53,779
comparisons across species with special

160
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:53,779
attention given to innovation as copying

161
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:53,779
ability.

162
00:06:43,686 --> 00:06:58,833
Both papers there is much to say and

163
00:06:58,833 --> 00:06:58,833
discuss around learning as an uptake

164
00:06:58,833 --> 00:06:58,833
exercise.

165
00:06:53,780 --> 00:07:13,926
If as reviewers, people reading these

166
00:07:13,926 --> 00:07:13,926
papers, we were to take an active and

167
00:07:13,926 --> 00:07:13,926
then in between that and inference

168
00:07:13,926 --> 00:07:13,926
anthropologist, archaeologist,

169
00:07:13,926 --> 00:07:13,926
comparative psychologist approach to

170
00:07:13,926 --> 00:07:13,926
combining these manuscripts.

171
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:25,044
And then I singled out many examples of

172
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:25,044
where the authors speak expressively

173
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:25,044
around combining combinatorial, and you

174
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:25,044
can read that on your own.

175
00:07:13,926 --> 00:07:46,257
If we were to look at combinations, what

176
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:46,257
might we learn when bicameral, for

177
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:46,257
example, two eyes and bi temporal meaning

178
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:46,257
holding up then and now strategies as

179
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:46,257
analysis are approximated with active and

180
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:46,257
inference as parentheses tool uptake, for

181
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:46,257
example, telescopes and microscope

182
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:46,257
usage.

183
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:52,313
After before or concurrent with

184
00:07:52,313 --> 00:07:52,313
compounding strategy uptake.

185
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:54,331
So that's my big question.

186
00:07:52,317 --> 00:07:58,378
And I think we're probably not going to

187
00:07:58,378 --> 00:07:58,378
get close to an answer until the dot

188
00:07:58,378 --> 00:07:58,378
two.

189
00:07:54,332 --> 00:08:05,383
That's why it's a big question because I

190
00:08:05,383 --> 00:08:05,383
think it's going to be able to span a

191
00:08:05,383 --> 00:08:05,383
little bit of a window here.

192
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:07,403
Daniel: Great.

193
00:08:06,395 --> 00:08:11,441
And I wrote a shorter question.

194
00:08:07,407 --> 00:08:26,590
Apart from other applications, for

195
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:26,590
example, in research and development or

196
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:26,590
in other fields or looking towards the

197
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:26,590
future, how does the free energy

198
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:26,590
principle and active inference serve as a

199
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:26,590
historical framework or approach?

200
00:08:11,446 --> 00:08:47,803
So whether we lean towards Aristotelian

201
00:08:47,803 --> 00:08:47,803
Causation Philosophies or Tinbergen's

202
00:08:47,803 --> 00:08:47,803
approach to ethology behavioral analysis,

203
00:08:47,803 --> 00:08:47,803
how does a historical explanatory power

204
00:08:47,803 --> 00:08:47,803
fit in amongst the wise, the plurality of

205
00:08:47,803 --> 00:08:47,803
wise in our investigations?

206
00:08:26,592 --> 00:08:58,916
And Ali, who is joining for some

207
00:08:58,916 --> 00:08:58,916
discussions, proposed the question how

208
00:08:58,916 --> 00:08:58,916
can self organized systems use copy

209
00:08:58,916 --> 00:08:58,916
discard functions to store information?

210
00:08:47,807 --> 00:09:07,948
A little bit of an externalization from

211
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:07,948
our category theory developments that I'm

212
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:07,948
sure will arise later.

213
00:08:59,924 --> 00:09:11,989
So you go for the top, I'll go for the

214
00:09:11,989 --> 00:09:11,989
bottom.

215
00:09:08,951 --> 00:09:12,997
Dean: Okay.

216
00:09:12,993 --> 00:09:32,197
So just before I start, I want to really

217
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:32,197
emphasize the fact that the authors I

218
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:32,197
think to really comprehend what the

219
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:32,197
authors are trying to put forward as an

220
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:32,197
idea here, you have to really spend some

221
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:32,197
time thinking through the aims of the

222
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:32,197
papers and the claims.

223
00:09:12,998 --> 00:09:34,213
We placed a heavy emphasis.

224
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:36,234
We're going to give a lot more time over

225
00:09:36,234 --> 00:09:36,234
to that.

226
00:09:34,215 --> 00:09:55,420
It's going to seem like we're going to

227
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:55,420
give a lot of time over to the keys

228
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:55,420
because having talked to the authors

229
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:55,420
prior to coming on and doing this live

230
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:55,420
stream set, they use those terms of the

231
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:55,420
key and the key to unlocking some of

232
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:55,420
these ideas that have been held for a

233
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:55,420
long time.

234
00:09:36,235 --> 00:10:01,423
So apologies again if it seems like we're

235
00:10:01,423 --> 00:10:01,423
text heavy or dialogue heavy.

236
00:09:55,421 --> 00:10:05,461
But in order to really appreciate what's

237
00:10:05,461 --> 00:10:05,461
going on, you have to kind of get it out

238
00:10:05,461 --> 00:10:05,461
there.

239
00:10:01,425 --> 00:10:15,569
So for the Snakes and Labs paper, provide

240
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:15,569
a hypothesis, a paradigmatic account

241
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:15,569
around how variational free energy is

242
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:15,569
both individual ontogenetic and

243
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:15,569
collective.

244
00:10:05,462 --> 00:10:43,842
Phylogenetic modeling could have played a

245
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:43,842
part in what could now be described as a

246
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:43,842
methodological fep paradigm or relating

247
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:43,842
biological and technological behavior in

248
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:43,842
homo, snakes and ladders in this context

249
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:43,842
pertains to appearances and

250
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:43,842
disappearances of Paleolithic skills in

251
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:43,842
the early and middle Pleistocene record.

252
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:51,925
Our proposal invokes a methodological

253
00:10:51,925 --> 00:10:51,925
paradigm grounded in existential

254
00:10:51,925 --> 00:10:51,925
principles that underpin the evolution of

255
00:10:51,925 --> 00:10:51,925
living organisms.

256
00:10:43,848 --> 00:11:24,192
It is that some, at least of the

257
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:24,192
irregular, regularities and regular

258
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:24,192
irregularities of phenomena attributable

259
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:24,192
to homo in the Pleistocene record reflect

260
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:24,192
the kinds of plausibility anomalous

261
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:24,192
behavior outcomes that doubtless occurred

262
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:24,192
often in a stakes and ladder model of

263
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:24,192
evolution in early members of Ardenus,

264
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:24,192
regardless of their skeletal

265
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:24,192
paleospecific taxonomy.

266
00:10:51,927 --> 00:11:25,203
Daniel: Awesome.

267
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:31,266
I'll read the bottom and then feel free

268
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:31,266
to explain the side by side visually.

269
00:11:25,204 --> 00:11:34,296
They wrote into copy or not to copy.

270
00:11:32,272 --> 00:11:54,490
An aim is to introduce the notion that

271
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:54,490
chimpanzees and other great apes show

272
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:54,490
considerable limitations in their

273
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:54,490
ambiguity or zone of bounded surprisal to

274
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:54,490
overcome cognitive surprisal induced by

275
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:54,490
innovative or unorthodox behavior, which

276
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:54,490
is rarely is copied precisely or

277
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:54,490
accurately.

278
00:11:34,298 --> 00:12:02,518
So things that can be innovated in a

279
00:12:02,518 --> 00:12:02,518
moment but do not have the ability to be

280
00:12:02,518 --> 00:12:02,518
recognized and carried forward.

281
00:11:54,491 --> 00:12:13,620
And they discussed the circumstances

282
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:13,620
under which Pleistocene homo underwent

283
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:13,620
remarkable evolutionary adaptation of

284
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:13,620
neurobiological propensities.

285
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:15,642
Cerebral aspects are discussed.

286
00:12:13,623 --> 00:12:24,737
That it is proposed here were fundamental

287
00:12:24,737 --> 00:12:24,737
for faithful copying, which underpins

288
00:12:24,737 --> 00:12:24,737
social transmission of technology's,

289
00:12:24,737 --> 00:12:24,737
cumulative culture and culture.

290
00:12:15,642 --> 00:12:31,806
Dean: So I think what we're going to be

291
00:12:31,806 --> 00:12:31,806
doing is holding up two things at once.

292
00:12:26,758 --> 00:12:38,877
The two things are copying as repetition

293
00:12:38,877 --> 00:12:38,877
and copying as origination, if there is

294
00:12:38,877 --> 00:12:38,877
such a word.

295
00:12:31,807 --> 00:12:46,949
But essentially of these images here,

296
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:46,949
there are copies that were simply cut and

297
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:46,949
pasted so they were repeated.

298
00:12:38,878 --> 00:12:52,016
And then there was one representation

299
00:12:52,016 --> 00:12:52,016
between those two that's an origination.

300
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:58,071
It didn't exist to be copied, but now it

301
00:12:58,071 --> 00:12:58,071
can be.

302
00:12:52,017 --> 00:13:12,156
So now what we're going to be doing is

303
00:13:12,156 --> 00:13:12,156
looking at, okay, so how does maybe all

304
00:13:12,156 --> 00:13:12,156
of that play out when we're observing the

305
00:13:12,156 --> 00:13:12,156
world around us, when we're taking things

306
00:13:12,156 --> 00:13:12,156
in and trying to reduce our surprise?

307
00:12:58,073 --> 00:13:15,181
How many things are we being deep faked

308
00:13:15,181 --> 00:13:15,181
on?

309
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:31,340
How many things are action action

310
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:31,340
oriented representation therefore

311
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:31,340
manageable as two very different places

312
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:31,340
of understanding or appreciation, maybe?

313
00:13:15,182 --> 00:13:34,373
Daniel: Great.

314
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:34,379
All right.

315
00:13:34,374 --> 00:13:43,461
I'll go for the first of the sections and

316
00:13:43,461 --> 00:13:43,461
then feel free to comment on them or to

317
00:13:43,461 --> 00:13:43,461
pick up on the second sections.

318
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:58,613
So in snakes and Ladders, they wrote,

319
00:13:58,613 --> 00:13:58,613
cognitive surprises favoring anomalous

320
00:13:58,613 --> 00:13:58,613
behavioral propensities to sporadic

321
00:13:58,613 --> 00:13:58,613
expression, can explain snakes and

322
00:13:58,613 --> 00:13:58,613
ladders appearances and disappearances of

323
00:13:58,613 --> 00:13:58,613
paleolithic skills in the early and

324
00:13:58,613 --> 00:13:58,613
middle Pleistocene.

325
00:13:43,464 --> 00:14:12,697
Record some behavioral outcomes

326
00:14:12,697 --> 00:14:12,697
attributable plausibly to individual

327
00:14:12,697 --> 00:14:12,697
members of homo unable to maintain

328
00:14:12,697 --> 00:14:12,697
orthodox behavior responses when faced

329
00:14:12,697 --> 00:14:12,697
with cognitive surprises, which is

330
00:14:12,697 --> 00:14:12,697
surprisal in the Bayesian terminology.

331
00:13:58,613 --> 00:14:20,774
Such individuals may show a particular

332
00:14:20,774 --> 00:14:20,774
neurobiological propensity for exploring

333
00:14:20,774 --> 00:14:20,774
unorthodox possibilities.

334
00:14:13,706 --> 00:14:43,003
The propensity has evolved further in

335
00:14:43,003 --> 00:14:43,003
humans than in great apes, which, unlike

336
00:14:43,003 --> 00:14:43,003
even our very young children, our larvae

337
00:14:43,003 --> 00:14:43,003
seem unable to envisage how things might

338
00:14:43,003 --> 00:14:43,003
be as well as how they actually are,

339
00:14:43,003 --> 00:14:43,003
whereas by coupling recall of past

340
00:14:43,003 --> 00:14:43,003
experience with prospective memory,

341
00:14:43,003 --> 00:14:43,003
humans are capable of blending reality

342
00:14:43,003 --> 00:14:43,003
among different potential spheres.

343
00:14:20,776 --> 00:15:02,131
Dean: Statistical considerations of

344
00:15:02,131 --> 00:15:02,131
classical population genetics are

345
00:15:02,131 --> 00:15:02,131
incommensurate with notions that

346
00:15:02,131 --> 00:15:02,131
Darwinian fitness and Pleistocene homo

347
00:15:02,131 --> 00:15:02,131
increased imperceptibly through gradual

348
00:15:02,131 --> 00:15:02,131
dual inheritance.

349
00:14:47,043 --> 00:15:15,265
Coevolution inherited changes proceeded

350
00:15:15,265 --> 00:15:15,265
in well nigh invariant lockstep with

351
00:15:15,265 --> 00:15:15,265
heritability of active behavioral and

352
00:15:15,265 --> 00:15:15,265
technological changes.

353
00:15:02,131 --> 00:15:37,489
Although ontogenetic autopoiesis may

354
00:15:37,489 --> 00:15:37,489
involve action perception cycles, a

355
00:15:37,489 --> 00:15:37,489
phylogenetic consequence could include

356
00:15:37,489 --> 00:15:37,489
unawareness by companions that those

357
00:15:37,489 --> 00:15:37,489
exceptions might allow new cooperative

358
00:15:37,489 --> 00:15:37,489
opportunities for minimizing the group's

359
00:15:37,489 --> 00:15:37,489
variation of free energy by performing

360
00:15:37,489 --> 00:15:37,489
unaccustomed behavior to attain dubious

361
00:15:37,489 --> 00:15:37,489
benefit.

362
00:15:15,268 --> 00:16:06,710
Though foresight of fluent communication

363
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:06,710
innovations often must have disappeared

364
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:06,710
unremarket, seen as useless and their

365
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:06,710
creator's prowess as misplaced energy and

366
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:06,710
wasting time needed for satisfying the

367
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:06,710
group's existentially implacable,

368
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:06,710
energetics prepotent, routine behavior,

369
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:06,710
and prosocial early homo plausibly

370
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:06,710
resulted in failure to become aware of

371
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:06,710
the potential of idiosyncratic active

372
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:06,710
outcomes.

373
00:15:38,490 --> 00:16:19,848
Here a prosaic approach merely inverts

374
00:16:19,848 --> 00:16:19,848
that narrative approach to interpreting

375
00:16:19,848 --> 00:16:19,848
the deep past, which draws for its

376
00:16:19,848 --> 00:16:19,848
inspiration on humane and social

377
00:16:19,848 --> 00:16:19,848
studies.

378
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:33,982
The inversion subordinates the narrative

379
00:16:33,982 --> 00:16:33,982
approach to critical scrutiny, such that

380
00:16:33,982 --> 00:16:33,982
the narrative approach no longer seems to

381
00:16:33,982 --> 00:16:33,982
be the most appropriate or most

382
00:16:33,982 --> 00:16:33,982
parsimonious interpretation available.

383
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:38,031
Now, again, what we're doing is trying to

384
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:38,031
avoid the situation where we're cherry

385
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:38,031
picking.

386
00:16:33,984 --> 00:16:44,099
So if you want to pause and read what's

387
00:16:44,099 --> 00:16:44,099
been written in context, please feel free

388
00:16:44,099 --> 00:16:44,099
to do that.

389
00:16:38,032 --> 00:16:52,176
But we just want to make sure that we

390
00:16:52,176 --> 00:16:52,176
touch on the highest peaks in this

391
00:16:52,176 --> 00:16:52,176
range.

392
00:16:45,099 --> 00:16:56,212
Daniel: Yes, the full papers are out

393
00:16:56,212 --> 00:16:56,212
there.

394
00:16:53,184 --> 00:17:12,314
We're linearizing and curating in this

395
00:17:12,314 --> 00:17:12,314
zero, which has been an incredible

396
00:17:12,314 --> 00:17:12,314
experience and that has helped us grasp

397
00:17:12,314 --> 00:17:12,314
some of these points, hopefully, so we

398
00:17:12,314 --> 00:17:12,314
can take them further.

399
00:16:56,217 --> 00:17:15,349
And I'll read the quote and then you can

400
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:15,349
go into the red zone.

401
00:17:12,315 --> 00:17:16,359
Dean: Yeah, go for it.

402
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:35,541
Daniel: In Snakes and Ladders, they wrote

403
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:35,541
the argument proposed here about a

404
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:35,541
neurobiological propensity to an

405
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:35,541
individual enactment in modifying stone,

406
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:35,541
considered from the standpoint of the

407
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:35,541
free energy principle, is not concerned

408
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:35,541
with a null hypothesis of innate latent

409
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:35,541
spontaneity.

410
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:44,635
Instead, it is directed towards

411
00:17:44,635 --> 00:17:44,635
interpreting irregular regularities and

412
00:17:44,635 --> 00:17:44,635
regular irregularities in the Pleistocene

413
00:17:44,635 --> 00:17:44,635
snakes and ladders.

414
00:17:35,545 --> 00:17:52,714
Record of appearances and disappearances

415
00:17:52,714 --> 00:17:52,714
of Bflcts, which we're going to get to

416
00:17:52,714 --> 00:17:52,714
tools.

417
00:17:44,636 --> 00:17:57,765
Given presence of BF lCTs in widely

418
00:17:57,765 --> 00:17:57,765
differing biotopes.

419
00:17:52,716 --> 00:18:04,770
Which likely led to differential

420
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:04,770
behavioral evolution of appropriate

421
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:04,770
subsistence strategies and diets.

422
00:17:57,766 --> 00:18:21,948
There is widespread comparability of the

423
00:18:21,948 --> 00:18:21,948
principal morphological attributes of BF

424
00:18:21,948 --> 00:18:21,948
lCTs of diverse Petrology at sites with

425
00:18:21,948 --> 00:18:21,948
contrasting paleo environments and

426
00:18:21,948 --> 00:18:21,948
different spatiotemporal contexts or

427
00:18:21,948 --> 00:18:21,948
paleoanthropological taxa.

428
00:18:04,771 --> 00:18:33,006
This renders unlikely any notion of a

429
00:18:33,006 --> 00:18:33,006
straightforward mendelian genetic basis

430
00:18:33,006 --> 00:18:33,006
favoring BF Lct outcomes by natural

431
00:18:33,006 --> 00:18:33,006
selection for a specific behavior

432
00:18:33,006 --> 00:18:33,006
adaptation.

433
00:18:22,953 --> 00:18:55,028
The circumstantial evidence seems to

434
00:18:55,028 --> 00:18:55,028
apply the adaptive evolution of human

435
00:18:55,028 --> 00:18:55,028
neurobiology propensities that support

436
00:18:55,028 --> 00:18:55,028
prospective memory in tool making,

437
00:18:55,028 --> 00:18:55,028
together with short term working memory,

438
00:18:55,028 --> 00:18:55,028
including haptic working memory, long

439
00:18:55,028 --> 00:18:55,028
term working memory, and long term

440
00:18:55,028 --> 00:18:55,028
procedural memory and episodic memory of

441
00:18:55,028 --> 00:18:55,028
past matters and things.

442
00:18:33,006 --> 00:19:16,043
Dean: So I'm doing a tease here, because

443
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:16,043
on the previous slide, I starred one of

444
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:16,043
the claims and then the last claim on

445
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:16,043
this slide here, my note is essentially,

446
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:16,043
I'm just going to read the part that

447
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:16,043
doesn't again, have me speculating memory

448
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:16,043
broken into types, as you can see here.

449
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:19,046
Working memory, long term, procedural, et

450
00:19:19,046 --> 00:19:19,046
cetera.

451
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:21,048
And now being applied instrumentally.

452
00:19:19,046 --> 00:19:37,064
Did all the memory types at some

453
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:37,064
threshold of uptake afford a parallel

454
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:37,064
processing of time, given time's

455
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:37,064
potential variance over the simpler

456
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:37,064
sequential sense of change as the starter

457
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:37,064
pack priority today?

458
00:19:21,048 --> 00:19:46,073
When I say starter pack priority today,

459
00:19:46,073 --> 00:19:46,073
how much about what we do today is being

460
00:19:46,073 --> 00:19:46,073
projected or overfit onto the deep past?

461
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:54,081
This is a question that Michael's

462
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:54,081
presentation in the 53 one is going to

463
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:54,081
have much to say.

464
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:57,084
Also the last claim of the copy or not to

465
00:19:57,084 --> 00:19:57,084
copy.

466
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:59,086
So a bit of a teaser.

467
00:19:57,084 --> 00:20:06,087
You're going to want to show up for 53

468
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:06,087
one, because I think Michael's

469
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:06,087
presentation is going to really open up a

470
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:06,087
lot of eyes.

471
00:19:59,086 --> 00:20:09,090
Daniel: Awesome.

472
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:15,096
Into to copy or not to copy, we go to

473
00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:15,096
their claims.

474
00:20:10,091 --> 00:20:22,103
So just to read some of the first parts,

475
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:22,103
what is the implication for innovations?

476
00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:26,107
A sinaquanon for one to spread.

477
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:37,118
So something that must happen to spread

478
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:37,118
is following its conception by one mind,

479
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:37,118
namely the hmm hierarchically,

480
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:37,118
mechanistic mind of the protagonist

481
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:37,118
brain.

482
00:20:26,107 --> 00:20:44,125
It must then be apprehended by another

483
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:44,125
mind, namely the hmm of an observer's

484
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:44,125
brain.

485
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:46,127
And we're going to come back to that on

486
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:46,127
the roadmap.

487
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:53,134
Here, innovations represent an anomaly,

488
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:53,134
and innovators are unorthodox actors or

489
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:53,134
protagonists.

490
00:20:46,127 --> 00:21:12,147
Their policy selection is in a sense,

491
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:12,147
faulty, in the sense that their ensuing

492
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:12,147
behavioral outcomes are in market

493
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:12,147
contrast to those of their fellow actors

494
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:12,147
or agents who deploy orthodox responses

495
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:12,147
that reduce discrepancies between

496
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:12,147
predictions and sensation.

497
00:20:53,134 --> 00:21:15,150
Thus, innovators fail to fulfill their

498
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:15,150
predictions.

499
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:32,167
If innovations be regarded as behavior

500
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:32,167
outputs, theirs are then responses that

501
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:32,167
fall outside the repertoire typical of

502
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:32,167
their community, and hence ceterais

503
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:32,167
paribus all of the things equal increase

504
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:32,167
the prediction error, e.

505
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:39,174
G the level of cognitive surprisal in

506
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:39,174
their exchanges with the surrounding eco

507
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:39,174
niche.

508
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:54,189
Dean: Predicted consequences of any

509
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:54,189
observed innovative behavior will be too

510
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:54,189
imprecise for the cons specific to make

511
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:54,189
sense of that novel or unorthodox

512
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:54,189
behavior.

513
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:59,194
When sense cannot be made, copying cannot

514
00:21:59,194 --> 00:21:59,194
take place.

515
00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:02,191
Very clear.

516
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:18,207
When brains cope with high levels of

517
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:18,207
cognitive surprisals, a plausible answer

518
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:18,207
is that it is when the holding capacity

519
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:18,207
of working memory increases from two to

520
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:18,207
three.

521
00:22:05,194 --> 00:22:29,217
Working memory in this setting

522
00:22:29,217 --> 00:22:29,217
corresponds to the temporal depth of

523
00:22:29,217 --> 00:22:29,217
generative models that generate or

524
00:22:29,217 --> 00:22:29,217
predict the consequences of successive

525
00:22:29,217 --> 00:22:29,217
actions.

526
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:39,228
This transition increases temporal

527
00:22:39,228 --> 00:22:39,228
horizon, which amplifies cognitive

528
00:22:39,228 --> 00:22:39,228
versatility and one of my favorite

529
00:22:39,228 --> 00:22:39,228
things, recursive thinking.

530
00:22:29,218 --> 00:22:49,238
A working memory or detemporal model able

531
00:22:49,238 --> 00:22:49,238
to entertain diverse novel Bayesian

532
00:22:49,238 --> 00:22:49,238
beliefs is more likely able to recognize

533
00:22:49,238 --> 00:22:49,238
and remember innovative behaviors.

534
00:22:40,229 --> 00:23:12,254
And it's easier for chimpanzees to

535
00:23:12,254 --> 00:23:12,254
perform complex action that involve

536
00:23:12,254 --> 00:23:12,254
considerable motor demands than it is for

537
00:23:12,254 --> 00:23:12,254
them to reproduce actions that are simple

538
00:23:12,254 --> 00:23:12,254
and undemanding with regard to motor

539
00:23:12,254 --> 00:23:12,254
dexterity and yet unorthodox with regard

540
00:23:12,254 --> 00:23:12,254
to their habitual behavioral repertoire.

541
00:22:50,239 --> 00:23:15,258
Daniel: Great.

542
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:21,264
I'll just joke and meme internally as we

543
00:23:21,264 --> 00:23:21,264
carry forward.

544
00:23:15,258 --> 00:23:26,269
Yeah, go for the top half here.

545
00:23:24,267 --> 00:23:27,270
Dean: All right, I'll do the first

546
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:27,270
three.

547
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:38,281
When considering early Pleistocene

548
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:38,281
behavior, we need not assume memories

549
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:38,281
were less complex psycho cognitively than

550
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:38,281
are ours.

551
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:48,291
It is prosaically sufficient to infer

552
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:48,291
that they were simply less frequent owing

553
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:48,291
to earlier consolidation of cerebral

554
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:48,291
networks in Homo erectus's smaller

555
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:48,291
brain.

556
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:53,296
And we're going to get into something

557
00:23:53,296 --> 00:23:53,296
called the zone of bounded surprisal

558
00:23:53,296 --> 00:23:53,296
here.

559
00:23:49,292 --> 00:24:11,308
And after the ZVS restricted them,

560
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:11,308
observations by early Homo erectus were

561
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:11,308
translated often into activity

562
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:11,308
intermediate between I love that

563
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:11,308
emulation and imitation owing to limited

564
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:11,308
foresight.

565
00:23:53,296 --> 00:24:24,321
That or there zbs limited their ambiguity

566
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:24,321
to join up the mental steps involved in

567
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:24,321
planning and to infer counterfactual

568
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:24,321
possibilities.

569
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:32,329
The focus of the Zbs is on the observers

570
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:32,329
and their ability to make sense of an

571
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:32,329
observed innovation.

572
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:47,344
The ZPs allows any potentially novel or

573
00:24:47,344 --> 00:24:47,344
unorthodox behavior to be copied provided

574
00:24:47,344 --> 00:24:47,344
that the ranges or the levels of surprise

575
00:24:47,344 --> 00:24:47,344
provoked in observers are tolerated or

576
00:24:47,344 --> 00:24:47,344
manageable by.

577
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:54,351
Daniel: There'S bilateral neuronal

578
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:54,351
activation in some brain regions.

579
00:24:49,346 --> 00:25:11,362
When some tools are being fashioned,

580
00:25:11,362 --> 00:25:11,362
activation is bilateral because

581
00:25:11,362 --> 00:25:11,362
fashioning stone requires precise and

582
00:25:11,362 --> 00:25:11,362
accurate monitoring by right hemisphere

583
00:25:11,362 --> 00:25:11,362
neurons of the left hand holding the

584
00:25:11,362 --> 00:25:11,362
future artifact as well as the action

585
00:25:11,362 --> 00:25:11,362
planning.

586
00:24:54,351 --> 00:25:19,370
It performed by the right hand holding a

587
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,370
hammerstone which are monitored by left

588
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,370
hemisphere neurons.

589
00:25:11,362 --> 00:25:30,381
Together they coordinate continuously

590
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:30,381
changing sensory motor representations

591
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:30,381
with appropriately changing hand

592
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:30,381
movements undertaken in an organized

593
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:30,381
forward sequence of perception action

594
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:30,381
with feedback.

595
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:56,407
Entertaining multiple and varied

596
00:25:56,407 --> 00:25:56,407
predictions in the Bayesian framework

597
00:25:56,407 --> 00:25:56,407
represented as probability densities in

598
00:25:56,407 --> 00:25:56,407
alternate models generated about reality

599
00:25:56,407 --> 00:25:56,407
enables the narrowing of cognitive gaps

600
00:25:56,407 --> 00:25:56,407
or lessening of cognitive dissonance or

601
00:25:56,407 --> 00:25:56,407
surprisal when conspecifics are seen to

602
00:25:56,407 --> 00:25:56,407
carry out unusual or unorthodox behaviors

603
00:25:56,407 --> 00:25:56,407
that paves the way for horizontal and

604
00:25:56,407 --> 00:25:56,407
vertical transmission.

605
00:25:30,381 --> 00:26:15,420
The working memory capacity of

606
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:15,420
chimpanzees seems to be below that

607
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:15,420
tipping point at which multiple mental

608
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:15,420
spheres or possibilities can be

609
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:15,420
entertained simultaneously for pitting

610
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:15,420
against an observed novel behavior while

611
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:15,420
keeping cognitive surprisal within a

612
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:15,420
tolerable range unsurprisingly.

613
00:25:57,407 --> 00:26:22,427
No copying occurs when innovations

614
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:22,427
observed deviate markedly from usual

615
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:22,427
chimpanzee behavior.

616
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:25,430
Dean: Can I just throw something in

617
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:25,430
here?

618
00:26:23,428 --> 00:26:29,434
Now, at this point we'll step back and

619
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:29,434
think about this as a live stream.

620
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:39,444
We are trying to avoid a tipping point by

621
00:26:39,444 --> 00:26:39,444
placing a heavy weighting on the aims and

622
00:26:39,444 --> 00:26:39,444
claims relative to most of the live

623
00:26:39,444 --> 00:26:39,444
streams that we've done in the past.

624
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:46,451
This is a big build up, but think of this

625
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:46,451
as your classic barbell analogy.

626
00:26:39,444 --> 00:26:49,454
We've just tipped one plate on the bar.

627
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:54,459
Now we're going to look at the bar and

628
00:26:54,459 --> 00:26:54,459
then we're going to look at the other

629
00:26:54,459 --> 00:26:54,459
plates on the other side of this.

630
00:26:50,455 --> 00:26:55,460
When we get to the keys.

631
00:26:54,459 --> 00:27:02,461
Daniel: You can go for the first

632
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:02,461
abstract.

633
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,462
I'll do a second.

634
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:04,463
Dean: You got it.

635
00:27:03,462 --> 00:27:04,463
Okay.

636
00:27:04,463 --> 00:27:24,483
A scientific paradigmatic account

637
00:27:24,483 --> 00:27:24,483
suffices to interpret behavior evolution

638
00:27:24,483 --> 00:27:24,483
in early homocognitive surprises favoring

639
00:27:24,483 --> 00:27:24,483
anomalous behavioral propensities to

640
00:27:24,483 --> 00:27:24,483
sporadic expression can explain stakes

641
00:27:24,483 --> 00:27:24,483
and ladders appearances and

642
00:27:24,483 --> 00:27:24,483
disappearances of paleolithic skills in

643
00:27:24,483 --> 00:27:24,483
the early and middle class scene record.

644
00:27:04,463 --> 00:27:35,494
The account applies to the principle of

645
00:27:35,494 --> 00:27:35,494
stationary action which underpins the

646
00:27:35,494 --> 00:27:35,494
free energy principle to self organizing

647
00:27:35,494 --> 00:27:35,494
systems at an evolutionary timescale.

648
00:27:24,483 --> 00:27:55,514
Unusual personal attainments, often

649
00:27:55,514 --> 00:27:55,514
explained by invoking progressive ascent

650
00:27:55,514 --> 00:27:55,514
of evolutionary phylogenetic ladders of

651
00:27:55,514 --> 00:27:55,514
cognitive and technical abilities could

652
00:27:55,514 --> 00:27:55,514
be disregarded in a hominid community

653
00:27:55,514 --> 00:27:55,514
that failed to imagine or articulate

654
00:27:55,514 --> 00:27:55,514
possible advantages for its

655
00:27:55,514 --> 00:27:55,514
survivability.

656
00:27:35,494 --> 00:28:11,524
Such failure, as well as diverse

657
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:11,524
fortuitous demographic accidents could

658
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:11,524
erase from collective memory the

659
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:11,524
recollection of exceptional individual

660
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:11,524
conduct which disappeared down a snake,

661
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:11,524
so to speak, of the human evolutionary

662
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:11,524
puzzle.

663
00:27:55,514 --> 00:28:15,528
The puzzle discomforts

664
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:15,528
paleoanthropologists.

665
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:17,530
The gloves are on.

666
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:36,549
Some explain it away with the self

667
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:36,549
justifying assertion that separate paleo

668
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:36,549
species of Homo differentially possessed

669
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:36,549
cognitive abilities that allegedly

670
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:36,549
underlay the differential presence or

671
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:36,549
absence in the Pleistocene archaeological

672
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:36,549
record of traces of particular behavioral

673
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:36,549
outcomes or skills.

674
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:54,567
An alternative methodological perspective

675
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:54,567
grounded in the fundamental relationships

676
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:54,567
between organisms and their environments

677
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:54,567
affords parsimonious prosaic deflationary

678
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:54,567
account for appearances and

679
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:54,567
disappearances of behavior, outcomes, and

680
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:54,567
skills.

681
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:57,570
Thus the title snakes and Ladders great.

682
00:28:54,567 --> 00:29:01,568
Daniel: And the Abstract of Copy or not

683
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:01,568
to Copy.

684
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:16,582
A prerequisite for copying innovative

685
00:29:16,582 --> 00:29:16,582
behavior is the capacity of observers

686
00:29:16,582 --> 00:29:16,582
brains, regarded as hierarchically

687
00:29:16,582 --> 00:29:16,582
mechanistic minds, to overcome cognitive

688
00:29:16,582 --> 00:29:16,582
surprisal by maximizing the evidence for

689
00:29:16,582 --> 00:29:16,582
their internal models via active

690
00:29:16,582 --> 00:29:16,582
inference.

691
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:41,608
Unlike modern humans, chimpanzees and

692
00:29:41,608 --> 00:29:41,608
other great apes show considerable

693
00:29:41,608 --> 00:29:41,608
limitations in their ability or zone of

694
00:29:41,608 --> 00:29:41,608
bounded surprisal to overcome cognitive

695
00:29:41,608 --> 00:29:41,608
surprisal induced by innovative or

696
00:29:41,608 --> 00:29:41,608
unorthodox behavior, which rarely is

697
00:29:41,608 --> 00:29:41,608
copied precisely or accurately, most can

698
00:29:41,608 --> 00:29:41,608
copy adequately what is within their

699
00:29:41,608 --> 00:29:41,608
phenotypically habitual behavioral

700
00:29:41,608 --> 00:29:41,608
repertoire in which technology plays a

701
00:29:41,608 --> 00:29:41,608
scant part.

702
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:53,620
Widespread intra and intergenerational

703
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:53,620
social transmission of complex

704
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:53,620
technological innovations is not a

705
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:53,620
hallmark of great ape taxa over 3 million

706
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:53,620
years ago.

707
00:29:42,609 --> 00:30:01,622
Precursors of the genus Homo made stone

708
00:30:01,622 --> 00:30:01,622
artifacts and stone flaking was likely

709
00:30:01,622 --> 00:30:01,622
habitual before 2 million years ago.

710
00:29:53,620 --> 00:30:15,636
After this time, early Homo erectus left

711
00:30:15,636 --> 00:30:15,636
traces of technological innovations,

712
00:30:15,636 --> 00:30:15,636
though faithful copying of these and

713
00:30:15,636 --> 00:30:15,636
their intra and intergenerational social

714
00:30:15,636 --> 00:30:15,636
transmission were rare before a million

715
00:30:15,636 --> 00:30:15,636
years ago.

716
00:30:01,622 --> 00:30:27,648
This likely ode to a cerebral

717
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:27,648
infrastructure of interconnected neuronal

718
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:27,648
networks that bounds the expressivity of

719
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:27,648
internal world models entailed by their

720
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:27,648
functional architecture.

721
00:30:16,637 --> 00:30:41,662
Brains were smaller in size than ours,

722
00:30:41,662 --> 00:30:41,662
and cerebral neuronal networks ceased to

723
00:30:41,662 --> 00:30:41,662
develop when early Homo erectus attained

724
00:30:41,662 --> 00:30:41,662
full adult maturity by the mid teen

725
00:30:41,662 --> 00:30:41,662
years, whereas their development

726
00:30:41,662 --> 00:30:41,662
continues until our mid 20s.

727
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:47,668
Nowadays, Pleistocene Homo underwent

728
00:30:47,668 --> 00:30:47,668
remarkable evolutionary adaptation of

729
00:30:47,668 --> 00:30:47,668
neurobiological propensities.

730
00:30:41,662 --> 00:30:49,670
Cerebral aspects are discussed.

731
00:30:47,668 --> 00:30:58,679
That it is proposed here were fundamental

732
00:30:58,679 --> 00:30:58,679
for faithful copying, which underpins

733
00:30:58,679 --> 00:30:58,679
social transmission of technologies,

734
00:30:58,679 --> 00:30:58,679
cumulative learning and culture.

735
00:30:49,670 --> 00:31:00,675
Great.

736
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,679
One of the most amazing.

737
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:06,681
Roadmap became road.

738
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:11,686
Rail became train station clearinghouse

739
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:11,686
slides.

740
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:12,687
So what is happening?

741
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:27,702
Dean: I think the great gift that the

742
00:31:27,702 --> 00:31:27,702
authors have provided Daniel and I here

743
00:31:27,702 --> 00:31:27,702
is the opportunity, because this work is

744
00:31:27,702 --> 00:31:27,702
talking about sequential time.

745
00:31:17,692 --> 00:31:31,706
And when on that timeline did things

746
00:31:31,706 --> 00:31:31,706
happen?

747
00:31:27,702 --> 00:31:37,712
Which came first or why did something

748
00:31:37,712 --> 00:31:37,712
that we thought came after?

749
00:31:32,706 --> 00:31:42,717
Suddenly we find new evidence that maybe

750
00:31:42,717 --> 00:31:42,717
it didn't come after.

751
00:31:37,712 --> 00:31:44,719
Maybe it was co occurring.

752
00:31:42,717 --> 00:32:02,731
And so what I wanted to do in this

753
00:32:02,731 --> 00:32:02,731
particular slide was talk about things

754
00:32:02,731 --> 00:32:02,731
like timelines and timetables around the

755
00:32:02,731 --> 00:32:02,731
idea of a learning destination,

756
00:32:02,731 --> 00:32:02,731
assumptions that learning does have some

757
00:32:02,731 --> 00:32:02,731
sense of convergence.

758
00:31:44,719 --> 00:32:12,741
So my question was, well, what if all

759
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:12,741
roads, be they rail or paved, lead to an

760
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:12,741
active Rome or Romeference?

761
00:32:02,731 --> 00:32:14,743
Like, what is this journey that we're

762
00:32:14,743 --> 00:32:14,743
on?

763
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:16,745
What is this interstate that we exist

764
00:32:16,745 --> 00:32:16,745
within?

765
00:32:14,743 --> 00:32:31,760
And why do we always assume that what

766
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:31,760
we're looking at is the ties between the

767
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:31,760
rails, instead of making sure that when

768
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:31,760
we're talking about a tipping point,

769
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:31,760
we're talking about the fact that the

770
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:31,760
entire underlying structure can hold up?

771
00:32:17,745 --> 00:32:39,768
The vehicle that Daniel and I are

772
00:32:39,768 --> 00:32:39,768
basically sitting on right now and moving

773
00:32:39,768 --> 00:32:39,768
forward with back and forth?

774
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:42,771
So the timelines and timetables to

775
00:32:42,771 --> 00:32:42,771
learning destinations are not uptakes.

776
00:32:39,768 --> 00:32:46,775
Someone else's formatting is not your

777
00:32:46,775 --> 00:32:46,775
outing of a figure.

778
00:32:42,771 --> 00:32:55,784
Okay, so I've never been on an official

779
00:32:55,784 --> 00:32:55,784
dig site, but I have come across dinosaur

780
00:32:55,784 --> 00:32:55,784
bones being in Alberta.

781
00:32:46,775 --> 00:33:01,784
And so you stumble across these things

782
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:01,784
and whoa, what's that right.

783
00:32:55,784 --> 00:33:10,793
In an otherwise field of clay, how much

784
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:10,793
can we schedule and how much is dependent

785
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:10,793
on the sophistication of our hierarchical

786
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:10,793
model?

787
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:20,803
And again, I've practiced this tutrenes,

788
00:33:20,803 --> 00:33:20,803
Allendo and Las plateaformas unuenue with

789
00:33:20,803 --> 00:33:20,803
apologies to Hector.

790
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:22,805
Where are we departing?

791
00:33:20,803 --> 00:33:27,810
All we know is that platforms one and

792
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:27,810
nine let's go.

793
00:33:22,805 --> 00:33:29,812
Vamos.

794
00:33:28,811 --> 00:33:31,814
Daniel: All aboard.

795
00:33:29,812 --> 00:33:33,816
But great visualization.

796
00:33:31,814 --> 00:33:35,818
The papers do have sections.

797
00:33:33,816 --> 00:33:53,836
However, without figures or formalisms,

798
00:33:53,836 --> 00:33:53,836
we were able to and drawing on the unique

799
00:33:53,836 --> 00:33:53,836
subject matter and contributions, able to

800
00:33:53,836 --> 00:33:53,836
also even reconsider the linearity and

801
00:33:53,836 --> 00:33:53,836
the structure of the stream.

802
00:33:35,818 --> 00:34:00,837
The keywords are displayed on the slide

803
00:34:00,837 --> 00:34:00,837
just to quickly read through them.

804

bounded surprisal.

820
00:34:19,856 --> 00:34:37,874
What can you add about the published

821
00:34:37,874 --> 00:34:37,874
priors?

822
00:34:35,872 --> 00:34:59,896
Dean: Well, I just think it's interesting

823
00:34:59,896 --> 00:34:59,896
because we've always used this image of

824
00:34:59,896 --> 00:34:59,896
the sort of the infinite and antherence

825
00:34:59,896 --> 00:34:59,896
ref which I've always really liked

826
00:34:59,896 --> 00:34:59,896
because I just momentarily lost the

827
00:34:59,896 --> 00:34:59,896
strange loop piece.

828
00:34:39,876 --> 00:35:00,891
What is that mobius?

829
00:34:59,896 --> 00:35:02,893
Is it a mobius?

830
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:09,900
Daniel: Right, a mobius stripped, also

831
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:09,900
developed by here Mcscher and Doug

832
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:09,900
Hofstadter into the strange loop

833
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:09,900
concept.

834
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:10,901
Dean: Right.

835
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:16,907
So all I wanted to do is add the fact

836
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:16,907
that maybe there is these branch lines.

837
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:32,923
And when we're talking about published

838
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:32,923
priors, I know that in the chronological

839
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:32,923
time they came first, but if we were now

840
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:32,923
to go to them post having read these

841
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:32,923
papers, what would that reveal?

842
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:33,924
Right?

843
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:35,926
Like is a branch less important than the

844
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:35,926
trunk?

845
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:37,928
I guess, I don't know.

846
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:43,934
Without a trunk there are no branches,

847
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:43,934
but without branches there's no

848
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:43,934
totality.

849
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:46,937
So that's what I was kind of laying out

850
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:46,937
there.

851
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:52,943
Daniel: Also, with respect to the

852
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:52,943
literature, it's a canonical example of

853
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:52,943
cumulative culture.

854
00:35:47,938 --> 00:36:06,951
It's all at once and the timing of which

855
00:36:06,951 --> 00:36:06,951
through Kronos publications were added in

856
00:36:06,951 --> 00:36:06,951
is by no means the Kronos or the Cairos

857
00:36:06,951 --> 00:36:06,951
of the learner or the researcher.

858
00:35:52,943 --> 00:36:15,960
So going from just the past and the

859
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:15,960
present, two min two of the literature to

860
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:15,960
the past, present and future.

861
00:36:07,952 --> 00:36:28,973
Three with literature expands into the

862
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:28,973
key points with another disclaimer for

863
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:28,973
your health.

864
00:36:16,961 --> 00:36:32,977
Dean: There are no cole's notes version

865
00:36:32,977 --> 00:36:32,977
that will both make sense and do

866
00:36:32,977 --> 00:36:32,977
justice.

867
00:36:29,974 --> 00:36:36,981
The analysis research arguments is laid

868
00:36:36,981 --> 00:36:36,981
out in these papers.

869
00:36:32,977 --> 00:36:40,985
We begin with keys and then start a

870
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:40,985
process of unlocking.

871
00:36:36,981 --> 00:36:43,988
All right, so how do you want to do this,

872
00:36:43,988 --> 00:36:43,988
Daniel?

873
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:48,993
Do you want to split each one of the

874
00:36:48,993 --> 00:36:48,993
slides or do you want to just swap

875
00:36:48,993 --> 00:36:48,993
slides?

876
00:36:43,988 --> 00:36:48,993
I'll do one.

877
00:36:48,993 --> 00:36:49,994
You do one?

878
00:36:48,993 --> 00:36:49,994
Daniel: Yes.

879
00:36:49,994 --> 00:36:51,995
You go for this slide?

880
00:36:50,994 --> 00:36:52,997
You go for even slides?

881
00:36:51,996 --> 00:36:53,998
I'll do odd slides.

882
00:36:52,997 --> 00:36:54,999
Dean: Okay.

883
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:57,002
All right, so this is all the keys.

884
00:36:55,999 --> 00:37:00,999
There are 17 of them from the Snakes and

885
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:00,999
ladder paper.

886
00:36:57,002 --> 00:37:05,004
Again, I really strongly recommend you

887
00:37:05,004 --> 00:37:05,004
have a read of this.

888
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:12,011
It's a fantastic paper, but if you want

889
00:37:12,011 --> 00:37:12,011
the one and a half times speed version of

890
00:37:12,011 --> 00:37:12,011
hearing it, this is what it sounds like.

891
00:37:05,004 --> 00:37:23,022
Evidence of early and middle clustened

892
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:23,022
behavior is distributed in

893
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:23,022
disconcertingly uneven ways between

894
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:23,022
2,200,000 years ago.

895
00:37:13,012 --> 00:37:45,044
Our proposal is that some, at least of

896
00:37:45,044 --> 00:37:45,044
the irregular, regularities and regular

897
00:37:45,044 --> 00:37:45,044
irregularities of phenomenal attributable

898
00:37:45,044 --> 00:37:45,044
to homo in the Pleistocene record reflect

899
00:37:45,044 --> 00:37:45,044
the kinds of plausibly anomalous behavior

900
00:37:45,044 --> 00:37:45,044
outcomes that doubtless occurred often in

901
00:37:45,044 --> 00:37:45,044
a sacred ladders model of evolution in

902
00:37:45,044 --> 00:37:45,044
early members of our genus.

903
00:37:23,022 --> 00:38:00,053
Regardless of their skeletal

904
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:00,053
Paleospecific taxonomy, increasingly

905
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:00,053
complex extractive and concomitant or

906
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:00,053
consequent procedures appear in several

907
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:00,053
parts of the world at various times

908
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:00,053
towards the end of the Lake Pleistocene.

909
00:37:45,044 --> 00:38:08,061
Some seem to have arisen separately and

910
00:38:08,061 --> 00:38:08,061
independently in a snakes and ladders

911
00:38:08,061 --> 00:38:08,061
fashion and with different outcomes at

912
00:38:08,061 --> 00:38:08,061
different places and times.

913
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:15,068
Self evidencing underwrites much of the

914
00:38:15,068 --> 00:38:15,068
following arguments, however, there is an

915
00:38:15,068 --> 00:38:15,068
important nuance.

916
00:38:09,062 --> 00:38:22,075
Certain creatures may have evolved deep

917
00:38:22,075 --> 00:38:22,075
generative models with the ability to

918
00:38:22,075 --> 00:38:22,075
predict the consequences of their

919
00:38:22,075 --> 00:38:22,075
actions.

920
00:38:15,068 --> 00:38:29,082
This kind of creature now has the

921
00:38:29,082 --> 00:38:29,082
capacity to entertain counterfactual

922
00:38:29,082 --> 00:38:29,082
futures under different actions.

923
00:38:22,075 --> 00:38:33,086
This is a key aspect of active inference

924
00:38:33,086 --> 00:38:33,086
under the fep.

925
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:41,094
Namely, actions and plans are selected on

926
00:38:41,094 --> 00:38:41,094
the basis of minimizing expected free

927
00:38:41,094 --> 00:38:41,094
energy under that plan.

928
00:38:33,086 --> 00:38:53,106
In terms of Bayesian mechanics, evolution

929
00:38:53,106 --> 00:38:53,106
and natural selection can be regarded as

930
00:38:53,106 --> 00:38:53,106
natural Bayesian model selection, which

931
00:38:53,106 --> 00:38:53,106
is also known as structured learning in

932
00:38:53,106 --> 00:38:53,106
the cognitive sciences.

933
00:38:41,094 --> 00:38:57,110
Evolution thus develops imperceptibly and

934
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:57,110
intermittently.

935
00:38:53,106 --> 00:39:19,126
And the fep concept is biologically and

936
00:39:19,126 --> 00:39:19,126
especially neurobiologically relevant

937
00:39:19,126 --> 00:39:19,126
both at ontogenetic levels of cellular

938
00:39:19,126 --> 00:39:19,126
dynamics, neural circuitry and behavior,

939
00:39:19,126 --> 00:39:19,126
and at phylogenetic levels of populations

940
00:39:19,126 --> 00:39:19,126
evolved through natural selection of

941
00:39:19,126 --> 00:39:19,126
biological adaptations and adaptability.

942
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:22,129
Just before we move on because there's a

943
00:39:22,129 --> 00:39:22,129
bunch of other keys here.

944
00:39:19,126 --> 00:39:37,144
I hope it makes sense that not only are

945
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:37,144
we setting the bars up or the plates up

946
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:37,144
on either end of the bar, if we're

947
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:37,144
talking about a tipping point, we as the

948
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:37,144
agent who are going to now bring that bar

949
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:37,144
down to our chest and then reextend

950
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:37,144
ourselves.

951
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:41,148
We don't want the tipping point to be the

952
00:39:41,148 --> 00:39:41,148
bar comes down and then squishes us.

953
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:50,157
So us setting this up, there's not a

954
00:39:50,157 --> 00:39:50,157
tipping point as a threshold is met and

955
00:39:50,157 --> 00:39:50,157
over the whole thing goes.

956
00:39:41,148 --> 00:39:52,159
The tipping point is here.

957
00:39:50,157 --> 00:39:54,161
Is there some agent.

958
00:39:53,160 --> 00:40:01,161
That's actually capable of we're talking

959
00:40:01,161 --> 00:40:01,161
directly about that.

960
00:39:54,161 --> 00:40:20,181
Daniel: Continuing with snakes and

961
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:20,181
ladders doubtless tried and trusted

962
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:20,181
routines predominated, and whoever

963
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:20,181
performed them with daily efficiency was

964
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:20,181
trusted by the group, whereas eccentric

965
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:20,181
or idiosyncratic conduct was treated with

966
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:20,181
indifference and not retained in

967
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:20,181
collective memory or lore.

968
00:40:03,164 --> 00:40:30,191
prepotent routine behavior plausibly

969
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:30,191
resulted in failure to become aware of

970
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:30,191
potentially idiosyncratic, inactive

971
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:30,191
outcomes.

972
00:40:21,182 --> 00:40:47,208
There is a difference between a

973
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:47,208
spatiotemporal snakes and ladders picture

974
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:47,208
of disappearances of tiny huntergatherer

975
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:47,208
bands and appearances of others, and the

976
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:47,208
snakes and ladders model of individual

977
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:47,208
idiosyncratic or unorthodox activity.

978
00:40:31,191 --> 00:41:15,230
Heterogeneous composition renders the

979
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:15,230
former picture inappropriate for making

980
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:15,230
predictions, whereas the latter model

981
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:15,230
individual idiosyncratic or unorthodox

982
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:15,230
activity by focusing on the information,

983
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:15,230
theoretic, and energetic constraints on

984
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:15,230
biological neurobiological and

985
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:15,230
psychosocial evolution allows for the

986
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:15,230
consideration of whether, by doing so, it

987
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:15,230
may offer a reasonable interpretation of

988
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:15,230
the material record.

989
00:40:48,209 --> 00:41:26,241
In particular, the uneven distribution of

990
00:41:26,241 --> 00:41:26,241
stone hand axes and evidence of

991
00:41:26,241 --> 00:41:26,241
paleolithic combustion between 2,200,000

992
00:41:26,241 --> 00:41:26,241
years ago.

993
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:51,266
The marginal relevance of stone about 3

994
00:41:51,266 --> 00:41:51,266
million years ago for the existential

995
00:41:51,266 --> 00:41:51,266
biological imperative of maintaining

996
00:41:51,266 --> 00:41:51,266
homeostatic integrity and consequent

997
00:41:51,266 --> 00:41:51,266
reproductive success and survival of

998
00:41:51,266 --> 00:41:51,266
inarticulate Hominina plausibly led

999
00:41:51,266 --> 00:41:51,266
stones to be regarded as

1000
00:41:51,266 --> 00:41:51,266
quintessentially, predictable, and

1001
00:41:51,266 --> 00:41:51,266
unsurprising, and crucially, lacking

1002
00:41:51,266 --> 00:41:51,266
epistemic affordances implicit in tool

1003
00:41:51,266 --> 00:41:51,266
use.

1004
00:41:26,241 --> 00:41:56,271
Nevertheless, an individual could

1005
00:41:56,271 --> 00:41:56,271
entertain more expressive I.

1006
00:41:52,266 --> 00:41:56,271
E.

1007
00:41:56,271 --> 00:42:03,272
Deeper generative models and respond to

1008
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:03,272
exploratory epistemic and exploitative

1009
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:03,272
pragmatic value.

1010
00:41:56,271 --> 00:42:14,283
She might discover novel ways of

1011
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:14,283
attaining predictable or unsurprising

1012
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:14,283
outcomes through her behavior, and its

1013
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:14,283
outcome may well have been disregarded by

1014
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:14,283
her companions.

1015
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:24,293
All the same, such idiosyncratic behavior

1016
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:24,293
may trump prevailing expectations that

1017
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:24,293
normally are unsurprising and therefore

1018
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:24,293
favor minimization of variational.

1019
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:47,316
Free energy in line with the free energy

1020
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:47,316
principle, it is unclear by what

1021
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:47,316
mechanism transmission of any conjectural

1022
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:47,316
package could have been sustained over

1023
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:47,316
the spatiotemporal dimensions involved,

1024
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:47,316
and so, with respect to some kinds of

1025
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:47,316
tool usage, it is imprudent to infer that

1026
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:47,316
they reflect an unbroken tradition of

1027
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:47,316
manual behavior handed down from

1028
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:47,316
generation to generation.

1029
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:59,328
If a generation lasts 25 years on

1030
00:42:59,328 --> 00:42:59,328
average, then 200,000 years imply 8000

1031
00:42:59,328 --> 00:42:59,328
generations, which presents a major

1032
00:42:59,328 --> 00:42:59,328
challenge for the culture history

1033
00:42:59,328 --> 00:42:59,328
approach to interpretation.

1034
00:42:48,317 --> 00:43:15,338
Dean: In late middle Pleistocene, Bflcts

1035
00:43:15,338 --> 00:43:15,338
were made by precursors of Hsapns in

1036
00:43:15,338 --> 00:43:15,338
Africa and neanderthals in Europe,

1037
00:43:15,338 --> 00:43:15,338
probably both used in the similar ways.

1038
00:43:03,326 --> 00:43:23,345
Nevertheless, the uneven spatial temporal

1039
00:43:23,345 --> 00:43:23,345
distribution of Bflcts is undeniable.

1040
00:43:15,338 --> 00:43:34,357
Cognitive and manual designs and

1041
00:43:34,357 --> 00:43:34,357
strategies for responses in common to

1042
00:43:34,357 --> 00:43:34,357
underlying neurobiological propensities

1043
00:43:34,357 --> 00:43:34,357
shared by the early middle Pleistocene.

1044
00:43:23,346 --> 00:43:38,361
Nappers and nappers are people that

1045
00:43:38,361 --> 00:43:38,361
actually form and shape these tools.

1046
00:43:34,357 --> 00:43:41,364
Sporadic local enactment by H.

1047
00:43:39,362 --> 00:43:42,365
Heidelberg.

1048
00:43:41,364 --> 00:44:01,378
Heidelbergnis could well have been

1049
00:44:01,378 --> 00:44:01,378
responsible for puzzling exceptional

1050
00:44:01,378 --> 00:44:01,378
finds of what at first sight looked like

1051
00:44:01,378 --> 00:44:01,378
impossibly early instances of

1052
00:44:01,378 --> 00:44:01,378
stoneworking techniques that flowered

1053
00:44:01,378 --> 00:44:01,378
only much later on, showing that hand

1054
00:44:01,378 --> 00:44:01,378
axes could be napped with care and

1055
00:44:01,378 --> 00:44:01,378
attention.

1056
00:43:44,367 --> 00:44:28,405
In Europe before the middle of the middle

1057
00:44:28,405 --> 00:44:28,405
Pleistocene, thereby disproving a

1058
00:44:28,405 --> 00:44:28,405
commonly held viewed to the contrary the

1059
00:44:28,405 --> 00:44:28,405
alternative ways of modifying stones that

1060
00:44:28,405 --> 00:44:28,405
appeared after two maimly on the one hand

1061
00:44:28,405 --> 00:44:28,405
to make lcts that's one sided and in

1062
00:44:28,405 --> 00:44:28,405
particular BF Lcts, and on the other, to

1063
00:44:28,405 --> 00:44:28,405
remove usable flakes from cores that also

1064
00:44:28,405 --> 00:44:28,405
may have undergone some modifications,

1065
00:44:28,405 --> 00:44:28,405
sometimes sort of facilitate the

1066
00:44:28,405 --> 00:44:28,405
removal.

1067
00:44:01,378 --> 00:44:29,406
Implies that H.

1068
00:44:28,405 --> 00:44:42,419
Erectus could carry out two different

1069
00:44:42,419 --> 00:44:42,419
irreversible chains of the manipulative

1070
00:44:42,419 --> 00:44:42,419
reduction of stone, implying a capacity

1071
00:44:42,419 --> 00:44:42,419
for haptic and short term working

1072
00:44:42,419 --> 00:44:42,419
memory.

1073
00:44:29,406 --> 00:44:52,429
Long term memory and prospective memory

1074
00:44:52,429 --> 00:44:52,429
respect beyond that of earlier homina or

1075
00:44:52,429 --> 00:44:52,429
extant pannons artifact diversity.

1076
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:54,431
Implies that at times, H.

1077
00:44:52,429 --> 00:45:11,442
Erectus could recognize not only the

1078
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:11,442
irreversibility of their respective

1079
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:11,442
change of sequential manual reduction of

1080
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:11,442
stone, but also their correspondence to

1081
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:11,442
distinct morphological sets, which at

1082
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:11,442
least is comparable to second order

1083
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:11,442
cognition.

1084
00:44:54,431 --> 00:45:16,447
That's understood implicitly by preverbal

1085
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:16,447
toddlers nowadays.

1086
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:28,459
Well studied regional differences in the

1087
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:28,459
development of gray matter, which may be

1088
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:28,459
prolonged in temporal cortex, perhaps

1089
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:28,459
related to its role in integrating

1090
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:28,459
memory, object recognition and

1091
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:28,459
audiovisual inputs.

1092
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:47,478
From the perspective of the free energy

1093
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:47,478
principle, these differences testify to

1094
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:47,478
structural priors that inherit from

1095
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:47,478
epigenetics and contextualize experience

1096
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:47,478
dependent learning and planning as

1097
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:47,478
inference at a somatic time scale.

1098
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:50,481
Daniel: Great.

1099
00:45:50,481 --> 00:46:02,487
And continuing with Snakes and Ladders

1100
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:02,487
also just to get it set as well, the BF

1101
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:02,487
Lct is bifacially flaked large cutting

1102
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:02,487
tools.

1103
00:45:51,482 --> 00:46:03,488
It's a type of tool.

1104
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:23,508
The circumstantial evidence seems to

1105
00:46:23,508 --> 00:46:23,508
imply the adaptive evolution of human

1106
00:46:23,508 --> 00:46:23,508
neurobiological propensities that support

1107
00:46:23,508 --> 00:46:23,508
prospective memory and tool making

1108
00:46:23,508 --> 00:46:23,508
together with short term working memory,

1109
00:46:23,508 --> 00:46:23,508
including haptic working memory, long

1110
00:46:23,508 --> 00:46:23,508
term working memory, and long term

1111
00:46:23,508 --> 00:46:23,508
procedural memory and episodic memory of

1112
00:46:23,508 --> 00:46:23,508
past matters and things.

1113
00:46:03,488 --> 00:46:36,521
These propensities were and are

1114
00:46:36,521 --> 00:46:36,521
phylogenetic outcomes of existential

1115
00:46:36,521 --> 00:46:36,521
ontogenetic programs adapted through

1116
00:46:36,521 --> 00:46:36,521
natural selection for satisfying the

1117
00:46:36,521 --> 00:46:36,521
bioenergetic requirements of organisms.

1118
00:46:24,509 --> 00:46:45,530
However, teaching and learning stone

1119
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:45,530
napping skills are very different from a

1120
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:45,530
communicatively challenged H.

1121
00:46:36,521 --> 00:46:58,543
Erectus individual spontaneous enactment

1122
00:46:58,543 --> 00:46:58,543
resulting in a disregarded Bflct outcome

1123
00:46:58,543 --> 00:46:58,543
of iterative inactive haptic lithic

1124
00:46:58,543 --> 00:46:58,543
manipulations.

1125
00:46:45,530 --> 00:47:07,546
Regardless of any neurobiologically

1126
00:47:07,546 --> 00:47:07,546
evolved cognitive neuronal propensity for

1127
00:47:07,546 --> 00:47:07,546
such enactments, it's a huge claim.

1128
00:46:58,543 --> 00:47:21,560
Getting and fashioning stone for

1129
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:21,560
subsequent use suggests awareness of

1130
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:21,560
potential, albeit delayed, advantages for

1131
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:21,560
lessening the efforts needed to acquire

1132
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:21,560
bioenergetic resources.

1133
00:47:08,547 --> 00:47:36,575
Such behavior draws on short term and

1134
00:47:36,575 --> 00:47:36,575
long term working memory, episodic and

1135
00:47:36,575 --> 00:47:36,575
procedural memory, and prospective

1136
00:47:36,575 --> 00:47:36,575
memory, or forethought to a degree well

1137
00:47:36,575 --> 00:47:36,575
beyond the capacity of living anthropoid

1138
00:47:36,575 --> 00:47:36,575
apes.

1139
00:47:22,561 --> 00:47:43,582
Those are all the keys for Snakes and

1140
00:47:43,582 --> 00:47:43,582
Ladders.

1141
00:47:40,579 --> 00:48:03,596
There's a strong, relentless, even focus

1142
00:48:03,596 --> 00:48:03,596
on the moment of tool production, the

1143
00:48:03,596 --> 00:48:03,596
cognitive and extended cognitive

1144
00:48:03,596 --> 00:48:03,596
phenomena associated with the performance

1145
00:48:03,596 --> 00:48:03,596
of that act.

1146
00:47:43,582 --> 00:48:19,612
Specifically with regard to hominids and

1147
00:48:19,612 --> 00:48:19,612
with a focus on the Bflct bifacially

1148
00:48:19,612 --> 00:48:19,612
flaked large cutting tool of which the

1149
00:48:19,612 --> 00:48:19,612
authors have extensive field expertise

1150
00:48:19,612 --> 00:48:19,612
seeing in sichu.

1151
00:48:04,597 --> 00:48:42,635
So Snakes and Ladders uses this fun board

1152
00:48:42,635 --> 00:48:42,635
game metaphor or reference to explain the

1153
00:48:42,635 --> 00:48:42,635
sudden appearance and disappearance not

1154
00:48:42,635 --> 00:48:42,635
by appeal to a cultural continuity

1155
00:48:42,635 --> 00:48:42,635
mechanism tradition, but rather the

1156
00:48:42,635 --> 00:48:42,635
instantaneous, a gentle zone of bounded

1157
00:48:42,635 --> 00:48:42,635
surprise and action.

1158
00:48:19,612 --> 00:49:07,654
Dean: Now, just before we get into copy

1159
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:07,654
or not to copy, what I think is what

1160
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:07,654
we're trying to do here is hold up the

1161
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:07,654
fact that we believe that these although

1162
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:07,654
each each paper has been discretized to a

1163
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:07,654
particular topic.

1164
00:48:47,640 --> 00:49:25,672
The continuity between the papers is what

1165
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:25,672
we'd really like to emphasize here

1166
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:25,672
because there are such strong strands

1167
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:25,672
where basically the shores are within

1168
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:25,672
such easy sight of one another that it's

1169
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:25,672
very nice to be able to kind of float

1170
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:25,672
back and forth.

1171
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:38,685
We're going to now focus on the copy or

1172
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:38,685
not to copy piece of this, but to say

1173
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:38,685
that there isn't a way of being able to

1174
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:38,685
look at this as a continuity.

1175
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:41,688
I think we're trying to disrupt that

1176
00:49:41,688 --> 00:49:41,688
right now.

1177
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:51,698
So try to hold on as much of the snakes

1178
00:49:51,698 --> 00:49:51,698
and ladder key points as you can as we

1179
00:49:51,698 --> 00:49:51,698
morph into this second perspective.

1180
00:49:41,688 --> 00:49:54,700
It's perspective Swapping 101.

1181
00:49:51,698 --> 00:50:00,701
Doesn't mean we're losing the details of

1182
00:50:00,701 --> 00:50:00,701
either.

1183
00:49:54,701 --> 00:50:03,704
Want me to start?

1184
00:50:02,703 --> 00:50:04,705
Oh, yeah, I'm on.

1185
00:50:03,704 --> 00:50:05,706
Evens you told me I had to do that.

1186
00:50:04,705 --> 00:50:06,707
Okay.

1187
00:50:05,706 --> 00:50:16,717
Social learning theories about how

1188
00:50:16,717 --> 00:50:16,717
information spreads do not explain how a

1189
00:50:16,717 --> 00:50:16,717
seed of information is planted in each

1190
00:50:16,717 --> 00:50:16,717
individual brain.

1191
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:18,719
So we're back to the brain based stuff.

1192
00:50:16,717 --> 00:50:34,735
A useful lens is the free energy

1193
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:34,735
principle, which underpins a generative

1194
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:34,735
hierarchically mechanistic mind or hmm

1195
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:34,735
surprising or uncharacteristic sensory

1196
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:34,735
and physical states are precluded via a

1197
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:34,735
minimization of variation of free

1198
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:34,735
energy.

1199
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:48,749
Interactions involve predictive

1200
00:50:48,749 --> 00:50:48,749
processing and consequent perception

1201
00:50:48,749 --> 00:50:48,749
action responses, active inference, yay

1202
00:50:48,749 --> 00:50:48,749
actively seeking predictive sensory

1203
00:50:48,749 --> 00:50:48,749
exchanges with the world that minimize

1204
00:50:48,749 --> 00:50:48,749
surprise or variation of free energy.

1205
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:54,755
Fundamental involvement of learning minds

1206
00:50:54,755 --> 00:50:54,755
is precisely the minds I e.

1207
00:50:49,750 --> 00:51:09,764
The brains that are concerned in a

1208
00:51:09,764 --> 00:51:09,764
mechanistic approach, seeking to

1209
00:51:09,764 --> 00:51:09,764
ascertain the minimum requirements back

1210
00:51:09,764 --> 00:51:09,764
to that threshold thing for an innovation

1211
00:51:09,764 --> 00:51:09,764
to nest, as it were, in one individual's

1212
00:51:09,764 --> 00:51:09,764
brain before it can do so in another's.

1213
00:50:54,755 --> 00:51:29,784
Innovation and innovator are treated

1214
00:51:29,784 --> 00:51:29,784
throughout in the context of habitual,

1215
00:51:29,784 --> 00:51:29,784
phenotypical behavior of a species from

1216
00:51:29,784 --> 00:51:29,784
the perspective of a conspecific observer

1217
00:51:29,784 --> 00:51:29,784
who witnesses novel or unorthodox

1218
00:51:29,784 --> 00:51:29,784
behavior or its outcome, usually through,

1219
00:51:29,784 --> 00:51:29,784
but not necessarily those that owe.

1220
00:51:09,764 --> 00:51:41,796
To activity performed by a cons specific,

1221
00:51:41,796 --> 00:51:41,796
but which, at the time of the

1222
00:51:41,796 --> 00:51:41,796
observation, have not been adopted by

1223
00:51:41,796 --> 00:51:41,796
other conspecifics in the group and

1224
00:51:41,796 --> 00:51:41,796
therefore have not undergone social

1225
00:51:41,796 --> 00:51:41,796
transmission.

1226
00:51:29,784 --> 00:52:04,813
In many respects, the words are

1227
00:52:04,813 --> 00:52:04,813
synonymous with invention and inventor,

1228
00:52:04,813 --> 00:52:04,813
though these often connote post hoc

1229
00:52:04,813 --> 00:52:04,813
recognition, the imperative to maximize

1230
00:52:04,813 --> 00:52:04,813
the expected information, curious

1231
00:52:04,813 --> 00:52:04,813
behavior responding to epistemic

1232
00:52:04,813 --> 00:52:04,813
affordance resolves uncertainty and

1233
00:52:04,813 --> 00:52:04,813
thereby reduces the long term average of

1234
00:52:04,813 --> 00:52:04,813
prediction errors in the future.

1235
00:51:41,796 --> 00:52:18,827
However, this kind of innovative behavior

1236
00:52:18,827 --> 00:52:18,827
is risky owing to its deviation from

1237
00:52:18,827 --> 00:52:18,827
those phenotypical responses that

1238
00:52:18,827 --> 00:52:18,827
selection is favored in a specific

1239
00:52:18,827 --> 00:52:18,827
ecological niche.

1240
00:52:04,813 --> 00:52:27,835
Innovation, when viewed from Charles

1241
00:52:27,835 --> 00:52:27,835
Darwin's vantage point of evolution by

1242
00:52:27,835 --> 00:52:27,835
natural selection, may be a far from

1243
00:52:27,835 --> 00:52:27,835
advantageous.

1244
00:52:18,827 --> 00:52:38,847
Trait deviations can have untoward

1245
00:52:38,847 --> 00:52:38,847
consequences that even may threaten an

1246
00:52:38,847 --> 00:52:38,847
innovator's very survival before

1247
00:52:38,847 --> 00:52:38,847
reproductive age can be reached.

1248
00:52:27,836 --> 00:52:40,849
Oh, the risk reward.

1249
00:52:39,847 --> 00:52:50,859
Daniel: Prehawk post hoc and that fine

1250
00:52:50,859 --> 00:52:50,859
line that bridges the two.

1251
00:52:44,853 --> 00:53:02,865
Continuing with copy or not to copy, they

1252
00:53:02,865 --> 00:53:02,865
write and also I will add Dean has

1253
00:53:02,865 --> 00:53:02,865
excellently visually differentiated in

1254
00:53:02,865 --> 00:53:02,865
these slides.

1255
00:52:52,861 --> 00:53:11,874
Innovative behavior can be regarded as a

1256
00:53:11,874 --> 00:53:11,874
latent variable a plausible policy whose

1257
00:53:11,874 --> 00:53:11,874
posterior probability must be inferred

1258
00:53:11,874 --> 00:53:11,874
from a set of observations.

1259
00:53:03,866 --> 00:53:19,882
The family of probability densities

1260
00:53:19,882 --> 00:53:19,882
entertained by an individual is

1261
00:53:19,882 --> 00:53:19,882
restricted to the system's prior Bayesian

1262
00:53:19,882 --> 00:53:19,882
beliefs.

1263
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:29,892
It can be the case that a conspecific's

1264
00:53:29,892 --> 00:53:29,892
innovative behavior will not fall neatly

1265
00:53:29,892 --> 00:53:29,892
into one of these prior conceptions of a

1266
00:53:29,892 --> 00:53:29,892
behavioral policy.

1267
00:53:21,884 --> 00:53:40,903
This means, by definition that innovative

1268
00:53:40,903 --> 00:53:40,903
behavior is both unlikely to be evinced

1269
00:53:40,903 --> 00:53:40,903
in any given phenotype and crucially

1270
00:53:40,903 --> 00:53:40,903
difficult to recognize when observed by

1271
00:53:40,903 --> 00:53:40,903
another.

1272
00:53:30,892 --> 00:53:45,908
Was true for modern art was true for the

1273
00:53:45,908 --> 00:53:45,908
large tools.

1274
00:53:41,904 --> 00:53:53,916
Small deviations by innovators may be

1275
00:53:53,916 --> 00:53:53,916
accommodated by observers who can take

1276
00:53:53,916 --> 00:53:53,916
discrepancies into account by making

1277
00:53:53,916 --> 00:53:53,916
minor adjustments.

1278
00:53:46,909 --> 00:54:06,923
An innovator's behavior, should it

1279
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:06,923
diverge markedly from the repertoire of

1280
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:06,923
plausible policies used by an observer to

1281
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:06,923
predict another's behavior may be beyond

1282
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:06,923
the capacity of the latter's generative

1283
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:06,923
model.

1284
00:53:54,917 --> 00:54:17,934
A prerequisite of registering and

1285
00:54:17,934 --> 00:54:17,934
encoding surprising sites may well be an

1286
00:54:17,934 --> 00:54:17,934
ability to modify the generative model in

1287
00:54:17,934 --> 00:54:17,934
order to accommodate sensory evidence

1288
00:54:17,934 --> 00:54:17,934
that fails to meet top down predictions.

1289
00:54:08,925 --> 00:54:24,941
Brains might balance top down

1290
00:54:24,941 --> 00:54:24,941
expectations against bottom up sensory

1291
00:54:24,941 --> 00:54:24,941
evidence.

1292
00:54:19,936 --> 00:54:35,952
The ability to do that dynamically and to

1293
00:54:35,952 --> 00:54:35,952
conduct complex computations suggestive

1294
00:54:35,952 --> 00:54:35,952
of high attentional executive control

1295
00:54:35,952 --> 00:54:35,952
implies sensitivity to both previous

1296
00:54:35,952 --> 00:54:35,952
experience and the current context.

1297
00:54:24,941 --> 00:54:58,975
Perhaps the overriding of top down

1298
00:54:58,975 --> 00:54:58,975
predictions implies that those complex

1299
00:54:58,975 --> 00:54:58,975
attentional and strategic components of

1300
00:54:58,975 --> 00:54:58,975
working memory that distinguish humans

1301
00:54:58,975 --> 00:54:58,975
from chimpanzees plausibly familiarity by

1302
00:54:58,975 --> 00:54:58,975
conspecific observers with the actions

1303
00:54:58,975 --> 00:54:58,975
demonstrated in an experiment kept their

1304
00:54:58,975 --> 00:54:58,975
surprise associated with the demonstrated

1305
00:54:58,975 --> 00:54:58,975
actions within a manageable range.

1306
00:54:35,952 --> 00:55:01,972
And this in turn prompted copying.

1307
00:54:59,975 --> 00:55:10,981
And it's easier for chimpanzees to

1308
00:55:10,981 --> 00:55:10,981
perform complex actions that are

1309
00:55:10,981 --> 00:55:10,981
unorthodox sorry, chimpanzees.

1310
00:55:01,972 --> 00:55:17,988
It's easier for chimpanzees to perform

1311
00:55:17,988 --> 00:55:17,988
complex actions that involve considerable

1312
00:55:17,988 --> 00:55:17,988
motor demands than it is for them to

1313
00:55:17,988 --> 00:55:17,988
reproduce actions that are unorthodox.

1314
00:55:10,981 --> 00:55:30,001
With regard to their habitual behavior

1315
00:55:30,001 --> 00:55:30,001
repertoire, brains must shoulder an

1316
00:55:30,001 --> 00:55:30,001
additional energetic cost whenever novel

1317
00:55:30,001 --> 00:55:30,001
associative behavior responses are

1318
00:55:30,001 --> 00:55:30,001
introduced that may override those

1319
00:55:30,001 --> 00:55:30,001
already present.

1320
00:55:17,988 --> 00:55:44,015
The acceptability of reproducing a novel

1321
00:55:44,015 --> 00:55:44,015
artifact may owe at least as much to the

1322
00:55:44,015 --> 00:55:44,015
ways in which broadly similar copies

1323
00:55:44,015 --> 00:55:44,015
might be used with predictably accurate

1324
00:55:44,015 --> 00:55:44,015
outcomes.

1325
00:55:32,003 --> 00:55:56,027
Again, big serious disciplinary claims

1326
00:55:56,027 --> 00:55:56,027
also with broad transdisciplinary and

1327
00:55:56,027 --> 00:55:56,027
application consequences.

1328
00:55:45,016 --> 00:56:11,036
Dean: By focusing attention less on the

1329
00:56:11,036 --> 00:56:11,036
creative process of an innovation more on

1330
00:56:11,036 --> 00:56:11,036
the observers of it this acceptance of

1331
00:56:11,036 --> 00:56:11,036
the outcome underpins its intra and

1332
00:56:11,036 --> 00:56:11,036
intergenerational transmission.

1333
00:56:00,025 --> 00:56:39,064
Questions raise their head about just

1334
00:56:39,064 --> 00:56:39,064
what materialistic phenomena are

1335
00:56:39,064 --> 00:56:39,064
implicated as opposed to psychocognitive

1336
00:56:39,064 --> 00:56:39,064
and social cognitive notions about mental

1337
00:56:39,064 --> 00:56:39,064
developments during human evolution and

1338
00:56:39,064 --> 00:56:39,064
how and when the impinge on the hmm of

1339
00:56:39,064 --> 00:56:39,064
our neogene hominid precursors such that

1340
00:56:39,064 --> 00:56:39,064
only in places seen Homo was faithful

1341
00:56:39,064 --> 00:56:39,064
copying become widespread and give rise

1342
00:56:39,064 --> 00:56:39,064
to technological cumulative complexity.

1343
00:56:11,036 --> 00:56:57,082
It's obligatory, therefore, to pay

1344
00:56:57,082 --> 00:56:57,082
attention both to fundamental principles

1345
00:56:57,082 --> 00:56:57,082
of biological science with particular

1346
00:56:57,082 --> 00:56:57,082
reference to Neurobiology and to the

1347
00:56:57,082 --> 00:56:57,082
evolution of binatural selection of

1348
00:56:57,082 --> 00:56:57,082
species of the genus Homo with particular

1349
00:56:57,082 --> 00:56:57,082
reference to their brains.

1350
00:56:39,064 --> 00:57:04,083
I added the smiley face narrowing the

1351
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:04,083
range of adult behavior open to him may

1352
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:04,083
be protracted.

1353
00:56:57,082 --> 00:57:14,093
corticogenesis evolved in Homo only

1354
00:57:14,093 --> 00:57:14,093
around zero five ma during the middle

1355
00:57:14,093 --> 00:57:14,093
plisocene in adolescents.

1356
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:21,100
Nowadays, co activity between prefrontal

1357
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:21,100
and caudal cortices underlies agile

1358
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:21,100
working memory.

1359
00:57:14,093 --> 00:57:39,118
From the perspective of the fep, these

1360
00:57:39,118 --> 00:57:39,118
differences near anatomical testified to

1361
00:57:39,118 --> 00:57:39,118
structural priors probably established

1362
00:57:39,118 --> 00:57:39,118
through neuro epigenetic evolution, which

1363
00:57:39,118 --> 00:57:39,118
contextualize experience dependent

1364
00:57:39,118 --> 00:57:39,118
learning and planning is inference at a

1365
00:57:39,118 --> 00:57:39,118
somatic timescale.

1366
00:57:22,101 --> 00:58:08,141
It's relevant that the interplay between

1367
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:08,141
working memory load and associate

1368
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:08,141
reinforcement learning aspects prediction

1369
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:08,141
errors via front parietal and dopa

1370
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:08,141
energetic striational neuronal circuits

1371
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:08,141
involving algorithmic like effects

1372
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:08,141
mediated by loops with basal ganglia with

1373
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:08,141
likely impingement also of episodic and

1374
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:08,141
procedural long term memory input

1375
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:08,141
remedial temporal hippocampal

1376
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:08,141
cortisones.

1377
00:57:40,119 --> 00:58:11,144
You can read the middle section.

1378
00:58:09,142 --> 00:58:22,155
When considering early Pleistocene

1379
00:58:22,155 --> 00:58:22,155
behavior, we need not assume that

1380
00:58:22,155 --> 00:58:22,155
relationships between different kinds of

1381
00:58:22,155 --> 00:58:22,155
memory of memory were less complex

1382
00:58:22,155 --> 00:58:22,155
psychocognitively than ours.

1383
00:58:11,144 --> 00:58:33,166
It is prosaically sufficient to infer

1384
00:58:33,166 --> 00:58:33,166
that they were simply less frequent owing

1385
00:58:33,166 --> 00:58:33,166
to earlier consolidation of cerebral

1386
00:58:33,166 --> 00:58:33,166
networks in Homo erectus smaller brain.

1387
00:58:23,156 --> 00:58:39,172
That's being restated, we already talked

1388
00:58:39,172 --> 00:58:39,172
about it earlier in our introduction.

1389
00:58:33,166 --> 00:59:02,189
Daniel: Yes, it reflects many of the so

1390
00:59:02,189 --> 00:59:02,189
called biological attributes that

1391
00:59:02,189 --> 00:59:02,189
archaeologists study in terms of cranial

1392
00:59:02,189 --> 00:59:02,189
volume and developmental trajectories,

1393
00:59:02,189 --> 00:59:02,189
and reaches towards some of those more

1394
00:59:02,189 --> 00:59:02,189
ineffable or at least unrecorded

1395
00:59:02,189 --> 00:59:02,189
cognitive phenotypes like working memory,

1396
00:59:02,189 --> 00:59:02,189
ability to integrate diverse stimuli and

1397
00:59:02,189 --> 00:59:02,189
so on.

1398
00:58:39,172 --> 00:59:05,192
More on that.

1399
00:59:04,191 --> 00:59:20,207
Homo erectus observers brains may have

1400
00:59:20,207 --> 00:59:20,207
lacked neuronal networks efficient enough

1401
00:59:20,207 --> 00:59:20,207
for enabling them to develop innovative

1402
00:59:20,207 --> 00:59:20,207
behavioral responses in the early

1403
00:59:20,207 --> 00:59:20,207
Pleistocene that were habit forming a

1404
00:59:20,207 --> 00:59:20,207
zone of bounded surprise here and after

1405
00:59:20,207 --> 00:59:20,207
Zbs restricted them.

1406
00:59:06,193 --> 00:59:46,233
Possibly, observations by early Homo

1407
00:59:46,233 --> 00:59:46,233
erectus were translated often into

1408
00:59:46,233 --> 00:59:46,233
activity intermediate between emulation

1409
00:59:46,233 --> 00:59:46,233
and imitation, owing to limited foresight

1410
00:59:46,233 --> 00:59:46,233
about the significance of precise

1411
00:59:46,233 --> 00:59:46,233
manipulations for determining the

1412
00:59:46,233 --> 00:59:46,233
practicality and effectiveness of an

1413
00:59:46,233 --> 00:59:46,233
outcome dimly envisaged, their ZVS

1414
00:59:46,233 --> 00:59:46,233
limited their ability to join up the

1415
00:59:46,233 --> 00:59:46,233
mental steps involved in planning and to

1416
00:59:46,233 --> 00:59:46,233
infer counterfactual possibilities.

1417
00:59:21,208 --> 00:59:58,245
That is a fundamental aspect of active

1418
00:59:58,245 --> 00:59:58,245
inference that selection of actions and

1419
00:59:58,245 --> 00:59:58,245
plans is based on minimizing the free

1420
00:59:58,245 --> 00:59:58,245
energy to be anticipated in undertaking

1421
00:59:58,245 --> 00:59:58,245
them.

1422
00:59:47,234 --> 00:59:59,246
Minimizing effort.

1423
00:59:58,245 --> 01:00:10,188
And also extremely interestingly, as we

1424
01:00:10,188 --> 01:00:10,188
explored in Live Stream 52 with Lancelot

1425
01:00:10,188 --> 01:00:10,188
Costa, free energy is not the only

1426
01:00:10,188 --> 01:00:10,188
discrepancy measure, and one that was

1427
01:00:10,188 --> 01:00:10,188
mentioned was the Earth mover's

1428
01:00:10,188 --> 01:00:10,188
distance.

1429
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:26,760
So it's interesting to think about active

1430
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:26,760
inference with the Earth mover's distance

1431
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:26,760
if you are actually moving earth zones

1432
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:26,760
abounded surprisal ZVS are different from

1433
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:26,760
the zones of latent solutions ZLS

1434
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:26,760
proposed by Tenney et al.

1435
01:00:10,198 --> 01:00:50,124
In 2009 in their attempt to explain the

1436
01:00:50,124 --> 01:00:50,124
lack of cumulative culture in great apes

1437
01:00:50,124 --> 01:00:50,124
on the basis that cultural complexity is

1438
01:00:50,124 --> 01:00:50,124
restricted by the limited potentials for

1439
01:00:50,124 --> 01:00:50,124
individual intervention zones abounded

1440
01:00:50,124 --> 01:00:50,124
surprisal are separated by varying

1441
01:00:50,124 --> 01:00:50,124
degrees of surprisal from the

1442
01:00:50,124 --> 01:00:50,124
species'prototypical behavioral

1443
01:00:50,124 --> 01:00:50,124
repertoire and could therefore resist the

1444
01:00:50,124 --> 01:00:50,124
gravitational pull of the ZLS.

1445
01:00:26,764 --> 01:01:11,649
The focus of the zbs concept is on the

1446
01:01:11,649 --> 01:01:11,649
observers and their ability to make sense

1447
01:01:11,649 --> 01:01:11,649
of an observed innovation encoding and

1448
01:01:11,649 --> 01:01:11,649
subsequent copying of an innovation

1449
01:01:11,649 --> 01:01:11,649
depends on the degree of disparity or

1450
01:01:11,649 --> 01:01:11,649
surprisal between predictable behavior

1451
01:01:11,649 --> 01:01:11,649
which are those typical of the species

1452
01:01:11,649 --> 01:01:11,649
and the perceptual incoming information

1453
01:01:11,649 --> 01:01:11,649
about novel behaviors.

1454
01:00:51,205 --> 01:01:23,881
The ZVS allows any potentially novel or

1455
01:01:23,881 --> 01:01:23,881
unorthodox behavior to be copied provided

1456
01:01:23,881 --> 01:01:23,881
that the ranges or levels of surprisal

1457
01:01:23,881 --> 01:01:23,881
provoked in observers are tolerated or

1458
01:01:23,881 --> 01:01:23,881
manageable by them.

1459
01:01:11,683 --> 01:01:43,844
The ZPs is constrained by the capacity of

1460
01:01:43,844 --> 01:01:43,844
a species'cerebral neuronal network as

1461
01:01:43,844 --> 01:01:43,844
opposed to potentially a sociocultural

1462
01:01:43,844 --> 01:01:43,844
explanation which might argue that the

1463
01:01:43,844 --> 01:01:43,844
continuity or pattern overall of a tool's

1464
01:01:43,844 --> 01:01:43,844
appearance would be rather constrained by

1465
01:01:43,844 --> 01:01:43,844
the capacity of a social group's

1466
01:01:43,844 --> 01:01:43,844
transmission capacity.

1467
01:01:24,898 --> 01:01:48,032
It's a yes and they're proposing a

1468
01:01:48,032 --> 01:01:48,032
different tack.

1469
01:01:43,886 --> 01:01:56,111
Zbs focuses on the observer of an

1470
01:01:56,111 --> 01:01:56,111
innovation and hence ZLS and Zbs can be

1471
01:01:56,111 --> 01:01:56,111
useful complementary concepts.

1472
01:01:49,042 --> 01:02:13,224
I think we checked but we never went

1473
01:02:13,224 --> 01:02:13,224
below min two in this paper properties of

1474
01:02:13,224 --> 01:02:13,224
mirror neuron circuitry are necessary

1475
01:02:13,224 --> 01:02:13,224
prerequisites for imitative copying the

1476
01:02:13,224 --> 01:02:13,224
left side of our brain contains neurons

1477
01:02:13,224 --> 01:02:13,224
with canonical properties involved in

1478
01:02:13,224 --> 01:02:13,224
tool use and perhaps understanding it.

1479
01:01:56,113 --> 01:02:19,284
The matter of understanding raises

1480
01:02:19,284 --> 01:02:19,284
unavoidable awkward epistemological

1481
01:02:19,284 --> 01:02:19,284
problems of neurology.

1482
01:02:13,226 --> 01:02:22,317
However, mirology is about parts and

1483
01:02:22,317 --> 01:02:22,317
holes.

1484
01:02:19,285 --> 01:03:00,631
Dean: The cardinal and the ordinal okay

1485
01:03:00,631 --> 01:03:00,631
chimpanzees resemble macaques and they

1486
01:03:00,631 --> 01:03:00,631
differ from them in sharing what with

1487
01:03:00,631 --> 01:03:00,631
humans coincidental prefrontal

1488
01:03:00,631 --> 01:03:00,631
somatotopic responses to transitive

1489
01:03:00,631 --> 01:03:00,631
behavior intransitive observation humans

1490
01:03:00,631 --> 01:03:00,631
differ from both in that arcuit I was

1491
01:03:00,631 --> 01:03:00,631
trying to practice this before we came on

1492
01:03:00,631 --> 01:03:00,631
live and I still trip.

1493
01:02:25,340 --> 01:03:00,637
Sorry.

1494
01:03:00,631 --> 01:03:12,753
Arcuit faciculous white matter has

1495
01:03:12,753 --> 01:03:12,753
undergone evolutionary modification

1496
01:03:12,753 --> 01:03:12,753
affecting temporal low connectivity.

1497
01:03:01,647 --> 01:03:15,789
Learnt behavior involves long term

1498
01:03:15,789 --> 01:03:15,789
working memory and procedural memory.

1499
01:03:12,755 --> 01:03:23,868
Conscious modification of learned

1500
01:03:23,868 --> 01:03:23,868
behavioral patterns reasonably permits

1501
01:03:23,868 --> 01:03:23,868
distinguishing long term working memory

1502
01:03:23,868 --> 01:03:23,868
from short term attention.

1503
01:03:16,791 --> 01:03:33,966
Working memories even though most long

1504
01:03:33,966 --> 01:03:33,966
term memory is implicit implicit and non

1505
01:03:33,966 --> 01:03:33,966
declarative the boundary between explicit

1506
01:03:33,966 --> 01:03:33,966
and implicit memory is porous.

1507
01:03:23,868 --> 01:03:36,994
It's a broken line.

1508
01:03:34,976 --> 01:03:41,040
Skillful acts imply fact for

1509
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:41,040
propositional perception.

1510
01:03:37,005 --> 01:03:47,102
Individual train sequences changed to a

1511
01:03:47,102 --> 01:03:47,102
greater extent earlier in learning and

1512
01:03:47,102 --> 01:03:47,102
stabilized later.

1513
01:03:41,042 --> 01:04:01,189
Patterns of neuronal activity became

1514
01:04:01,189 --> 01:04:01,189
increasingly distinct for trained

1515
01:04:01,189 --> 01:04:01,189
sequences carried out at full speed the

1516
01:04:01,189 --> 01:04:01,189
selective importance of particular

1517
01:04:01,189 --> 01:04:01,189
neuronal groups and included striatal

1518
01:04:01,189 --> 01:04:01,189
activation.

1519
01:03:48,117 --> 01:04:22,392
Comparing the motor sequences and carried

1520
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:22,392
out at different speeds permitted an

1521
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:22,392
analysis of the observation that areas of

1522
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:22,392
motor and sensory motor cortices show

1523
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:22,392
relatively slight changes in patterns of

1524
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:22,392
neuronal activity that are specific for

1525
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:22,392
particular sequences following training

1526
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:22,392
plausibly on account of the slow speed at

1527
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:22,392
which participants previously been paced

1528
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:22,392
during training.

1529
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:40,571
Hence, defining that patterns of sequence

1530
01:04:40,571 --> 01:04:40,571
specific activation are strongest when

1531
01:04:40,571 --> 01:04:40,571
performing at greatest speed implies that

1532
01:04:40,571 --> 01:04:40,571
investigating fine grained patterns of

1533
01:04:40,571 --> 01:04:40,571
activity requires participants to cope

1534
01:04:40,571 --> 01:04:40,571
with a strong manual challenge.

1535
01:04:22,393 --> 01:04:55,721
Activation is bilateral because

1536
01:04:55,721 --> 01:04:55,721
fashioning stone requires precise and

1537
01:04:55,721 --> 01:04:55,721
accurate monitoring in an organized

1538
01:04:55,721 --> 01:04:55,721
forward sequence of perception action

1539
01:04:55,721 --> 01:04:55,721
with feedback homo erectus brains had an

1540
01:04:55,721 --> 01:04:55,721
appropriate working memory.

1541
01:04:40,572 --> 01:05:11,828
Moreover, they had to have had a

1542
01:05:11,828 --> 01:05:11,828
hierarchically organized neurocognitive

1543
01:05:11,828 --> 01:05:11,828
capacity to generate in an observer the

1544
01:05:11,828 --> 01:05:11,828
combinatorial ability needed for there to

1545
01:05:11,828 --> 01:05:11,828
be any acceptably accurate copying.

1546
01:04:55,723 --> 01:05:31,024
The Stone undergoing artifactual

1547
01:05:31,024 --> 01:05:31,024
modification as envisaged outcome that is

1548
01:05:31,024 --> 01:05:31,024
abstracted and understood implicitly by

1549
01:05:31,024 --> 01:05:31,024
both parties, albeit invisible explicitly

1550
01:05:31,024 --> 01:05:31,024
during the materializing through shaping

1551
01:05:31,024 --> 01:05:31,024
process.

1552
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:38,095
Such abstraction severely challenges

1553
01:05:38,095 --> 01:05:38,095
innate homeostatic drives in naive

1554
01:05:38,095 --> 01:05:38,095
observers.

1555
01:05:31,025 --> 01:06:03,287
Daniel: Rebro neuroimaging of students

1556
01:06:03,287 --> 01:06:03,287
learning to nap chopping tools via v

1557
01:06:03,287 --> 01:06:03,287
those learning to nap BF Lcts suggests

1558
01:06:03,287 --> 01:06:03,287
significant distinctions in their

1559
01:06:03,287 --> 01:06:03,287
respective judgments concerning the

1560
01:06:03,287 --> 01:06:03,287
physical accuracy of predicted outcomes

1561
01:06:03,287 --> 01:06:03,287
versus strategical appropriateness in

1562
01:06:03,287 --> 01:06:03,287
preparing the attended tool.

1563
01:05:44,158 --> 01:06:11,362
It is as if the two groups were trying

1564
01:06:11,362 --> 01:06:11,362
out different cognitive strategies

1565
01:06:11,362 --> 01:06:11,362
differently during their respective

1566
01:06:11,362 --> 01:06:11,362
apprenticeships.

1567
01:06:03,288 --> 01:06:24,490
Accurately repeated preparations of

1568
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:24,490
Bflcts evolved hand in hand with

1569
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:24,490
preferential natural selection of a

1570
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:24,490
propensity for developments in haptic

1571
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:24,490
working memory.

1572
01:06:13,385 --> 01:06:44,698
It must not be forgotten, of course, that

1573
01:06:44,698 --> 01:06:44,698
working memory can also be an external

1574
01:06:44,698 --> 01:06:44,698
physical resource hashtag stigmaji that

1575
01:06:44,698 --> 01:06:44,698
facilitates copying e g handbooks of

1576
01:06:44,698 --> 01:06:44,698
instructions, YouTube demonstrations or

1577
01:06:44,698 --> 01:06:44,698
physical models available for copying e g

1578
01:06:44,698 --> 01:06:44,698
models in an artist studio or stone

1579
01:06:44,698 --> 01:06:44,698
artifacts visible to paleolithic

1580
01:06:44,698 --> 01:06:44,698
observers.

1581
01:06:24,491 --> 01:06:50,757
As argued elsewhere, working memory is a

1582
01:06:50,757 --> 01:06:50,757
complex multidimensional concept.

1583
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:54,791
You can take the last part.

1584
01:06:52,774 --> 01:07:21,001
Dean: Evolution by natural selection is

1585
01:07:21,001 --> 01:07:21,001
inherently conservative and emergent

1586
01:07:21,001 --> 01:07:21,001
neural representations exploited by lone

1587
01:07:21,001 --> 01:07:21,001
individuals need not have been shared

1588
01:07:21,001 --> 01:07:21,001
automatically by other minds and groups

1589
01:07:21,001 --> 01:07:21,001
of largely inarticulate home erectus

1590
01:07:21,001 --> 01:07:21,001
whose adaptive priors guided their action

1591
01:07:21,001 --> 01:07:21,001
perception cycles towards adaptive

1592
01:07:21,001 --> 01:07:21,001
unsurprising states by way of minimizing

1593
01:07:21,001 --> 01:07:21,001
variation of free energy.

1594
01:06:54,798 --> 01:07:43,226
Those priors could involve neuro

1595
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:43,226
epigenetically controlled expressions of

1596
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:43,226
genes implicated in those cerebral

1597
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:43,226
neuronal developments that prioritize

1598
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:43,226
routine expectations and consolidate

1599
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:43,226
habitual behavior to the detriment of

1600
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:43,226
recognizing the epistemic affordances

1601
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:43,226
that underwrite curiosity and surprising

1602
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:43,226
novelty seeking behavior.

1603
01:07:21,001 --> 01:07:59,381
In consequence, some infrequently found

1604
01:07:59,381 --> 01:07:59,381
technological aspects of early

1605
01:07:59,381 --> 01:07:59,381
Pleistocene innovative behavior may well

1606
01:07:59,381 --> 01:07:59,381
have been isolated instances until such

1607
01:07:59,381 --> 01:07:59,381
times, active inference brought about

1608
01:07:59,381 --> 01:07:59,381
modification of adaptive behavior sorry.

1609
01:07:43,227 --> 01:08:10,437
Active priors, thereby permitting

1610
01:08:10,437 --> 01:08:10,437
acceptance and adoption by observers of

1611
01:08:10,437 --> 01:08:10,437
unorthodox behavior that had failed to

1612
01:08:10,437 --> 01:08:10,437
provide adaptive advantage.

1613
01:07:59,382 --> 01:08:11,448
Hitherto.

1614
01:08:10,438 --> 01:08:19,526
Daniel: So much to unpack with what

1615
01:08:19,526 --> 01:08:19,526
active inference allows.

1616
01:08:14,476 --> 01:08:21,542
Dean: Right?

1617
01:08:20,534 --> 01:08:29,623
Daniel: So that is where our discussion

1618
01:08:29,623 --> 01:08:29,623
of the key rings of the two papers ends.

1619
01:08:22,554 --> 01:08:39,719
Just as a reminder, the more extensive

1620
01:08:39,719 --> 01:08:39,719
quotes are great resources to see in the

1621
01:08:39,719 --> 01:08:39,719
final versions of the paper and so on.

1622
01:08:30,631 --> 01:08:55,884
And in the following couple of slides we

1623
01:08:55,884 --> 01:08:55,884
wanted to bring in a few other directions

1624
01:08:55,884 --> 01:08:55,884
a sampling of the extra resources that

1625
01:08:55,884 --> 01:08:55,884
Dean and I were looking through in our

1626
01:08:55,884 --> 01:08:55,884
zero preparation.

1627
01:08:39,727 --> 01:09:00,879
And do you have any comments on this

1628
01:09:00,879 --> 01:09:00,879
before I describe this side by side?

1629
01:08:55,888 --> 01:09:07,942
Dean: Yeah, I think it's good that you

1630
01:09:07,942 --> 01:09:07,942
show the two representations on the right

1631
01:09:07,942 --> 01:09:07,942
side of the screen.

1632
01:09:01,884 --> 01:09:19,062
I think oftentimes we think of things of

1633
01:09:19,062 --> 01:09:19,062
interstate as here are the two train

1634
01:09:19,062 --> 01:09:19,062
tracks and they are in perfect parallel.

1635
01:09:07,944 --> 01:09:29,169
What I also think often happens is the

1636
01:09:29,169 --> 01:09:29,169
shortest distance between two points from

1637
01:09:29,169 --> 01:09:29,169
formalism aspect is a straight line.

1638
01:09:19,063 --> 01:09:40,275
But when what we're talking about is

1639
01:09:40,275 --> 01:09:40,275
generative models, we're talking about

1640
01:09:40,275 --> 01:09:40,275
two kinds of time one that's continuous

1641
01:09:40,275 --> 01:09:40,275
and one that's discrete.

1642
01:09:30,175 --> 01:10:02,432
And our ability to uptake something may

1643
01:10:02,432 --> 01:10:02,432
be afforded when we meander slightly so

1644
01:10:02,432 --> 01:10:02,432
the representation on the left isn't to

1645
01:10:02,432 --> 01:10:02,432
remove the idea of the barbell or to

1646
01:10:02,432 --> 01:10:02,432
impose on the model that it has to be

1647
01:10:02,432 --> 01:10:02,432
direct.

1648
01:09:40,277 --> 01:10:09,508
Sometimes getting to the answer comes

1649
01:10:09,508 --> 01:10:09,508
about in kind of strange and wonderful

1650
01:10:09,508 --> 01:10:09,508
ways.

1651
01:10:03,442 --> 01:10:15,565
Sometimes things happen suddenly because

1652
01:10:15,565 --> 01:10:15,565
we meander.

1653
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:26,670
So I'll turn over the actual diagram now

1654
01:10:26,670 --> 01:10:26,670
to you and be able to talk a little bit

1655
01:10:26,670 --> 01:10:26,670
about that in terms of how we shape that

1656
01:10:26,670 --> 01:10:26,670
in terms of discrete and continuous

1657
01:10:26,670 --> 01:10:26,670
time.

1658
01:10:15,565 --> 01:10:27,684
Daniel: Awesome.

1659
01:10:26,678 --> 01:10:57,980
Well, this is Figure 4.3 from Par Pazulo

1660
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:57,980
and Friston's 2022 active inference

1661
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:57,980
textbook that we have textbook groups at

1662
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:57,980
the institute around and two different

1663
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:57,980
taxonomic groups, maybe generative

1664
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:57,980
modelus erectus and generative modelus

1665
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:57,980
habilis or something like that, are

1666
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:57,980
juxtaposed in a way that highlights their

1667
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:57,980
structural similarity but also calls

1668
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:57,980
attention to some of their details.

1669
01:10:27,684 --> 01:11:01,963
On the top is a partially observable

1670
01:11:01,963 --> 01:11:01,963
Markov decision process.

1671
01:10:57,982 --> 01:11:05,008
And this is a discrete time

1672
01:11:05,008 --> 01:11:05,008
representation of a generative model.

1673
01:11:01,965 --> 01:11:19,142
The hidden states are evolving through

1674
01:11:19,142 --> 01:11:19,142
time and there's a past, present and

1675
01:11:19,142 --> 01:11:19,142
future which are indexed with temporal

1676
01:11:19,142 --> 01:11:19,142
markers time minus one, time right now,

1677
01:11:19,142 --> 01:11:19,142
time plus one.

1678
01:11:06,019 --> 01:11:22,173
And at each time there's the emission of

1679
01:11:22,173 --> 01:11:22,173
observables.

1680
01:11:19,143 --> 01:11:23,187
That's the tail of two densities.

1681
01:11:22,173 --> 01:11:31,268
It can emit generative AI densities from

1682
01:11:31,268 --> 01:11:31,268
hidden states or it can dean hidden

1683
01:11:31,268 --> 01:11:31,268
states from observables.

1684
01:11:23,188 --> 01:11:44,392
That's the A matrix D is the prior b

1685
01:11:44,392 --> 01:11:44,392
describes how those hidden states change

1686
01:11:44,392 --> 01:11:44,392
through time and G shapes policy

1687
01:11:44,392 --> 01:11:44,392
selection through expected free energy

1688
01:11:44,392 --> 01:11:44,392
that intervenes in how hidden states

1689
01:11:44,392 --> 01:11:44,392
change through time.

1690
01:11:31,268 --> 01:11:52,469
And more briefly in the continuous time

1691
01:11:52,469 --> 01:11:52,469
generative model rather than explicit

1692
01:11:52,469 --> 01:11:52,469
representation of past, present and

1693
01:11:52,469 --> 01:11:52,469
future.

1694
01:11:44,393 --> 01:12:16,657
The approach taken is much more resonant

1695
01:12:16,657 --> 01:12:16,657
with generalized coordinates of motion or

1696
01:12:16,657 --> 01:12:16,657
a Taylor series expansion in which all

1697
01:12:16,657 --> 01:12:16,657
past, present and future time points are

1698
01:12:16,657 --> 01:12:16,657
implicitly predicted through the

1699
01:12:16,657 --> 01:12:16,657
specification of the derivatives of

1700
01:12:16,657 --> 01:12:16,657
increasingly high order around the target

1701
01:12:16,657 --> 01:12:16,657
variable latent state x.

1702
01:11:52,471 --> 01:12:19,683
There's a lot more to say.

1703
01:12:17,668 --> 01:12:34,833
But when I saw Dean bring in the straight

1704
01:12:34,833 --> 01:12:34,833
and the wavy and the kind of meta train

1705
01:12:34,833 --> 01:12:34,833
track that together they enabled seeing,

1706
01:12:34,833 --> 01:12:34,833
I thought 4.3, that's where we wanted to

1707
01:12:34,833 --> 01:12:34,833
be.

1708
01:12:19,684 --> 01:12:36,858
Dean: And here's the interesting thing.

1709
01:12:35,840 --> 01:13:10,134
Even in that representation, if you were

1710
01:13:10,134 --> 01:13:10,134
to suddenly realize that you liked the

1711
01:13:10,134 --> 01:13:10,134
relaxing meandering route, that you're

1712
01:13:10,134 --> 01:13:10,134
not always in a hurry, you would probably

1713
01:13:10,134 --> 01:13:10,134
have a better chance of realizing that in

1714
01:13:10,134 --> 01:13:10,134
continuous time the suddenness would

1715
01:13:10,134 --> 01:13:10,134
occur as you stretched your window of

1716
01:13:10,134 --> 01:13:10,134
analysis out, which again seems

1717
01:13:10,134 --> 01:13:10,134
counterintuitive, but that's what the

1718
01:13:10,134 --> 01:13:10,134
representation affirms.

1719
01:12:37,863 --> 01:13:24,270
Daniel: And one last note on this before

1720
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:24,270
you introduce the next one is in this

1721
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:24,270
Figure 4.3 we see a crystallization of

1722
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:24,270
methodological pluralism in active

1723
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:24,270
inference.

1724
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:29,324
So all questions of the form how does

1725
01:13:29,324 --> 01:13:29,324
inference, active inference treat x

1726
01:13:29,324 --> 01:13:29,324
phenomena?

1727
01:13:24,272 --> 01:13:31,346
Even for a specified subsystem?

1728
01:13:29,325 --> 01:13:36,393
There is no a priori reason to favor the

1729
01:13:36,393 --> 01:13:36,393
left or the right foot.

1730
01:13:31,348 --> 01:13:40,431
We want the barbell loaded on both sides

1731
01:13:40,431 --> 01:13:40,431
before we bench press it.

1732
01:13:36,394 --> 01:13:55,581
And so even the decision of the time

1733
01:13:55,581 --> 01:13:55,581
window and the treatment of time, which

1734
01:13:55,581 --> 01:13:55,581
is one of the most absolutely fundamental

1735
01:13:55,581 --> 01:13:55,581
decisions in a model, let alone further

1736
01:13:55,581 --> 01:13:55,581
structural learning questions which were

1737
01:13:55,581 --> 01:13:55,581
mentioned earlier in the quotations.

1738
01:13:40,433 --> 01:14:05,623
Even at that most fundamental divergence

1739
01:14:05,623 --> 01:14:05,623
between discrete and continuous time

1740
01:14:05,623 --> 01:14:05,623
generative models, the active infra Ant

1741
01:14:05,623 --> 01:14:05,623
absolutely has a decision.

1742
01:13:55,588 --> 01:14:11,686
So what do you see here and what do we

1743
01:14:11,686 --> 01:14:11,686
want to bring in?

1744
01:14:08,655 --> 01:14:14,719
Dean: Yeah, this was Ryan Smith's paper.

1745
01:14:11,687 --> 01:14:29,864
And what I like about this is he broke it

1746
01:14:29,864 --> 01:14:29,864
down into decision active inference just

1747
01:14:29,864 --> 01:14:29,864
to if you want to go back and have a look

1748
01:14:29,864 --> 01:14:29,864
at that live stream set.

1749
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:44,012
What he was trying to speak to there was

1750
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:44,012
that a lot of stuff that's going on in

1751
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:44,012
folk psychology doesn't contradict what

1752
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:44,012
we now kind of understand in terms of how

1753
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:44,012
we can model things out using active

1754
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:44,012
inference.

1755
01:14:32,890 --> 01:15:01,121
And again, you can explain the diagram

1756
01:15:01,121 --> 01:15:01,121
better than I can, but I think what's

1757
01:15:01,121 --> 01:15:01,121
interesting here is to decide to make a

1758
01:15:01,121 --> 01:15:01,121
choice to copy or not to copy.

1759
01:14:44,013 --> 01:15:04,157
To throw a stone or not to throw a

1760
01:15:04,157 --> 01:15:04,157
stone.

1761
01:15:01,129 --> 01:15:14,259
There's two slides here that we kind of

1762
01:15:14,259 --> 01:15:14,259
have to kind of pull together again for

1763
01:15:14,259 --> 01:15:14,259
what I wanted to focus on, which is on

1764
01:15:14,259 --> 01:15:14,259
the next slide next.

1765
01:15:05,163 --> 01:15:21,327
But here what I want to do is kind of

1766
01:15:21,327 --> 01:15:21,327
talk about this paragraph on the bottom

1767
01:15:21,327 --> 01:15:21,327
left hand side.

1768
01:15:15,259 --> 01:15:26,373
You have a paper about sensory

1769
01:15:26,373 --> 01:15:26,373
attenuation.

1770
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:32,435
What do we pay attention to as an outcome

1771
01:15:32,435 --> 01:15:32,435
desensitization?

1772
01:15:26,378 --> 01:15:39,505
This only becomes problematic when

1773
01:15:39,505 --> 01:15:39,505
contingencies in the environment, when

1774
01:15:39,505 --> 01:15:39,505
the environment changes over time.

1775
01:15:32,436 --> 01:15:40,510
Right.

1776
01:15:39,507 --> 01:15:45,560
So we are talking about things that

1777
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:45,560
agents do in time and in place.

1778
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:56,679
But what this paper was talking about was

1779
01:15:56,679 --> 01:15:56,679
sort of the folk psychological and some

1780
01:15:56,679 --> 01:15:56,679
of those stories that we've used to try

1781
01:15:56,679 --> 01:15:56,679
to explain things and focuses on what's

1782
01:15:56,679 --> 01:15:56,679
going on in the envelope, what's going on

1783
01:15:56,679 --> 01:15:56,679
in the niche.

1784
01:15:45,561 --> 01:16:08,731
This highlights an important distinction

1785
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:08,731
between this type of habit formation and

1786
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:08,731
other mechanisms promoting habitlike

1787
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:08,731
patterns of behavior in decision active

1788
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:08,731
inference, for example.

1789
01:15:57,685 --> 01:16:18,834
Actions can also become resistant to

1790
01:16:18,834 --> 01:16:18,834
change after repeated experience because

1791
01:16:18,834 --> 01:16:18,834
agents build up highly confident beliefs

1792
01:16:18,834 --> 01:16:18,834
about the reward probabilities under each

1793
01:16:18,834 --> 01:16:18,834
action.

1794
01:16:08,732 --> 01:16:28,938
If contingencies, change could take a

1795
01:16:28,938 --> 01:16:28,938
very large number of trials for agents to

1796
01:16:28,938 --> 01:16:28,938
unlearn such beliefs.

1797
01:16:18,835 --> 01:16:35,009
So I wanted to throw this in as a

1798
01:16:35,009 --> 01:16:35,009
complement to the habitization stuff that

1799
01:16:35,009 --> 01:16:35,009
was in the copied or not to copy paper.

1800
01:16:28,938 --> 01:16:38,034
Do you want to explain the diagram real

1801
01:16:38,034 --> 01:16:38,034
quick?

1802
01:16:36,010 --> 01:16:48,137
Daniel: My only comment there is with

1803
01:16:48,137 --> 01:16:48,137
respect to Ali's question about copy

1804
01:16:48,137 --> 01:16:48,137
discard, the shadow of to copy or not to

1805
01:16:48,137 --> 01:16:48,137
copy is to discard or not to discard.

1806
01:16:38,038 --> 01:17:03,220
Because if people have been hitting their

1807
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:03,220
rocks one way and somebody else even if

1808
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:03,220
the functional mirror neurons allow one

1809
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:03,220
to understand that one is doing it

1810
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:03,220
differently, there's a whole variety of

1811
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:03,220
things that can happen and not.

1812
01:16:48,138 --> 01:17:19,384
All of them involve the successful

1813
01:17:19,384 --> 01:17:19,384
contagion of even an resolutely positive

1814
01:17:19,384 --> 01:17:19,384
improvement on tool use and especially

1815
01:17:19,384 --> 01:17:19,384
with complex trade off frontiers and

1816
01:17:19,384 --> 01:17:19,384
partially obscured views and all these

1817
01:17:19,384 --> 01:17:19,384
other social complexities.

1818
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:29,482
That is going to mean that to copy or not

1819
01:17:29,482 --> 01:17:29,482
to copy to discard or not to discard copy

1820
01:17:29,482 --> 01:17:29,482
discard becomes a central piece in

1821
01:17:29,482 --> 01:17:29,482
compositional.

1822
01:17:20,389 --> 01:17:33,528
Accounts of surprise minimization under

1823
01:17:33,528 --> 01:17:33,528
the hierarchically mechanistic minds.

1824
01:17:29,483 --> 01:17:45,648
Dean: So on this slide, which was just a

1825
01:17:45,648 --> 01:17:45,648
continuation of that live stream set or

1826
01:17:45,648 --> 01:17:45,648
deck, I'm going to drop down to the

1827
01:17:45,648 --> 01:17:45,648
fourth paragraph.

1828
01:17:35,545 --> 01:18:05,784
If the highest value in an outcome space

1829
01:18:05,784 --> 01:18:05,784
was specified for observing tasting ice

1830
01:18:05,784 --> 01:18:05,784
cream in the policy and the policy space

1831
01:18:05,784 --> 01:18:05,784
included, either choose don't move or

1832
01:18:05,784 --> 01:18:05,784
choose walk to the ice cream truck and

1833
01:18:05,784 --> 01:18:05,784
buy ice cream.

1834
01:17:45,648 --> 01:18:15,880
A deciding active agent, active inference

1835
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:15,880
agent will infer that walking to the ice

1836
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:15,880
cream truck and buying ice cream is the

1837
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:15,880
highest probability policy.

1838
01:18:05,785 --> 01:18:18,913
That is, it will form the intention to go

1839
01:18:18,913 --> 01:18:18,913
buy ice cream.

1840
01:18:15,881 --> 01:18:33,006
In addition, when considering the range

1841
01:18:33,006 --> 01:18:33,006
of cases involving goal directed choice,

1842
01:18:33,006 --> 01:18:33,006
we have been unsuccessful at identifying

1843
01:18:33,006 --> 01:18:33,006
examples where the policy would play a

1844
01:18:33,006 --> 01:18:33,006
role inconsistent with representing

1845
01:18:33,006 --> 01:18:33,006
desired outcomes.

1846
01:18:18,913 --> 01:18:34,007
Now, here's an interesting thing.

1847
01:18:33,006 --> 01:18:54,027
Even back then, if you look at the ice

1848
01:18:54,027 --> 01:18:54,027
cream cone and you ask it to the third

1849
01:18:54,027 --> 01:18:54,027
person now, Daniel and Dean looking at

1850
01:18:54,027 --> 01:18:54,027
the slide, is the ice cream truck closer

1851
01:18:54,027 --> 01:18:54,027
to us as we're viewing this or further

1852
01:18:54,027 --> 01:18:54,027
away from us than the actual ice cream

1853
01:18:54,027 --> 01:18:54,027
cone is?

1854
01:18:34,007 --> 01:19:04,031
You get one sense of it and then if I

1855
01:19:04,031 --> 01:19:04,031
grab this line at first it appears that

1856
01:19:04,031 --> 01:19:04,031
the ice cream cone truck is closer to

1857
01:19:04,031 --> 01:19:04,031
us.

1858
01:18:55,027 --> 01:19:13,040
If I do this, however, and I grab this

1859
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:13,040
line just like that, pull that away.

1860
01:19:04,031 --> 01:19:15,042
Now all of a sudden, what's in the

1861
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:15,042
foreground?

1862
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:17,044
The ice cream cone.

1863
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:31,058
So oftentimes when we're trying to figure

1864
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:31,058
out what we desire or what our goal is,

1865
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:31,058
we're completely unaware of how we're

1866
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:31,058
setting up our own frame, what rule we're

1867
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:31,058
actually following.

1868
01:19:17,044 --> 01:19:35,062
If we have a rule, we're completely

1869
01:19:35,062 --> 01:19:35,062
unaware of it.

1870
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:44,071
And yet that has a huge decision

1871
01:19:44,071 --> 01:19:44,071
implication on what's the desired

1872
01:19:44,071 --> 01:19:44,071
foreground background here?

1873
01:19:35,062 --> 01:20:00,081
How are we coming about to this idea that

1874
01:20:00,081 --> 01:20:00,081
this one shape which we're going to have

1875
01:20:00,081 --> 01:20:00,081
to arrive at by removing things is more

1876
01:20:00,081 --> 01:20:00,081
advantageous than just leaving it the way

1877
01:20:00,081 --> 01:20:00,081
it is.

1878
01:19:46,073 --> 01:20:09,090
So just to have one perspective on

1879
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:09,090
something unidirectional versus to be

1880
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:09,090
able to have those two perspectives on

1881
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:09,090
something.

1882
01:20:00,081 --> 01:20:24,105
So again, this was in comparison to a

1883
01:20:24,105 --> 01:20:24,105
folk psychology narrative of telling how

1884
01:20:24,105 --> 01:20:24,105
we might come to behaving versus the

1885
01:20:24,105 --> 01:20:24,105
active inference.

1886
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:32,113
What Ryan wanted to do in his paper was

1887
01:20:32,113 --> 01:20:32,113
say they're not fighting with one

1888
01:20:32,113 --> 01:20:32,113
another.

1889
01:20:24,105 --> 01:20:48,129
And oftentimes, if you actually

1890
01:20:48,129 --> 01:20:48,129
understand that you've made a lot of

1891
01:20:48,129 --> 01:20:48,129
choices that you're not even aware of,

1892
01:20:48,129 --> 01:20:48,129
that your generative model sometimes is a

1893
01:20:48,129 --> 01:20:48,129
reduction to some rules that you may or

1894
01:20:48,129 --> 01:20:48,129
may not even be able to articulate.

1895
01:20:32,113 --> 01:20:49,130
And that's fine.

1896
01:20:48,129 --> 01:20:55,136
Yes, it will influence what you do

1897
01:20:55,136 --> 01:20:55,136
present as an articulation.

1898
01:20:50,131 --> 01:21:03,138
It doesn't change what we now understand

1899
01:21:03,138 --> 01:21:03,138
as the mechanisms that are present and

1900
01:21:03,138 --> 01:21:03,138
that may help us.

1901
01:20:55,136 --> 01:21:05,140
In terms of some of that predictive

1902
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:05,140
process.

1903
01:21:03,138 --> 01:21:13,148
Daniel: Awesome live stream 46 way back

1904
01:21:13,148 --> 01:21:13,148
when.

1905
01:21:08,143 --> 01:21:17,152
All right, just a few more pieces to

1906
01:21:17,152 --> 01:21:17,152
bring into the puzzle.

1907
01:21:13,148 --> 01:21:25,159
So I'll give the first description on

1908
01:21:25,159 --> 01:21:25,159
each of them and then Dean, feel free to

1909
01:21:25,159 --> 01:21:25,159
kind of bring in why you wanted these to

1910
01:21:25,159 --> 01:21:25,159
be here.

1911
01:21:17,152 --> 01:21:38,173
So here's a paper, a variational

1912
01:21:38,173 --> 01:21:38,173
synthesis of evolutionary and

1913
01:21:38,173 --> 01:21:38,173
developmental dynamics which was written

1914
01:21:38,173 --> 01:21:38,173
with Friston, myself, Constance Knight,

1915
01:21:38,173 --> 01:21:38,173
Par and Campbell.

1916
01:21:25,160 --> 01:22:05,194
We recently uploaded it to archive and

1917
01:22:05,194 --> 01:22:05,194
one of the main novelties or

1918
01:22:05,194 --> 01:22:05,194
contributions of this paper was in

1919
01:22:05,194 --> 01:22:05,194
contrast with previous multiscale

1920
01:22:05,194 --> 01:22:05,194
biologically oriented active inference or

1921
01:22:05,194 --> 01:22:05,194
fep models which used the formalism of

1922
01:22:05,194 --> 01:22:05,194
nested POMDPs to model nested Markov

1923
01:22:05,194 --> 01:22:05,194
blankets, thus creating one bigger and

1924
01:22:05,194 --> 01:22:05,194
bigger tree with finer and finer leaves.

1925
01:21:38,173 --> 01:22:40,229
We used an explicit, discontinuous,

1926
01:22:40,229 --> 01:22:40,229
multiscale or scale friendly jump such

1927
01:22:40,229 --> 01:22:40,229
that within the lifetime, the intra

1928
01:22:40,229 --> 01:22:40,229
generational action perception loops and

1929
01:22:40,229 --> 01:22:40,229
also developmental loops that we heard

1930
01:22:40,229 --> 01:22:40,229
about in some selections from the papers

1931
01:22:40,229 --> 01:22:40,229
today that that particular partition that

1932
01:22:40,229 --> 01:22:40,229
thing, over the course of its life in an

1933
01:22:40,229 --> 01:22:40,229
ecologically embodied way can have bottom

1934
01:22:40,229 --> 01:22:40,229
up causation to this higher order thing,

1935
01:22:40,229 --> 01:22:40,229
which is a population thing.

1936
01:22:06,195 --> 01:22:53,242
And this higher order extended genotypic

1937
01:22:53,242 --> 01:22:53,242
thing also uses the exact same particular

1938
01:22:53,242 --> 01:22:53,242
partition mathematics and framing that we

1939
01:22:53,242 --> 01:22:53,242
see across systems in active.

1940
01:22:41,230 --> 01:23:09,252
And another way to look at that is here

1941
01:23:09,252 --> 01:23:09,252
in the center is one thing with a blue

1942
01:23:09,252 --> 01:23:09,252
ring going around it at a given level and

1943
01:23:09,252 --> 01:23:09,252
it is itself composed of these smaller

1944
01:23:09,252 --> 01:23:09,252
things which also are composed of even

1945
01:23:09,252 --> 01:23:09,252
smaller things.

1946
01:22:54,243 --> 01:23:15,258
And also that main blue ring is playing a

1947
01:23:15,258 --> 01:23:15,258
role in potentially a larger thing.

1948
01:23:09,252 --> 01:23:28,271
And this is the scale friendliness or the

1949
01:23:28,271 --> 01:23:28,271
scale freeness of the fep formalism

1950
01:23:28,271 --> 01:23:28,271
discussed in an ontogenetic phylogenetic

1951
01:23:28,271 --> 01:23:28,271
setting within and amongst generations.

1952
01:23:15,258 --> 01:23:59,302
And rather than utilizing this graphed

1953
01:23:59,302 --> 01:23:59,302
bigger and bigger POMDPs strategy, we

1954
01:23:59,302 --> 01:23:59,302
introduce an explicit discontinuity in

1955
01:23:59,302 --> 01:23:59,302
that things at a lower level are sampled

1956
01:23:59,302 --> 01:23:59,302
or instantiated from a higher level

1957
01:23:59,302 --> 01:23:59,302
distributional thing and the differential

1958
01:23:59,302 --> 01:23:59,302
success of those within generation

1959
01:23:59,302 --> 01:23:59,302
trajectories can result in bottom up

1960
01:23:59,302 --> 01:23:59,302
causation modifying the extended

1961
01:23:59,302 --> 01:23:59,302
genotypic thing.

1962
01:23:28,271 --> 01:24:06,303
I hope that we'll have more sessions to

1963
01:24:06,303 --> 01:24:06,303
talk more about this paper and related

1964
01:24:06,303 --> 01:24:06,303
work, but just wanted to give that quick

1965
01:24:06,303 --> 01:24:06,303
overview.

1966
01:24:00,297 --> 01:24:22,319
Dean: And I don't have a lot of deep

1967
01:24:22,319 --> 01:24:22,319
background in biology, so the reason why

1968
01:24:22,319 --> 01:24:22,319
I was hoping that you would be interested

1969
01:24:22,319 --> 01:24:22,319
in at least touching on this is because I

1970
01:24:22,319 --> 01:24:22,319
think, again, we're back to so which have

1971
01:24:22,319 --> 01:24:22,319
we chosen to do?

1972
01:24:07,304 --> 01:24:32,329
Have we chosen to zoom in on the scale

1973
01:24:32,329 --> 01:24:32,329
friendly or have we zoom in on the scale

1974
01:24:32,329 --> 01:24:32,329
friendly or zoom out onto the scale

1975
01:24:32,329 --> 01:24:32,329
free?

1976
01:24:22,319 --> 01:24:43,340
And I think we get a better understanding

1977
01:24:43,340 --> 01:24:43,340
when we're able to appreciate the

1978
01:24:43,340 --> 01:24:43,340
differences and put them back together in

1979
01:24:43,340 --> 01:24:43,340
sort of our own model.

1980
01:24:32,329 --> 01:24:47,344
Daniel: Great.

1981
01:24:46,343 --> 01:24:48,345
On to the next.

1982
01:24:47,344 --> 01:25:05,356
Here is a paper with Sean O'Connor who

1983
01:25:05,356 --> 01:25:05,356
led this effort and myself from the end

1984
01:25:05,356 --> 01:25:05,356
of 2022 predictive Processing

1985
01:25:05,356 --> 01:25:05,356
interpretation of the Mirror test and

1986
01:25:05,356 --> 01:25:05,356
implications of a reflection prediction

1987
01:25:05,356 --> 01:25:05,356
for human cognition.

1988
01:24:50,347 --> 01:25:25,376
And just to read one sentence from the

1989
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:25,376
abstract, we hypothesize that a

1990
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:25,376
reflection prediction upon which our

1991
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:25,376
predictive processing interpretation of

1992
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:25,376
the mirror test is built may also offer a

1993
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:25,376
novel perspective to understand how

1994
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:25,376
humans locate themselves relative to a

1995
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:25,376
mirror, imitate others and are self aware

1996
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:25,376
from a social perspective.

1997
01:25:05,356 --> 01:25:30,381
So what have you seen in that mirror

1998
01:25:30,381 --> 01:25:30,381
mirror on the screen?

1999
01:25:26,377 --> 01:25:32,383
And why did you want it here?

2000
01:25:30,381 --> 01:25:49,400
Dean: Because I think the sensory first

2001
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:49,400
of all, I strongly recommend people get

2002
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:49,400
this paper and read it because I thought

2003
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:49,400
it was an excellent paper and it should

2004
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:49,400
become on part of more people's reading

2005
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:49,400
lists.

2006
01:25:34,385 --> 01:26:06,411
One of the things that really speaks to

2007
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:06,411
very clearly and makes a strong case

2008
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:06,411
around is the role of sensory attention

2009
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:06,411
and bringing the concept of sensory

2010
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:06,411
attenuation into the world of predictive

2011
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:06,411
processing.

2012
01:25:50,401 --> 01:26:19,424
And I think it would be something that

2013
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:19,424
would be helpful for people to

2014
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:19,424
understand, especially if you're thinking

2015
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:19,424
that, for example and I don't forget,

2016
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:19,424
Danny, you'll know what this is.

2017
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:35,440
But one of the things that was talked

2018
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:35,440
about in this paper was the idea that if

2019
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:35,440
you believe you do not have a limb, then

2020
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:35,440
one of the things that you could do is

2021
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:35,440
come up with a way of a mirror showing

2022
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:35,440
you without that limb, even if you

2023
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:35,440
already possessed it.

2024
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:54,459
So it's reinforcing what Hector and

2025
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:54,459
Michael Andy Clark were talking about in

2026
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:54,459
terms of so how does active inference

2027
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:54,459
help us get to maybe some more plausible

2028
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:54,459
answers in prosaic ways?

2029
01:26:35,440 --> 01:27:01,460
And so the sensory attenuation piece to

2030
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:01,460
me was really valuable and tied in with

2031
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:01,460
some of the concepts we're talking about

2032
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:01,460
here.

2033
01:26:54,459 --> 01:27:12,471
Daniel: Yeah, one thought on that is

2034
01:27:12,471 --> 01:27:12,471
let's grant an effective mirror neuron or

2035
01:27:12,471 --> 01:27:12,471
recognition capacity, just spatially in

2036
01:27:12,471 --> 01:27:12,471
terms of tool usage.

2037
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:18,477
So that is not always granted with

2038
01:27:18,477 --> 01:27:18,477
eyesight and partial occlusion of the

2039
01:27:18,477 --> 01:27:18,477
working locations of tools and all of

2040
01:27:18,477 --> 01:27:18,477
this.

2041
01:27:12,471 --> 01:27:32,491
But let's just say that an observer can

2042
01:27:32,491 --> 01:27:32,491
observe somebody else doing a motor

2043
01:27:32,491 --> 01:27:32,491
behavior and entirely understands the

2044
01:27:32,491 --> 01:27:32,491
basis of that motor behavior like the

2045
01:27:32,491 --> 01:27:32,491
person does a pirouette or they write a

2046
01:27:32,491 --> 01:27:32,491
line incursive or they play violin.

2047
01:27:18,477 --> 01:27:40,499
You can have absolute understanding of

2048
01:27:40,499 --> 01:27:40,499
the mechanisms of the baseball pitcher,

2049
01:27:40,499 --> 01:27:40,499
of the hockey stick.

2050
01:27:32,491 --> 01:27:49,508
Yet there are multiple reasons from an

2051
01:27:49,508 --> 01:27:49,508
embodied and cognitive perspective why

2052
01:27:49,508 --> 01:27:49,508
the behavior cannot be copied.

2053
01:27:40,499 --> 01:27:59,518
We can all understand that there are

2054
01:27:59,518 --> 01:27:59,518
certain sport acts that are not just

2055
01:27:59,518 --> 01:27:59,518
strength limited and they're not even

2056
01:27:59,518 --> 01:27:59,518
necessarily dexterity limited that we

2057
01:27:59,518 --> 01:27:59,518
cannot do.

2058
01:27:49,508 --> 01:28:04,517
We cannot write in a language we do not

2059
01:28:04,517 --> 01:28:04,517
know by hand, even though we might have

2060
01:28:04,517 --> 01:28:04,517
the motor dexterity.

2061
01:27:59,518 --> 01:28:26,539
And so that's a semantic explanation or

2062
01:28:26,539 --> 01:28:26,539
quite simply and to call back the zone of

2063
01:28:26,539 --> 01:28:26,539
bounded surprisal an observer may observe

2064
01:28:26,539 --> 01:28:26,539
a hetero praxis, a different praxis and

2065
01:28:26,539 --> 01:28:26,539
simply, implicitly or even explicitly

2066
01:28:26,539 --> 01:28:26,539
believe that's unlikely for me to do.

2067
01:28:04,517 --> 01:28:29,542
And as it was thought, so it shall be

2068
01:28:29,542 --> 01:28:29,542
done.

2069
01:28:26,539 --> 01:28:50,563
The innovation is over and then lastly

2070
01:28:50,563 --> 01:28:50,563
and a little bit most Extrapolatively

2071
01:28:50,563 --> 01:28:50,563
previously in some work I've juxtaposed

2072
01:28:50,563 --> 01:28:50,563
Buckminster Fuller's life and work in

2073
01:28:50,563 --> 01:28:50,563
times with that of William Blake.

2074
01:28:29,542 --> 01:29:08,575
And the prompting quote from the paper

2075
01:29:08,575 --> 01:29:08,575
was above zones of bounded surprisal are

2076
01:29:08,575 --> 01:29:08,575
different from the zones of latent

2077
01:29:08,575 --> 01:29:08,575
solution in their attempt to explain the

2078
01:29:08,575 --> 01:29:08,575
lack of cumulative culture in great apes

2079
01:29:08,575 --> 01:29:08,575
on the basis that cultural complexity is

2080
01:29:08,575 --> 01:29:08,575
restricted by the limited potentials for

2081
01:29:08,575 --> 01:29:08,575
individual invention.

2082
01:28:50,563 --> 01:29:31,598
So Bucky and Blake were both tremendously

2083
01:29:31,598 --> 01:29:31,598
inventive individuals and to reflect a

2084
01:29:31,598 --> 01:29:31,598
few lines of some Blake poetry the

2085
01:29:31,598 --> 01:29:31,598
auguries of Innocence begins with to see

2086
01:29:31,598 --> 01:29:31,598
a world in a grain of sand and a heaven

2087
01:29:31,598 --> 01:29:31,598
in a wild flower hold infinity in the

2088
01:29:31,598 --> 01:29:31,598
palm of your hand and eternity in an

2089
01:29:31,598 --> 01:29:31,598
hour.

2090
01:29:08,575 --> 01:29:41,608
Those are some of the famous opening

2091
01:29:41,608 --> 01:29:41,608
lines of that poem and they speak to this

2092
01:29:41,608 --> 01:29:41,608
time representation but the closing lines

2093
01:29:41,608 --> 01:29:41,608
are less often quoted.

2094
01:29:32,599 --> 01:29:53,619
We are led to believe a lie when we see

2095
01:29:53,619 --> 01:29:53,619
not through the eye which was born in a

2096
01:29:53,619 --> 01:29:53,619
night to perish in a night when the soul

2097
01:29:53,619 --> 01:29:53,619
slept in beams of light.

2098
01:29:43,610 --> 01:29:57,624
God appears and God is light to those

2099
01:29:57,624 --> 01:29:57,624
poor souls who dwell in night.

2100
01:29:53,620 --> 01:30:02,623
But does a human form display to those

2101
01:30:02,623 --> 01:30:02,623
who dwell in realms of day?

2102
01:29:58,624 --> 01:30:06,627
And I'll let you get the word on that.

2103
01:30:03,624 --> 01:30:08,629
Dean: Well, here's the thing.

2104
01:30:07,628 --> 01:30:31,652
I want to thank again the authors who are

2105
01:30:31,652 --> 01:30:31,652
going to be joining us for the one and

2106
01:30:31,652 --> 01:30:31,652
two for allowing us to pull two of their

2107
01:30:31,652 --> 01:30:31,652
papers into proximity and allow us to

2108
01:30:31,652 --> 01:30:31,652
talk about them so proximally because we

2109
01:30:31,652 --> 01:30:31,652
I think I speak for both of us, but you

2110
01:30:31,652 --> 01:30:31,652
can correct me on this, Daniel.

2111
01:30:08,629 --> 01:31:03,678
I think with the use of active inference

2112
01:31:03,678 --> 01:31:03,678
and our continuous updating with active

2113
01:31:03,678 --> 01:31:03,678
inference as a way of strategizing are

2114
01:31:03,678 --> 01:31:03,678
coming to realize that sometimes things

2115
01:31:03,678 --> 01:31:03,678
that seem really distal and unrelated

2116
01:31:03,678 --> 01:31:03,678
when brought together, you as the person

2117
01:31:03,678 --> 01:31:03,678
who is looking at two things at once with

2118
01:31:03,678 --> 01:31:03,678
both of your eyes open tend to learn a

2119
01:31:03,678 --> 01:31:03,678
lot.

2120
01:30:31,652 --> 01:31:22,697
And so whether it's pulling Buckminster

2121
01:31:22,697 --> 01:31:22,697
Fuller and Blake into the same slide deck

2122
01:31:22,697 --> 01:31:22,697
or talking about to copy or not to copy

2123
01:31:22,697 --> 01:31:22,697
and snakes and ladders it's actually a

2124
01:31:22,697 --> 01:31:22,697
real treat to be able to bring things

2125
01:31:22,697 --> 01:31:22,697
that seem like well, conventionally.

2126
01:31:03,678 --> 01:31:26,701
That was field work and this is lab

2127
01:31:26,701 --> 01:31:26,701
work.

2128
01:31:22,697 --> 01:31:50,725
Being able to have 1ft in both of those

2129
01:31:50,725 --> 01:31:50,725
realms really helps the person who likes

2130
01:31:50,725 --> 01:31:50,725
to go back and forth who is moving from a

2131
01:31:50,725 --> 01:31:50,725
position of being really familiar with

2132
01:31:50,725 --> 01:31:50,725
the subject matter to being somebody who

2133
01:31:50,725 --> 01:31:50,725
can actually get into the predictive

2134
01:31:50,725 --> 01:31:50,725
matters because they're more comfortable

2135
01:31:50,725 --> 01:31:50,725
in doing the update thing.

2136
01:31:26,701 --> 01:31:52,727
They're not quite so stuck and bound.

2137
01:31:50,725 --> 01:32:01,730
And that means when I see ZLS and ZVS

2138
01:32:01,730 --> 01:32:01,730
beside one another makes me very, very

2139
01:32:01,730 --> 01:32:01,730
happy.

2140
01:31:53,728 --> 01:32:22,751
So that's why I wanted you to get

2141
01:32:22,751 --> 01:32:22,751
acknowledged for some of the work that

2142
01:32:22,751 --> 01:32:22,751
you've done in terms of this isn't the

2143
01:32:22,751 --> 01:32:22,751
first time that you seen an advantage in

2144
01:32:22,751 --> 01:32:22,751
bringing two things that don't seem like

2145
01:32:22,751 --> 01:32:22,751
they belong on the same table and

2146
01:32:22,751 --> 01:32:22,751
bringing them together and kind of going,

2147
01:32:22,751 --> 01:32:22,751
whoa, look what happens when you do.

2148
01:32:01,730 --> 01:32:25,754
Daniel: Great.

2149
01:32:25,754 --> 01:32:26,755
Thanks.

2150
01:32:26,755 --> 01:32:29,758
Any final comments or I'll give a final

2151
01:32:29,758 --> 01:32:29,758
thought.

2152
01:32:26,755 --> 01:32:30,759
Dean: Go for it.

2153
01:32:29,758 --> 01:32:35,764
Daniel: All right, well, I would just

2154
01:32:35,764 --> 01:32:35,764
like to echo your words.

2155
01:32:30,759 --> 01:32:48,777
We really appreciated, even, dare I say,

2156
01:32:48,777 --> 01:32:48,777
working with the authors in this zero and

2157
01:32:48,777 --> 01:32:48,777
even negative dot one, the first of its

2158
01:32:48,777 --> 01:32:48,777
kind interval.

2159
01:32:35,764 --> 01:33:02,785
These papers initially, to me at least,

2160
01:33:02,785 --> 01:33:02,785
felt like two pillowy beds of plain

2161
01:33:02,785 --> 01:33:02,785
text.

2162
01:32:50,779 --> 01:33:05,788
Can't think of any other way to say it

2163
01:33:05,788 --> 01:33:05,788
right now.

2164
01:33:03,786 --> 01:33:19,802
However, once we dug at that field site

2165
01:33:19,802 --> 01:33:19,802
and we brushed off some of those uni and

2166
01:33:19,802 --> 01:33:19,802
bifacial tools and ideas, there was just

2167
01:33:19,802 --> 01:33:19,802
more and more to find and explore.

2168
01:33:06,789 --> 01:33:27,810
So I'm very much looking forward to the

2169
01:33:27,810 --> 01:33:27,810
coming one, two, and potentially beyond.

2170
01:33:20,803 --> 01:33:29,812
And we hope you've enjoyed this.

2171
01:33:28,811 --> 01:33:31,814
53.0.

2172
01:33:29,812 --> 01:33:33,816
Dean: Thanks, Daniel.

2173
01:33:32,815 --> 01:33:34,817
Daniel: All right.

2174
01:33:33,816 --> 01:33:34,817
Thank you.

2175
01:33:34,817 --> 01:33:35,818
