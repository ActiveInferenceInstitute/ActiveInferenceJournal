1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,002
Daniel: Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:07,603 --> 00:00:16,742
It's March 23, 2023, and we're here in

3
00:00:16,742 --> 00:00:16,742
ActInf Livestream 53.1.

4
00:00:09,017 --> 00:00:19,066
Welcome to the active inference

5
00:00:19,066 --> 00:00:19,066
institute.

6
00:00:17,811 --> 00:00:27,800
We're a participatory online institute

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:27,800
that is communicating, learning, and

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:27,800
practicing applied active inference.

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:33,480
This is a recorded and an archived live

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:33,480
stream, so please provide us with

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:33,480
feedback so we can improve our work.

12
00:00:27,834 --> 00:00:40,187
All backgrounds and perspectives are

13
00:00:40,187 --> 00:00:40,187
welcome and we'll be following video

14
00:00:40,187 --> 00:00:40,187
etiquette for live streams.

15
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:49,996
Head over to Active Inference.org to

16
00:00:49,996 --> 00:00:49,996
learn more about the institute and

17
00:00:49,996 --> 00:00:49,996
learning groups and projects.

18
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:58,928
We're here in Active Stream 53.1 and we

19
00:00:58,928 --> 00:00:58,928
are discussing a dyad of papers.

20
00:00:50,166 --> 00:01:05,085
We are discussing Snakes and Ladders in

21
00:01:05,085 --> 00:01:05,085
Paleoanthropology by Hector, Karl and

22
00:01:05,085 --> 00:01:05,085
Michael.

23
00:00:58,945 --> 00:01:07,220
Welcome, Karl.

24
00:01:05,094 --> 00:01:12,790
And we're discussing to copy or not to

25
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:12,790
copy with Hector and Michael.

26
00:01:07,235 --> 00:01:21,618
Previously in 53.0, we, dean and I

27
00:01:21,618 --> 00:01:21,618
provided some background and context on

28
00:01:21,618 --> 00:01:21,618
these papers.

29
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:26,185
And today in 53.1 1st, we will all say

30
00:01:26,185 --> 00:01:26,185
hello.

31
00:01:21,634 --> 00:01:31,661
Then we will feature a presentation by

32
00:01:31,661 --> 00:01:31,661
Michael Walker.

33
00:01:27,238 --> 00:01:36,120
And following the presentation, we'll

34
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,120
have a discussion and see where it goes.

35
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:40,555
So with no further ado, we will all say

36
00:01:40,555 --> 00:01:40,555
hello.

37
00:01:36,134 --> 00:01:47,020
The non authors first, then the authors

38
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,020
concluding with Michael and leading into

39
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,020
the presentation.

40
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:56,115
So I'm Daniel, I'm a researcher in

41
00:01:56,115 --> 00:01:56,115
California, and it was a great fun and

42
00:01:56,115 --> 00:01:56,115
learning experience to work on the dot

43
00:01:56,115 --> 00:01:56,115
zero.

44
00:01:47,022 --> 00:02:02,116
So I'm really excited to continue in the

45
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:02,116
dot one today to Dean.

46
00:01:56,116 --> 00:02:04,133
Dean: Thanks, Daniel.

47
00:02:03,126 --> 00:02:04,137
I'm Dean.

48
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:06,150
I'm here in Calgary.

49
00:02:04,137 --> 00:02:12,218
I guess the only thing I want to just

50
00:02:12,218 --> 00:02:12,218
highlight today is the fact that it's

51
00:02:12,218 --> 00:02:12,218
32323.

52
00:02:07,165 --> 00:02:19,282
And I love that bouncing back and forth

53
00:02:19,282 --> 00:02:19,282
between those two quantities.

54
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:21,300
So I'm really excited.

55
00:02:19,283 --> 00:02:24,333
And I will pass this to Hector.

56
00:02:21,302 --> 00:02:26,352
Hector: Okay.

57
00:02:25,348 --> 00:02:31,402
Hello, I'm Hector Manrique, and I will

58
00:02:31,402 --> 00:02:31,402
just summarize what brought me here.

59
00:02:26,352 --> 00:02:33,423
Basically, I graduated in psychology.

60
00:02:31,403 --> 00:02:38,471
That was in Spain, and then I did my PhD

61
00:02:38,471 --> 00:02:38,471
in psychobiology.

62
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:42,511
So I came to learn the biological basis

63
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:42,511
of behavior.

64
00:02:38,471 --> 00:02:45,546
Then I recycled into a comparative

65
00:02:45,546 --> 00:02:45,546
psychology.

66
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:55,646
When I joined the Max Planck Institute

67
00:02:55,646 --> 00:02:55,646
for Evolutionary Anthropology in

68
00:02:55,646 --> 00:02:55,646
Lepstick, I was lucky that I could work

69
00:02:55,646 --> 00:02:55,646
with Joseph Kai under his supervision.

70
00:02:45,547 --> 00:03:00,631
And then I had the opportunity to work

71
00:03:00,631 --> 00:03:00,631
with the four species of grade eight.

72
00:02:55,647 --> 00:03:05,688
And after that, I came to know Michael in

73
00:03:05,688 --> 00:03:05,688
a conference on human evolution.

74
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:08,712
And we have been working together ever

75
00:03:08,712 --> 00:03:08,712
since.

76
00:03:05,688 --> 00:03:11,745
So we are now good friends and also

77
00:03:11,745 --> 00:03:11,745
colleagues.

78
00:03:08,712 --> 00:03:13,762
And that's it, basically.

79
00:03:11,746 --> 00:03:20,836
Daniel: Thank you, Hector and Karl, if

80
00:03:20,836 --> 00:03:20,836
you'd like to say hello, please.

81
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:23,861
Karl: So, my name is Karl Friston.

82
00:03:21,844 --> 00:03:36,993
I'm a professor of neuroscience at

83
00:03:36,993 --> 00:03:36,993
University College London and a colleague

84
00:03:36,993 --> 00:03:36,993
of our main speakers today, who I've

85
00:03:36,993 --> 00:03:36,993
never seen in person, but now at least I

86
00:03:36,993 --> 00:03:36,993
have seen you, virtually.

87
00:03:23,862 --> 00:03:37,008
They're very nice to meet you.

88
00:03:36,993 --> 00:03:39,027
Daniel: Great.

89
00:03:39,023 --> 00:03:41,040
Thank you, Karl.

90
00:03:39,028 --> 00:03:43,067
Michael, the floor is yours.

91
00:03:41,045 --> 00:03:52,156
Michael: Michael, I'm very pleased to say

92
00:03:52,156 --> 00:03:52,156
hello to Karl, whom I've not yet met

93
00:03:52,156 --> 00:03:52,156
personally, but we are now meeting

94
00:03:52,156 --> 00:03:52,156
visually, virtually.

95
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:57,205
I'm a retired professor at the University

96
00:03:57,205 --> 00:03:57,205
of Murphy in Spain.

97
00:03:54,169 --> 00:04:01,187
I'm getting rather ancient I shall be 82

98
00:04:01,187 --> 00:04:01,187
years old tomorrow.

99
00:03:58,212 --> 00:04:08,251
But anyway, that doesn't stop me from

100
00:04:08,251 --> 00:04:08,251
digging up Neanderthal skeletons and even

101
00:04:08,251 --> 00:04:08,251
earlier things here in Spain.

102
00:04:01,188 --> 00:04:11,288
I'm very pleased to be presenting this.

103
00:04:08,257 --> 00:04:18,351
It's a case of the dog that didn't bark

104
00:04:18,351 --> 00:04:18,351
in the night.

105
00:04:12,296 --> 00:04:24,419
So whenever you want me to begin, I can

106
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:24,419
begin.

107
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:31,479
Daniel: Daniel yes, the slide is up and

108
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:31,479
it is all you.

109
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:38,554
Michael: Well, this is really a paper

110
00:04:38,554 --> 00:04:38,554
which we have out on syrup in an earlier

111
00:04:38,554 --> 00:04:38,554
version.

112
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:44,613
It's now been modified for a different

113
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:44,613
journal to the one that was originally

114
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:44,613
intended.

115
00:04:38,555 --> 00:04:53,704
But the presentation is in order to make

116
00:04:53,704 --> 00:04:53,704
a complicated subject fairly simple to

117
00:04:53,704 --> 00:04:53,704
comprehend.

118
00:04:44,615 --> 00:05:06,773
I call it Snakes and Ladders because

119
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:06,773
stuff appears, disappears and reappears

120
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:06,773
throughout human evolution over the past

121
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:06,773
at least 2 million years, if not before.

122
00:04:55,722 --> 00:05:11,825
And the question is, why is there not a

123
00:05:11,825 --> 00:05:11,825
continuous trajectory?

124
00:05:06,775 --> 00:05:12,836
Let's move on to the next one.

125
00:05:11,825 --> 00:05:15,863
Daniel right.

126
00:05:12,836 --> 00:05:25,962
The traditional view is the received

127
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:25,962
wisdom is looking at what

128
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:25,962
paleoanthropology can tell us from the

129
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:25,962
outside.

130
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:44,150
And there are two basic methodologies,

131
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,150
one based on geology and Darwinism, which

132
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,150
gives us one view of what it is all about

133
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,150
and another view down on the bottom right

134
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,150
is all based on what modern people do and

135
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,150
what modern apes do.

136
00:05:25,964 --> 00:05:47,184
And it's all by so called analogy.

137
00:05:44,151 --> 00:05:49,204
Let's move on to the next one.

138
00:05:47,185 --> 00:05:54,249
Both of these have drawbacks.

139
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,266
I won't go into this in detail.

140
00:05:54,251 --> 00:06:08,330
You're welcome to take these slides away

141
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:08,330
provided you don't publish them because

142
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:08,330
they do include some material drawn from

143
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:08,330
other sources which I haven't

144
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:08,330
acknowledged formally.

145
00:05:55,267 --> 00:06:18,431
But the drawbacks to Darwinism is really

146
00:06:18,431 --> 00:06:18,431
the difficulty of being able to prove

147
00:06:18,431 --> 00:06:18,431
anything in the past by in its own

148
00:06:18,431 --> 00:06:18,431
terms.

149
00:06:08,332 --> 00:06:25,507
Okay, we can accept it as being a valid

150
00:06:25,507 --> 00:06:25,507
way of explaining natural phenomena and

151
00:06:25,507 --> 00:06:25,507
evolution.

152
00:06:19,442 --> 00:06:49,741
The drawback to using modern analogies is

153
00:06:49,741 --> 00:06:49,741
the spatiotemporal incompetence,

154
00:06:49,741 --> 00:06:49,741
incommensurability with regard to the

155
00:06:49,741 --> 00:06:49,741
regular irregularities and irregular

156
00:06:49,741 --> 00:06:49,741
regularities of which things appear,

157
00:06:49,741 --> 00:06:49,741
disappear and reappear throughout the

158
00:06:49,741 --> 00:06:49,741
Pleistocene record and indeed prehistory

159
00:06:49,741 --> 00:06:49,741
in general.

160
00:06:25,508 --> 00:06:50,757
Let's move on to the next one.

161
00:06:49,741 --> 00:06:54,798
So instead of looking at it from the

162
00:06:54,798 --> 00:06:54,798
outside, let's look at it from the

163
00:06:54,798 --> 00:06:54,798
inside.

164
00:06:50,758 --> 00:07:14,930
And this has an advantage of

165
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:14,930
commensurability and compatibility at the

166
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:14,930
same time with the gradual evolution of

167
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:14,930
and within species by natural selection

168
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:14,930
and at the same time with the documented

169
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:14,930
behavior of organis hormone.

170
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:18,972
Well, this is from Karl's and his

171
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:18,972
colleagues latest book.

172
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:19,983
I'm sure you all know it.

173
00:07:18,973 --> 00:07:21,000
So let's move on to the next one.

174
00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:24,037
Right.

175
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:42,214
In the 1960s, some archaeologists were

176
00:07:42,214 --> 00:07:42,214
certainly reflecting, including some

177
00:07:42,214 --> 00:07:42,214
Cambridge friends of mine, on the

178
00:07:42,214 --> 00:07:42,214
ostensive presence of irregular

179
00:07:42,214 --> 00:07:42,214
regularities and regular irregularities

180
00:07:42,214 --> 00:07:42,214
in the archaeological record.

181
00:07:25,043 --> 00:07:44,239
And a well known one is the Case of the

182
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:44,239
Wheel.

183
00:07:42,215 --> 00:07:52,311
Wheels were used for action in Central

184
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:52,311
Asia and the Middle East from about 5000

185
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:52,311
years ago.

186
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:57,368
They were invented separately in

187
00:07:57,368 --> 00:07:57,368
Mesoamerica just over 2000 years ago.

188
00:07:52,312 --> 00:08:05,387
They weren't used for any kind of

189
00:08:05,387 --> 00:08:05,387
practical purpose, but just for moving

190
00:08:05,387 --> 00:08:05,387
effigies statues and toys around.

191
00:07:57,369 --> 00:08:09,429
And this seems to have been completely

192
00:08:09,429 --> 00:08:09,429
independent inventions.

193
00:08:06,392 --> 00:08:20,530
Okay, so let's say that surprising

194
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:20,530
enactment with stuff was the exception in

195
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:20,530
early humans.

196
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:25,581
Just see if I can I'm getting a little

197
00:08:25,581 --> 00:08:25,581
bit tied up with two screens here because

198
00:08:25,581 --> 00:08:25,581
I'm working on my own screen.

199
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:44,769
At the same time, cognitive surprises

200
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:44,769
were probably disregarded in general

201
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:44,769
because surprising spontaneous enactment

202
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:44,769
with stuff distracted attention away from

203
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:44,769
daily routines.

204
00:08:25,581 --> 00:08:59,924
If we go back 2 million years ago, when

205
00:08:59,924 --> 00:08:59,924
homophobic appears from the earlier

206
00:08:59,924 --> 00:08:59,924
bipedal humans or human ancestors, we

207
00:08:59,924 --> 00:08:59,924
begin to see the establishment of the

208
00:08:59,924 --> 00:08:59,924
Guinness homo, especially in Africa.

209
00:08:45,780 --> 00:09:20,071
And I'm sure that spontaneous enactment

210
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:20,071
with stuff certainly occurred innumerable

211
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:20,071
times without gaining any foothold as

212
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:20,071
technological or cultural, if you like,

213
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:20,071
communal behavioral traditions passed

214
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:20,071
down for generation generation, because

215
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:20,071
this is unlikely.

216
00:09:00,876 --> 00:09:27,142
If we take a period, let's say, from 2

217
00:09:27,142 --> 00:09:27,142
million years ago, even one, even to half

218
00:09:27,142 --> 00:09:27,142
a million years ago, that's one and a

219
00:09:27,142 --> 00:09:27,142
half million years.

220
00:09:20,072 --> 00:09:29,162
That's 60,000 generations.

221
00:09:27,143 --> 00:09:39,262
If you consider one generation as lasting

222
00:09:39,262 --> 00:09:39,262
25 years, most unlikely that things could

223
00:09:39,262 --> 00:09:39,262
be handed down on father the son over

224
00:09:39,262 --> 00:09:39,262
60,000 generations.

225
00:09:29,163 --> 00:09:42,292
So let's take a different take on this.

226
00:09:39,267 --> 00:09:50,376
Let's go back to looking at it from the

227
00:09:50,376 --> 00:09:50,376
inside, from considerations of the free

228
00:09:50,376 --> 00:09:50,376
energy principle and active inference.

229
00:09:42,293 --> 00:10:11,523
It follows that active inference

230
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:11,523
underpins biological behavior that has

231
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:11,523
exploratory or epistemic and exploitative

232
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:11,523
or pragmatic aspects sensitive

233
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:11,523
respectively to ambiguity and risk

234
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:11,523
enabling epistemic and ambiguity

235
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:11,523
resolving responses to support pragmatic,

236
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:11,523
reward seeking ones.

237
00:09:51,382 --> 00:10:55,968
And therefore it is not implausible that

238
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:55,968
the snakes and ladders appearance,

239
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:55,968
disappearance and reappearance of stuff

240
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:55,968
over, let's say, the past 2 million

241
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:55,968
years, is the existence of organis owe to

242
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:55,968
no more than the extreme rarity with

243
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:55,968
which unorthodox epistemic exploration of

244
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:55,968
possibly advantageous opportunities in

245
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:55,968
the human influence resulted from

246
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:55,968
incipient, albeit imperceptibly, evolving

247
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:55,968
neurobiological propensities in brains or

248
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:55,968
hierarchical mechanistic minds to

249
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:55,968
generate exploitative pragmatic attention

250
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:55,968
via active inference to cognitive

251
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:55,968
surprises from untoward behavioral

252
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:55,968
incidents which weren't expressed more

253
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:55,968
onto the next one.

254
00:10:11,524 --> 00:10:58,995
So let's forget about let's move on to

255
00:10:58,995 --> 00:10:58,995
the next one.

256
00:10:55,969 --> 00:11:00,956
Daniel, let's forget about this.

257
00:10:58,995 --> 00:11:03,982
How do I get from here to there?

258
00:11:01,964 --> 00:11:08,034
How do I get from a lump of rock to,

259
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:08,034
let's say, a hand axe by spontaneous

260
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:08,034
inactive?

261
00:11:03,982 --> 00:11:09,048
What could provoke this?

262
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:11,064
Okay, let's move on.

263
00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:12,076
Next slide.

264
00:11:11,065 --> 00:11:16,115
I excavated a site.

265
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:17,123
I am excavating.

266
00:11:16,115 --> 00:11:25,200
The site almost a million years old,

267
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,200
which has one hand axe remains of burning

268
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,200
lots of small stone tools.

269
00:11:17,124 --> 00:11:31,264
You can see some burnt ones on the bottom

270
00:11:31,264 --> 00:11:31,264
left, but then this is the dog that

271
00:11:31,264 --> 00:11:31,264
didn't bark.

272
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:34,297
Why are there no more hand axe?

273
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:42,375
Why do we only have one big lodge

274
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:42,375
bifacially shaped cutting tool, the hand

275
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:42,375
axe and hundreds of tiny little tools?

276
00:11:34,298 --> 00:11:44,397
People don't ask that question.

277
00:11:42,377 --> 00:11:46,415
Let's move on to the next one.

278
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,429
They explain it away.

279
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:55,501
People really didn't bother with cutting

280
00:11:55,501 --> 00:11:55,501
up big animals.

281
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:56,518
They didn't need big cutting tools.

282
00:11:55,501 --> 00:11:59,547
Well, that's one way of looking at it.

283
00:11:57,524 --> 00:12:00,499
Prove it.

284
00:11:59,548 --> 00:12:06,552
People lost stuff and so there should be

285
00:12:06,552 --> 00:12:06,552
more of these around.

286
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:07,567
But there's only one.

287
00:12:06,554 --> 00:12:13,620
Well, prove that there's only one because

288
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:13,620
people took them away and used them

289
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:13,620
elsewhere.

290
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:14,630
Move that.

291
00:12:13,621 --> 00:12:20,695
The problem is these so called

292
00:12:20,695 --> 00:12:20,695
interpretations only explain stuff away.

293
00:12:14,631 --> 00:12:23,721
Could it well have been a Valentine gift

294
00:12:23,721 --> 00:12:23,721
or not?

295
00:12:20,696 --> 00:12:24,732
Next slide.

296
00:12:23,722 --> 00:12:29,788
So let's get back to Snakes and Ladders.

297
00:12:25,748 --> 00:12:35,844
We have fire at the site there agent too

298
00:12:35,844 --> 00:12:35,844
many sites with fire either.

299
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:47,969
And again, the general assumption is that

300
00:12:47,969 --> 00:12:47,969
there was continuity once trouble with

301
00:12:47,969 --> 00:12:47,969
moving my other screen.

302
00:12:35,845 --> 00:12:48,978
Just a moment.

303
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:51,003
How can I move this on?

304
00:12:49,989 --> 00:12:52,018
Excuse me a moment.

305
00:12:51,005 --> 00:12:56,054
My eyesight isn't all that good these

306
00:12:56,054 --> 00:12:56,054
days.

307
00:12:53,028 --> 00:12:58,078
No, that's not doing it.

308
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:01,046
Excuse me 1 minute.

309
00:12:59,088 --> 00:13:07,101
It's not bad.

310
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:21,247
So we have the file, as I just mentioned

311
00:13:21,247 --> 00:13:21,247
and I don't believe that suddenly fire

312
00:13:21,247 --> 00:13:21,247
was brought to humans or invented and

313
00:13:21,247 --> 00:13:21,247
then passed on from father to son.

314
00:13:07,109 --> 00:13:30,334
Nor do I believe, as we'll see in the

315
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:30,334
next slide, that this was done along with

316
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:30,334
an expansion can we have the next one,

317
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:30,334
Daniel, please?

318
00:13:22,253 --> 00:13:40,433
Of these early Homo erectus moving from

319
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:40,433
Africa outwards, carrying a hand axe,

320
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:40,433
carrying little embers and spreading the

321
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:40,433
good news.

322
00:13:31,342 --> 00:13:41,449
No, next slide.

323
00:13:40,434 --> 00:13:43,467
Don't think it worked like that.

324
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:48,516
Stuff couldn't have been passed on over

325
00:13:48,516 --> 00:13:48,516
all that period of time, over all that

326
00:13:48,516 --> 00:13:48,516
space.

327
00:13:43,468 --> 00:13:53,568
This is not commensurable with modern

328
00:13:53,568 --> 00:13:53,568
human or modern ape behavior.

329
00:13:48,518 --> 00:13:56,590
Let's move on to the next one, Daniel.

330
00:13:54,572 --> 00:13:57,602
So how do we begin?

331
00:13:56,592 --> 00:14:00,576
We begin by bashing stone enactment with

332
00:14:00,576 --> 00:14:00,576
stuff.

333
00:13:57,602 --> 00:14:03,601
And that started over 3 million years

334
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:03,601
ago.

335
00:14:00,577 --> 00:14:03,608
We know that.

336
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:05,625
Next one, please.

337
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:21,786
And then we have another problem, which

338
00:14:21,786 --> 00:14:21,786
is that there is almost exponential

339
00:14:21,786 --> 00:14:21,786
increase in stuff, artifacts made by

340
00:14:21,786 --> 00:14:21,786
people, and yet the brain, as we know

341
00:14:21,786 --> 00:14:21,786
from fossil evidence, does not follow

342
00:14:21,786 --> 00:14:21,786
that trajectory, which is the red one.

343
00:14:07,645 --> 00:14:31,888
The brain increases and gradually

344
00:14:31,888 --> 00:14:31,888
flattens out at the same time as the

345
00:14:31,888 --> 00:14:31,888
number of stuff that people make

346
00:14:31,888 --> 00:14:31,888
increases or almost exponentially.

347
00:14:21,787 --> 00:14:33,901
Let's have the next one.

348
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:36,933
So here we have another problem to try

349
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:36,933
and solve.

350
00:14:33,902 --> 00:15:04,158
And one possibility which was pointed out

351
00:15:04,158 --> 00:15:04,158
by the late Professor Philip Tobias is

352
00:15:04,158 --> 00:15:04,158
that as the brain increases, we see in

353
00:15:04,158 --> 00:15:04,158
the Paleoanthropological record an

354
00:15:04,158 --> 00:15:04,158
increase in the variation in the volume

355
00:15:04,158 --> 00:15:04,158
of the brain, suggesting perhaps that

356
00:15:04,158 --> 00:15:04,158
there is some relaxation of selection

357
00:15:04,158 --> 00:15:04,158
pressure as Homo evolved.

358
00:14:40,971 --> 00:15:08,198
And we have the next that's a point which

359
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:08,198
is worth bearing in mind.

360
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:16,272
So let's think about another way of how

361
00:15:16,272 --> 00:15:16,272
all this may or may not have happened.

362
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:30,418
A methodological perspective grounded in

363
00:15:30,418 --> 00:15:30,418
fundamental biological and physical

364
00:15:30,418 --> 00:15:30,418
relationships gives us a postimonious

365
00:15:30,418 --> 00:15:30,418
prosaic deflationary account.

366
00:15:19,307 --> 00:15:37,485
All these appearances, disappearances and

367
00:15:37,485 --> 00:15:37,485
reappearances of behavior outcomes and so

368
00:15:37,485 --> 00:15:37,485
called skills.

369
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:48,595
Now, Professor Nicholas Timbergen, who

370
00:15:48,595 --> 00:15:48,595
was a professor of zoology at Oxford and

371
00:15:48,595 --> 00:15:48,595
got a Nobel Prize, was fascinated with

372
00:15:48,595 --> 00:15:48,595
four questions.

373
00:15:37,487 --> 00:15:51,619
Let's have the next slide and see what

374
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:51,619
those are.

375
00:15:48,596 --> 00:16:08,733
He wanted to know how we can relate

376
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:08,733
evolution at four different levels that

377
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:08,733
of ontogeny and that of the mechanisms,

378
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:08,733
the causation, that of phylogeny and that

379
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:08,733
of adaptation or survival value.

380
00:15:51,620 --> 00:16:29,940
And these are related diacronically and

381
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:29,940
synchronically, as one can see from this

382
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:29,940
little diagram into also what might call

383
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:29,940
proximate and ultimate explanatory

384
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:29,940
approaches if we look at the problem in

385
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:29,940
hand.

386
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:30,957
Let's have the next slide, Daniel.

387
00:16:29,941 --> 00:16:43,084
We can see that here we have in the

388
00:16:43,084 --> 00:16:43,084
diatronic aspects paleolithic behavior in

389
00:16:43,084 --> 00:16:43,084
general in the synchronic one stuff

390
00:16:43,084 --> 00:16:43,084
appearing at different times in the top

391
00:16:43,084 --> 00:16:43,084
right.

392
00:16:31,966 --> 00:17:08,272
As far as ontogeny is concerned, we have

393
00:17:08,272 --> 00:17:08,272
something which I'll mention later on,

394
00:17:08,272 --> 00:17:08,272
but we need to make a big deal of it that

395
00:17:08,272 --> 00:17:08,272
we know that there was a lack of

396
00:17:08,272 --> 00:17:08,272
adolescent growth split and a relatively

397
00:17:08,272 --> 00:17:08,272
small brain in Homo erectus one and a

398
00:17:08,272 --> 00:17:08,272
half million years ago compared with

399
00:17:08,272 --> 00:17:08,272
ours, about two thirds the size of ours.

400
00:16:43,088 --> 00:17:14,334
When we think of mechanisms here we come

401
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:14,334
to looking at it from the inside.

402
00:17:10,294 --> 00:17:20,397
We have the matter of awareness involving

403
00:17:20,397 --> 00:17:20,397
active inference, MathStream, flea energy

404
00:17:20,397 --> 00:17:20,397
principle and variation of flea energy.

405
00:17:14,336 --> 00:17:33,523
And we have what happens at the

406
00:17:33,523 --> 00:17:33,523
neurophysiological level allowing a

407
00:17:33,523 --> 00:17:33,523
complexity of behavior between hand and

408
00:17:33,523 --> 00:17:33,523
stuff, hand and stone in this case, or

409
00:17:33,523 --> 00:17:33,523
stones.

410
00:17:20,398 --> 00:17:44,631
We have to involve matters such as

411
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:44,631
working memory, long term memory,

412
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:44,631
perspective memory and indeed

413
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:44,631
constructive memory.

414
00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:46,658
So how does all this tie into Phylogen?

415
00:17:44,632 --> 00:18:00,731
Here we have a Snakes and Ladder model

416
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:00,731
based on the empirical evidence from the

417
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:00,731
past and we have survival value that

418
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:00,731
clearly existed because Homo erectus

419
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:00,731
eventually gave rise to us.

420
00:17:47,668 --> 00:18:01,744
Next slide please.

421
00:18:00,732 --> 00:18:05,782
So let's get back to Snakes and Ladders.

422
00:18:02,757 --> 00:18:09,824
Here we have the man looking at the lock

423
00:18:09,824 --> 00:18:09,824
and saying how the hell do I get this

424
00:18:09,824 --> 00:18:09,824
handax out of it?

425
00:18:05,782 --> 00:18:10,836
And now the next one.

426
00:18:09,825 --> 00:18:19,927
And in the same way with the next slide

427
00:18:19,927 --> 00:18:19,927
we have the Snakes and Ladders, a game of

428
00:18:19,927 --> 00:18:19,927
pure chance and of random outcomes.

429
00:18:10,836 --> 00:18:23,960
But next slide please.

430
00:18:19,928 --> 00:18:26,999
We are not dealing with completely random

431
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:26,999
outcomes.

432
00:18:23,961 --> 00:18:47,020
There's a big difference between, on the

433
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,020
one hand, a spatiotemporal Snakes and

434
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,020
Ladders game of chance as if throws of a

435
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,020
dice alone thought about appearances,

436
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,020
disappearances and reappearances

437
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,020
behavioral phenomena unrelated to

438
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,020
responses of the hierarchical mechanistic

439
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,020
minds of earlier homo and on the other

440
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,020
hand a snakes.

441
00:18:27,000 --> 00:19:08,035
And that is analogy for regular

442
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:08,035
irregularities and irregular regularities

443
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:08,035
in the behavioral record owing to

444
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:08,035
individual idiosyncratic or an orthodox

445
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:08,035
activity and the receptivity to it or not

446
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:08,035
of an observing hierarchical mechanistic

447
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:08,035
mind, whether that's an onlooker, a

448
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:08,035
bystander or that even the self same man

449
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:08,035
making the woman making the hand axe in

450
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:08,035
this case.

451
00:18:47,020 --> 00:19:10,037
Okay, let's move on to the next one.

452
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:29,056
And here we begin to see that the

453
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:29,056
heterogeneous composition of a picture of

454
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:29,056
appearances by chance alone,

455
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:29,056
disappearances by chance alone,

456
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:29,056
reappearances by chance alone renders it

457
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:29,056
useless as a model for making predictions

458
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:29,056
that can be compared or contrasted with

459
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:29,056
archaeological findings of early paradigm

460
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:29,056
science.

461
00:19:10,037 --> 00:19:51,078
Whereas our preferred model, by focusing

462
00:19:51,078 --> 00:19:51,078
on the information, theoretic and

463
00:19:51,078 --> 00:19:51,078
energetic constraints on biological

464
00:19:51,078 --> 00:19:51,078
neurobiological and psychosocial

465
00:19:51,078 --> 00:19:51,078
evolution, affords us a picture that lets

466
00:19:51,078 --> 00:19:51,078
us consider whether the model's focus

467
00:19:51,078 --> 00:19:51,078
could offer a rational interpretation of

468
00:19:51,078 --> 00:19:51,078
the material record.

469
00:19:30,056 --> 00:20:01,082
And in particular of the uneven

470
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:01,082
distribution across the old world things

471
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:01,082
like Stonehand axes and evidence of the

472
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:01,082
tending of fire or even visiting caves.

473
00:19:51,078 --> 00:20:03,084
Things that chimpanzees and gorillas

474
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:03,084
don't do.

475
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:08,089
Between 2 million and let's say 200,000

476
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:08,089
in this case, 80,000 generations.

477
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:10,091
Okay, let's move on very quickly.

478
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:22,103
And the rest of it in fact, you're

479
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:22,103
welcome to read for yourselves rather

480
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:22,103
than have me read it out to you because

481
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:22,103
basically you can take this away or copy

482
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:22,103
it or download it.

483
00:20:10,091 --> 00:20:50,131
What we are arguing is that by about a

484
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:50,131
million years ago adaptive evolution was

485
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:50,131
underway of cerebral human

486
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:50,131
neurobiological propensities that support

487
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:50,131
prospective and constructive memory in

488
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:50,131
making artifacts or working with stuff,

489
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:50,131
doing unusual unorthodox things together

490
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:50,131
with short term working memory including

491
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:50,131
that of the hands haptic working memory,

492
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:50,131
long term working memory and long term

493
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:50,131
procedural and episodic memory.

494
00:20:22,103 --> 00:21:04,139
Those propensities were phylogenetic

495
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:04,139
outcomes of existential ontogenetic

496
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:04,139
programs adapted through natural

497
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:04,139
selection for satisfying the bioenergetic

498
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:04,139
requirements of organisms, organis in

499
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:04,139
particular.

500
00:20:50,131 --> 00:21:18,153
So here we have the basis of our argument

501
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:18,153
that in a small band of communicatively

502
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:18,153
challenged Homo erectus one member

503
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:18,153
spontaneous enactment often went

504
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:18,153
unregarded.

505
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:30,165
Disregarded it was regarded as useless,

506
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:30,165
pointless and unhelpful to gathering the

507
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:30,165
food requirements needed for surviving

508
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:30,165
from day to day.

509
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:53,188
And we can refer the matter to the free

510
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:53,188
energy principle applied to ecological

511
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:53,188
niche construction variation on

512
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:53,188
neuroethology, to use Professor Fisson's

513
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:53,188
phrase, whereby selection of adaptive

514
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:53,188
action volcanisms involves their

515
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:53,188
assessment of the alternatives in terms

516
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:53,188
of the expected variation of free energy

517
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:53,188
expressed as the combination of epistemic

518
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:53,188
and pragmatic affordance.

519
00:21:30,165 --> 00:22:10,199
So these early individuals a million and

520
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:10,199
a half years ago, who experienced

521
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:10,199
cognitive surprises, to say prediction

522
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:10,199
errors about effective variation of the

523
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:10,199
energy, were unlikely to introduce novel

524
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:10,199
behavior, whether affected or seen by

525
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:10,199
them, that could gain.

526
00:21:54,188 --> 00:22:30,219
A foothold in their community before

527
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:30,219
those communicative skills had developed

528
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:30,219
in some groups that widened their social

529
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:30,219
scope for active influence and involved

530
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:30,219
by natural selection within a shared

531
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:30,219
framework of adaptive prior beliefs

532
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:30,219
favoring alignment of common expectations

533
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:30,219
and joint activities that affected their

534
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:30,219
ecological niche.

535
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:32,221
Well, that's the basis of our argument.

536
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:34,223
Of course.

537
00:22:33,222 --> 00:22:42,231
It's no more, as it were, falsifiable or

538
00:22:42,231 --> 00:22:42,231
refutable within the terms of the data

539
00:22:42,231 --> 00:22:42,231
from the past than the alternatives that

540
00:22:42,231 --> 00:22:42,231
I began with.

541
00:22:34,223 --> 00:22:55,243
But at least it makes rational, coherent

542
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:55,243
sense and fits in with the Darwinist view

543
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:55,243
of evolution of species and within

544
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:55,243
species by natural selection.

545
00:22:42,231 --> 00:23:06,249
It is a more prosaic and deflationary

546
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:06,249
argument than the ones that people,

547
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:06,249
archaeologists and anthropologists like

548
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:06,249
to use and which I began with.

549
00:22:55,244 --> 00:23:11,254
So you can take this away and read it,

550
00:23:11,254 --> 00:23:11,254
read it carefully.

551
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:20,263
What we're arguing is that by a million

552
00:23:20,263 --> 00:23:20,263
years ago sorry, can you move on Daniel.

553
00:23:11,254 --> 00:23:27,270
And again so let's just stick with this.

554
00:23:21,264 --> 00:23:35,278
I think we can go through this rather

555
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:35,278
quickly, move on to the next one.

556
00:23:32,275 --> 00:23:40,283
Right, let's go back to a million and a

557
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:40,283
half years ago.

558
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,284
Let's look at this stuff.

559
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:52,295
We know there's a skeleton about a kid

560
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:52,295
only nine years old, according to

561
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:52,295
Professor Christopher, dean of University

562
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:52,295
College, professor of Dental Anatomy and

563
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:52,295
he studied the teeth.

564
00:23:41,284 --> 00:24:03,300
And whilst at one time this individual

565
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:03,300
had the same height as myself, I'm about

566
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:03,300
short about 1 meter 57.

567
00:23:52,295 --> 00:24:13,310
Nevertheless, although he had our adult

568
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:13,310
size, he was only a child at nine years

569
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:13,310
old and his skull had almost certainly

570
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:13,310
stopped growing.

571
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:15,312
It was only two thirds or less than the

572
00:24:15,312 --> 00:24:15,312
size of ours.

573
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:24,321
But these people were clearly making hand

574
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:24,321
axes and lighting fires or at least

575
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:24,321
carrying fire around from time to time

576
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:24,321
and visiting caves.

577
00:24:15,312 --> 00:24:41,338
We know there was one in South Africa

578
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:41,338
bonded Cave and doing stuff that is sort

579
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:41,338
of halfway between what a chimp does and

580
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:41,338
what our modern primitive peoples are

581
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:41,338
supposed to have been able to do, let's

582
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:41,338
say 10,000 or 20,000 years ago during the

583
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:41,338
last ice age.

584
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:43,340
But there's a big time difference here.

585
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:49,346
And when we think about this kid, clearly

586
00:24:49,346 --> 00:24:49,346
he was developing much sooner than we

587
00:24:49,346 --> 00:24:49,346
do.

588
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:57,354
He became an adult probably before the

589
00:24:57,354 --> 00:24:57,354
age of 15 years old whereas our brains

590
00:24:57,354 --> 00:24:57,354
are not fully formed for at least another

591
00:24:57,354 --> 00:24:57,354
ten years.

592
00:24:49,346 --> 00:25:00,351
So this would have limited have the next

593
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:00,351
slide.

594
00:24:57,354 --> 00:25:02,353
You can take these away and look at

595
00:25:02,353 --> 00:25:02,353
them.

596
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:05,356
I don't have to read all this out in

597
00:25:05,356 --> 00:25:05,356
detail to you.

598
00:25:02,353 --> 00:25:15,366
But in short, these people were

599
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:15,366
precociously developed and therefore much

600
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:15,366
more limited.

601
00:25:05,356 --> 00:25:26,377
They would be behavior, perhaps more

602
00:25:26,377 --> 00:25:26,377
like, let's say, a modern, I don't know,

603
00:25:26,377 --> 00:25:26,377
four or five year old child of modern

604
00:25:26,377 --> 00:25:26,377
adult height and with a small brain.

605
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:45,396
Well, they were not doing too badly if

606
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:45,396
they kept making things making stuff with

607
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:45,396
their hands, doing things and then

608
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:45,396
forgetting about them because their main

609
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:45,396
purpose was to survive and they had to

610
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:45,396
eat and find something to eat and they

611
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:45,396
couldn't spend all their time in these

612
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:45,396
rather than productive activities.

613
00:25:26,377 --> 00:26:14,419
So let's say that let's take the active

614
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:14,419
inference approach to this and suggest

615
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:14,419
that from the perspective of the free

616
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:14,419
energy principle and active inference,

617
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:14,419
the differences that we're seeing

618
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:14,419
contextualize the experience dependent

619
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:14,419
learning and planning and influence on a

620
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:14,419
small scale.

621
00:25:45,396 --> 00:26:43,448
But they reflect the structural

622
00:26:43,448 --> 00:26:43,448
neurobiological priors that could be

623
00:26:43,448 --> 00:26:43,448
inherited by epigenetic and genetic

624
00:26:43,448 --> 00:26:43,448
processes within the hierarchically

625
00:26:43,448 --> 00:26:43,448
mechanistic minds that were evolving and

626
00:26:43,448 --> 00:26:43,448
which certainly were not the same as

627
00:26:43,448 --> 00:26:43,448
those of modern chimpanzees and gorillas

628
00:26:43,448 --> 00:26:43,448
that don't do all these things that even

629
00:26:43,448 --> 00:26:43,448
our Homo ancestors were doing one and a

630
00:26:43,448 --> 00:26:43,448
half million years ago.

631
00:26:14,419 --> 00:27:00,459
Well, okay, I accept that the absence of

632
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:00,459
evidence need not imply the evidence of

633
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:00,459
that absence, but that fails to satisfy

634
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:00,459
most people or many people, particularly

635
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:00,459
scientists like ourselves.

636
00:26:44,449 --> 00:27:06,465
Certainly the Darwin's argument had power

637
00:27:06,465 --> 00:27:06,465
has power.

638
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:39,498
But if we take a look at early human

639
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:39,498
evolution from the perspective of the

640
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:39,498
free energy principle our proposal

641
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:39,498
invokes an overarching methodological

642
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:39,498
paradigm grounded in an existential

643
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:39,498
principle fundamental to the evolution of

644
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:39,498
living organisms and is consistent both

645
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:39,498
with the long periods of time and the

646
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:39,498
vast periods of space in the Old world

647
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:39,498
that we are dealing with, let's say

648
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:39,498
60,000 or even 80,000 generations across

649
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:39,498
three continents.

650
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:57,516
And nevertheless explain allows us to

651
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:57,516
interpret from the point of view of

652
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:57,516
natural selection what was going on,

653
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:57,516
albeit imperceptibly slowly by natural

654
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:57,516
selection and adaptation.

655
00:27:40,499 --> 00:28:26,539
At least some of the irregular,

656
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:26,539
regularities and regular irregularities

657
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:26,539
of phenomena attributable to homo in the

658
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:26,539
Pleistocene record reflect the kinds of

659
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:26,539
plausibly anomalous behavioral outcomes

660
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:26,539
that doubtless occurred often in a snakes

661
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:26,539
and ladders model of evolution in early

662
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:26,539
members of our genus, regardless of what

663
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:26,539
species we want to call their skeletal

664
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:26,539
remains, whether Neanderthals or merectus

665
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:26,539
modern Homo whatever.

666
00:27:59,518 --> 00:28:27,540
Okay?

667
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:48,561
These are plausible outcomes of behavior

668
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:48,561
by individuals who failed to maintain

669
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:48,561
orthodox behavioral responses when faced

670
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:48,561
with cognitive supply zones and who

671
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:48,561
showed, almost certainly particular

672
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:48,561
neurobiological propensity to exploring

673
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:48,561
unorthodox possibilities.

674
00:28:27,540 --> 00:29:00,567
A propensity that's involved further in

675
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:00,567
humans and in great apes which, unlike

676
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:00,567
even our very young children, seem unable

677
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:00,567
to envisage how things might be as well

678
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:00,567
as how they actually are.

679
00:28:49,562 --> 00:29:06,573
As the Canadian psychologist and

680
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:06,573
primatologist professor Anne Russen has

681
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:06,573
written.

682
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:32,599
And with that, I will end my little

683
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:32,599
introduction, which I hope will explain a

684
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:32,599
rather complicated approach to producing

685
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:32,599
a novel interpretation of how human

686
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:32,599
behavior was evolving during a very long

687
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:32,599
period of time and across a very large

688
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:32,599
period of space on our planet during the

689
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:32,599
Pleistocene.

690
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:33,600
Thank you.

691
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:42,609
Daniel: Thank you, Michael.

692
00:29:41,608 --> 00:29:45,612
Yes, that is the end of the

693
00:29:45,612 --> 00:29:45,612
presentation.

694
00:29:43,609 --> 00:29:48,615
Great.

695
00:29:47,614 --> 00:29:53,620
Thank you for the presentation.

696
00:29:51,618 --> 00:30:09,630
We will now move into discussion, so I'm

697
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:09,630
going to open up a blank page and then

698
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:09,630
Hector, Karl and Dean, please feel free

699
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:09,630
to join.

700
00:29:54,621 --> 00:30:14,635
Dean.

701
00:30:13,634 --> 00:30:14,635
First.

702
00:30:14,635 --> 00:30:31,652
Dean: Of all, Michael, I'm not sure what

703
00:30:31,652 --> 00:30:31,652
your stature is in person, but after that

704
00:30:31,652 --> 00:30:31,652
presentation, you're a giant in my mind

705
00:30:31,652 --> 00:30:31,652
and that's not said out of me needing to

706
00:30:31,652 --> 00:30:31,652
compliment you.

707
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:33,654
Thank you for the presentation.

708
00:30:32,653 --> 00:30:42,663
I'm curious now because the approach that

709
00:30:42,663 --> 00:30:42,663
Daniel and I took was one of trying to

710
00:30:42,663 --> 00:30:42,663
parameterize a space between the two

711
00:30:42,663 --> 00:30:42,663
papers.

712
00:30:33,654 --> 00:31:05,680
I'm curious now what Hector thinks in

713
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:05,680
terms of sort of holding up that other

714
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:05,680
side of this set, in particular with the

715
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:05,680
paper on to copy or not to copy, and how

716
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:05,680
we might now sort of gain some depth

717
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:05,680
perception around things like zone of

718
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:05,680
about a surprising now that we've had

719
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:05,680
sort of the introduction with the

720
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:05,680
presentation that Michael just shared.

721
00:30:42,663 --> 00:31:17,692
Daniel: Hector, feel free to give a first

722
00:31:17,692 --> 00:31:17,692
comment.

723
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:24,699
Hector: Okay, so you want me to comment

724
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:24,699
on to copy or not to copy on this one or

725
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:24,699
how they yeah.

726
00:31:18,693 --> 00:31:31,706
Dean: The zone abound is surprising in

727
00:31:31,706 --> 00:31:31,706
particular given sort of the groundwork

728
00:31:31,706 --> 00:31:31,706
that Michael has just established.

729
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:32,707
Hector: Okay, perfect.

730
00:31:31,706 --> 00:31:48,723
I would like to start by thanking both

731
00:31:48,723 --> 00:31:48,723
Michael, Andy Clark for this

732
00:31:48,723 --> 00:31:48,723
collaboration, because I think I was

733
00:31:48,723 --> 00:31:48,723
thinking in the Aphorism by Newton, while

734
00:31:48,723 --> 00:31:48,723
attributed to Newton, is not original

735
00:31:48,723 --> 00:31:48,723
from him on the shoulder of giants.

736
00:31:32,707 --> 00:31:57,732
And I think I feel a bit shy here among

737
00:31:57,732 --> 00:31:57,732
this huge intellect and I feel very

738
00:31:57,732 --> 00:31:57,732
privileged too.

739
00:31:49,724 --> 00:32:05,734
So I want to thank them both, Andy Clark

740
00:32:05,734 --> 00:32:05,734
especially because he has been so kind as

741
00:32:05,734 --> 00:32:05,734
to revise our two papers.

742
00:31:57,732 --> 00:32:12,741
I mean, in one he's cohort, but in the

743
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:12,741
other he revised it and give us very good

744
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:12,741
indications and advice.

745
00:32:05,734 --> 00:32:19,748
So I'm very grateful because we all know

746
00:32:19,748 --> 00:32:19,748
how busy he is, so he took the time to

747
00:32:19,748 --> 00:32:19,748
help us and I'm very grateful.

748
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:33,762
And coming back to the papers, the thing

749
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:33,762
is that Michael came up with this

750
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:33,762
original idea of explaining this

751
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:33,762
appearance and disappearance of hand

752
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:33,762
access in terms of the free energy

753
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:33,762
principle.

754
00:32:19,748 --> 00:32:42,771
And when we were working on that paper, I

755
00:32:42,771 --> 00:32:42,771
thought that the same argument could

756
00:32:42,771 --> 00:32:42,771
apply naturally to the case of grade

757
00:32:42,771 --> 00:32:42,771
apes.

758
00:32:34,763 --> 00:32:54,783
And the thing that there was this parcel

759
00:32:54,783 --> 00:32:54,783
in grade apes studies when they study

760
00:32:54,783 --> 00:32:54,783
this kind of social transmission or

761
00:32:54,783 --> 00:32:54,783
culture, or cumulative culture, or

762
00:32:54,783 --> 00:32:54,783
cumulative technology.

763
00:32:42,771 --> 00:33:09,792
And what happens is that there are many

764
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:09,792
reports on chimpanzees being innovative,

765
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:09,792
meaning innovative like they invent new

766
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:09,792
things, new behaviors, or new

767
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:09,792
exploitation of resources by applying new

768
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:09,792
tools.

769
00:32:54,783 --> 00:33:20,803
So there are many instances of this, but

770
00:33:20,803 --> 00:33:20,803
there is a puzzle here, as there is the

771
00:33:20,803 --> 00:33:20,803
other puzzle with appearance and

772
00:33:20,803 --> 00:33:20,803
disappearances of technology, that there

773
00:33:20,803 --> 00:33:20,803
is no cumulative technology.

774
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:31,814
So this is a puzzle for me, because if

775
00:33:31,814 --> 00:33:31,814
you have one creature who is able to be

776
00:33:31,814 --> 00:33:31,814
so inventive, how is it possible that it

777
00:33:31,814 --> 00:33:31,814
doesn't accumulate complexity in the

778
00:33:31,814 --> 00:33:31,814
technology?

779
00:33:20,803 --> 00:33:44,827
So the same cognitive machinery, so to

780
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:44,827
speak, should be able to produce more

781
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:44,827
complex artifacts, so there is no kind of

782
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:44,827
accumulation of complexity across

783
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:44,827
generations.

784
00:33:31,814 --> 00:33:46,829
And that's a big puzzle for me.

785
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:52,835
So I thought maybe the free energy

786
00:33:52,835 --> 00:33:52,835
principle was useful here too.

787
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:54,837
So I just made this analogy.

788
00:33:52,835 --> 00:33:59,842
So it's Michael who opened up this new

789
00:33:59,842 --> 00:33:59,842
avenue thanks to the work of Karl.

790
00:33:54,837 --> 00:34:07,844
And I just took advantage to think maybe

791
00:34:07,844 --> 00:34:07,844
it is because new things are too

792
00:34:07,844 --> 00:34:07,844
surprising for gray waves.

793
00:33:59,842 --> 00:34:12,849
So there are features that cannot cope

794
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:12,849
with high levels of surprise.

795
00:34:07,844 --> 00:34:17,854
If I'm talking too fast or too much, just

796
00:34:17,854 --> 00:34:17,854
tell me.

797
00:34:14,851 --> 00:34:20,857
I think you are following the agreement,

798
00:34:20,857 --> 00:34:20,857
I assume.

799
00:34:17,854 --> 00:34:22,859
Is it okay?

800
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:31,868
So the idea is that if something that I

801
00:34:31,868 --> 00:34:31,868
observe is too surprising, I have to deal

802
00:34:31,868 --> 00:34:31,868
with this high level of surprise.

803
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:37,874
And also by reading a paper by Andy

804
00:34:37,874 --> 00:34:37,874
Clark.

805
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:39,876
The title was Predictive Coding.

806
00:34:37,874 --> 00:34:44,881
It was in behavioral brain sciences, if I

807
00:34:44,881 --> 00:34:44,881
remember correctly.

808
00:34:39,876 --> 00:34:55,892
He talked of one can see very surprising

809
00:34:55,892 --> 00:34:55,892
things if he's able to credit the sensory

810
00:34:55,892 --> 00:34:55,892
information as opposed to the top down

811
00:34:55,892 --> 00:34:55,892
prediction.

812
00:34:44,881 --> 00:34:57,894
And this again helped me to make the

813
00:34:57,894 --> 00:34:57,894
connection.

814
00:34:55,892 --> 00:35:14,905
So maybe the problem is that from the

815
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:14,905
point of view of the observer of an

816
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:14,905
innovation, if something is too

817
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:14,905
surprising, I have to consider if I trust

818
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:14,905
the sensory information as opposed to the

819
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:14,905
top down prediction.

820
00:34:57,894 --> 00:35:22,913
And I need to decide, I mean, I'm talking

821
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:22,913
I need to decide like it was some kind of

822
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:22,913
animistic thing, but you know what I

823
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:22,913
mean.

824
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:30,921
So there is the weighting up of sensory

825
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:30,921
information and top down prediction.

826
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:43,934
So my idea was that perhaps what happens

827
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:43,934
here is that these great apes, when they

828
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:43,934
observe something new and it's

829
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:43,934
surprising, they kind of do not credit

830
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:43,934
it.

831
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:56,947
So it's like they basically do not

832
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:56,947
register that because it's a mismatch

833
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:56,947
with the prediction and for some reason

834
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:56,947
they are not able to credit essential

835
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:56,947
information.

836
00:35:43,934 --> 00:36:00,945
And this brings us to the concept of the

837
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:00,945
zones of bandage surprisals.

838
00:35:56,947 --> 00:36:04,949
So these zones is an imaginary concept.

839
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:07,952
It's something we use to explain what

840
00:36:07,952 --> 00:36:07,952
happens.

841
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:28,973
So it's like if you have a wide tone of

842
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:28,973
boundary, surprisingly, it means that

843
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:28,973
things that are not in accordance with

844
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:28,973
your top down predictions, things that

845
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:28,973
deviate much from these top down

846
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:28,973
predictions, can be handled because you

847
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:28,973
are able to bounce surprising.

848
00:36:07,952 --> 00:36:41,986
So you have cognitive mechanisms that

849
00:36:41,986 --> 00:36:41,986
help you to bounce surprising, even when

850
00:36:41,986 --> 00:36:41,986
you are facing huge mismatches with

851
00:36:41,986 --> 00:36:41,986
regard to your expectations, to previous

852
00:36:41,986 --> 00:36:41,986
expectations.

853
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:45,990
So that will be the main thing here.

854
00:36:41,986 --> 00:36:57,002
So we propose that in gray days there has

855
00:36:57,002 --> 00:36:57,002
not been these changes in the brain that

856
00:36:57,002 --> 00:36:57,002
allow them to bounce surprise, where

857
00:36:57,002 --> 00:36:57,002
things deviate markedly from what they

858
00:36:57,002 --> 00:36:57,002
expect.

859
00:36:45,990 --> 00:37:14,013
Only indeed when they deviate slightly

860
00:37:14,013 --> 00:37:14,013
from what they expect, so they can

861
00:37:14,013 --> 00:37:14,013
accumulate complexity, provided the

862
00:37:14,013 --> 00:37:14,013
things they observe that are new are not

863
00:37:14,013 --> 00:37:14,013
very different from what they expected.

864
00:36:57,002 --> 00:37:16,015
I think I will stop here.

865
00:37:15,014 --> 00:37:19,018
Even I can make more precision.

866
00:37:16,015 --> 00:37:20,019
But that is the basic idea.

867
00:37:19,018 --> 00:37:26,025
I don't know if Michael is in agreement

868
00:37:26,025 --> 00:37:26,025
or he wants to add something, because I

869
00:37:26,025 --> 00:37:26,025
hope I have my limitation with language

870
00:37:26,025 --> 00:37:26,025
too.

871
00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:28,027
So perhaps he can't help me out.

872
00:37:26,025 --> 00:37:36,035
Michael, do you have something to add or

873
00:37:36,035 --> 00:37:36,035
to precise?

874
00:37:32,031 --> 00:37:38,037
Michael: Not really.

875
00:37:37,036 --> 00:37:44,043
Fundamentally, I accept what Hector is

876
00:37:44,043 --> 00:37:44,043
saying.

877
00:37:40,039 --> 00:38:17,070
His idea was certainly novel to me when

878
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,070
he put it forward, that we have to think

879
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,070
about the observers, not merely the

880
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,070
practitioners, because anthropologists

881
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,070
and archaeologists and indeed many people

882
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,070
working in the cognitive and

883
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,070
psychological sciences have tended to put

884
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,070
the emphasis in terms of skills on the

885
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,070
person who performs them and not the

886
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,070
person who or not the observation of

887
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,070
those skills which is so necessary.

888
00:37:46,045 --> 00:38:18,071
Of course.

889
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:26,079
And I didn't realize this until Hector

890
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:26,079
pointed out to me, so necessary, of

891
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:26,079
course, for their transmission to take

892
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:26,079
hold at all.

893
00:38:18,071 --> 00:38:36,088
And this struck me as being a most

894
00:38:36,088 --> 00:38:36,088
important insight, so obvious that one

895
00:38:36,088 --> 00:38:36,088
wonders why one never thought of it

896
00:38:36,088 --> 00:38:36,088
oneself.

897
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:45,098
In the same way that one wonders why it

898
00:38:45,098 --> 00:38:45,098
is that so many paleoanthropologists and

899
00:38:45,098 --> 00:38:45,098
archaeologists are more concerned with

900
00:38:45,098 --> 00:38:45,098
this.

901
00:38:36,089 --> 00:38:48,101
Stuff than with why this stuff isn't

902
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:48,101
there.

903
00:38:45,098 --> 00:38:50,103
These are such obvious problems.

904
00:38:49,102 --> 00:39:14,121
They go back to Sherlock Holmes and so

905
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:14,121
Arthur Conan Doyle, but we tend to be

906
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:14,121
obsessed with what we can see and feel

907
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:14,121
and touch, rather than with what sort of

908
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:14,121
process might have led to explaining both

909
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:14,121
presence as and absences at the same

910
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:14,121
time.

911
00:38:50,103 --> 00:39:24,131
And this is why I find the whole notion

912
00:39:24,131 --> 00:39:24,131
of active inference so important to tie

913
00:39:24,131 --> 00:39:24,131
in with evolution.

914
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:39,146
It was Professor Christian himself who

915
00:39:39,146 --> 00:39:39,146
enthused me to go back to the lectures

916
00:39:39,146 --> 00:39:39,146
that I used to attend 50 years ago when I

917
00:39:39,146 --> 00:39:39,146
was an undergraduate, that were given by

918
00:39:39,146 --> 00:39:39,146
Nicholas Tinbergen at Oxford.

919
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:47,154
I would steal away from the lectures of

920
00:39:47,154 --> 00:39:47,154
anatomy given by Sir Wilfred Lagrange

921
00:39:47,154 --> 00:39:47,154
Clark to attend those of Nicholas

922
00:39:47,154 --> 00:39:47,154
Tinbergen and other people.

923
00:39:39,146 --> 00:40:07,168
And I come to realize just how important

924
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,168
Lawrence's and Tinbergens, and, of

925
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,168
course, van Fish von Fish, as Daniel

926
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,168
knows, were, and how worthy they were of

927
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,168
getting, 50 years ago, the Nobel Prize

928
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,168
for physiology or medicine.

929
00:39:47,154 --> 00:40:20,181
50 years later, we're still trying to get

930
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:20,181
to terms with the significance of their

931
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:20,181
insights, which shows just how difficult

932
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:20,181
it is for us to absorb novelty.

933
00:40:08,169 --> 00:40:26,187
But nevertheless, I'm no giant, I'm a

934
00:40:26,187 --> 00:40:26,187
dwarf.

935
00:40:21,182 --> 00:40:29,190
We stand on the shoulders of giants.

936
00:40:26,187 --> 00:40:47,208
Not only Lorenz and Tinbergen, Fish,

937
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:47,208
Darwin, of course, and going back to

938
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:47,208
Bayesian in the 18th century, one critic

939
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:47,208
of our psychic paper said that we were

940
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:47,208
pomo.

941
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:52,213
In other words, we were pomo

942
00:40:52,213 --> 00:40:52,213
postmodernist.

943
00:40:48,209 --> 00:40:59,220
No, we go back in a good scientific and

944
00:40:59,220 --> 00:40:59,220
vocal tradition and theoretical tradition

945
00:40:59,220 --> 00:40:59,220
back to the 18th century.

946
00:40:52,213 --> 00:41:02,217
Nothing postmodern about us at all.

947
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:28,243
I think all of us would reject any

948
00:41:28,243 --> 00:41:28,243
suspicion that we were involved in

949
00:41:28,243 --> 00:41:28,243
postprocessual and postmodernist

950
00:41:28,243 --> 00:41:28,243
argument, unlike many of our colleagues

951
00:41:28,243 --> 00:41:28,243
in what I call the social studies, like

952
00:41:28,243 --> 00:41:28,243
the late Lou Binford, an archaeologist in

953
00:41:28,243 --> 00:41:28,243
America, some note I prefer social

954
00:41:28,243 --> 00:41:28,243
studies to social science, which I think

955
00:41:28,243 --> 00:41:28,243
can at times be something of an opsimal.

956
00:41:02,217 --> 00:41:31,246
I suspect that others will dispute that.

957
00:41:29,243 --> 00:41:35,250
With me, however, I'm no giant, I'm a

958
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:35,250
dwarf.

959
00:41:31,246 --> 00:41:48,263
It took me all my time to cope with

960
00:41:48,263 --> 00:41:48,263
something we were never taught at school,

961
00:41:48,263 --> 00:41:48,263
matrix algebra, which I had to learn when

962
00:41:48,263 --> 00:41:48,263
I was doing my research on prehistoric

963
00:41:48,263 --> 00:41:48,263
skulls.

964
00:41:36,251 --> 00:42:16,285
And from then, to cope with Bayes theorem

965
00:42:16,285 --> 00:42:16,285
and the approaches or the uses that can

966
00:42:16,285 --> 00:42:16,285
be made of Bayesian mathematical

967
00:42:16,285 --> 00:42:16,285
statistics using matrix theory, which I'm

968
00:42:16,285 --> 00:42:16,285
gradually caught up with, and I can

969
00:42:16,285 --> 00:42:16,285
follow it, but I certainly wouldn't be

970
00:42:16,285 --> 00:42:16,285
capable, unlike Professor Christian of

971
00:42:16,285 --> 00:42:16,285
deriving it.

972
00:41:48,263 --> 00:42:30,299
But I can certainly understand the

973
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:30,299
significance of something that I think a

974
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:30,299
lot of our colleagues in the humanities

975
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:30,299
and social studies simply are not

976
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:30,299
prepared to confront at all.

977
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:42,311
I think they prefer much more subjective,

978
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:42,311
if you like, postmodernist thinking, to

979
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:42,311
rational scientific analysis.

980
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:44,313
Well, thank you.

981
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:52,321
Karl.

982
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,323
Lost the screen.

983
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:55,324
Can you see me?

984
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:55,324
I can see you.

985
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:56,325
Karl: I can see.

986
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:59,328
Daniel: We see you, Karl.

987
00:42:56,325 --> 00:43:03,326
Michael: My eyesight is no longer quite

988
00:43:03,326 --> 00:43:03,326
as good as it used to be.

989
00:43:00,323 --> 00:43:07,330
So I sometimes tend to huddle over the

990
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:07,330
computer.

991
00:43:04,327 --> 00:43:09,332
Daniel: It's all good.

992
00:43:08,331 --> 00:43:10,333
It's all good.

993
00:43:09,332 --> 00:43:22,345
Karl, maybe you could come in and share

994
00:43:22,345 --> 00:43:22,345
how this collaboration came to be or from

995
00:43:22,345 --> 00:43:22,345
your view from the inside or however else

996
00:43:22,345 --> 00:43:22,345
you'd like to comment on what we've seen

997
00:43:22,345 --> 00:43:22,345
so far.

998
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:26,349
Karl: Yes, well, thank you very much for

999
00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:26,349
the opportunity.

1000
00:43:24,347 --> 00:43:40,363
I also have to do a lot of huddling

1001
00:43:40,363 --> 00:43:40,363
because of my failing eyesight, just to

1002
00:43:40,363 --> 00:43:40,363
reiterate what a joy it was to hear that

1003
00:43:40,363 --> 00:43:40,363
presentation and Hector's follow up.

1004
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:45,368
So this is, for me, an adventure well

1005
00:43:45,368 --> 00:43:45,368
outside my comfort zone.

1006
00:43:40,363 --> 00:43:50,373
So I'm here as a passenger spectator and

1007
00:43:50,373 --> 00:43:50,373
learning a lot.

1008
00:43:45,368 --> 00:44:00,377
I didn't know half of this stuff, even

1009
00:44:00,377 --> 00:44:00,377
though I did a lot of biology and a

1010
00:44:00,377 --> 00:44:00,377
little bit of evolutionary biology as a

1011
00:44:00,377 --> 00:44:00,377
young man.

1012
00:43:50,373 --> 00:44:07,384
But this is intriguing and foundational

1013
00:44:07,384 --> 00:44:07,384
insights into the way that we are.

1014
00:44:00,377 --> 00:44:11,388
So I'm going to make a few comments.

1015
00:44:08,385 --> 00:44:17,394
It's going to be more of a stream of

1016
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:17,394
consciousness, but I qualify this again,

1017
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:17,394
but this is completely outside my comfort

1018
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:17,394
zone.

1019
00:44:11,388 --> 00:44:25,402
I'm just talking as a layperson here, or

1020
00:44:25,402 --> 00:44:25,402
a lay physicist perhaps, and I'll just

1021
00:44:25,402 --> 00:44:25,402
make a few observations.

1022
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:42,419
But, Daniel, I'd be particularly

1023
00:44:42,419 --> 00:44:42,419
interested in your synthesis because, of

1024
00:44:42,419 --> 00:44:42,419
course, you have probably more than any

1025
00:44:42,419 --> 00:44:42,419
of us, the broadest oversight from the

1026
00:44:42,419 --> 00:44:42,419
evolutionary perspective right through to

1027
00:44:42,419 --> 00:44:42,419
the Bayesian mechanics that is entailed

1028
00:44:42,419 --> 00:44:42,419
by things like active inference.

1029
00:44:25,402 --> 00:44:58,435
Just to forewarn you, I'm going to call

1030
00:44:58,435 --> 00:44:58,435
upon you to do the synthesis and to draw

1031
00:44:58,435 --> 00:44:58,435
and join the dots that haven't already

1032
00:44:58,435 --> 00:44:58,435
been joined, although there's been a lot

1033
00:44:58,435 --> 00:44:58,435
of dot joining from what I can see

1034
00:44:58,435 --> 00:44:58,435
already.

1035
00:44:44,421 --> 00:45:11,442
So the stream of consciousness comes

1036
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:11,442
really from this commitment to ideas that

1037
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:11,442
are certainly not postmodern.

1038
00:44:59,436 --> 00:45:20,451
I think I'd probably have to go back to

1039
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:20,451
Plato and certainly sort of get stuck

1040
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:20,451
around the era of helmholtz and the

1041
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:20,451
like.

1042
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:50,481
From a physicist's point of view and

1043
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:50,481
pursuing that, looking at the looking at

1044
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:50,481
this sort of remarkable snakes and

1045
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:50,481
ladders phenomenon through the eyes of a

1046
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:50,481
physicist, it certainly makes complete

1047
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:50,481
sense that if we're looking at a process,

1048
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:50,481
that would be described as a non

1049
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:50,481
equilibrium, steady state that is slowly

1050
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:50,481
evolving.

1051
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:57,488
That could be, if you like, a

1052
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:57,488
mathematical image of the evolutionary

1053
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:57,488
process.

1054
00:45:52,483 --> 00:46:17,502
The definitive feature of these non

1055
00:46:17,502 --> 00:46:17,502
equilibrium steady states that have a

1056
00:46:17,502 --> 00:46:17,502
biological aspect is that they entail a

1057
00:46:17,502 --> 00:46:17,502
revisiting of the trajectory to

1058
00:46:17,502 --> 00:46:17,502
neighborhoods of certain parts of face

1059
00:46:17,502 --> 00:46:17,502
space.

1060
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:51,536
So if I read face space as basically the

1061
00:46:51,536 --> 00:46:51,536
state of evolution or what phenotypes are

1062
00:46:51,536 --> 00:46:51,536
doing or what is encoded genetically in a

1063
00:46:51,536 --> 00:46:51,536
very, very crude, broad level, there can

1064
00:46:51,536 --> 00:46:51,536
be no other solution to a particular

1065
00:46:51,536 --> 00:46:51,536
trajectory that is apt for describing a

1066
00:46:51,536 --> 00:46:51,536
non equilibrium steady state than the

1067
00:46:51,536 --> 00:46:51,536
occasional I anteriorant recurrence of

1068
00:46:51,536 --> 00:46:51,536
certain states of being literally being

1069
00:46:51,536 --> 00:46:51,536
close or revisiting neighborhoods, of

1070
00:46:51,536 --> 00:46:51,536
certain regimes of face space.

1071
00:46:17,502 --> 00:47:20,559
So the snakes and Ladders image seems to

1072
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:20,559
me a very apt image to actually describe

1073
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:20,559
pullback attractors, which are another

1074
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:20,559
way of articulating these kinds of

1075
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:20,559
dynamics or this kind of kind of dynamics

1076
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:20,559
in the sense that they have this aspect

1077
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:20,559
of recurrence and they have this aspect

1078
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:20,559
of self contained itinerancy which are

1079
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:20,559
the hallmarks of any system, really, that

1080
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:20,559
exists over a substantial period of

1081
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:20,559
time.

1082
00:46:51,536 --> 00:47:26,565
It would be interesting to think, can it

1083
00:47:26,565 --> 00:47:26,565
be any other way?

1084
00:47:23,562 --> 00:47:27,566
And I would submit.

1085
00:47:26,565 --> 00:47:28,567
No.

1086
00:47:27,566 --> 00:47:47,586
If you have a physical process that is

1087
00:47:47,586 --> 00:47:47,586
unfolding at multiple timescales and it

1088
00:47:47,586 --> 00:47:47,586
is endowed and can be recognized either

1089
00:47:47,586 --> 00:47:47,586
historically or in the moment by being in

1090
00:47:47,586 --> 00:47:47,586
certain characteristic states that

1091
00:47:47,586 --> 00:47:47,586
literally characterize the system in

1092
00:47:47,586 --> 00:47:47,586
question.

1093
00:47:28,567 --> 00:48:04,597
So that it can be named, whether it's a

1094
00:48:04,597 --> 00:48:04,597
species or whether it's your behavior or

1095
00:48:04,597 --> 00:48:04,597
whether it's an artifact or whether it's

1096
00:48:04,597 --> 00:48:04,597
a process, then it must be the case that

1097
00:48:04,597 --> 00:48:04,597
it has this kind of iterrancy where

1098
00:48:04,597 --> 00:48:04,597
things come and go.

1099
00:47:47,586 --> 00:48:22,615
So it will be interesting just as a pure

1100
00:48:22,615 --> 00:48:22,615
exercise for pure mathematics just to put

1101
00:48:22,615 --> 00:48:22,615
things like the Poncara recurrence

1102
00:48:22,615 --> 00:48:22,615
theorem into a snakes and ladders format

1103
00:48:22,615 --> 00:48:22,615
and vice versa.

1104
00:48:04,597 --> 00:48:28,621
Because I think there's something

1105
00:48:28,621 --> 00:48:28,621
fundamentally true that has to be the way

1106
00:48:28,621 --> 00:48:28,621
that things are.

1107
00:48:22,615 --> 00:48:33,626
And I see that in many fields.

1108
00:48:28,621 --> 00:48:37,630
And two immediately came to mind.

1109
00:48:35,628 --> 00:48:47,640
The first was current notions of not the

1110
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:47,640
spread of ideas or the spread of tools,

1111
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:47,640
but the spread of cancer.

1112
00:48:38,631 --> 00:48:52,644
The view that cancer there are two views

1113
00:48:52,644 --> 00:48:52,644
of cancer.

1114
00:48:47,640 --> 00:49:14,660
There's a sort of 20th century view that

1115
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:14,660
you get one cell in your body, fails to

1116
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:14,660
recognize that it should not be growing

1117
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:14,660
and just keeps on growing and you'll get

1118
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:14,660
these progressive and inevitable growth

1119
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:14,660
of the cancer set of cells and at some

1120
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:14,660
point they will disseminate and seed

1121
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:14,660
themselves around the body.

1122
00:48:52,645 --> 00:49:21,668
You get metastases and secondaries and

1123
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:21,668
the like and ultimately, unless it's

1124
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:21,668
cured, then it will destroy the

1125
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:21,668
phenotype.

1126
00:49:14,661 --> 00:49:27,674
There's another view which is now

1127
00:49:27,674 --> 00:49:27,674
becoming more prevalent, which is a much

1128
00:49:27,674 --> 00:49:27,674
more snakes and ladders view.

1129
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:37,684
And this view is that we're all the time

1130
00:49:37,684 --> 00:49:37,684
generating little cancer cells but 99.9%

1131
00:49:37,684 --> 00:49:37,684
of the of the time they don't get a

1132
00:49:37,684 --> 00:49:37,684
foothold.

1133
00:49:27,674 --> 00:49:46,693
So that we're in equilibrium, hopefully

1134
00:49:46,693 --> 00:49:46,693
on the right side of an equilibrium,

1135
00:49:46,693 --> 00:49:46,693
always paying host to little cancer

1136
00:49:46,693 --> 00:49:46,693
cells.

1137
00:49:38,685 --> 00:50:03,704
It's just that it's very rarely do they

1138
00:50:03,704 --> 00:50:03,704
actually establish themselves to the

1139
00:50:03,704 --> 00:50:03,704
extent that they can get a foothold and

1140
00:50:03,704 --> 00:50:03,704
reproduce to actually produce a tumor or

1141
00:50:03,704 --> 00:50:03,704
a neoplastic growth.

1142
00:49:46,693 --> 00:50:05,706
And that struck me.

1143
00:50:03,704 --> 00:50:16,717
It would be nice to put a snakes and

1144
00:50:16,717 --> 00:50:16,717
ladders sort of picture on the way that

1145
00:50:16,717 --> 00:50:16,717
that particular biological natural system

1146
00:50:16,717 --> 00:50:16,717
is viewed.

1147
00:50:05,706 --> 00:50:19,720
And it's certainly very consistent with

1148
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:19,720
current views on cancer.

1149
00:50:16,717 --> 00:50:34,735
The other system that seems to comply

1150
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:34,735
with this notion is not, again the spread

1151
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:34,735
of ideas or the spread of tools or

1152
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:34,735
cultural means, but the spread of

1153
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:34,735
viruses.

1154
00:50:20,721 --> 00:50:44,745
In epidemiology it's very interesting

1155
00:50:44,745 --> 00:50:44,745
that there are certain viruses, for

1156
00:50:44,745 --> 00:50:44,745
example, that get a foothold and explode

1157
00:50:44,745 --> 00:50:44,745
exponentially.

1158
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:52,753
And we've had, you know, we've just

1159
00:50:52,753 --> 00:50:52,753
enjoyed or witnessed an episode of that

1160
00:50:52,753 --> 00:50:52,753
with the with the the recent COVID-19

1161
00:50:52,753 --> 00:50:52,753
pandemic.

1162
00:50:44,745 --> 00:51:02,757
But there are other very similar episodes

1163
00:51:02,757 --> 00:51:02,757
that don't get a foothold and they die

1164
00:51:02,757 --> 00:51:02,757
out very quickly because they can't

1165
00:51:02,757 --> 00:51:02,757
spread.

1166
00:50:52,753 --> 00:51:13,768
And I know this personally because we

1167
00:51:13,768 --> 00:51:13,768
were looking for data when modeling using

1168
00:51:13,768 --> 00:51:13,768
actually exactly the same maths that

1169
00:51:13,768 --> 00:51:13,768
underwrites free energy principle, active

1170
00:51:13,768 --> 00:51:13,768
inference.

1171
00:51:03,758 --> 00:51:23,778
We were modeling the coronavirus crisis

1172
00:51:23,778 --> 00:51:23,778
recently and we hope to get some priors

1173
00:51:23,778 --> 00:51:23,778
on certain parameters by looking at

1174
00:51:23,778 --> 00:51:23,778
legacy historical data.

1175
00:51:13,768 --> 00:51:42,797
And it's interesting that there is data

1176
00:51:42,797 --> 00:51:42,797
out there on very similar viral

1177
00:51:42,797 --> 00:51:42,797
epidemics, but they died out too quickly

1178
00:51:42,797 --> 00:51:42,797
to generate enough data to make sense of

1179
00:51:42,797 --> 00:51:42,797
so things like MERS, for example, was

1180
00:51:42,797 --> 00:51:42,797
recorded, but it went away before it

1181
00:51:42,797 --> 00:51:42,797
actually produced enough data to get a

1182
00:51:42,797 --> 00:51:42,797
handle on it.

1183
00:51:23,778 --> 00:51:56,811
So again, this phenomena of sort of

1184
00:51:56,811 --> 00:51:56,811
things repeating themselves, climbing up

1185
00:51:56,811 --> 00:51:56,811
the ladder, but then sometimes falling

1186
00:51:56,811 --> 00:51:56,811
down a snake very, very quickly.

1187
00:51:43,797 --> 00:51:59,814
So you have to wait until the next

1188
00:51:59,814 --> 00:51:59,814
occurrence.

1189
00:51:56,811 --> 00:52:14,823
Seems to be a fundamental aspects of

1190
00:52:14,823 --> 00:52:14,823
ensemble dynamics wherever you see it,

1191
00:52:14,823 --> 00:52:14,823
either within the body in terms of

1192
00:52:14,823 --> 00:52:14,823
neoplasia or in terms of epidemiology of

1193
00:52:14,823 --> 00:52:14,823
spread.

1194
00:51:59,814 --> 00:52:23,832
And I use the word spread deliberately

1195
00:52:23,832 --> 00:52:23,832
because of that latter perspective on

1196
00:52:23,832 --> 00:52:23,832
basically to copy or not to copy.

1197
00:52:14,823 --> 00:52:29,838
So if you're copying, then you're in the

1198
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:29,838
game of spreading.

1199
00:52:23,832 --> 00:52:32,841
And if you don't copy, then you don't

1200
00:52:32,841 --> 00:52:32,841
spend.

1201
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:57,866
So I think just coming back to the

1202
00:52:57,866 --> 00:52:57,866
question what is it that determines

1203
00:52:57,866 --> 00:52:57,866
whether a particular cognitive surprise

1204
00:52:57,866 --> 00:52:57,866
or a novel approach to a way of behaving

1205
00:52:57,866 --> 00:52:57,866
or indeed a way of being catches on or

1206
00:52:57,866 --> 00:52:57,866
not?

1207
00:52:32,841 --> 00:53:03,866
And that dialectic, I think is absolutely

1208
00:53:03,866 --> 00:53:03,866
intriguing.

1209
00:52:58,867 --> 00:53:11,874
I should just say that all of this

1210
00:53:11,874 --> 00:53:11,874
formulation rests very sensitively on a

1211
00:53:11,874 --> 00:53:11,874
separation of temporal scales.

1212
00:53:03,866 --> 00:53:25,888
In the background, there is always this

1213
00:53:25,888 --> 00:53:25,888
separation of scales that you get with

1214
00:53:25,888 --> 00:53:25,888
evolution.

1215
00:53:16,879 --> 00:53:41,904
And in this particular instance, what we

1216
00:53:41,904 --> 00:53:41,904
are talking about is really whether

1217
00:53:41,904 --> 00:53:41,904
certain things can survive generationally

1218
00:53:41,904 --> 00:53:41,904
in the spirit, I would imagine, of sort

1219
00:53:41,904 --> 00:53:41,904
of evo devo and cultural niche

1220
00:53:41,904 --> 00:53:41,904
construction.

1221
00:53:27,890 --> 00:54:01,918
And then the question then is, okay, at a

1222
00:54:01,918 --> 00:54:01,918
fast time scale of interactions between

1223
00:54:01,918 --> 00:54:01,918
phenotypes, what's going to make that

1224
00:54:01,918 --> 00:54:01,918
sufficiently endemic to be propagated at

1225
00:54:01,918 --> 00:54:01,918
a transgenerational timescale?

1226
00:53:42,905 --> 00:54:04,921
I think that's a really interesting

1227
00:54:04,921 --> 00:54:04,921
question.

1228
00:54:01,918 --> 00:54:14,931
Again, it's the kind of question which,

1229
00:54:14,931 --> 00:54:14,931
as a neuroscientist, certainly as a

1230
00:54:14,931 --> 00:54:14,931
clinician, you are often confronted with

1231
00:54:14,931 --> 00:54:14,931
things.

1232
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:17,934
For example, like epilepsy.

1233
00:54:14,931 --> 00:54:40,957
What is it, Axel constant that determines

1234
00:54:40,957 --> 00:54:40,957
whether a particular epileptic,

1235
00:54:40,957 --> 00:54:40,957
surprising, dynamic discharge in a

1236
00:54:40,957 --> 00:54:40,957
particular part of the brain can be

1237
00:54:40,957 --> 00:54:40,957
propagated and disseminated throughout

1238
00:54:40,957 --> 00:54:40,957
the brain to give you a fit or as opposed

1239
00:54:40,957 --> 00:54:40,957
to it sort of auto vitiating or quenching

1240
00:54:40,957 --> 00:54:40,957
itself because the neighboring cells are

1241
00:54:40,957 --> 00:54:40,957
just not interested.

1242
00:54:17,934 --> 00:54:46,963
They just don't recognize a particular

1243
00:54:46,963 --> 00:54:46,963
pattern and it's inhibited.

1244
00:54:41,957 --> 00:54:50,967
And I guess the answer I think we've

1245
00:54:50,967 --> 00:54:50,967
already had the answer.

1246
00:54:46,963 --> 00:54:53,970
Both Michael and Hector have articulated

1247
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:53,970
it.

1248
00:54:51,968 --> 00:55:29,000
But I guess the answer lies in the

1249
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:29,000
mechanics of the spread of ideas and

1250
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:29,000
shared frames of reference and whether it

1251
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:29,000
is too surprising to be incorporated into

1252
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:29,000
your conspecifics or your community or

1253
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:29,000
whether it is learnable and can be

1254
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:29,000
incorporated or absorbed into your

1255
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:29,000
generative models such that it can then

1256
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:29,000
be sped to the next person in the

1257
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:29,000
standard sense of sort of niche

1258
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:29,000
construction.

1259
00:54:53,970 --> 00:55:44,015
And Hector mentioned specifically one key

1260
00:55:44,015 --> 00:55:44,015
determinant of that, which is Michael,

1261
00:55:44,015 --> 00:55:44,015
but it was the ability to change your

1262
00:55:44,015 --> 00:55:44,015
mind.

1263
00:55:30,001 --> 00:55:49,020
And the ability to change your mind is

1264
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:49,020
absolutely fundamental.

1265
00:55:44,015 --> 00:56:11,036
If you want to frame this in an active

1266
00:56:11,036 --> 00:56:11,036
inference context, just confronted with a

1267
00:56:11,036 --> 00:56:11,036
cognitive surprisal as it has been

1268
00:56:11,036 --> 00:56:11,036
articulated, a set of difficult to

1269
00:56:11,036 --> 00:56:11,036
explain sensations or sensory evidence,

1270
00:56:11,036 --> 00:56:11,036
then there are two ways in which you can

1271
00:56:11,036 --> 00:56:11,036
resolve that surprise.

1272
00:55:50,021 --> 00:56:24,049
The first way is to change your mind and

1273
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:24,049
to adjust your internal generative models

1274
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:24,049
or do some basic belief updating on the

1275
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:24,049
inside to make sense of this thing.

1276
00:56:11,036 --> 00:56:42,067
And that might depend upon some

1277
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:42,067
experience dependent learning over a

1278
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:42,067
suitable timescale so that you're

1279
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:42,067
changing your model, your generative

1280
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:42,067
model of the world to make it more apt to

1281
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:42,067
explain this novel observation or

1282
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:42,067
observation of one of your conspecifics

1283
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:42,067
doing this kind of thing.

1284
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:52,077
The other way is not the perceptual

1285
00:56:52,077 --> 00:56:52,077
response, the belief updating on the

1286
00:56:52,077 --> 00:56:52,077
inside to make your predictions more like

1287
00:56:52,077 --> 00:56:52,077
the sensations.

1288
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:58,083
It's to actually act upon the world, to

1289
00:56:58,083 --> 00:56:58,083
make your sensations more like they were

1290
00:56:58,083 --> 00:56:58,083
predicted.

1291
00:56:52,077 --> 00:57:01,080
So this is foundational inactive

1292
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:01,080
inference.

1293
00:56:58,083 --> 00:57:07,086
There's two complementary ways of

1294
00:57:07,086 --> 00:57:07,086
minimizing surprisal or prediction

1295
00:57:07,086 --> 00:57:07,086
error.

1296
00:57:02,081 --> 00:57:15,094
You either change your mind or you change

1297
00:57:15,094 --> 00:57:15,094
the thing that you're surprised about at

1298
00:57:15,094 --> 00:57:15,094
every level, at every temporal scale.

1299
00:57:07,086 --> 00:57:23,102
So just read in terms of whether I am

1300
00:57:23,102 --> 00:57:23,102
able to change my mind about witnessing

1301
00:57:23,102 --> 00:57:23,102
fire.

1302
00:57:15,094 --> 00:57:43,122
There are two ways I can say yes, fire is

1303
00:57:43,122 --> 00:57:43,122
a thing and I can then incorporate or

1304
00:57:43,122 --> 00:57:43,122
imbibe that into my world model and

1305
00:57:43,122 --> 00:57:43,122
become the kind of creature that actually

1306
00:57:43,122 --> 00:57:43,122
engages with fire or I can act to put the

1307
00:57:43,122 --> 00:57:43,122
fire out and then I don't have to worry

1308
00:57:43,122 --> 00:57:43,122
about it.

1309
00:57:24,103 --> 00:57:47,126
Both are perfectly appropriate ways of

1310
00:57:47,126 --> 00:57:47,126
minimizing surprise.

1311
00:57:43,122 --> 00:58:17,150
The difference at a very basic level, the

1312
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:17,150
thing that determines whether I perceive

1313
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:17,150
or act or whether I engage in perceptual

1314
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:17,150
or active inference in the moment to

1315
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:17,150
moment depends exactly on something which

1316
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:17,150
was again mentioned implicitly earlier

1317
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:17,150
on, which is the precision afforded the

1318
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:17,150
sensory evidence relative to your prior

1319
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:17,150
beliefs.

1320
00:57:47,126 --> 00:58:24,157
So as a physiologist, if you don't know

1321
00:58:24,157 --> 00:58:24,157
this, there are beautiful illustrations

1322
00:58:24,157 --> 00:58:24,157
of this.

1323
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:42,175
So if we just forget about the notion at

1324
00:58:42,175 --> 00:58:42,175
the moment of sort of long term revisions

1325
00:58:42,175 --> 00:58:42,175
or belief updating of our generative

1326
00:58:42,175 --> 00:58:42,175
model over multiple experiences to an

1327
00:58:42,175 --> 00:58:42,175
instance of somebody making a fire or

1328
00:58:42,175 --> 00:58:42,175
providing me with a valentine's gift of a

1329
00:58:42,175 --> 00:58:42,175
hand axe.

1330
00:58:24,157 --> 00:58:52,185
I'm just thinking now to the moment to

1331
00:58:52,185 --> 00:58:52,185
moment ways of making of sampling the

1332
00:58:52,185 --> 00:58:52,185
world and making sense of the world.

1333
00:58:43,176 --> 00:59:08,195
It's the case that in order to move, in

1334
00:59:08,195 --> 00:59:08,195
order to change the world, I have to

1335
00:59:08,195 --> 00:59:08,195
attenuate the precision afforded my

1336
00:59:08,195 --> 00:59:08,195
sensory information because if I didn't

1337
00:59:08,195 --> 00:59:08,195
do that, I would not be able to ignore

1338
00:59:08,195 --> 00:59:08,195
all the evidence that I am not currently

1339
00:59:08,195 --> 00:59:08,195
moving.

1340
00:58:52,185 --> 00:59:14,201
So the most beautiful example of this, I

1341
00:59:14,201 --> 00:59:14,201
think, is something called sacanic

1342
00:59:14,201 --> 00:59:14,201
suppression.

1343
00:59:08,195 --> 00:59:34,221
It's when we move our eyes, and we do so

1344
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:34,221
about four times a second, we actually

1345
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:34,221
attenuate the precision of the sensory

1346
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:34,221
evidence so that we are able to actually

1347
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:34,221
move our eyes, which basically means you

1348
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:34,221
can't see the optic flow induced when you

1349
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:34,221
make a sharp or sacred eye movement.

1350
00:59:14,201 --> 00:59:43,230
And yet, 50 milliseconds after you've

1351
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:43,230
made the eye movement, you're suddenly

1352
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:43,230
now attending to the visual information

1353
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:43,230
that you can see.

1354
00:59:35,222 --> 01:00:06,154
So you can't actually see anything while

1355
01:00:06,154 --> 01:00:06,154
your eyes are moving, because you've got

1356
01:00:06,154 --> 01:00:06,154
this sensory attenuation, which is

1357
01:00:06,154 --> 01:00:06,154
basically putting the priors in charge,

1358
01:00:06,154 --> 01:00:06,154
suspending attention to the sensorium

1359
01:00:06,154 --> 01:00:06,154
while you are acting, failures of that

1360
01:00:06,154 --> 01:00:06,154
can have quite horrible consequences.

1361
00:59:43,230 --> 01:00:21,224
So a failure to ignore the evidence that

1362
01:00:21,224 --> 01:00:21,224
I'm not moving and a failure to attenuate

1363
01:00:21,224 --> 01:00:21,224
or suspend attention attenuate the

1364
01:00:21,224 --> 01:00:21,224
precision of sensory evidence or afforded

1365
01:00:21,224 --> 01:00:21,224
sensory evidence, looks like things like

1366
01:00:21,224 --> 01:00:21,224
Parkinson's disease.

1367
01:00:06,234 --> 01:00:29,030
So we think that this precision is

1368
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:29,030
encoded by certain neurochemical

1369
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:29,030
transmitters, particularly dopamine.

1370
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:44,537
A deficit of dopamine basically means an

1371
01:00:44,537 --> 01:00:44,537
inability to attenuate the evidence from

1372
01:00:44,537 --> 01:00:44,537
your strept receptors, all the signals

1373
01:00:44,537 --> 01:00:44,537
coming from the body that you're not

1374
01:00:44,537 --> 01:00:44,537
currently moving.

1375
01:00:29,041 --> 01:00:58,950
So if you have the pride belief, I'm

1376
01:00:58,950 --> 01:00:58,950
going to move, I'm going to sit up, walk,

1377
01:00:58,950 --> 01:00:58,950
drink from this cup, you may have that

1378
01:00:58,950 --> 01:00:58,950
prior belief, but it's immediately

1379
01:00:58,950 --> 01:00:58,950
counteracted by and dispelled by very

1380
01:00:58,950 --> 01:00:58,950
precise evidence that you're not moving.

1381
01:00:44,547 --> 01:01:00,583
So you can never actually initiate a

1382
01:01:00,583 --> 01:01:00,583
movement.

1383
01:00:58,962 --> 01:01:06,157
And what you actually see clinically is

1384
01:01:06,157 --> 01:01:06,157
basically a psychomotoptery or a brady

1385
01:01:06,157 --> 01:01:06,157
Kinesia.

1386
01:01:00,586 --> 01:01:15,076
The point I'm making here all reduces to

1387
01:01:15,076 --> 01:01:15,076
something very, very simple, which is the

1388
01:01:15,076 --> 01:01:15,076
precision afforded sensory evidence.

1389
01:01:06,173 --> 01:01:36,118
And if you can't get that right and

1390
01:01:36,118 --> 01:01:36,118
notice it has to be estimated at every

1391
01:01:36,118 --> 01:01:36,118
timescale, either in terms of sacredic

1392
01:01:36,118 --> 01:01:36,118
suppression on a ten millisecond

1393
01:01:36,118 --> 01:01:36,118
timescale, right through to, one might

1394
01:01:36,118 --> 01:01:36,118
actually argue, an evolutionary

1395
01:01:36,118 --> 01:01:36,118
timescale.

1396
01:01:15,089 --> 01:01:44,988
And I make that argument because

1397
01:01:44,988 --> 01:01:44,988
precision can also be thought of as a

1398
01:01:44,988 --> 01:01:44,988
rate constant.

1399
01:01:36,126 --> 01:02:14,230
So if I've got some sort of sensory

1400
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:14,230
evidence and some prior beliefs, and I

1401
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:14,230
now view my belief updating at any level,

1402
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:14,230
whether it's sort of my neural activity

1403
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:14,230
encoding my beliefs at the moment, or

1404
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:14,230
whether it's my neuronal connectivity or

1405
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:14,230
encoding what I have learned, or it's

1406
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:14,230
neurodevelopment or indeed, at

1407
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:14,230
evolutionary timescale, the precision can

1408
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:14,230
be read as a rate constant.

1409
01:01:45,000 --> 01:02:57,668
So now what we're talking about is a

1410
01:02:57,668 --> 01:02:57,668
certain quantity that is absolutely

1411
01:02:57,668 --> 01:02:57,668
crucial for whether I adopt this or

1412
01:02:57,668 --> 01:02:57,668
incorporate instill this novel experience

1413
01:02:57,668 --> 01:02:57,668
into my model or not, that depends upon a

1414
01:02:57,668 --> 01:02:57,668
precision or a rate constant, which means

1415
01:02:57,668 --> 01:02:57,668
that if one wanted to ask the question,

1416
01:02:57,668 --> 01:02:57,668
why do some species have the ability to

1417
01:02:57,668 --> 01:02:57,668
learn whereas other species don't, then I

1418
01:02:57,668 --> 01:02:57,668
think the answer is, quite simply in

1419
01:02:57,668 --> 01:02:57,668
their ability to optimize and adjust

1420
01:02:57,668 --> 01:02:57,668
their learning rate.

1421
01:02:14,234 --> 01:03:17,803
Either precision afforded the evidence at

1422
01:03:17,803 --> 01:03:17,803
hand that drives the learning and I'm

1423
01:03:17,803 --> 01:03:17,803
wondering whether there are a couple of

1424
01:03:17,803 --> 01:03:17,803
ways to take that sort of mathematical

1425
01:03:17,803 --> 01:03:17,803
take on this really single, really

1426
01:03:17,803 --> 01:03:17,803
important quantity just to make it

1427
01:03:17,803 --> 01:03:17,803
intuitive.

1428
01:02:57,668 --> 01:03:19,823
I'm trying to get back to the copy versus

1429
01:03:19,823 --> 01:03:19,823
not copy.

1430
01:03:17,803 --> 01:03:25,882
So if I can copy, that means that I'm

1431
01:03:25,882 --> 01:03:25,882
impressionable.

1432
01:03:19,824 --> 01:03:26,892
What does that mean?

1433
01:03:25,883 --> 01:03:30,933
It means that I will accumulate new

1434
01:03:30,933 --> 01:03:30,933
evidence very very quickly.

1435
01:03:26,892 --> 01:03:31,941
What does that mean?

1436
01:03:30,934 --> 01:03:41,047
That means I have the capacity to assign

1437
01:03:41,047 --> 01:03:41,047
greater evidence or precision to that

1438
01:03:41,047 --> 01:03:41,047
sensory evidence and suspend the

1439
01:03:41,047 --> 01:03:41,047
precision of my prior beliefs.

1440
01:03:31,942 --> 01:03:43,063
I'm not rigid in my thinking.

1441
01:03:41,048 --> 01:03:46,093
I can learn because I am impressionable.

1442
01:03:43,064 --> 01:03:48,113
What would that look like?

1443
01:03:47,101 --> 01:03:49,122
What would it look like?

1444
01:03:48,114 --> 01:03:49,128
You were young.

1445
01:03:49,122 --> 01:03:58,217
It would look like you have just been

1446
01:03:58,217 --> 01:03:58,217
born and you are designed to learn

1447
01:03:58,217 --> 01:03:58,217
because you have yet to build

1448
01:03:58,217 --> 01:03:58,217
neurodevelopmentally your model of the

1449
01:03:58,217 --> 01:03:58,217
world.

1450
01:03:50,129 --> 01:04:27,446
Which means that averaged over a lifetime

1451
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:27,446
the degree to which you are likely to

1452
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:27,446
learn and implicitly enable the spread of

1453
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:27,446
ideas and ignite this particular episode

1454
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:27,446
of a new tool or a new way of doing

1455
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:27,446
things or being then it would look as if

1456
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:27,446
you are younger for longer.

1457
01:03:59,228 --> 01:04:29,467
So I was just intrigued.

1458
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:55,723
I think Michael was making an explicit

1459
01:04:55,723 --> 01:04:55,723
reference to the fact that there may be a

1460
01:04:55,723 --> 01:04:55,723
key difference between certain species,

1461
01:04:55,723 --> 01:04:55,723
maybe the duration or the timing of the

1462
01:04:55,723 --> 01:04:55,723
point where you basically switch off your

1463
01:04:55,723 --> 01:04:55,723
learnability, you switch off your

1464
01:04:55,723 --> 01:04:55,723
impressionability, and you become an

1465
01:04:55,723 --> 01:04:55,723
adult and you bake in then.

1466
01:04:30,472 --> 01:04:59,763
And then from that point on, you become

1467
01:04:59,763 --> 01:04:59,763
old and wise and stuck in your ways.

1468
01:04:55,724 --> 01:05:04,750
And instead of actually trying to change

1469
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:04,750
your mind when something changes, you

1470
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:04,750
don't.

1471
01:04:59,764 --> 01:05:12,836
You become not conservative in a

1472
01:05:12,836 --> 01:05:12,836
political sense but you actually try to

1473
01:05:12,836 --> 01:05:12,836
keep things status quo, commit to the

1474
01:05:12,836 --> 01:05:12,836
social norms.

1475
01:05:04,751 --> 01:05:14,850
But before that you don't.

1476
01:05:12,837 --> 01:05:20,912
You explore, you go to discos, you do

1477
01:05:20,912 --> 01:05:20,912
bungee jumping, you make new friends.

1478
01:05:14,851 --> 01:05:42,138
But if it's the case then that the spread

1479
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:42,138
of ideas depends upon being a child at

1480
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:42,138
heart for longer than that observation

1481
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:42,138
about at what point do we get to that

1482
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:42,138
epigenetically determined stage of

1483
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:42,138
neurodevelopment becomes absolutely

1484
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:42,138
crucial and just.

1485
01:05:20,914 --> 01:05:45,159
This is the final point.

1486
01:05:43,142 --> 01:05:54,255
An even longer timescale I'm wondering

1487
01:05:54,255 --> 01:05:54,255
whether the same maths can be borrowed or

1488
01:05:54,255 --> 01:05:54,255
the same concepts at least can be

1489
01:05:54,255 --> 01:05:54,255
borrowed.

1490
01:05:46,174 --> 01:06:04,291
To think about this kind of evolvability

1491
01:06:04,291 --> 01:06:04,291
from the perspective of people like

1492
01:06:04,291 --> 01:06:04,291
Stuart Kaufman and the like.

1493
01:05:55,262 --> 01:06:24,492
So selection for selectability so again,

1494
01:06:24,492 --> 01:06:24,492
if you're now reading these rate

1495
01:06:24,492 --> 01:06:24,492
constants or precisions in an

1496
01:06:24,492 --> 01:06:24,492
evolutionary setting what you are talking

1497
01:06:24,492 --> 01:06:24,492
about is basically the mutation rates or

1498
01:06:24,492 --> 01:06:24,492
the selectability which of course itself

1499
01:06:24,492 --> 01:06:24,492
can be subject to selective pressure.

1500
01:06:04,292 --> 01:06:52,774
So if you commit to this style of

1501
01:06:52,774 --> 01:06:52,774
thinking about belief updating in a

1502
01:06:52,774 --> 01:06:52,774
mathematical sense at many different

1503
01:06:52,774 --> 01:06:52,774
levels or different spatial temporal

1504
01:06:52,774 --> 01:06:52,774
scales, or at least temporal scales, then

1505
01:06:52,774 --> 01:06:52,774
it may be that the selection for

1506
01:06:52,774 --> 01:06:52,774
selectability or the selectability in and

1507
01:06:52,774 --> 01:06:52,774
of itself is exactly the same kind of

1508
01:06:52,774 --> 01:06:52,774
quantity that is the learnability.

1509
01:06:24,494 --> 01:07:16,952
And being young at heart for longer, that

1510
01:07:16,952 --> 01:07:16,952
just is the same kind of quantity that is

1511
01:07:16,952 --> 01:07:16,952
required right down to the level of

1512
01:07:16,952 --> 01:07:16,952
psychiatric suppression and sensory

1513
01:07:16,952 --> 01:07:16,952
tennuation that determines when we act to

1514
01:07:16,952 --> 01:07:16,952
keep the world constant as opposed to no,

1515
01:07:16,952 --> 01:07:16,952
we actually have to attend to this

1516
01:07:16,952 --> 01:07:16,952
evidence and update our beliefs.

1517
01:06:52,775 --> 01:07:29,087
And if that's the case, then this notion

1518
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:29,087
well, I just wanted to close on the

1519
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:29,087
importance of cultural niche

1520
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:29,087
construction.

1521
01:07:16,958 --> 01:07:38,177
Looked at through the lens of this rate

1522
01:07:38,177 --> 01:07:38,177
of adaptation.

1523
01:07:31,099 --> 01:07:57,365
Precision selectability at different

1524
01:07:57,365 --> 01:07:57,365
levels and how all of these couple to

1525
01:07:57,365 --> 01:07:57,365
each other in a sort of bootstrapping way

1526
01:07:57,365 --> 01:07:57,365
and whether that would be a useful view

1527
01:07:57,365 --> 01:07:57,365
of the spread of ideas sometimes

1528
01:07:57,365 --> 01:07:57,365
spreading and sometimes not spreading.

1529
01:07:38,178 --> 01:08:12,452
Can I just ask it did you laterally sort

1530
01:08:12,452 --> 01:08:12,452
of leverage sort of the well, actually

1531
01:08:12,452 --> 01:08:12,452
no.

1532
01:07:58,375 --> 01:08:15,479
This is basically setting up Daniel for

1533
01:08:15,479 --> 01:08:15,479
his perspective.

1534
01:08:12,452 --> 01:08:41,748
But I'm just wondering how much people in

1535
01:08:41,748 --> 01:08:41,748
evo devo and evolutionary psychology I'm

1536
01:08:41,748 --> 01:08:41,748
thinking here people like Cecilia Hayes

1537
01:08:41,748 --> 01:08:41,748
and cognitive Gadgets, how much they

1538
01:08:41,748 --> 01:08:41,748
think about these issues and whether

1539
01:08:41,748 --> 01:08:41,748
there's the opportunity or whether they

1540
01:08:41,748 --> 01:08:41,748
have a snakes and matters like view of

1541
01:08:41,748 --> 01:08:41,748
things from the point of view of

1542
01:08:41,748 --> 01:08:41,748
evolutionary psychology.

1543
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:43,760
And that's it.

1544
01:08:42,754 --> 01:08:44,771
That's all I have to say.

1545
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:44,774
Thank you.

1546
01:08:44,771 --> 01:08:46,797
Daniel, your turn.

1547
01:08:44,775 --> 01:08:51,840
Daniel: Thank you.

1548
01:08:50,834 --> 01:08:51,847
Wow.

1549
01:08:51,841 --> 01:09:08,958
Barely know which side of that hand axe

1550
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:08,958
to flake the multiscale learning is a

1551
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:08,958
great point and perspective.

1552
01:08:55,884 --> 01:09:50,373
We can just imagine the extreme cases in

1553
01:09:50,373 --> 01:09:50,373
the total acceptance of sensory evidence

1554
01:09:50,373 --> 01:09:50,373
world then that thing defined by its

1555
01:09:50,373 --> 01:09:50,373
revisiting potentially infrequently of

1556
01:09:50,373 --> 01:09:50,373
characteristic states that thing ceases

1557
01:09:50,373 --> 01:09:50,373
to be that thing in that whether that's

1558
01:09:50,373 --> 01:09:50,373
seen in some positive light, a neutral

1559
01:09:50,373 --> 01:09:50,373
entanglement light or a dean like light

1560
01:09:50,373 --> 01:09:50,373
it will cease to be that thing because it

1561
01:09:50,373 --> 01:09:50,373
will have just simply informationally if

1562
01:09:50,373 --> 01:09:50,373
not biomaterially accepted the generative

1563
01:09:50,373 --> 01:09:50,373
processes in positions.

1564
01:09:09,959 --> 01:09:57,447
And then the other extreme case would be

1565
01:09:57,447 --> 01:09:57,447
no attention, see no evil, hear no evil.

1566
01:09:50,374 --> 01:10:05,462
And in that case the trajectory from

1567
01:10:05,462 --> 01:10:05,462
Bayesian mechanics perspective is

1568
01:10:05,462 --> 01:10:05,462
massive.

1569
01:09:58,454 --> 01:10:14,551
It's a trajectory with so much inertia

1570
01:10:14,551 --> 01:10:14,551
that it can't be moved and that sounds

1571
01:10:14,551 --> 01:10:14,551
like it would ever happen.

1572
01:10:05,464 --> 01:10:35,768
But in fact, when we heard from Hector

1573
01:10:35,768 --> 01:10:35,768
and Michael that upon seeing an

1574
01:10:35,768 --> 01:10:35,768
innovation, a great ape does not take up

1575
01:10:35,768 --> 01:10:35,768
that innovation, their prior on how to

1576
01:10:35,768 --> 01:10:35,768
accomplish a behavior outcome or even at

1577
01:10:35,768 --> 01:10:35,768
a higher order, some functional outcome

1578
01:10:35,768 --> 01:10:35,768
can be seen as massive.

1579
01:10:14,552 --> 01:10:48,891
The Bayesian physical inertia of their

1580
01:10:48,891 --> 01:10:48,891
top down prior dominates these

1581
01:10:48,891 --> 01:10:48,891
potentially sparse or nonlinearly related

1582
01:10:48,891 --> 01:10:48,891
cues coming up from the bottom.

1583
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:57,983
So simply by not paying attention to the

1584
01:10:57,983 --> 01:10:57,983
bottom up cues, there is the imposition

1585
01:10:57,983 --> 01:10:57,983
of this top down mass.

1586
01:10:48,892 --> 01:11:07,020
And so that's a Bayesian mechanical way

1587
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:07,020
to understand well, if we had no priors

1588
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:07,020
at all, no prior, no problem, but then we

1589
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:07,020
dissolve.

1590
01:10:57,985 --> 01:11:14,092
But if we have the Titanic prior, then

1591
01:11:14,092 --> 01:11:14,092
it's a fragile strategy.

1592
01:11:07,021 --> 01:11:22,178
And so if the niche were very simple and

1593
01:11:22,178 --> 01:11:22,178
unchanging, that may be locally an

1594
01:11:22,178 --> 01:11:22,178
adaptive strategy.

1595
01:11:14,093 --> 01:11:30,252
And on certain axes of phenotype where

1596
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:30,252
there can be regularities, we do see

1597
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:30,252
those kinds of strategies.

1598
01:11:22,179 --> 01:11:45,402
Like a bacterium that has selected to

1599
01:11:45,402 --> 01:11:45,402
live in a constant temperature geothermal

1600
01:11:45,402 --> 01:11:45,402
niche may come to entrench in its protein

1601
01:11:45,402 --> 01:11:45,402
structure and in its gene regulatory

1602
01:11:45,402 --> 01:11:45,402
networks and so on.

1603
01:11:30,253 --> 01:12:01,503
An embodiment that sharpens and sharpens

1604
01:12:01,503 --> 01:12:01,503
and sharpens its capacity to compete in

1605
01:12:01,503 --> 01:12:01,503
that regularity from a temperature

1606
01:12:01,503 --> 01:12:01,503
perspective and therefore at the

1607
01:12:01,503 --> 01:12:01,503
detriment of fitness in changing

1608
01:12:01,503 --> 01:12:01,503
environments.

1609
01:11:45,403 --> 01:12:32,812
So that's one aspect is seeing learning

1610
01:12:32,812 --> 01:12:32,812
as this multiscale synergetic and ongoing

1611
01:12:32,812 --> 01:12:32,812
renegotiation process of the updating

1612
01:12:32,812 --> 01:12:32,812
across multiple scales, some spatial

1613
01:12:32,812 --> 01:12:32,812
temporal scales of which there are no

1614
01:12:32,812 --> 01:12:32,812
problems with talking about those using

1615
01:12:32,812 --> 01:12:32,812
the cognitive ontology like perception,

1616
01:12:32,812 --> 01:12:32,812
cognition and action.

1617
01:12:02,517 --> 01:12:49,987
But then some scales, especially beyond

1618
01:12:49,987 --> 01:12:49,987
the physical mechanisms that those

1619
01:12:49,987 --> 01:12:49,987
cognitive ontological terms arose from,

1620
01:12:49,987 --> 01:12:49,987
it becomes like, well, what does it mean

1621
01:12:49,987 --> 01:12:49,987
for the population to pay attention to

1622
01:12:49,987 --> 01:12:49,987
something?

1623
01:12:32,814 --> 01:12:54,034
Or what does it mean for the niche to pay

1624
01:12:54,034 --> 01:12:54,034
attention to something?

1625
01:12:49,988 --> 01:13:09,121
So that was one angle on the rates and it

1626
01:13:09,121 --> 01:13:09,121
speaks to the importance of having

1627
01:13:09,121 --> 01:13:09,121
flexible and interoperable mathematics

1628
01:13:09,121 --> 01:13:09,121
and statistics and analysis frameworks.

1629
01:12:56,050 --> 01:13:34,372
So we can just qualitatively, even in

1630
01:13:34,372 --> 01:13:34,372
conversation, start to see that as a

1631
01:13:34,372 --> 01:13:34,372
starting point, instead of needing to

1632
01:13:34,372 --> 01:13:34,372
argue up to that point of that being

1633
01:13:34,372 --> 01:13:34,372
important, for example, in pursuit of

1634
01:13:34,372 --> 01:13:34,372
transdisciplinary, synthesis,

1635
01:13:34,372 --> 01:13:34,372
conceptually, epistemically or so that we

1636
01:13:34,372 --> 01:13:34,372
could explain, predict, design, control,

1637
01:13:34,372 --> 01:13:34,372
create, pragmatically.

1638
01:13:09,123 --> 01:13:39,424
How can we take that multiscale insight

1639
01:13:39,424 --> 01:13:39,424
as our starting point?

1640
01:13:34,377 --> 01:13:46,491
And then I think that leads to a question

1641
01:13:46,491 --> 01:13:46,491
in the chat which I will ask now.

1642
01:13:40,431 --> 01:13:57,602
Mark Fruchman wrote early in the video

1643
01:13:57,602 --> 01:13:57,602
was the complaint that there was a lack

1644
01:13:57,602 --> 01:13:57,602
of evidence as to why certain things

1645
01:13:57,602 --> 01:13:57,602
occurred in the archaeological evidence

1646
01:13:57,602 --> 01:13:57,602
record?

1647
01:13:46,498 --> 01:14:01,587
How does active inference not suffer from

1648
01:14:01,587 --> 01:14:01,587
the same issue?

1649
01:13:57,608 --> 01:14:03,607
And so it's a key question.

1650
01:14:01,589 --> 01:14:05,622
Thank you, Mark, for asking.

1651
01:14:03,607 --> 01:14:15,722
And was the motivation for one of my

1652
01:14:15,722 --> 01:14:15,722
underlying motivations for even reading

1653
01:14:15,722 --> 01:14:15,722
and investigating with this lens was

1654
01:14:15,722 --> 01:14:15,722
great.

1655
01:14:05,623 --> 01:14:39,969
If we can describe everything and we have

1656
01:14:39,969 --> 01:14:39,969
this very interesting mathematics and so

1657
01:14:39,969 --> 01:14:39,969
on, how do we go from a technique and a

1658
01:14:39,969 --> 01:14:39,969
method to moving beyond some limitations

1659
01:14:39,969 --> 01:14:39,969
of previous analysis techniques with

1660
01:14:39,969 --> 01:14:39,969
respect especially to the historical

1661
01:14:39,969 --> 01:14:39,969
record?

1662
01:14:15,723 --> 01:14:51,087
We can go to Dean or whomever else has a

1663
01:14:51,087 --> 01:14:51,087
thought.

1664
01:14:47,042 --> 01:15:02,131
Dean: I can throw something in, but I'm

1665
01:15:02,131 --> 01:15:02,131
not sure it's going to satisfy directly

1666
01:15:02,131 --> 01:15:02,131
the question.

1667
01:14:55,124 --> 01:15:04,155
Maybe somebody else wants to throw

1668
01:15:04,155 --> 01:15:04,155
something in.

1669
01:15:02,137 --> 01:15:05,161
Karl: But.

1670
01:15:04,155 --> 01:15:16,272
Dean: I want to indirectly answer the

1671
01:15:16,272 --> 01:15:16,272
question and I'll loop into what I think

1672
01:15:16,272 --> 01:15:16,272
might be satisfying part of it.

1673
01:15:07,184 --> 01:15:24,356
I think one of the things that in

1674
01:15:24,356 --> 01:15:24,356
particular that to copy or not to copy

1675
01:15:24,356 --> 01:15:24,356
paper emphasizes is the observer's

1676
01:15:24,356 --> 01:15:24,356
perspective.

1677
01:15:16,274 --> 01:15:37,485
So rather than just looking at that as

1678
01:15:37,485 --> 01:15:37,485
something written down on the page,

1679
01:15:37,485 --> 01:15:37,485
taking up or absorbing that position, the

1680
01:15:37,485 --> 01:15:37,485
observer's perspective, I think what the

1681
01:15:37,485 --> 01:15:37,485
two papers.

1682
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:57,687
And one of the things that we tried to

1683
01:15:57,687 --> 01:15:57,687
highlight, and we're so grateful that

1684
01:15:57,687 --> 01:15:57,687
Michael and Karl and Hector Beren

1685
01:15:57,687 --> 01:15:57,687
Millidge to let us look at two things at

1686
01:15:57,687 --> 01:15:57,687
once was the idea that the papers both

1687
01:15:57,687 --> 01:15:57,687
raised the specter of and I put quotes

1688
01:15:57,687 --> 01:15:57,687
around this.

1689
01:15:37,486 --> 01:16:07,722
The narrative follows what the

1690
01:16:07,722 --> 01:16:07,722
implications of start with a story about

1691
01:16:07,722 --> 01:16:07,722
seeing phenomena x actually are.

1692
01:15:58,689 --> 01:16:14,797
Now, one of the implications of that is

1693
01:16:14,797 --> 01:16:14,797
that when you have a story, you can't

1694
01:16:14,797 --> 01:16:14,797
have gaps in the plot.

1695
01:16:08,736 --> 01:16:25,905
So people who are really story biased and

1696
01:16:25,905 --> 01:16:25,905
story forward, they want those gaps

1697
01:16:25,905 --> 01:16:25,905
filled in as quickly as possible.

1698
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:27,920
That's how we comprehend.

1699
01:16:25,905 --> 01:16:41,068
But the interesting thing is, if we are

1700
01:16:41,068 --> 01:16:41,068
actually active inference as opposed to

1701
01:16:41,068 --> 01:16:41,068
just seeing it as a subject matter or a

1702
01:16:41,068 --> 01:16:41,068
topic, we can take a game theory

1703
01:16:41,068 --> 01:16:41,068
approach.

1704
01:16:27,924 --> 01:16:48,134
And in games there will be random gas,

1705
01:16:48,134 --> 01:16:48,134
like Charles Saunders Pierce says, an

1706
01:16:48,134 --> 01:16:48,134
exhaustive inquiry.

1707
01:16:42,070 --> 01:16:53,188
Well, if it's exhaustive, we're also

1708
01:16:53,188 --> 01:16:53,188
going to need recovery and reflection and

1709
01:16:53,188 --> 01:16:53,188
so on.

1710
01:16:48,135 --> 01:16:55,209
So there will be gaps.

1711
01:16:53,189 --> 01:17:01,205
And so the snakes and ladders metaphor to

1712
01:17:01,205 --> 01:17:01,205
me is like, okay, perfect.

1713
01:16:56,210 --> 01:17:09,281
Now we're starting with a game as opposed

1714
01:17:09,281 --> 01:17:09,281
to the retelling or the manufacturing of

1715
01:17:09,281 --> 01:17:09,281
starting with a story.

1716
01:17:01,206 --> 01:17:15,348
So there's very different mechanisms in

1717
01:17:15,348 --> 01:17:15,348
the two approaches, right?

1718
01:17:09,289 --> 01:17:20,395
There are very different assumptions in

1719
01:17:20,395 --> 01:17:20,395
the two approaches.

1720
01:17:16,352 --> 01:17:46,654
And then the question around modeling as

1721
01:17:46,654 --> 01:17:46,654
perspective swapping kind of pivots on

1722
01:17:46,654 --> 01:17:46,654
the stuff that Michael was talking about

1723
01:17:46,654 --> 01:17:46,654
in terms of how is the change based

1724
01:17:46,654 --> 01:17:46,654
model, depth capacity either affording or

1725
01:17:46,654 --> 01:17:46,654
not affording that ability to play with

1726
01:17:46,654 --> 01:17:46,654
time as opposed to being captured by it?

1727
01:17:20,396 --> 01:17:52,714
Because in a story, you've written down

1728
01:17:52,714 --> 01:17:52,714
what the sequence is.

1729
01:17:46,654 --> 01:17:55,740
It's now been applied.

1730
01:17:52,715 --> 01:18:04,770
Now, you can interpret that, but in terms

1731
01:18:04,770 --> 01:18:04,770
of the actual effort of starting with a

1732
01:18:04,770 --> 01:18:04,770
story, it's now stabilized per se,

1733
01:18:04,770 --> 01:18:04,770
relatively speaking.

1734
01:17:55,741 --> 01:18:08,812
So let's start with a game.

1735
01:18:04,772 --> 01:18:13,866
And Karl's heard this before because I

1736
01:18:13,866 --> 01:18:13,866
asked him a question about a year and a

1737
01:18:13,866 --> 01:18:13,866
half, maybe two years ago.

1738
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:19,925
Is starting with a game is a prediction

1739
01:18:19,925 --> 01:18:19,925
matter, expertise strategy or a bias?

1740
01:18:13,866 --> 01:18:26,992
Starting with a story is a subject

1741
01:18:26,992 --> 01:18:26,992
matter, expertise strategy or a bias?

1742
01:18:20,933 --> 01:18:37,010
And you can understand why, if you're

1743
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:37,010
dealing with historical records, to fall

1744
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:37,010
into a default of, okay, well, we have to

1745
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:37,010
start with a story.

1746
01:18:26,996 --> 01:18:58,031
But I think what Hector and Michael are

1747
01:18:58,031 --> 01:18:58,031
at least asking us to have a conversation

1748
01:18:58,031 --> 01:18:58,031
around is, well, so what if we do bring

1749
01:18:58,031 --> 01:18:58,031
this other way of viewing the

1750
01:18:58,031 --> 01:18:58,031
circumstances, taking that game strategy

1751
01:18:58,031 --> 01:18:58,031
and putting it on the same shelf as the

1752
01:18:58,031 --> 01:18:58,031
story strategy?

1753
01:18:37,010 --> 01:19:13,040
So, again, if you look at the assumptions

1754
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:13,040
around why gaps have to be filled in as

1755
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:13,040
opposed to there will be gaps because the

1756
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:13,040
game is on something as simple as that.

1757
01:18:58,031 --> 01:19:19,046
And being able to hold the two things up

1758
01:19:19,046 --> 01:19:19,046
at once can sometimes at.

1759
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:21,048
Michael: Least tell you a little bit

1760
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:21,048
about.

1761
01:19:19,046 --> 01:19:28,055
Dean: Maybe some of the conditions that

1762
01:19:28,055 --> 01:19:28,055
you as the observer are.

1763
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:32,059
Inserting on what it is that you're

1764
01:19:32,059 --> 01:19:32,059
observing or examining.

1765
01:19:28,055 --> 01:19:41,068
Daniel: Was it Sherlock who said, the

1766
01:19:41,068 --> 01:19:41,068
game is afoot?

1767
01:19:38,065 --> 01:19:44,071
Maybe?

1768
01:19:44,071 --> 01:19:46,073
Dean: Right.

1769
01:19:45,072 --> 01:19:53,080
Daniel: Okay.

1770
01:19:53,079 --> 01:19:56,083
Yes, Karl, indeed.

1771
01:19:53,080 --> 01:20:06,087
Michael or Hector, how is this landing

1772
01:20:06,087 --> 01:20:06,087
with what you're thinking right now?

1773
01:19:57,084 --> 01:20:08,089
Hector: Michael, go ahead.

1774
01:20:06,087 --> 01:20:13,094
You always know better than I can pick up

1775
01:20:13,094 --> 01:20:13,094
from you.

1776
01:20:08,089 --> 01:20:20,101
Michael: I'm not quite sure where to

1777
01:20:20,101 --> 01:20:20,101
begin.

1778
01:20:18,099 --> 01:20:47,128
Perhaps thinking in terms of the

1779
01:20:47,128 --> 01:20:47,128
evolution of both the brain and the body

1780
01:20:47,128 --> 01:20:47,128
in the Guinness homo we and possibly

1781
01:20:47,128 --> 01:20:47,128
neanderthals also maybe from as early as

1782
01:20:47,128 --> 01:20:47,128
three quarters of a million or even at

1783
01:20:47,128 --> 01:20:47,128
least half a million.

1784
01:20:23,104 --> 01:21:29,164
Years ago seem to have undergone an

1785
01:21:29,164 --> 01:21:29,164
evolution towards a bimodal growth spurt

1786
01:21:29,164 --> 01:21:29,164
or growth curve caused by the adolescent

1787
01:21:29,164 --> 01:21:29,164
growth spurt following a period of

1788
01:21:29,164 --> 01:21:29,164
childhood slowing down of growth which is

1789
01:21:29,164 --> 01:21:29,164
unique in organis and seems to be related

1790
01:21:29,164 --> 01:21:29,164
in adolescence to some changes in terms

1791
01:21:29,164 --> 01:21:29,164
of the agility to react to complex

1792
01:21:29,164 --> 01:21:29,164
situations or not, as the case may be.

1793
01:20:48,128 --> 01:21:55,190
But even before that, in early childhood

1794
01:21:55,190 --> 01:21:55,190
I'm now talking about the first three or

1795
01:21:55,190 --> 01:21:55,190
four years of life our infants seem to

1796
01:21:55,190 --> 01:21:55,190
have exceeded already quite considerably

1797
01:21:55,190 --> 01:21:55,190
their cognitive ability, particularly

1798
01:21:55,190 --> 01:21:55,190
with regard to working memory when

1799
01:21:55,190 --> 01:21:55,190
contrasted against the present great

1800
01:21:55,190 --> 01:21:55,190
apes.

1801
01:21:30,165 --> 01:22:39,228
In other words, there has definitely been

1802
01:22:39,228 --> 01:22:39,228
not merely an expansion of the brain but

1803
01:22:39,228 --> 01:22:39,228
in particular changes in the connective

1804
01:22:39,228 --> 01:22:39,228
systems within the brain which clearly

1805
01:22:39,228 --> 01:22:39,228
must have an evolutionary physical basis

1806
01:22:39,228 --> 01:22:39,228
in terms of structure, both inter and, in

1807
01:22:39,228 --> 01:22:39,228
particular, intra neuronal structure

1808
01:22:39,228 --> 01:22:39,228
which, when I began to study medicine

1809
01:22:39,228 --> 01:22:39,228
physiology over a long time ago now,

1810
01:22:39,228 --> 01:22:39,228
1960, we could barely imagine.

1811
01:21:56,191 --> 01:23:00,243
It was only in the very end of the 1950s,

1812
01:23:00,243 --> 01:23:00,243
I think 59, if I'm not mistaken,

1813
01:23:00,243 --> 01:23:00,243
Professor Friston Blanket, correct me,

1814
01:23:00,243 --> 01:23:00,243
that Cambridge Henry Huxley was doing

1815
01:23:00,243 --> 01:23:00,243
began to do into neuronal studies on

1816
01:23:00,243 --> 01:23:00,243
accident potentials.

1817
01:22:41,230 --> 01:23:05,248
We were doing them in the lab at Oxford

1818
01:23:05,248 --> 01:23:05,248
as undergraduates about four years

1819
01:23:05,248 --> 01:23:05,248
later.

1820
01:23:00,243 --> 01:23:44,287
And then I was doing them under Professor

1821
01:23:44,287 --> 01:23:44,287
Power gleece at gettingham a few years

1822
01:23:44,287 --> 01:23:44,287
later, still with a practical

1823
01:23:44,287 --> 01:23:44,287
application, because we were studying the

1824
01:23:44,287 --> 01:23:44,287
changes in these following

1825
01:23:44,287 --> 01:23:44,287
orthocryphosphate poisoning, which had a

1826
01:23:44,287 --> 01:23:44,287
structural situation in Hens, which we

1827
01:23:44,287 --> 01:23:44,287
were working on, similar to those in

1828
01:23:44,287 --> 01:23:44,287
humans who had suffered from a massive

1829
01:23:44,287 --> 01:23:44,287
outbreak of poisoning at Agadir in

1830
01:23:44,287 --> 01:23:44,287
Morocco when a lot of local people were

1831
01:23:44,287 --> 01:23:44,287
sold American jet fuel oil rich in

1832
01:23:44,287 --> 01:23:44,287
orthopesyl phosphates for cooking with.

1833
01:23:05,248 --> 01:23:50,293
And there was an epidemic of many deaths

1834
01:23:50,293 --> 01:23:50,293
which is well known in medical history.

1835
01:23:45,287 --> 01:24:42,339
And so some of these early studies, even

1836
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:42,339
then, were having applications which now

1837
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:42,339
seem almost paleolithic when we think of

1838
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:42,339
the work which is being done on

1839
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:42,339
interneuronal and also on synaptic

1840
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:42,339
connectivity, neuronal transmission and

1841
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:42,339
the effects not merely of genetics, such

1842
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:42,339
as, for example, synaptic pooling, but

1843
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:42,339
also of epigenetic modifications, which

1844
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:42,339
no doubt we shall learn a lot more about

1845
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:42,339
in the coming decades, but which even now

1846
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:42,339
seem to be telling us that the increase

1847
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:42,339
in the kind of connectivity or what's the

1848
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:42,339
word I'm really looking for?

1849
01:23:50,293 --> 01:24:45,342
Perhaps connectivity is not the best word

1850
01:24:45,342 --> 01:24:45,342
within.

1851
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:58,355
The brain is far greater than anything

1852
01:24:58,355 --> 01:24:58,355
which is possible within even growing

1853
01:24:58,355 --> 01:24:58,355
chimpanzees, let alone the adults or

1854
01:24:58,355 --> 01:24:58,355
other great apes.

1855
01:24:45,342 --> 01:25:30,381
And this must have evolved somehow,

1856
01:25:30,381 --> 01:25:30,381
probably in relation to the appearance, I

1857
01:25:30,381 --> 01:25:30,381
suspect, of the slowing down of childhood

1858
01:25:30,381 --> 01:25:30,381
growth followed by the uniquely human

1859
01:25:30,381 --> 01:25:30,381
Homo adolescent growth spurt which was

1860
01:25:30,381 --> 01:25:30,381
completely absent one and a half million

1861
01:25:30,381 --> 01:25:30,381
years ago in early Homo erectus,

1862
01:25:30,381 --> 01:25:30,381
according to Professor Christopher Dean

1863
01:25:30,381 --> 01:25:30,381
and others.

1864
01:24:59,356 --> 01:25:56,407
And which must surely have been a

1865
01:25:56,407 --> 01:25:56,407
response or the evolutionary change must

1866
01:25:56,407 --> 01:25:56,407
have been a response to not merely some

1867
01:25:56,407 --> 01:25:56,407
kind of magical physiological change, but

1868
01:25:56,407 --> 01:25:56,407
more likely to the effects of what one

1869
01:25:56,407 --> 01:25:56,407
might call behavior responses.

1870
01:25:30,381 --> 01:26:10,415
And fundamentally it takes us back to

1871
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:10,415
active inference and to fundamental

1872
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:10,415
changes which are naturally slow to

1873
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:10,415
evolve.

1874
01:25:57,407 --> 01:26:28,433
And this is the part which is not

1875
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:28,433
recognized by most of our colleagues who

1876
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:28,433
work with living organisms, on living

1877
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:28,433
climates and for that matter, living

1878
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:28,433
human communities and individuals.

1879
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:41,445
Their perspective is not that I hope

1880
01:26:41,445 --> 01:26:41,445
they'll forgive me for saying this which

1881
01:26:41,445 --> 01:26:41,445
those of us who've been brought up in the

1882
01:26:41,445 --> 01:26:41,445
natural sciences naturally come to

1883
01:26:41,445 --> 01:26:41,445
expect.

1884
01:26:28,433 --> 01:27:02,461
They don't have the kind of cosmic

1885
01:27:02,461 --> 01:27:02,461
timescale and cosmic spatial scale of

1886
01:27:02,461 --> 01:27:02,461
things and of the slowness and the

1887
01:27:02,461 --> 01:27:02,461
imperceptibility of change which come

1888
01:27:02,461 --> 01:27:02,461
naturally to those of us brought up from

1889
01:27:02,461 --> 01:27:02,461
school days in a different tradition.

1890
01:26:41,446 --> 01:27:17,476
And I think this is very important

1891
01:27:17,476 --> 01:27:17,476
because I think there is a big divide

1892
01:27:17,476 --> 01:27:17,476
still between what 60 years ago we knew

1893
01:27:17,476 --> 01:27:17,476
as being named the two cultures.

1894
01:27:03,462 --> 01:27:50,509
I think this divide still exists as that

1895
01:27:50,509 --> 01:27:50,509
critic of our paper who claimed we were

1896
01:27:50,509 --> 01:27:50,509
postmodernists clearly represents the

1897
01:27:50,509 --> 01:27:50,509
more, shall we say, intuitive

1898
01:27:50,509 --> 01:27:50,509
relativistic view in which there is

1899
01:27:50,509 --> 01:27:50,509
something which some of them believe to

1900
01:27:50,509 --> 01:27:50,509
want to call an ethnographical pleasant,

1901
01:27:50,509 --> 01:27:50,509
which I think is a contradiction in

1902
01:27:50,509 --> 01:27:50,509
terms.

1903
01:27:17,476 --> 01:27:54,513
Otherwise there could have been no

1904
01:27:54,513 --> 01:27:54,513
evolution in behavior.

1905
01:27:50,509 --> 01:28:11,524
But which wants to compare instead of

1906
01:28:11,524 --> 01:28:11,524
contrast, as I would have it, what goes

1907
01:28:11,524 --> 01:28:11,524
on in a few generations, let's say in a

1908
01:28:11,524 --> 01:28:11,524
community, be it a small one, albeit a

1909
01:28:11,524 --> 01:28:11,524
large one today, with what went on over

1910
01:28:11,524 --> 01:28:11,524
many, many generations.

1911
01:27:54,513 --> 01:28:21,533
As I said, between 2,200,000 years ago,

1912
01:28:21,533 --> 01:28:21,533
there would have been at least 80,000

1913
01:28:21,533 --> 01:28:21,533
generations if each was 25 years long.

1914
01:28:12,525 --> 01:28:38,551
And even that is pushing it a bit, given

1915
01:28:38,551 --> 01:28:38,551
that adulthood in Homo erectus was very

1916
01:28:38,551 --> 01:28:38,551
likely achieved before the age of 15 and

1917
01:28:38,551 --> 01:28:38,551
reproductive success was probably or the

1918
01:28:38,551 --> 01:28:38,551
next generation was probably only a few

1919
01:28:38,551 --> 01:28:38,551
years away.

1920
01:28:21,534 --> 01:29:11,578
This is important because, as Professor

1921
01:29:11,578 --> 01:29:11,578
Christian remarked talking about cancer,

1922
01:29:11,578 --> 01:29:11,578
our longevity has allowed us to and of

1923
01:29:11,578 --> 01:29:11,578
course on better hygiene and medical

1924
01:29:11,578 --> 01:29:11,578
knowledge, but particularly our longevity

1925
01:29:11,578 --> 01:29:11,578
has permitted us to survive in ways that

1926
01:29:11,578 --> 01:29:11,578
were unthinkable perhaps in many parts of

1927
01:29:11,578 --> 01:29:11,578
the world barely, well, less than 100

1928
01:29:11,578 --> 01:29:11,578
years ago.

1929
01:28:40,553 --> 01:29:26,593
It wasn't merely thanks to antibiotics or

1930
01:29:26,593 --> 01:29:26,593
even better hygiene, but to increases in

1931
01:29:26,593 --> 01:29:26,593
standard of living going back perhaps

1932
01:29:26,593 --> 01:29:26,593
perhaps a few hundred years.

1933
01:29:12,579 --> 01:29:28,595
But let's not get into that.

1934
01:29:26,593 --> 01:29:30,596
What I really want to say is.

1935
01:29:28,595 --> 01:29:30,597
Karl: That.

1936
01:29:30,597 --> 01:29:58,625
Michael: Next week I have to have a small

1937
01:29:58,625 --> 01:29:58,625
basal cell neoplasm removed from the side

1938
01:29:58,625 --> 01:29:58,625
of my nose, which only at the age of 80

1939
01:29:58,625 --> 01:29:58,625
or 81 became noticeable, indicating that

1940
01:29:58,625 --> 01:29:58,625
some of these diseases which we now

1941
01:29:58,625 --> 01:29:58,625
regard as being part and parcel of our

1942
01:29:58,625 --> 01:29:58,625
humanity.

1943
01:29:32,599 --> 01:30:32,653
Or the aortic stenosis, which was I was

1944
01:30:32,653 --> 01:30:32,653
diagnosed with my first and only ever

1945
01:30:32,653 --> 01:30:32,653
incident of cardiac failure about a year

1946
01:30:32,653 --> 01:30:32,653
ago and has been successfully treated

1947
01:30:32,653 --> 01:30:32,653
thanks to our modern catheterization

1948
01:30:32,653 --> 01:30:32,653
processes that allow prosthetes to be

1949
01:30:32,653 --> 01:30:32,653
prosthetics to be placed on heart valves

1950
01:30:32,653 --> 01:30:32,653
by a long catheter from the groin.

1951
01:29:58,625 --> 01:30:36,657
This kind of thing would have been

1952
01:30:36,657 --> 01:30:36,657
unthinkable a few years ago.

1953
01:30:32,653 --> 01:30:55,676
In fact, I can remember as an

1954
01:30:55,676 --> 01:30:55,676
undergraduate, as a medical student

1955
01:30:55,676 --> 01:30:55,676
watching the first ever open heart

1956
01:30:55,676 --> 01:30:55,676
operations done by Alf Gunning which was

1957
01:30:55,676 --> 01:30:55,676
regarded in 1960, wherever it was 63 64

1958
01:30:55,676 --> 01:30:55,676
as being something that might never might

1959
01:30:55,676 --> 01:30:55,676
never succeed.

1960
01:30:36,657 --> 01:31:23,698
And nowadays these operations on our

1961
01:31:23,698 --> 01:31:23,698
heart are just regarded as everyday

1962
01:31:23,698 --> 01:31:23,698
occurs in cardiovascular units around the

1963
01:31:23,698 --> 01:31:23,698
world things are changing and they're

1964
01:31:23,698 --> 01:31:23,698
changing with an acceleration which we

1965
01:31:23,698 --> 01:31:23,698
can only barely appreciate even those of

1966
01:31:23,698 --> 01:31:23,698
us who've now outlived our four school

1967
01:31:23,698 --> 01:31:23,698
years and ten and are on the verge of

1968
01:31:23,698 --> 01:31:23,698
defunction.

1969
01:30:55,676 --> 01:31:56,731
However, we have to think in terms of the

1970
01:31:56,731 --> 01:31:56,731
and this again is important of the

1971
01:31:56,731 --> 01:31:56,731
exponential, if you like, rather crudely

1972
01:31:56,731 --> 01:31:56,731
scale at which things are happening and

1973
01:31:56,731 --> 01:31:56,731
which are so influencing many people,

1974
01:31:56,731 --> 01:31:56,731
many of our colleagues in the humanities

1975
01:31:56,731 --> 01:31:56,731
and in the social studies and in indeed

1976
01:31:56,731 --> 01:31:56,731
studies of animal behavior, including

1977
01:31:56,731 --> 01:31:56,731
climate behavior of course.

1978
01:31:24,699 --> 01:32:12,741
And this I think is detracting from an

1979
01:32:12,741 --> 01:32:12,741
appreciation of the long time scale and

1980
01:32:12,741 --> 01:32:12,741
the over which evolutionary processes

1981
01:32:12,741 --> 01:32:12,741
have necessarily still take place.

1982
01:31:57,732 --> 01:32:25,754
I don't believe in gerdschmidt's hopeful

1983
01:32:25,754 --> 01:32:25,754
monsters, magical genes some people

1984
01:32:25,754 --> 01:32:25,754
believe that there's a magical gene in

1985
01:32:25,754 --> 01:32:25,754
Homo sapiens switched on our cognitive

1986
01:32:25,754 --> 01:32:25,754
ability.

1987
01:32:12,741 --> 01:32:27,756
I think this is wishful thinking.

1988
01:32:25,754 --> 01:32:30,759
Indeed it's magical thinking in my view.

1989
01:32:28,757 --> 01:32:38,767
However, I suppose my own training would

1990
01:32:38,767 --> 01:32:38,767
lead me to want to say that.

1991
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:50,779
But there have been exceptions and one

1992
01:32:50,779 --> 01:32:50,779
exception I should like to mention by

1993
01:32:50,779 --> 01:32:50,779
name is an emeritus professor of

1994
01:32:50,779 --> 01:32:50,779
archaeology who is eminent in Paleolithic

1995
01:32:50,779 --> 01:32:50,779
studies at York University.

1996
01:32:38,767 --> 01:33:16,799
Now Professor Jeff Bailey who over 40

1997
01:33:16,799 --> 01:33:16,799
years ago was pointing out the

1998
01:33:16,799 --> 01:33:16,799
incommensurability of the timescales of

1999
01:33:16,799 --> 01:33:16,799
recent archaeology and if you like,

2000
01:33:16,799 --> 01:33:16,799
ethnography with those of the Paleolithic

2001
01:33:16,799 --> 01:33:16,799
and the Pleistocene and human evolution

2002
01:33:16,799 --> 01:33:16,799
and this was not really well regarded at

2003
01:33:16,799 --> 01:33:16,799
the time although it influenced me very

2004
01:33:16,799 --> 01:33:16,799
greatly.

2005
01:32:50,779 --> 01:33:25,808
There have been honorable exceptions who

2006
01:33:25,808 --> 01:33:25,808
have certainly influenced me.

2007
01:33:18,801 --> 01:33:30,813
We do, as I say, stand on the shoulders

2008
01:33:30,813 --> 01:33:30,813
of others.

2009
01:33:26,809 --> 01:34:16,853
We try to make one or two small comments

2010
01:34:16,853 --> 01:34:16,853
advances in both methodology and in

2011
01:34:16,853 --> 01:34:16,853
theoretical influences and deductions and

2012
01:34:16,853 --> 01:34:16,853
I think that we are finally coming to

2013
01:34:16,853 --> 01:34:16,853
possibly begin to see how to bring

2014
01:34:16,853 --> 01:34:16,853
together thanks to especially Professor

2015
01:34:16,853 --> 01:34:16,853
Friston's insights and methodological

2016
01:34:16,853 --> 01:34:16,853
what I'm trying to say, methodological

2017
01:34:16,853 --> 01:34:16,853
proposals and advances.

2018
01:33:30,813 --> 01:34:55,892
We're going to see that it might be

2019
01:34:55,892 --> 01:34:55,892
possible to square the circle, to bring

2020
01:34:55,892 --> 01:34:55,892
together the evolutionary, very slow

2021
01:34:55,892 --> 01:34:55,892
evolutionary development of the

2022
01:34:55,892 --> 01:34:55,892
hierarchical mind which characterizes our

2023
01:34:55,892 --> 01:34:55,892
Guinness and actual processes which can

2024
01:34:55,892 --> 01:34:55,892
underpin this undergird.

2025
01:34:16,853 --> 01:35:11,902
It can bring together the Darwinian view

2026
01:35:11,902 --> 01:35:11,902
which most of us espouse in the west with

2027
01:35:11,902 --> 01:35:11,902
a few exceptions, which are too well

2028
01:35:11,902 --> 01:35:11,902
known to be worth mentioning here.

2029
01:34:55,892 --> 01:35:15,906
I'm sure Daniel knows more about them

2030
01:35:15,906 --> 01:35:15,906
than I do.

2031
01:35:12,903 --> 01:35:45,936
But it's beginning to bring together the

2032
01:35:45,936 --> 01:35:45,936
theory of evolution of species by natural

2033
01:35:45,936 --> 01:35:45,936
selection of and within species and the

2034
01:35:45,936 --> 01:35:45,936
within part is important and it's

2035
01:35:45,936 --> 01:35:45,936
beginning to bring it together with what

2036
01:35:45,936 --> 01:35:45,936
we can appreciate about human behavior

2037
01:35:45,936 --> 01:35:45,936
which is so different from that of the

2038
01:35:45,936 --> 01:35:45,936
great apes.

2039
01:35:16,907 --> 01:36:17,962
And here I just like to make one final

2040
01:36:17,962 --> 01:36:17,962
point, which is that in another paper,

2041
01:36:17,962 --> 01:36:17,962
which Hector and I were co authors, along

2042
01:36:17,962 --> 01:36:17,962
with Professor Wright Reed of UCLA in

2043
01:36:17,962 --> 01:36:17,962
Neuroscience and Bio Behavior Reviews

2044
01:36:17,962 --> 01:36:17,962
last year, we pointed out that there has

2045
01:36:17,962 --> 01:36:17,962
been too much, in our view, hopeful or

2046
01:36:17,962 --> 01:36:17,962
wishful thinking about the human nature

2047
01:36:17,962 --> 01:36:17,962
of great apes.

2048
01:35:45,936 --> 01:36:32,977
Certainly their behavior is very

2049
01:36:32,977 --> 01:36:32,977
different from that of many other orders

2050
01:36:32,977 --> 01:36:32,977
of mammals and not to mention other

2051
01:36:32,977 --> 01:36:32,977
phyla, other classes.

2052
01:36:17,962 --> 01:36:34,979
Within the animal kingdom.

2053
01:36:32,977 --> 01:36:38,983
However, there is a big difference.

2054
01:36:35,980 --> 01:36:53,998
And I think this difference is best

2055
01:36:53,998 --> 01:36:53,998
emphasized by going back to the growth

2056
01:36:53,998 --> 01:36:53,998
curve of humans and of human behavior in

2057
01:36:53,998 --> 01:36:53,998
relation to our childhood.

2058
01:36:38,983 --> 01:37:20,019
In particular, our infants are capable by

2059
01:37:20,019 --> 01:37:20,019
about the age of three of putting of

2060
01:37:20,019 --> 01:37:20,019
combinatorial thinking in ways that are

2061
01:37:20,019 --> 01:37:20,019
virtually impossible or outside the scope

2062
01:37:20,019 --> 01:37:20,019
of the behavior of most great apes most

2063
01:37:20,019 --> 01:37:20,019
of the time and almost certainly in the

2064
01:37:20,019 --> 01:37:20,019
wild.

2065
01:36:53,998 --> 01:37:30,029
And this, I think, demands an explanation

2066
01:37:30,029 --> 01:37:30,029
which is more than simply saying no, the

2067
01:37:30,029 --> 01:37:30,029
apes are really more like us, it's just

2068
01:37:30,029 --> 01:37:30,029
that we don't recognize this.

2069
01:37:20,019 --> 01:37:39,038
No, I think that there is a difference

2070
01:37:39,038 --> 01:37:39,038
here and that the timescale has to be

2071
01:37:39,038 --> 01:37:39,038
taken into consideration, which it often

2072
01:37:39,038 --> 01:37:39,038
is not.

2073
01:37:30,029 --> 01:38:02,055
And most important and this brings me

2074
01:38:02,055 --> 01:38:02,055
back to my last point and the first one

2075
01:38:02,055 --> 01:38:02,055
which is that finally we're beginning to

2076
01:38:02,055 --> 01:38:02,055
get together thanks to Professor

2077
01:38:02,055 --> 01:38:02,055
Christensen's insights to seeing the

2078
01:38:02,055 --> 01:38:02,055
possibility of tying together the

2079
01:38:02,055 --> 01:38:02,055
biological evolution and if you like, the

2080
01:38:02,055 --> 01:38:02,055
psychological evolution.

2081
01:37:39,038 --> 01:38:13,066
Certainly I would say the neurobiological

2082
01:38:13,066 --> 01:38:13,066
evolution which has characterized Algenus

2083
01:38:13,066 --> 01:38:13,066
and characterizes it today in a unique

2084
01:38:13,066 --> 01:38:13,066
way.

2085
01:38:02,055 --> 01:38:16,069
And with that, that's my case.

2086
01:38:14,067 --> 01:38:25,078
Daniel: Thank you, Michael.

2087
01:38:23,076 --> 01:38:40,093
Many ways to go.

2088
01:38:37,090 --> 01:38:43,096
The dinner plate balanced on top of the

2089
01:38:43,096 --> 01:38:43,096
stick.

2090
01:38:40,093 --> 01:39:13,120
And I think that's the cognitive moment

2091
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:13,120
where the top down constraints and

2092
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:13,120
opportunities of our enabling

2093
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:13,120
architectures, which for a long time

2094
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:13,120
included primarily what was on board and

2095
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:13,120
then over the last several thousand years

2096
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:13,120
progressively included niche

2097
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:13,120
modifications and stigmaic modifications

2098
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:13,120
like writing.

2099
01:38:44,097 --> 01:39:29,135
And so, just like in the SPM toolkit for

2100
01:39:29,135 --> 01:39:29,135
studying brain function, there are brain

2101
01:39:29,135 --> 01:39:29,135
regions that have statistical connections

2102
01:39:29,135 --> 01:39:29,135
that aren't necessarily anatomically

2103
01:39:29,135 --> 01:39:29,135
connected and vice versa.

2104
01:39:14,121 --> 01:39:38,145
And when we consider information spaces

2105
01:39:38,145 --> 01:39:38,145
we have similar connectivity patterns.

2106
01:39:29,136 --> 01:40:07,168
Some are like information anatomy and

2107
01:40:07,168 --> 01:40:07,168
some are more like information physiology

2108
01:40:07,168 --> 01:40:07,168
in narrative or rhetorical spaces that

2109
01:40:07,168 --> 01:40:07,168
becomes part of our extended cognitive

2110
01:40:07,168 --> 01:40:07,168
selves and leave to others in the best

2111
01:40:07,168 --> 01:40:07,168
possible way those who want bright lines

2112
01:40:07,168 --> 01:40:07,168
of what is a self.

2113
01:39:38,145 --> 01:40:20,181
There are analytic frameworks that

2114
01:40:20,181 --> 01:40:20,181
respect continuities and discontinuities

2115
01:40:20,181 --> 01:40:20,181
with an emphasis on the respect, the

2116
01:40:20,181 --> 01:40:20,181
continuities.

2117
01:40:09,170 --> 01:40:47,208
We want them to be differentiable and

2118
01:40:47,208 --> 01:40:47,208
integrated and generalized coordinates of

2119
01:40:47,208 --> 01:40:47,208
motion and the continuous time active

2120
01:40:47,208 --> 01:40:47,208
inference models and the path integral

2121
01:40:47,208 --> 01:40:47,208
formulation and then the discrete time

2122
01:40:47,208 --> 01:40:47,208
generative model, which is also a map,

2123
01:40:47,208 --> 01:40:47,208
not the territory, helps us understand

2124
01:40:47,208 --> 01:40:47,208
saltatory maneuvers over multiple

2125
01:40:47,208 --> 01:40:47,208
timescales.

2126
01:40:20,181 --> 01:41:01,216
And looking back at the literature and

2127
01:41:01,216 --> 01:41:01,216
the discourse discussions like well, is

2128
01:41:01,216 --> 01:41:01,216
evolution gradual or general and

2129
01:41:01,216 --> 01:41:01,216
jumping?

2130
01:40:47,208 --> 01:41:05,220
These have been some of the biggest touch

2131
01:41:05,220 --> 01:41:05,220
points.

2132
01:41:01,216 --> 01:41:09,224
Are things slowly changing or fast

2133
01:41:09,224 --> 01:41:09,224
changing?

2134
01:41:06,221 --> 01:41:42,257
Those are where certain lines were drawn

2135
01:41:42,257 --> 01:41:42,257
and the methodological developments,

2136
01:41:42,257 --> 01:41:42,257
Bayesian graphs and so on and so on have

2137
01:41:42,257 --> 01:41:42,257
provided an instrumentalist lens that as

2138
01:41:42,257 --> 01:41:42,257
a matter of fact does integrate these

2139
01:41:42,257 --> 01:41:42,257
frameworks methodologically.

2140
01:41:10,225 --> 01:41:49,264
That is a claim that hardly anyone

2141
01:41:49,264 --> 01:41:49,264
dissents from.

2142
01:41:43,258 --> 01:42:26,295
And then what happens with respect to our

2143
01:42:26,295 --> 01:42:26,295
past, present and future when we realize

2144
01:42:26,295 --> 01:42:26,295
that we're, after the moment of intra and

2145
01:42:26,295 --> 01:42:26,295
among disciplinary tension, not pushing

2146
01:42:26,295 --> 01:42:26,295
the rock up the hill anymore or trying to

2147
01:42:26,295 --> 01:42:26,295
bring somebody else along, but gardening

2148
01:42:26,295 --> 01:42:26,295
in a space that already is how we need it

2149
01:42:26,295 --> 01:42:26,295
to be?

2150
01:41:51,266 --> 01:42:33,302
Michael: Could I make a comment?

2151
01:42:32,301 --> 01:43:26,349
Anil, Seth just occurred to me that when

2152
01:43:26,349 --> 01:43:26,349
we think of the formant frequencies that

2153
01:43:26,349 --> 01:43:26,349
affect all of the harmonics and other

2154
01:43:26,349 --> 01:43:26,349
aspects of our vocalizations whether

2155
01:43:26,349 --> 01:43:26,349
speech, chanting, song or even whistling,

2156
01:43:26,349 --> 01:43:26,349
perhaps it is unlikely or improbable that

2157
01:43:26,349 --> 01:43:26,349
these very many variants which occur in

2158
01:43:26,349 --> 01:43:26,349
different languages throughout the world

2159
01:43:26,349 --> 01:43:26,349
with their very, very different

2160
01:43:26,349 --> 01:43:26,349
characteristics and which almost

2161
01:43:26,349 --> 01:43:26,349
certainly Dean had begun to evolve quite

2162
01:43:26,349 --> 01:43:26,349
considerably by the time that earlier

2163
01:43:26,349 --> 01:43:26,349
writing appears about 5000 years ago.

2164
01:42:34,303 --> 01:43:52,375
But it's still unlikely that these can be

2165
01:43:52,375 --> 01:43:52,375
taken back into the past on a slow

2166
01:43:52,375 --> 01:43:52,375
evolving timescale such that they can be

2167
01:43:52,375 --> 01:43:52,375
related directly in a direct evolutionary

2168
01:43:52,375 --> 01:43:52,375
line to the vocalizations, let us say, of

2169
01:43:52,375 --> 01:43:52,375
great apes from a common ancestor that we

2170
01:43:52,375 --> 01:43:52,375
have with them 6 million years ago.

2171
01:43:27,350 --> 01:44:36,413
If we accept this unlikelihood, then it

2172
01:44:36,413 --> 01:44:36,413
seems equally unlikely to me that we can

2173
01:44:36,413 --> 01:44:36,413
talk about cultural transmission or

2174
01:44:36,413 --> 01:44:36,413
technological transmission in a slow,

2175
01:44:36,413 --> 01:44:36,413
uniform manner, invariant manner, over

2176
01:44:36,413 --> 01:44:36,413
the past, let's say, 2 million years,

2177
01:44:36,413 --> 01:44:36,413
from which we have information about

2178
01:44:36,413 --> 01:44:36,413
different technical skills and technical

2179
01:44:36,413 --> 01:44:36,413
abilities or at least, shall we say,

2180
01:44:36,413 --> 01:44:36,413
technical possibilities that were

2181
01:44:36,413 --> 01:44:36,413
exploited by our Guinness homo.

2182
01:43:54,377 --> 01:45:14,445
And therefore I would argue that it is

2183
01:45:14,445 --> 01:45:14,445
equally likely that the unawareness of

2184
01:45:14,445 --> 01:45:14,445
what people, what individuals were

2185
01:45:14,445 --> 01:45:14,445
actually enacting the unawareness by

2186
01:45:14,445 --> 01:45:14,445
bystanders onlookers, or even the very

2187
01:45:14,445 --> 01:45:14,445
protagonist protagonists of those

2188
01:45:14,445 --> 01:45:14,445
activities themselves was a continuous,

2189
01:45:14,445 --> 01:45:14,445
incontinenuous evolution over, let us

2190
01:45:14,445 --> 01:45:14,445
say, 80 or at least 60,000 generations in

2191
01:45:14,445 --> 01:45:14,445
a continuous, invariant manner.

2192
01:44:36,413 --> 01:45:31,462
This seems unlikely, and it seems equally

2193
01:45:31,462 --> 01:45:31,462
unlikely that the same is true of

2194
01:45:31,462 --> 01:45:31,462
different linguistic, shall we say,

2195
01:45:31,462 --> 01:45:31,462
abilities or aptitudes.

2196
01:45:14,445 --> 01:45:56,487
In other words, as Professor Christensen

2197
01:45:56,487 --> 01:45:56,487
has remarked in more than one paper, it

2198
01:45:56,487 --> 01:45:56,487
does seem that the advantages that were

2199
01:45:56,487 --> 01:45:56,487
taken were taken not in a continuous

2200
01:45:56,487 --> 01:45:56,487
manner, but in a discontinuous manner

2201
01:45:56,487 --> 01:45:56,487
when particular communicative skills had

2202
01:45:56,487 --> 01:45:56,487
developed.

2203
01:45:31,462 --> 01:46:21,506
In some groups, such as to be able to

2204
01:46:21,506 --> 01:46:21,506
widen their social scope for active

2205
01:46:21,506 --> 01:46:21,506
inference and had evolved by natural

2206
01:46:21,506 --> 01:46:21,506
selection within a shared framework of

2207
01:46:21,506 --> 01:46:21,506
adaptive prior beliefs favoring alignment

2208
01:46:21,506 --> 01:46:21,506
of common expectations and joint

2209
01:46:21,506 --> 01:46:21,506
activities affecting their ecological

2210
01:46:21,506 --> 01:46:21,506
niche, formation or development.

2211
01:45:56,487 --> 01:46:30,515
And this, it seems to me, is a very

2212
01:46:30,515 --> 01:46:30,515
expedient way of looking at how things

2213
01:46:30,515 --> 01:46:30,515
happened or likely to have happened.

2214
01:46:21,506 --> 01:46:42,527
Whether we will ever be able to produce a

2215
01:46:42,527 --> 01:46:42,527
theoretic in terms terms of formal

2216
01:46:42,527 --> 01:46:42,527
Bayesian proposal for this, I don't

2217
01:46:42,527 --> 01:46:42,527
know.

2218
01:46:30,515 --> 01:46:46,531
I would like to think so, but I really

2219
01:46:46,531 --> 01:46:46,531
don't know how.

2220
01:46:42,527 --> 01:47:10,549
I don't have the competence to begin to

2221
01:47:10,549 --> 01:47:10,549
do this myself, but I think that if it is

2222
01:47:10,549 --> 01:47:10,549
possible, it will certainly be, to put it

2223
01:47:10,549 --> 01:47:10,549
mildly, a challenge to those who tend to

2224
01:47:10,549 --> 01:47:10,549
think that there is a rapid jump or rapid

2225
01:47:10,549 --> 01:47:10,549
jump took place which, shall we say, a

2226
01:47:10,549 --> 01:47:10,549
small gap.

2227
01:46:46,531 --> 01:47:19,558
There's only a small gap that separates

2228
01:47:19,558 --> 01:47:19,558
us from the great apes of the equatorial

2229
01:47:19,558 --> 01:47:19,558
latitudes of the Old World.

2230
01:47:10,549 --> 01:47:26,565
I think that that took a much longer

2231
01:47:26,565 --> 01:47:26,565
period of time.

2232
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:46,585
And I don't think that to compare what

2233
01:47:46,585 --> 01:47:46,585
modern even, shall we say, in inverted

2234
01:47:46,585 --> 01:47:46,585
commerce, relatively simple or primitive

2235
01:47:46,585 --> 01:47:46,585
communities do, or how they act, is

2236
01:47:46,585 --> 01:47:46,585
commensurable with the behavior of modern

2237
01:47:46,585 --> 01:47:46,585
great apes.

2238
01:47:26,565 --> 01:48:08,601
Frankly, I would like to challenge this,

2239
01:48:08,601 --> 01:48:08,601
and I would hope that it might be

2240
01:48:08,601 --> 01:48:08,601
possible to produce a model which will

2241
01:48:08,601 --> 01:48:08,601
permit the theoretic, which will permit

2242
01:48:08,601 --> 01:48:08,601
the evolutionary process to be at least

2243
01:48:08,601 --> 01:48:08,601
interpreted in an alternative fashion.

2244
01:47:47,586 --> 01:48:15,608
Sorry, I didn't mean to be long winded.

2245
01:48:13,606 --> 01:48:16,609
I apologize.

2246
01:48:15,608 --> 01:48:31,624
Daniel: The classical information is

2247
01:48:31,624 --> 01:48:31,624
inscribed on the holograph in the

2248
01:48:31,624 --> 01:48:31,624
classical sedimentary layers is Daniel,

2249
01:48:31,624 --> 01:48:31,624
you're muted.

2250
01:48:19,612 --> 01:48:33,626
Sorry.

2251
01:48:32,625 --> 01:48:50,643
In the holograph, we have the inscription

2252
01:48:50,643 --> 01:48:50,643
of the classical information and the

2253
01:48:50,643 --> 01:48:50,643
quantum cognitive moment is the unpacking

2254
01:48:50,643 --> 01:48:50,643
or the rotation of what is on the

2255
01:48:50,643 --> 01:48:50,643
holograph into the information space.

2256
01:48:35,628 --> 01:48:58,651
And that, I think, was provocatively

2257
01:48:58,651 --> 01:48:58,651
raised when you asked, what if this was

2258
01:48:58,651 --> 01:48:58,651
all there ever was?

2259
01:48:51,644 --> 01:49:04,651
What if there wasn't a second hand axe to

2260
01:49:04,651 --> 01:49:04,651
find at that field site?

2261
01:48:59,652 --> 01:49:17,664
That's the interpretive moment and how we

2262
01:49:17,664 --> 01:49:17,664
interpret it is everything.

2263
01:49:05,652 --> 01:49:48,695
So in our final ten minutes of this

2264
01:49:48,695 --> 01:49:48,695
continuous 53.1, if each of us could

2265
01:49:48,695 --> 01:49:48,695
provide a kind of closing just several

2266
01:49:48,695 --> 01:49:48,695
minutes, or any several thoughts on

2267
01:49:48,695 --> 01:49:48,695
anything they'd like to add into this

2268
01:49:48,695 --> 01:49:48,695
session, or any directions that they

2269
01:49:48,695 --> 01:49:48,695
would like to seed or prompt for next

2270
01:49:48,695 --> 01:49:48,695
week's 53.2.

2271
01:49:19,666 --> 01:49:55,702
Hector: I have something, Daniel, that we

2272
01:49:55,702 --> 01:49:55,702
like to contribute before we close the

2273
01:49:55,702 --> 01:49:55,702
session.

2274
01:49:50,697 --> 01:50:09,710
I would like to take advantage of

2275
01:50:09,710 --> 01:50:09,710
Professor Friston with us because I have

2276
01:50:09,710 --> 01:50:09,710
some questions for him that have to do

2277
01:50:09,710 --> 01:50:09,710
with the free energy principle and the to

2278
01:50:09,710 --> 01:50:09,710
copy and not to copy, if you allow me to

2279
01:50:09,710 --> 01:50:09,710
just formulate it.

2280
01:49:55,702 --> 01:50:15,716
And first thing I would like to do is

2281
01:50:15,716 --> 01:50:15,716
that there were some losses in my

2282
01:50:15,716 --> 01:50:15,716
argumentation before.

2283
01:50:09,710 --> 01:50:21,722
I want to make clear that chimpanzees

2284
01:50:21,722 --> 01:50:21,722
learn socially.

2285
01:50:16,717 --> 01:50:22,723
This is something we know for sure.

2286
01:50:21,722 --> 01:50:28,729
So there is social learning and there is

2287
01:50:28,729 --> 01:50:28,729
even cultures, as Professor Andrew Witten

2288
01:50:28,729 --> 01:50:28,729
in St.

2289
01:50:22,723 --> 01:50:31,732
Andrews has proven, has demonstrated.

2290
01:50:28,729 --> 01:50:34,735
So there are some cultural tradition.

2291
01:50:31,732 --> 01:50:37,738
What is lacking is accumulation of

2292
01:50:37,738 --> 01:50:37,738
complexity.

2293
01:50:34,735 --> 01:50:41,742
What is called by Michael Tomasello

2294
01:50:41,742 --> 01:50:41,742
ratcheting up.

2295
01:50:37,738 --> 01:50:42,743
Okay?

2296
01:50:41,742 --> 01:50:48,749
So from one generation to the next, every

2297
01:50:48,749 --> 01:50:48,749
generation builds upon what was produced

2298
01:50:48,749 --> 01:50:48,749
in last generation.

2299
01:50:42,743 --> 01:50:51,752
So you have a tool implement and you

2300
01:50:51,752 --> 01:50:51,752
modify it, you make it more complex.

2301
01:50:48,749 --> 01:50:56,757
So our technology is the result of many

2302
01:50:56,757 --> 01:50:56,757
people accumulating their knowledge.

2303
01:50:51,752 --> 01:50:58,759
So it's kind of a joint endeavor.

2304
01:50:56,757 --> 01:50:59,760
This I wanted to make clear.

2305
01:50:58,759 --> 01:51:11,766
And what the models proposed, theoretical

2306
01:51:11,766 --> 01:51:11,766
and other kind of models, is that copying

2307
01:51:11,766 --> 01:51:11,766
with fidelity is key to have this

2308
01:51:11,766 --> 01:51:11,766
accuracy of complexity.

2309
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:36,791
So what I wanted to correct is that the

2310
01:51:36,791 --> 01:51:36,791
puzzle is that high rates of

2311
01:51:36,791 --> 01:51:36,791
innovativeness does not relate in an

2312
01:51:36,791 --> 01:51:36,791
action of complex technology because

2313
01:51:36,791 --> 01:51:36,791
there is a lack of copying with fidelity

2314
01:51:36,791 --> 01:51:36,791
what is called true imitation for some

2315
01:51:36,791 --> 01:51:36,791
and for Bruce and ambient, I think they

2316
01:51:36,791 --> 01:51:36,791
call it impersonation.

2317
01:51:12,767 --> 01:51:40,795
So I see someone doing something, I copy

2318
01:51:40,795 --> 01:51:40,795
the means and the result.

2319
01:51:36,791 --> 01:51:51,806
So chimpanzees are more prompted or

2320
01:51:51,806 --> 01:51:51,806
likely to emulate, which is copying the

2321
01:51:51,806 --> 01:51:51,806
end result, but by their own devices so

2322
01:51:51,806 --> 01:51:51,806
they can do different things to produce

2323
01:51:51,806 --> 01:51:51,806
the same result.

2324
01:51:40,795 --> 01:51:55,810
And it appears that coping with fidelity

2325
01:51:55,810 --> 01:51:55,810
is key.

2326
01:51:51,806 --> 01:51:58,813
And I'm cutting this long explanation.

2327
01:51:55,810 --> 01:52:03,812
I just wanted to correct this for the

2328
01:52:03,812 --> 01:52:03,812
sake of purity of science.

2329
01:51:58,813 --> 01:52:07,816
And now my question for Professor

2330
01:52:07,816 --> 01:52:07,816
Friston, if you allow me.

2331
01:52:03,812 --> 01:52:12,821
There is something interesting that the

2332
01:52:12,821 --> 01:52:12,821
team of Andrea Wheaton in St.

2333
01:52:08,817 --> 01:52:24,833
Andrews observed and that is in our

2334
01:52:24,833 --> 01:52:24,833
paper, that there was one instance that I

2335
01:52:24,833 --> 01:52:24,833
know of when there was this kind of

2336
01:52:24,833 --> 01:52:24,833
accumulation of complexity in

2337
01:52:24,833 --> 01:52:24,833
chimpanzees.

2338
01:52:12,821 --> 01:52:37,846
And the thing was possible because these

2339
01:52:37,846 --> 01:52:37,846
chimpanzees that combined two different

2340
01:52:37,846 --> 01:52:37,846
techniques to make something more

2341
01:52:37,846 --> 01:52:37,846
complex, we could be a kind of

2342
01:52:37,846 --> 01:52:37,846
primigenous example of what we call this

2343
01:52:37,846 --> 01:52:37,846
action of ratcheting up of behavior.

2344
01:52:24,833 --> 01:52:46,855
They did it because they had performed or

2345
01:52:46,855 --> 01:52:46,855
enacted these behaviors before.

2346
01:52:38,847 --> 01:53:00,863
And this is for me it's very intriguing

2347
01:53:00,863 --> 01:53:00,863
because thinking of how in 2010 there is

2348
01:53:00,863 --> 01:53:00,863
this paper by Priest and other people

2349
01:53:00,863 --> 01:53:00,863
where they talk of the generative models

2350
01:53:00,863 --> 01:53:00,863
under the free energy principle.

2351
01:52:46,855 --> 01:53:06,869
They talk of an active inference like

2352
01:53:06,869 --> 01:53:06,869
generative model are not a structural

2353
01:53:06,869 --> 01:53:06,869
representation, nothing that you enact.

2354
01:53:00,863 --> 01:53:08,871
You enter with your whole body, so to

2355
01:53:08,871 --> 01:53:08,871
speak.

2356
01:53:06,869 --> 01:53:10,873
Correct me if I'm wrong, Professor

2357
01:53:10,873 --> 01:53:10,873
Friston.

2358
01:53:09,871 --> 01:53:21,884
So I'm thinking that these guys, these

2359
01:53:21,884 --> 01:53:21,884
impulses that were able to have this

2360
01:53:21,884 --> 01:53:21,884
complex tool product, they had enacted

2361
01:53:21,884 --> 01:53:21,884
the behaviors independently before.

2362
01:53:10,873 --> 01:53:32,895
So I'm wondering if this enacting the

2363
01:53:32,895 --> 01:53:32,895
behavior before allowed them to overcome

2364
01:53:32,895 --> 01:53:32,895
surprise health because this would be

2365
01:53:32,895 --> 01:53:32,895
would go to the core of this idea of an

2366
01:53:32,895 --> 01:53:32,895
active inference.

2367
01:53:22,885 --> 01:53:45,908
Like if you have performed those things

2368
01:53:45,908 --> 01:53:45,908
separately with your body then the

2369
01:53:45,908 --> 01:53:45,908
surprise is kind of bounded and you can

2370
01:53:45,908 --> 01:53:45,908
produce this more complex product.

2371
01:53:32,895 --> 01:53:49,912
I mean, I don't know if that was clear

2372
01:53:49,912 --> 01:53:49,912
enough but this is something that is

2373
01:53:49,912 --> 01:53:49,912
intriguing to me.

2374
01:53:45,908 --> 01:53:59,922
Daniel: Sure Karl, as your last thoughts,

2375
01:53:59,922 --> 01:53:59,922
feel free to address that or anything

2376
01:53:59,922 --> 01:53:59,922
else.

2377
01:53:54,917 --> 01:54:04,921
Karl: Well, yes, I'm just reflecting on

2378
01:54:04,921 --> 01:54:04,921
that, I think very important question.

2379
01:54:01,918 --> 01:54:29,946
I mean it is certainly the case that all

2380
01:54:29,946 --> 01:54:29,946
of the active inference formalism both in

2381
01:54:29,946 --> 01:54:29,946
neuroscience but also in terms of

2382
01:54:29,946 --> 01:54:29,946
ensemble dynamics and self organization

2383
01:54:29,946 --> 01:54:29,946
of collections of things rests upon a

2384
01:54:29,946 --> 01:54:29,946
generative model of the consequences of

2385
01:54:29,946 --> 01:54:29,946
my action.

2386
01:54:04,921 --> 01:54:43,960
Even to the extent you could argue from a

2387
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:43,960
telogical perspective that all our

2388
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:43,960
perception is just in service of deciding

2389
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:43,960
what's the best thing to do next and

2390
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:43,960
literally how to move next.

2391
01:54:30,947 --> 01:54:48,965
Just acknowledging there are only a very

2392
01:54:48,965 --> 01:54:48,965
limited number of ways you can actually

2393
01:54:48,965 --> 01:54:48,965
change the universe.

2394
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:52,969
You can either move a striated muscle or

2395
01:54:52,969 --> 01:54:52,969
you can secrete something.

2396
01:54:48,965 --> 01:54:54,971
There's not much else you can do.

2397
01:54:53,969 --> 01:55:09,980
And so it becomes very important in terms

2398
01:55:09,980 --> 01:55:09,980
of your characteristic state of being and

2399
01:55:09,980 --> 01:55:09,980
to have the right generative models that

2400
01:55:09,980 --> 01:55:09,980
choose the right ways to move your

2401
01:55:09,980 --> 01:55:09,980
muscles or to secrete things.

2402
01:54:55,971 --> 01:55:20,991
And that places embodied action or having

2403
01:55:20,991 --> 01:55:20,991
embodiment and activism at the center of

2404
01:55:20,991 --> 01:55:20,991
the generative models.

2405
01:55:10,981 --> 01:55:49,020
And it certainly makes sense to me from

2406
01:55:49,020 --> 01:55:49,020
the point of view of both a statistician

2407
01:55:49,020 --> 01:55:49,020
and a machine learning enthusiast that it

2408
01:55:49,020 --> 01:55:49,020
would be much easier to revise or update

2409
01:55:49,020 --> 01:55:49,020
a generative model in the sense you were

2410
01:55:49,020 --> 01:55:49,020
intimating in terms of accommodating the

2411
01:55:49,020 --> 01:55:49,020
next kind of behavior.

2412
01:55:20,991 --> 01:56:09,034
I'm not sure whether this was composing a

2413
01:56:09,034 --> 01:56:09,034
sequence of behaviors but certainly being

2414
01:56:09,034 --> 01:56:09,034
able to incrementally, embellish or adopt

2415
01:56:09,034 --> 01:56:09,034
a behavior if you had already a precursor

2416
01:56:09,034 --> 01:56:09,034
that was inherent in the structure or

2417
01:56:09,034 --> 01:56:09,034
could be scaffolded within your

2418
01:56:09,034 --> 01:56:09,034
generative model.

2419
01:55:50,021 --> 01:56:22,047
So the idea here is that everything that

2420
01:56:22,047 --> 01:56:22,047
goes on on the outside has to be in some

2421
01:56:22,047 --> 01:56:22,047
structural and dynamic way recapitulated

2422
01:56:22,047 --> 01:56:22,047
on the inside in order for you to control

2423
01:56:22,047 --> 01:56:22,047
the outside.

2424
01:56:09,034 --> 01:56:29,054
And this of course is at the heart of

2425
01:56:29,054 --> 01:56:29,054
early formulations of things like the

2426
01:56:29,054 --> 01:56:29,054
free free energy principle.

2427
01:56:22,047 --> 01:56:50,075
Cybernetics Roshbi's Good Regulator

2428
01:56:50,075 --> 01:56:50,075
theorem would say literally that and

2429
01:56:50,075 --> 01:56:50,075
subsequent formulations in terms of laws

2430
01:56:50,075 --> 01:56:50,075
of requisite variety that the degrees of

2431
01:56:50,075 --> 01:56:50,075
freedom on the inside have to correspond

2432
01:56:50,075 --> 01:56:50,075
to the degrees of freedom on the things

2433
01:56:50,075 --> 01:56:50,075
on the outside that have to be

2434
01:56:50,075 --> 01:56:50,075
controlled, namely the environment.

2435
01:56:30,055 --> 01:56:53,077
So I think that's absolutely right.

2436
01:56:51,076 --> 01:57:09,088
That if you had already established

2437
01:57:09,088 --> 01:57:09,088
through having an internal model of a

2438
01:57:09,088 --> 01:57:09,088
particular behavior, a particular way of

2439
01:57:09,088 --> 01:57:09,088
deploying my actuators and making sense

2440
01:57:09,088 --> 01:57:09,088
of that and being able to infer, it was

2441
01:57:09,088 --> 01:57:09,088
me that did that and this.

2442
01:56:53,077 --> 01:57:39,118
Is me doing that and this is the kind of

2443
01:57:39,118 --> 01:57:39,118
thing that I do then you are in a much

2444
01:57:39,118 --> 01:57:39,118
stronger position to learn or incorporate

2445
01:57:39,118 --> 01:57:39,118
or to imitate something that you have

2446
01:57:39,118 --> 01:57:39,118
witnessed novo and mathematically, the

2447
01:57:39,118 --> 01:57:39,118
reason why that becomes easier is that

2448
01:57:39,118 --> 01:57:39,118
the cost of belief updating in its most

2449
01:57:39,118 --> 01:57:39,118
general mathematical sense.

2450
01:57:09,088 --> 01:57:48,127
So I'm not talking about personal

2451
01:57:48,127 --> 01:57:48,127
beliefs, I'm just talking about any

2452
01:57:48,127 --> 01:57:48,127
belief entailed by the structure, the

2453
01:57:48,127 --> 01:57:48,127
connectivity, the activity, or indeed

2454
01:57:48,127 --> 01:57:48,127
say, neural activity.

2455
01:57:39,118 --> 01:57:52,131
Any belief updating comes along with a

2456
01:57:52,131 --> 01:57:52,131
cost.

2457
01:57:49,127 --> 01:58:01,134
And that cost can be variously

2458
01:58:01,134 --> 01:58:01,134
articulated in terms of a failure to

2459
01:58:01,134 --> 01:58:01,134
generalize informationally.

2460
01:57:53,131 --> 01:58:07,140
Thermodynamically it has a cost via

2461
01:58:07,140 --> 01:58:07,140
Landauer's principle.

2462
01:58:01,134 --> 01:58:17,150
But mathematically it's interesting that

2463
01:58:17,150 --> 01:58:17,150
the cost is the relative entropy between

2464
01:58:17,150 --> 01:58:17,150
your prior and posterior beliefs.

2465
01:58:07,140 --> 01:58:21,154
So this will be like a computational

2466
01:58:21,154 --> 01:58:21,154
cost, a complexity cost.

2467
01:58:17,150 --> 01:58:40,173
What that means is to make these steps,

2468
01:58:40,173 --> 01:58:40,173
be they gradual or be they big jumps,

2469
01:58:40,173 --> 01:58:40,173
they can only be made if they're, to use

2470
01:58:40,173 --> 01:58:40,173
one of your words, if they are suitably

2471
01:58:40,173 --> 01:58:40,173
bounded in terms of the complexity,

2472
01:58:40,173 --> 01:58:40,173
cost.

2473
01:58:21,154 --> 01:58:50,183
Which means the degree of belief updating

2474
01:58:50,183 --> 01:58:50,183
literally, the relative entropy or the

2475
01:58:50,183 --> 01:58:50,183
chaos divergence between the implicit

2476
01:58:50,183 --> 01:58:50,183
posterior and prior after the update is

2477
01:58:50,183 --> 01:58:50,183
sufficiently small.

2478
01:58:40,173 --> 01:58:57,190
Which means, literally, you're changing

2479
01:58:57,190 --> 01:58:57,190
your mind in a sort of mathematical

2480
01:58:57,190 --> 01:58:57,190
sense, in the most efficient way

2481
01:58:57,190 --> 01:58:57,190
possible.

2482
01:58:50,183 --> 01:59:21,208
So if you're already close to and have

2483
01:59:21,208 --> 01:59:21,208
the right kind of generative model to do

2484
01:59:21,208 --> 01:59:21,208
imitation of a de novo behavior in virtue

2485
01:59:21,208 --> 01:59:21,208
of the fact you've done it before, that

2486
01:59:21,208 --> 01:59:21,208
means that the complexity cost of

2487
01:59:21,208 --> 01:59:21,208
actually committing to that and revising

2488
01:59:21,208 --> 01:59:21,208
and belief updating your generative model

2489
01:59:21,208 --> 01:59:21,208
now becomes within a tenable range, it

2490
01:59:21,208 --> 01:59:21,208
becomes acceptable.

2491
01:58:57,190 --> 01:59:25,212
So that would certainly make sense if I

2492
01:59:25,212 --> 01:59:25,212
were simulating that.

2493
01:59:21,208 --> 01:59:47,234
And we've been talking about ways of all

2494
01:59:47,234 --> 01:59:47,234
sorts of different questions, the

2495
01:59:47,234 --> 01:59:47,234
questions in the chat Dean's questions

2496
01:59:47,234 --> 01:59:47,234
and the plea from Michael, how would you

2497
01:59:47,234 --> 01:59:47,234
make this mechanics work in terms of

2498
01:59:47,234 --> 01:59:47,234
resolving various hypotheses and evincing

2499
01:59:47,234 --> 01:59:47,234
insights into how all of this works?

2500
01:59:25,212 --> 01:59:50,237
I think at the end of the day you're

2501
01:59:50,237 --> 01:59:50,237
going to have to simulate it.

2502
01:59:47,234 --> 02:00:07,947
And this has not been done very much in

2503
02:00:07,947 --> 02:00:07,947
the setting of the free energy principle

2504
02:00:07,947 --> 02:00:07,947
or active inference certainly, but there

2505
02:00:07,947 --> 02:00:07,947
now are a number of papers coming out

2506
02:00:07,947 --> 02:00:07,947
within the past year or a few months and

2507
02:00:07,947 --> 02:00:07,947
it might be interesting to go to those.

2508
01:59:51,238 --> 02:00:23,441
And I'm thinking of, for example, a paper

2509
02:00:23,441 --> 02:00:23,441
by Casper Hest group that looked I think

2510
02:00:23,441 --> 02:00:23,441
the final write up is something like One

2511
02:00:23,441 --> 02:00:23,441
Small Step for Mankind or something, but

2512
02:00:23,441 --> 02:00:23,441
it was originally entitled Ideas Worth

2513
02:00:23,441 --> 02:00:23,441
Spreading.

2514
02:00:07,985 --> 02:00:45,608
So it's explicitly using the basic

2515
02:00:45,608 --> 02:00:45,608
mechanics of belief updating to look at

2516
02:00:45,608 --> 02:00:45,608
how spreadable, how copyable certain

2517
02:00:45,608 --> 02:00:45,608
beliefs were framed in the, in the

2518
02:00:45,608 --> 02:00:45,608
current age of the internet and sort of

2519
02:00:45,608 --> 02:00:45,608
tweets and the like.

2520
02:00:23,448 --> 02:01:09,492
And the same kind of theme has also been

2521
02:01:09,492 --> 02:01:09,492
taken up by colleagues of Conor Hines and

2522
02:01:09,492 --> 02:01:09,492
Maxwell Ransted in terms of simulating

2523
02:01:09,492 --> 02:01:09,492
epistemic communities where coming back

2524
02:01:09,492 --> 02:01:09,492
to Michael's use of the importance of

2525
02:01:09,492 --> 02:01:09,492
epistemic spread and copying and

2526
02:01:09,492 --> 02:01:09,492
imitation being basically an epistemic

2527
02:01:09,492 --> 02:01:09,492
spread that's now starting to be

2528
02:01:09,492 --> 02:01:09,492
simulated.

2529
02:00:45,620 --> 02:01:23,890
So I think we are on the cusp in the

2530
02:01:23,890 --> 02:01:23,890
world of active inference, at least on

2531
02:01:23,890 --> 02:01:23,890
having mechanics out there that's

2532
02:01:23,890 --> 02:01:23,890
actually realized in silicon that you can

2533
02:01:23,890 --> 02:01:23,890
start to intervene on a model, things of

2534
02:01:23,890 --> 02:01:23,890
this kind or that kind.

2535
02:01:10,502 --> 02:01:32,724
And speaking to Dean's question earlier

2536
02:01:32,724 --> 02:01:32,724
on, it strikes me that people in

2537
02:01:32,724 --> 02:01:32,724
Climatology must face exactly the same

2538
02:01:32,724 --> 02:01:32,724
problem.

2539
02:01:24,897 --> 02:01:36,112
Is this missing data or did this thing

2540
02:01:36,112 --> 02:01:36,112
actually go away?

2541
02:01:32,735 --> 02:01:41,601
And of course, it's a really important

2542
02:01:41,601 --> 02:01:41,601
question to answer that.

2543
02:01:36,128 --> 02:01:54,091
In principle, you can do it if you've got

2544
02:01:54,091 --> 02:01:54,091
a model of those legacy data, but you

2545
02:01:54,091 --> 02:01:54,091
have to have a model, which means you got

2546
02:01:54,091 --> 02:01:54,091
to basically have an in silico sort of

2547
02:01:54,091 --> 02:01:54,091
digital twin of the way you think it

2548
02:01:54,091 --> 02:01:54,091
works.

2549
02:01:41,605 --> 02:02:09,184
And then you can compare two generative

2550
02:02:09,184 --> 02:02:09,184
models or digital twins on the way it

2551
02:02:09,184 --> 02:02:09,184
works and see which has the greatest

2552
02:02:09,184 --> 02:02:09,184
evidence in light of the historical data

2553
02:02:09,184 --> 02:02:09,184
that clearly hasn't been done either in

2554
02:02:09,184 --> 02:02:09,184
climate change or or your field.

2555
02:01:54,092 --> 02:02:12,216
But in principle, that would be the way

2556
02:02:12,216 --> 02:02:12,216
to do that.

2557
02:02:09,185 --> 02:02:13,220
I'm sorry.

2558
02:02:12,216 --> 02:02:13,229
I've gone over time.

2559
02:02:13,220 --> 02:02:14,236
Sorry.

2560
02:02:14,230 --> 02:02:18,276
Daniel: It's totally fine.

2561
02:02:17,260 --> 02:02:26,353
My reflection on that again, anyone else

2562
02:02:26,353 --> 02:02:26,353
who wants to have any last words is in

2563
02:02:26,353 --> 02:02:26,353
the Par et al.

2564
02:02:19,285 --> 02:02:28,374
2022 textbook.

2565
02:02:26,353 --> 02:02:51,602
There is attention to two kinds of

2566
02:02:51,602 --> 02:02:51,602
surprise plain surprise, which is an

2567
02:02:51,602 --> 02:02:51,602
information theoretic quality quantity

2568
02:02:51,602 --> 02:02:51,602
associated with an observation with

2569
02:02:51,602 --> 02:02:51,602
respect to its prior, and the second

2570
02:02:51,602 --> 02:02:51,602
being Bayesian surprise, which is what

2571
02:02:51,602 --> 02:02:51,602
you just described the cost of movement,

2572
02:02:51,602 --> 02:02:51,602
which is related to the divergence of

2573
02:02:51,602 --> 02:02:51,602
movement.

2574
02:02:28,376 --> 02:03:08,719
And I think in that difference between

2575
02:03:08,719 --> 02:03:08,719
that was surprising and I surprised me or

2576
02:03:08,719 --> 02:03:08,719
I have changed, are two aspects of the

2577
02:03:08,719 --> 02:03:08,719
scenario.

2578
02:02:51,604 --> 02:03:15,779
Because to just be surprised doesn't

2579
02:03:15,779 --> 02:03:15,779
require one to change at all.

2580
02:03:09,723 --> 02:03:20,835
One can just say every day, wake up,

2581
02:03:20,835 --> 02:03:20,835
check the news, I can't believe that

2582
02:03:20,835 --> 02:03:20,835
they're doing that.

2583
02:03:15,781 --> 02:03:23,861
You can just be surprised again and

2584
02:03:23,861 --> 02:03:23,861
again.

2585
02:03:20,836 --> 02:03:28,917
And then there's the Bayesian surprise

2586
02:03:28,917 --> 02:03:28,917
with the belief updating.

2587
02:03:24,876 --> 02:03:39,020
And that is really where the semantic

2588
02:03:39,020 --> 02:03:39,020
advances of the Bayesian mechanics are

2589
02:03:39,020 --> 02:03:39,020
just beginning to mature.

2590
02:03:28,917 --> 02:03:47,100
Dean: I hate the last word, but I hope it

2591
02:03:47,100 --> 02:03:47,100
isn't so.

2592
02:03:43,062 --> 02:03:57,201
The provocations have been dropped in 530

2593
02:03:57,201 --> 02:03:57,201
and 53 one, and Daniel and Dean have

2594
02:03:57,201 --> 02:03:57,201
avoided being provocateurs so far.

2595
02:03:47,100 --> 02:04:17,341
What I'm really looking forward to is in

2596
02:04:17,341 --> 02:04:17,341
53.2 whether we can declare game on,

2597
02:04:17,341 --> 02:04:17,341
because I think if we do, if we have that

2598
02:04:17,341 --> 02:04:17,341
to look forward to, we can push the

2599
02:04:17,341 --> 02:04:17,341
narrative to the end of the timetable and

2600
02:04:17,341 --> 02:04:17,341
we can start to continue to enhance the

2601
02:04:17,341 --> 02:04:17,341
conversation that we initiated today.

2602
02:03:57,207 --> 02:04:27,442
So I just want to say thank you to all of

2603
02:04:27,442 --> 02:04:27,442
you for all of the care and passion that

2604
02:04:27,442 --> 02:04:27,442
you shared with us.

2605
02:04:17,342 --> 02:04:30,470
And I'm just happy as can be.

2606
02:04:27,443 --> 02:04:31,483
Michael: So thank you.

2607
02:04:30,470 --> 02:04:33,508
Daniel: Thank you.

2608
02:04:33,502 --> 02:04:35,520
Any final comments?

2609
02:04:33,508 --> 02:04:36,535
Hector or Michael?

2610
02:04:35,521 --> 02:04:40,579
Hector: No, just thank you for having us

2611
02:04:40,579 --> 02:04:40,579
and sharing this time with us.

2612
02:04:37,545 --> 02:04:42,594
It was been great discussion.

2613
02:04:41,580 --> 02:04:43,603
Thank you.

2614
02:04:42,595 --> 02:04:46,634
Michael: Well, thank you very much.

2615
02:04:44,618 --> 02:04:48,653
It's been.

2616
02:04:47,643 --> 02:04:50,672
Most profitable session.

2617
02:04:48,655 --> 02:04:52,695
Daniel: Excellent.

2618
02:04:51,684 --> 02:04:55,722
Karl, any last thoughts?

2619
02:04:53,703 --> 02:04:58,757
Karl: Again, I've enjoyed it greatly.

2620
02:04:56,731 --> 02:05:06,777
It's a real pleasure to actually speak to

2621
02:05:06,777 --> 02:05:06,777
all of you, but in particular, Michael

2622
02:05:06,777 --> 02:05:06,777
and Hector.

2623
02:05:00,714 --> 02:05:13,849
You're actually using words, spoken

2624
02:05:13,849 --> 02:05:13,849
words, very embodied, very active.

2625
02:05:07,785 --> 02:05:14,857
Lovely.

2626
02:05:14,850 --> 02:05:16,870
Daniel: Excellent.

2627
02:05:15,862 --> 02:05:16,878
All right.

2628
02:05:16,872 --> 02:05:17,889
Till next time.

2629
02:05:16,879 --> 02:05:18,899
Thank you, everybody.

2630
02:05:17,889 --> 02:05:21,920
Michael: Bye.
