00:07 _Daniel:_

Hello and welcome.
It's March 23, 2023, and we're here in ActInf Livestream 53.1.
Welcome to the Active Inference Institute.
We're a participatory online institute that is communicating, learning, and practicing applied active inference.
This is a recorded and an archived live stream, so please provide us with feedback so we can improve our work.

00:34 All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome and we'll be following video etiquette for live streams.
Head over to ActiveInference.org to learn more about the institute and learning groups and projects.
We're here in Active Stream 53.1 and we are discussing a dyad of papers.
We are discussing "Snakes and Ladders in Paleoanthropology" by Hector, Karl and Michael.
Welcome, Karl.

01:07 And we're discussing "To Copy or Not to Copy" with Hector and Michael.
Previously in 53.0, we, dean and I provided some background and context on these papers.
And today in 53.1 1st, we will all say hello.
Then we will feature a presentation by Michael Walker.
And following the presentation, we'll have a discussion and see where it goes.

01:36 So with no further ado, we will all say hello.
The non authors first, then the authors concluding with Michael and leading into the presentation.
So I'm Daniel, I'm a researcher in California, and it was a great fun and learning experience to work on the dot zero.
So I'm really excited to continue in the dot one today to Dean.

02:03 _Dean:_

Thanks, Daniel.

02:04 I'm Dean.
I'm here in Calgary.
I guess the only thing I want to just highlight today is the fact that it's 32323.
And I love that bouncing back and forth between those two quantities.
So I'm really excited.

02:21 And I will pass this to Hector.

02:25 _Hector:_

Okay.
Hello, I'm Hector Manrique, and I will just summarize what brought me here.
Basically, I graduated in psychology.
That was in Spain, and then I did my PhD in psychobiology.

02:38 So I came to learn the biological basis of behavior.
Then I recycled into a comparative psychology.
When I joined the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Lepstick, I was lucky that I could work with Joseph Kai under his supervision.
And then I had the opportunity to work with the four species of grade eight.
And after that, I came to know Michael in a conference on human evolution.

03:05 And we have been working together ever since.
So we are now good friends and also colleagues.
And that's it, basically.

03:14 _Daniel:_

Thank you, Hector and Karl, if you'd like to say hello, please.

03:21 _Karl:_

So, my name is Karl Friston.

03:23 I'm a professor of neuroscience at University College London and a colleague of our main speakers today, who I've never seen in person, but now at least I have seen you, virtually.
They're very nice to meet you.

03:39 _Daniel:_

Great.
Thank you, Karl.
Michael, the floor is yours.

03:43 _Michael:_

Michael, I'm very pleased to say hello to Karl, whom I've not yet met personally, but we are now meeting visually, virtually.
I'm a retired professor at the University of Murphy in Spain.
I'm getting rather ancient I shall be 82 years old tomorrow.
But anyway, that doesn't stop me from digging up Neanderthal skeletons and even earlier things here in Spain.
I'm very pleased to be presenting this.

04:12 It's a case of the dog that didn't bark in the night.

04:20 So whenever you want me to begin, I can begin.

04:25 _Daniel:_

Daniel yes, the slide is up and it is all you.

04:31 _Michael:_

Well, this is really a paper which we have out on syrup in an earlier version.
It's now been modified for a different journal to the one that was originally intended.
But the presentation is in order to make a complicated subject fairly simple to comprehend.

04:55 I call it Snakes and Ladders because stuff appears, disappears and reappears throughout human evolution over the past at least 2 million years, if not before.
And the question is, why is there not a continuous trajectory?
Let's move on to the next one.
Daniel right.
The traditional view is the received wisdom is looking at what paleoanthropology can tell us from the outside.

05:25 And there are two basic methodologies, one based on geology and Darwinism, which gives us one view of what it is all about and another view down on the bottom right is all based on what modern people do and what modern apes do.
And it's all by so called analogy.
Let's move on to the next one.

05:52 Both of these have drawbacks.
I won't go into this in detail.
You're welcome to take these slides away provided you don't publish them because they do include some material drawn from other sources which I haven't acknowledged formally.
But the drawbacks to Darwinism is really the difficulty of being able to prove anything in the past by in its own terms.
Okay, we can accept it as being a valid way of explaining natural phenomena and evolution.

06:25 The drawback to using modern analogies is the spatiotemporal incompetence, incommensurability with regard to the regular irregularities and irregular regularities of which things appear, disappear and reappear throughout the Pleistocene record and indeed prehistory in general.
Let's move on to the next one.
So instead of looking at it from the outside, let's look at it from the inside.
And this has an advantage of commensurability and compatibility at the same time with the gradual evolution of and within species by natural selection and at the same time with the documented behavior of organis hormone.
Well, this is from Karl's and his colleagues latest book.

07:18 I'm sure you all know it.
So let's move on to the next one.

07:24 Right.
In the 1960s, some archaeologists were certainly reflecting, including some Cambridge friends of mine, on the ostensive presence of irregular regularities and regular irregularities in the archaeological record.
And a well known one is the Case of the Wheel.
Wheels were used for action in Central Asia and the Middle East from about 5000 years ago.
They were invented separately in Mesoamerica just over 2000 years ago.

07:57 They weren't used for any kind of practical purpose, but just for moving effigies statues and toys around.
And this seems to have been completely independent inventions.
Okay, so let's say that surprising enactment with stuff was the exception in early humans.
Just see if I can I'm getting a little bit tied up with two screens here because I'm working on my own screen.
At the same time, cognitive surprises were probably disregarded in general because surprising spontaneous enactment with stuff distracted attention away from daily routines.

08:45 If we go back 2 million years ago, when homophobic appears from the earlier bipedal humans or human ancestors, we begin to see the establishment of the Guinness homo, especially in Africa.
And I'm sure that spontaneous enactment with stuff certainly occurred innumerable times without gaining any foothold as technological or cultural, if you like, communal behavioral traditions passed down for generation generation, because this is unlikely.
If we take a period, let's say, from 2 million years ago, even one, even to half a million years ago, that's one and a half million years.
That's 60,000 generations.
If you consider one generation as lasting 25 years, most unlikely that things could be handed down on father the son over 60,000 generations.

09:39 So let's take a different take on this.
Let's go back to looking at it from the inside, from considerations of the free energy principle and active inference.
It follows that active inference underpins biological behavior that has exploratory or epistemic and exploitative or pragmatic aspects sensitive respectively to ambiguity and risk enabling epistemic and ambiguity resolving responses to support pragmatic, reward seeking ones.
And therefore it is not implausible that the snakes and ladders appearance, disappearance and reappearance of stuff over, let's say, the past 2 million years, is the existence of organis owe to no more than the extreme rarity with which unorthodox epistemic exploration of possibly advantageous opportunities in the human influence resulted from incipient, albeit imperceptibly, evolving neurobiological propensities in brains or hierarchical mechanistic minds to generate exploitative pragmatic attention via active inference to cognitive surprises from untoward behavioral incidents which weren't expressed more onto the next one.

10:55 So let's forget about let's move on to the next one.

10:58 Daniel, let's forget about this.
How do I get from here to there?
How do I get from a lump of rock to, let's say, a hand axe by spontaneous inactive?
What could provoke this?
Okay, let's move on.

11:11 Next slide.

11:15 I excavated a site.
I am excavating.
The site almost a million years old, which has one hand axe remains of burning lots of small stone tools.
You can see some burnt ones on the bottom left, but then this is the dog that didn't bark.
Why are there no more hand axe?

11:34 Why do we only have one big lodge bifacially shaped cutting tool, the hand axe and hundreds of tiny little tools?
People don't ask that question.
Let's move on to the next one.
They explain it away.

11:51 People really didn't bother with cutting up big animals.
They didn't need big cutting tools.
Well, that's one way of looking at it.
Prove it.
People lost stuff and so there should be more of these around.

12:06 But there's only one.
Well, prove that there's only one because people took them away and used them elsewhere.
Move that.
The problem is these so called interpretations only explain stuff away.
Could it well have been a Valentine gift or not?

12:23 Next slide.
So let's get back to Snakes and Ladders.
We have fire at the site there agent too many sites with fire either.
And again, the general assumption is that there was continuity once trouble with moving my other screen.
Just a moment.

12:49 How can I move this on?
Excuse me a moment.
My eyesight isn't all that good these days.
No, that's not doing it.
Excuse me 1 minute.

13:06 It's not bad.
So we have the file, as I just mentioned and I don't believe that suddenly fire was brought to humans or invented and then passed on from father to son.
Nor do I believe, as we'll see in the next slide, that this was done along with an expansion can we have the next one, Daniel, please?
Of these early Homo erectus moving from Africa outwards, carrying a hand axe, carrying little embers and spreading the good news.
No, next slide.

13:42 Don't think it worked like that.
Stuff couldn't have been passed on over all that period of time, over all that space.
This is not commensurable with modern human or modern ape behavior.
Let's move on to the next one, Daniel.
So how do we begin?

13:57 We begin by bashing stone enactment with stuff.
And that started over 3 million years ago.
We know that.
Next one, please.

14:07 And then we have another problem, which is that there is almost exponential increase in stuff, artifacts made by people, and yet the brain, as we know from fossil evidence, does not follow that trajectory, which is the red one.
The brain increases and gradually flattens out at the same time as the number of stuff that people make increases or almost exponentially.
Let's have the next one.
So here we have another problem to try and solve.

14:40 And one possibility which was pointed out by the late Professor Philip Tobias is that as the brain increases, we see in the Paleoanthropological record an increase in the variation in the volume of the brain, suggesting perhaps that there is some relaxation of selection pressure as Homo evolved.
And we have the next that's a point which is worth bearing in mind.
So let's think about another way of how all this may or may not have happened.

15:19 A methodological perspective grounded in fundamental biological and physical relationships gives us a postimonious prosaic deflationary account.
All these appearances, disappearances and reappearances of behavior outcomes and so called skills.
Now, Professor Nicholas Timbergen, who was a professor of zoology at Oxford and got a Nobel Prize, was fascinated with four questions.
Let's have the next slide and see what those are.
He wanted to know how we can relate evolution at four different levels that of ontogeny and that of the mechanisms, the causation, that of phylogeny and that of adaptation or survival value.

16:08 And these are related diacronically and synchronically, as one can see from this little diagram into also what might call proximate and ultimate explanatory approaches if we look at the problem in hand.
Let's have the next slide, Daniel.
We can see that here we have in the diatronic aspects paleolithic behavior in general in the synchronic one stuff appearing at different times in the top right.
As far as ontogeny is concerned, we have something which I'll mention later on, but we need to make a big deal of it that we know that there was a lack of adolescent growth split and a relatively small brain in Homo erectus one and a half million years ago compared with ours, about two thirds the size of ours.

17:10 When we think of mechanisms here we come to looking at it from the inside.
We have the matter of awareness involving active inference, MathStream, flea energy principle and variation of flea energy.
And we have what happens at the neurophysiological level allowing a complexity of behavior between hand and stuff, hand and stone in this case, or stones.
We have to involve matters such as working memory, long term memory, perspective memory and indeed constructive memory.
So how does all this tie into Phylogen?

17:47 Here we have a Snakes and Ladder model based on the empirical evidence from the past and we have survival value that clearly existed because Homo erectus eventually gave rise to us.
Next slide please.
So let's get back to Snakes and Ladders.
Here we have the man looking at the lock and saying how the hell do I get this handax out of it?
And now the next one.

18:10 And in the same way with the next slide we have the Snakes and Ladders, a game of pure chance and of random outcomes.
But next slide please.
We are not dealing with completely random outcomes.
There's a big difference between, on the one hand, a spatiotemporal Snakes and Ladders game of chance as if throws of a dice alone thought about appearances, disappearances and reappearances behavioral phenomena unrelated to responses of the hierarchical mechanistic minds of earlier homo and on the other hand a snakes.
And that is analogy for regular irregularities and irregular regularities in the behavioral record owing to individual idiosyncratic or an orthodox activity and the receptivity to it or not of an observing hierarchical mechanistic mind, whether that's an onlooker, a bystander or that even the self same man making the woman making the hand axe in this case.

19:08 Okay, let's move on to the next one.
And here we begin to see that the heterogeneous composition of a picture of appearances by chance alone, disappearances by chance alone, reappearances by chance alone renders it useless as a model for making predictions that can be compared or contrasted with archaeological findings of early paradigm science.
Whereas our preferred model, by focusing on the information, theoretic and energetic constraints on biological neurobiological and psychosocial evolution, affords us a picture that lets us consider whether the model's focus could offer a rational interpretation of the material record.
And in particular of the uneven distribution across the old world things like Stonehand axes and evidence of the tending of fire or even visiting caves.
Things that chimpanzees and gorillas don't do.

20:03 Between 2 million and let's say 200,000 in this case, 80,000 generations.
Okay, let's move on very quickly.
And the rest of it in fact, you're welcome to read for yourselves rather than have me read it out to you because basically you can take this away or copy it or download it.
What we are arguing is that by about a million years ago adaptive evolution was underway of cerebral human neurobiological propensities that support prospective and constructive memory in making artifacts or working with stuff, doing unusual unorthodox things together with short term working memory including that of the hands haptic working memory, long term working memory and long term procedural and episodic memory.
Those propensities were phylogenetic outcomes of existential ontogenetic programs adapted through natural selection for satisfying the bioenergetic requirements of organisms, organis in particular.

21:05 So here we have the basis of our argument that in a small band of communicatively challenged Homo erectus one member spontaneous enactment often went unregarded.
Disregarded it was regarded as useless, pointless and unhelpful to gathering the food requirements needed for surviving from day to day.
And we can refer the matter to the free energy principle applied to ecological niche construction variation on neuroethology, to use Professor Fisson's phrase, whereby selection of adaptive action volcanisms involves their assessment of the alternatives in terms of the expected variation of free energy expressed as the combination of epistemic and pragmatic affordance.
So these early individuals a million and a half years ago, who experienced cognitive surprises, to say prediction errors about effective variation of the energy, were unlikely to introduce novel behavior, whether affected or seen by them, that could gain.

22:10 A foothold in their community before those communicative skills had developed in some groups that widened their social scope for active influence and involved by natural selection within a shared framework of adaptive prior beliefs favoring alignment of common expectations and joint activities that affected their ecological niche.

22:30 Well, that's the basis of our argument.
Of course.
It's no more, as it were, falsifiable or refutable within the terms of the data from the past than the alternatives that I began with.
But at least it makes rational, coherent sense and fits in with the Darwinist view of evolution of species and within species by natural selection.
It is a more prosaic and deflationary argument than the ones that people, archaeologists and anthropologists like to use and which I began with.

23:06 So you can take this away and read it, read it carefully.
What we're arguing is that by a million years ago sorry, can you move on Daniel.
And again so let's just stick with this.

23:32 I think we can go through this rather quickly, move on to the next one.
Right, let's go back to a million and a half years ago.
Let's look at this stuff.
We know there's a skeleton about a kid only nine years old, according to Professor Christopher, dean of University College, professor of Dental Anatomy and he studied the teeth.
And whilst at one time this individual had the same height as myself, I'm about short about 1 meter 57.

24:04 Nevertheless, although he had our adult size, he was only a child at nine years old and his skull had almost certainly stopped growing.
It was only two thirds or less than the size of ours.
But these people were clearly making hand axes and lighting fires or at least carrying fire around from time to time and visiting caves.
We know there was one in South Africa bonded Cave and doing stuff that is sort of halfway between what a chimp does and what our modern primitive peoples are supposed to have been able to do, let's say 10,000 or 20,000 years ago during the last ice age.
But there's a big time difference here.

24:43 And when we think about this kid, clearly he was developing much sooner than we do.
He became an adult probably before the age of 15 years old whereas our brains are not fully formed for at least another ten years.
So this would have limited have the next slide.
You can take these away and look at them.
I don't have to read all this out in detail to you.

25:05 But in short, these people were precociously developed and therefore much more limited.
They would be behavior, perhaps more like, let's say, a modern, I don't know, four or five year old child of modern adult height and with a small brain.
Well, they were not doing too badly if they kept making things making stuff with their hands, doing things and then forgetting about them because their main purpose was to survive and they had to eat and find something to eat and they couldn't spend all their time in these rather than productive activities.
So let's say that let's take the active inference approach to this and suggest that from the perspective of the free energy principle and active inference, the differences that we're seeing contextualize the experience dependent learning and planning and influence on a small scale.

26:14 But they reflect the structural neurobiological priors that could be inherited by epigenetic and genetic processes within the hierarchically mechanistic minds that were evolving and which certainly were not the same as those of modern chimpanzees and gorillas that don't do all these things that even our Homo ancestors were doing one and a half million years ago.

26:44 Well, okay, I accept that the absence of evidence need not imply the evidence of that absence, but that fails to satisfy most people or many people, particularly scientists like ourselves.
Certainly the Darwin's argument had power has power.
But if we take a look at early human evolution from the perspective of the free energy principle our proposal invokes an overarching methodological paradigm grounded in an existential principle fundamental to the evolution of living organisms and is consistent both with the long periods of time and the vast periods of space in the Old world that we are dealing with, let's say 60,000 or even 80,000 generations across three continents.
And nevertheless explain allows us to interpret from the point of view of natural selection what was going on, albeit imperceptibly slowly by natural selection and adaptation.

27:59 At least some of the irregular, regularities and regular irregularities of phenomena attributable to homo in the Pleistocene record reflect the kinds of plausibly anomalous behavioral outcomes that doubtless occurred often in a snakes and ladders model of evolution in early members of our genus, regardless of what species we want to call their skeletal remains, whether Neanderthals or merectus modern Homo whatever.

28:26 Okay?
These are plausible outcomes of behavior by individuals who failed to maintain orthodox behavioral responses when faced with cognitive supply zones and who showed, almost certainly particular neurobiological propensity to exploring unorthodox possibilities.
A propensity that's involved further in humans and in great apes which, unlike even our very young children, seem unable to envisage how things might be as well as how they actually are.
As the Canadian psychologist and primatologist professor Anne Russen has written.
And with that, I will end my little introduction, which I hope will explain a rather complicated approach to producing a novel interpretation of how human behavior was evolving during a very long period of time and across a very large period of space on our planet during the Pleistocene.

29:32 Thank you.

29:41 _Daniel:_

Thank you, Michael.
Yes, that is the end of the presentation.

29:47 Great.

29:51 Thank you for the presentation.
We will now move into discussion, so I'm going to open up a blank page and then Hector, Karl and Dean, please feel free to join.

30:13 Dean.
First.

30:17 _Dean:_

Of all, Michael, I'm not sure what your stature is in person, but after that presentation, you're a giant in my mind and that's not said out of me needing to compliment you.
Thank you for the presentation.
I'm curious now because the approach that Daniel and I took was one of trying to parameterize a space between the two papers.
I'm curious now what Hector thinks in terms of sort of holding up that other side of this set, in particular with the paper on to copy or not to copy, and how we might now sort of gain some depth perception around things like zone of about a surprising now that we've had sort of the introduction with the presentation that Michael just shared.

31:14 _Daniel:_

Hector, feel free to give a first comment.

31:18 _Hector:_

Okay, so you want me to comment on to copy or not to copy on this one or how they yeah.

31:24 _Dean:_

The zone abound is surprising in particular given sort of the groundwork that Michael has just established.

31:31 _Hector:_

Okay, perfect.
I would like to start by thanking both Michael, Andy Clark for this collaboration, because I think I was thinking in the Aphorism by Newton, while attributed to Newton, is not original from him on the shoulder of giants.

31:49 And I think I feel a bit shy here among this huge intellect and I feel very privileged too.
So I want to thank them both, Andy Clark especially because he has been so kind as to revise our two papers.
I mean, in one he's cohort, but in the other he revised it and give us very good indications and advice.
So I'm very grateful because we all know how busy he is, so he took the time to help us and I'm very grateful.
And coming back to the papers, the thing is that Michael came up with this original idea of explaining this appearance and disappearance of hand access in terms of the free energy principle.

32:34 And when we were working on that paper, I thought that the same argument could apply naturally to the case of grade apes.
And the thing that there was this parcel in grade apes studies when they study this kind of social transmission or culture, or cumulative culture, or cumulative technology.
And what happens is that there are many reports on chimpanzees being innovative, meaning innovative like they invent new things, new behaviors, or new exploitation of resources by applying new tools.
So there are many instances of this, but there is a puzzle here, as there is the other puzzle with appearance and disappearances of technology, that there is no cumulative technology.
So this is a puzzle for me, because if you have one creature who is able to be so inventive, how is it possible that it doesn't accumulate complexity in the technology?

33:31 So the same cognitive machinery, so to speak, should be able to produce more complex artifacts, so there is no kind of accumulation of complexity across generations.
And that's a big puzzle for me.
So I thought maybe the free energy principle was useful here too.
So I just made this analogy.
So it's Michael who opened up this new avenue thanks to the work of Karl.

33:59 And I just took advantage to think maybe it is because new things are too surprising for gray waves.
So there are features that cannot cope with high levels of surprise.
If I'm talking too fast or too much, just tell me.
I think you are following the agreement, I assume.
Is it okay?

34:22 So the idea is that if something that I observe is too surprising, I have to deal with this high level of surprise.
And also by reading a paper by Andy Clark.
The title was Predictive Coding.
It was in behavioral brain sciences, if I remember correctly.
He talked of one can see very surprising things if he's able to credit the sensory information as opposed to the top down prediction.

34:55 And this again helped me to make the connection.
So maybe the problem is that from the point of view of the observer of an innovation, if something is too surprising, I have to consider if I trust the sensory information as opposed to the top down prediction.
And I need to decide, I mean, I'm talking I need to decide like it was some kind of animistic thing, but you know what I mean.
So there is the weighting up of sensory information and top down prediction.
So my idea was that perhaps what happens here is that these great apes, when they observe something new and it's surprising, they kind of do not credit it.

35:43 So it's like they basically do not register that because it's a mismatch with the prediction and for some reason they are not able to credit essential information.
And this brings us to the concept of the zones of bandage surprisals.
So these zones is an imaginary concept.
It's something we use to explain what happens.
So it's like if you have a wide tone of boundary, surprisingly, it means that things that are not in accordance with your top down predictions, things that deviate much from these top down predictions, can be handled because you are able to bounce surprising.

36:28 So you have cognitive mechanisms that help you to bounce surprising, even when you are facing huge mismatches with regard to your expectations, to previous expectations.
So that will be the main thing here.
So we propose that in gray days there has not been these changes in the brain that allow them to bounce surprise, where things deviate markedly from what they expect.
Only indeed when they deviate slightly from what they expect, so they can accumulate complexity, provided the things they observe that are new are not very different from what they expected.
I think I will stop here.

37:16 Even I can make more precision.
But that is the basic idea.
I don't know if Michael is in agreement or he wants to add something, because I hope I have my limitation with language too.
So perhaps he can't help me out.

37:32 Michael, do you have something to add or to precise?

37:37 _Michael:_

Not really.
Fundamentally, I accept what Hector is saying.
His idea was certainly novel to me when he put it forward, that we have to think about the observers, not merely the practitioners, because anthropologists and archaeologists and indeed many people working in the cognitive and psychological sciences have tended to put the emphasis in terms of skills on the person who performs them and not the person who or not the observation of those skills which is so necessary.
Of course.

38:18 And I didn't realize this until Hector pointed out to me, so necessary, of course, for their transmission to take hold at all.
And this struck me as being a most important insight, so obvious that one wonders why one never thought of it oneself.
In the same way that one wonders why it is that so many paleoanthropologists and archaeologists are more concerned with this.
Stuff than with why this stuff isn't there.
These are such obvious problems.

38:50 They go back to Sherlock Holmes and so Arthur Conan Doyle, but we tend to be obsessed with what we can see and feel and touch, rather than with what sort of process might have led to explaining both presence as and absences at the same time.
And this is why I find the whole notion of active inference so important to tie in with evolution.

39:26 It was Professor Christian himself who enthused me to go back to the lectures that I used to attend 50 years ago when I was an undergraduate, that were given by Nicholas Tinbergen at Oxford.
I would steal away from the lectures of anatomy given by Sir Wilfred Lagrange Clark to attend those of Nicholas Tinbergen and other people.
And I come to realize just how important Lawrence's and Tinbergens, and, of course, van Fish von Fish, as Daniel knows, were, and how worthy they were of getting, 50 years ago, the Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine.
50 years later, we're still trying to get to terms with the significance of their insights, which shows just how difficult it is for us to absorb novelty.
But nevertheless, I'm no giant, I'm a dwarf.

40:26 We stand on the shoulders of giants.
Not only Lorenz and Tinbergen, Fish, Darwin, of course, and going back to Bayesian in the 18th century, one critic of our psychic paper said that we were pomo.
In other words, we were pomo postmodernist.
No, we go back in a good scientific and vocal tradition and theoretical tradition back to the 18th century.
Nothing postmodern about us at all.

41:02 I think all of us would reject any suspicion that we were involved in postprocessual and postmodernist argument, unlike many of our colleagues in what I call the social studies, like the late Lou Binford, an archaeologist in America, some note I prefer social studies to social science, which I think can at times be something of an opsimal.
I suspect that others will dispute that.
With me, however, I'm no giant, I'm a dwarf.
It took me all my time to cope with something we were never taught at school, matrix algebra, which I had to learn when I was doing my research on prehistoric skulls.
And from then, to cope with Bayes theorem and the approaches or the uses that can be made of Bayesian mathematical statistics using matrix theory, which I'm gradually caught up with, and I can follow it, but I certainly wouldn't be capable, unlike Professor Christian of deriving it.

42:17 But I can certainly understand the significance of something that I think a lot of our colleagues in the humanities and social studies simply are not prepared to confront at all.
I think they prefer much more subjective, if you like, postmodernist thinking, to rational scientific analysis.
Well, thank you.

42:51 Karl.
Lost the screen.
Can you see me?
I can see you.

42:55 _Karl:_

I can see.

42:56 _Daniel:_

We see you, Karl.

43:00 _Michael:_

My eyesight is no longer quite as good as it used to be.
So I sometimes tend to huddle over the computer.

43:08 _Daniel:_

It's all good.
It's all good.

43:10 Karl, maybe you could come in and share how this collaboration came to be or from your view from the inside or however else you'd like to comment on what we've seen so far.

43:24 _Karl:_

Yes, well, thank you very much for the opportunity.
I also have to do a lot of huddling because of my failing eyesight, just to reiterate what a joy it was to hear that presentation and Hector's follow up.
So this is, for me, an adventure well outside my comfort zone.
So I'm here as a passenger spectator and learning a lot.

43:50 I didn't know half of this stuff, even though I did a lot of biology and a little bit of evolutionary biology as a young man.
But this is intriguing and foundational insights into the way that we are.
So I'm going to make a few comments.
It's going to be more of a stream of consciousness, but I qualify this again, but this is completely outside my comfort zone.
I'm just talking as a layperson here, or a lay physicist perhaps, and I'll just make a few observations.

44:25 But, Daniel, I'd be particularly interested in your synthesis because, of course, you have probably more than any of us, the broadest oversight from the evolutionary perspective right through to the Bayesian mechanics that is entailed by things like active inference.
Just to forewarn you, I'm going to call upon you to do the synthesis and to draw and join the dots that haven't already been joined, although there's been a lot of dot joining from what I can see already.
So the stream of consciousness comes really from this commitment to ideas that are certainly not postmodern.
I think I'd probably have to go back to Plato and certainly sort of get stuck around the era of helmholtz and the like.

45:22 From a physicist's point of view and pursuing that, looking at the looking at this sort of remarkable snakes and ladders phenomenon through the eyes of a physicist, it certainly makes complete sense that if we're looking at a process, that would be described as a non equilibrium, steady state that is slowly evolving.
That could be, if you like, a mathematical image of the evolutionary process.
The definitive feature of these non equilibrium steady states that have a biological aspect is that they entail a revisiting of the trajectory to neighborhoods of certain parts of face space.
So if I read face space as basically the state of evolution or what phenotypes are doing or what is encoded genetically in a very, very crude, broad level, there can be no other solution to a particular trajectory that is apt for describing a non equilibrium steady state than the occasional I anteriorant recurrence of certain states of being literally being close or revisiting neighborhoods, of certain regimes of face space.

46:51 So the snakes and Ladders image seems to me a very apt image to actually describe pullback attractors, which are another way of articulating these kinds of dynamics or this kind of kind of dynamics in the sense that they have this aspect of recurrence and they have this aspect of self contained itinerancy which are the hallmarks of any system, really, that exists over a substantial period of time.

47:23 It would be interesting to think, can it be any other way?
And I would submit.
No.
If you have a physical process that is unfolding at multiple timescales and it is endowed and can be recognized either historically or in the moment by being in certain characteristic states that literally characterize the system in question.
So that it can be named, whether it's a species or whether it's your behavior or whether it's an artifact or whether it's a process, then it must be the case that it has this kind of iterrancy where things come and go.

48:04 So it will be interesting just as a pure exercise for pure mathematics just to put things like the Poncara recurrence theorem into a snakes and ladders format and vice versa.
Because I think there's something fundamentally true that has to be the way that things are.
And I see that in many fields.

48:35 And two immediately came to mind.
The first was current notions of not the spread of ideas or the spread of tools, but the spread of cancer.
The view that cancer there are two views of cancer.
There's a sort of 20th century view that you get one cell in your body, fails to recognize that it should not be growing and just keeps on growing and you'll get these progressive and inevitable growth of the cancer set of cells and at some point they will disseminate and seed themselves around the body.
You get metastases and secondaries and the like and ultimately, unless it's cured, then it will destroy the phenotype.

49:22 There's another view which is now becoming more prevalent, which is a much more snakes and ladders view.
And this view is that we're all the time generating little cancer cells but 99.9% of the of the time they don't get a foothold.
So that we're in equilibrium, hopefully on the right side of an equilibrium, always paying host to little cancer cells.
It's just that it's very rarely do they actually establish themselves to the extent that they can get a foothold and reproduce to actually produce a tumor or a neoplastic growth.
And that struck me.

50:05 It would be nice to put a snakes and ladders sort of picture on the way that that particular biological natural system is viewed.
And it's certainly very consistent with current views on cancer.
The other system that seems to comply with this notion is not, again the spread of ideas or the spread of tools or cultural means, but the spread of viruses.
In epidemiology it's very interesting that there are certain viruses, for example, that get a foothold and explode exponentially.
And we've had, you know, we've just enjoyed or witnessed an episode of that with the with the the recent COVID-19 pandemic.

50:52 But there are other very similar episodes that don't get a foothold and they die out very quickly because they can't spread.
And I know this personally because we were looking for data when modeling using actually exactly the same maths that underwrites free energy principle, active inference.
We were modeling the coronavirus crisis recently and we hope to get some priors on certain parameters by looking at legacy historical data.
And it's interesting that there is data out there on very similar viral epidemics, but they died out too quickly to generate enough data to make sense of so things like MERS, for example, was recorded, but it went away before it actually produced enough data to get a handle on it.
So again, this phenomena of sort of things repeating themselves, climbing up the ladder, but then sometimes falling down a snake very, very quickly.

51:56 So you have to wait until the next occurrence.
Seems to be a fundamental aspects of ensemble dynamics wherever you see it, either within the body in terms of neoplasia or in terms of epidemiology of spread.
And I use the word spread deliberately because of that latter perspective on basically to copy or not to copy.
So if you're copying, then you're in the game of spreading.
And if you don't copy, then you don't spend.

52:32 So I think just coming back to the question what is it that determines whether a particular cognitive surprise or a novel approach to a way of behaving or indeed a way of being catches on or not?
And that dialectic, I think is absolutely intriguing.
I should just say that all of this formulation rests very sensitively on a separation of temporal scales.

53:16 In the background, there is always this separation of scales that you get with evolution.

53:27 And in this particular instance, what we are talking about is really whether certain things can survive generationally in the spirit, I would imagine, of sort of evo devo and cultural niche construction.
And then the question then is, okay, at a fast time scale of interactions between phenotypes, what's going to make that sufficiently endemic to be propagated at a transgenerational timescale?
I think that's a really interesting question.
Again, it's the kind of question which, as a neuroscientist, certainly as a clinician, you are often confronted with things.
For example, like epilepsy.

54:17 What is it, Axel constant that determines whether a particular epileptic, surprising, dynamic discharge in a particular part of the brain can be propagated and disseminated throughout the brain to give you a fit or as opposed to it sort of auto vitiating or quenching itself because the neighboring cells are just not interested.
They just don't recognize a particular pattern and it's inhibited.
And I guess the answer I think we've already had the answer.
Both Michael and Hector have articulated it.
But I guess the answer lies in the mechanics of the spread of ideas and shared frames of reference and whether it is too surprising to be incorporated into your conspecifics or your community or whether it is learnable and can be incorporated or absorbed into your generative models such that it can then be sped to the next person in the standard sense of sort of niche construction.

55:30 And Hector mentioned specifically one key determinant of that, which is Michael, but it was the ability to change your mind.
And the ability to change your mind is absolutely fundamental.
If you want to frame this in an active inference context, just confronted with a cognitive surprisal as it has been articulated, a set of difficult to explain sensations or sensory evidence, then there are two ways in which you can resolve that surprise.
The first way is to change your mind and to adjust your internal generative models or do some basic belief updating on the inside to make sense of this thing.
And that might depend upon some experience dependent learning over a suitable timescale so that you're changing your model, your generative model of the world to make it more apt to explain this novel observation or observation of one of your conspecifics doing this kind of thing.

56:44 The other way is not the perceptual response, the belief updating on the inside to make your predictions more like the sensations.
It's to actually act upon the world, to make your sensations more like they were predicted.
So this is foundational inactive inference.
There's two complementary ways of minimizing surprisal or prediction error.
You either change your mind or you change the thing that you're surprised about at every level, at every temporal scale.

57:15 So just read in terms of whether I am able to change my mind about witnessing fire.
There are two ways I can say yes, fire is a thing and I can then incorporate or imbibe that into my world model and become the kind of creature that actually engages with fire or I can act to put the fire out and then I don't have to worry about it.
Both are perfectly appropriate ways of minimizing surprise.
The difference at a very basic level, the thing that determines whether I perceive or act or whether I engage in perceptual or active inference in the moment to moment depends exactly on something which was again mentioned implicitly earlier on, which is the precision afforded the sensory evidence relative to your prior beliefs.

58:17 So as a physiologist, if you don't know this, there are beautiful illustrations of this.

58:24 So if we just forget about the notion at the moment of sort of long term revisions or belief updating of our generative model over multiple experiences to an instance of somebody making a fire or providing me with a valentine's gift of a hand axe.
I'm just thinking now to the moment to moment ways of making of sampling the world and making sense of the world.
It's the case that in order to move, in order to change the world, I have to attenuate the precision afforded my sensory information because if I didn't do that, I would not be able to ignore all the evidence that I am not currently moving.
So the most beautiful example of this, I think, is something called sacanic suppression.
It's when we move our eyes, and we do so about four times a second, we actually attenuate the precision of the sensory evidence so that we are able to actually move our eyes, which basically means you can't see the optic flow induced when you make a sharp or sacred eye movement.

59:35 And yet, 50 milliseconds after you've made the eye movement, you're suddenly now attending to the visual information that you can see.
So you can't actually see anything while your eyes are moving, because you've got this sensory attenuation, which is basically putting the priors in charge, suspending attention to the sensorium while you are acting, failures of that can have quite horrible consequences.
So a failure to ignore the evidence that I'm not moving and a failure to attenuate or suspend attention attenuate the precision of sensory evidence or afforded sensory evidence, looks like things like Parkinson's disease.
So we think that this precision is encoded by certain neurochemical transmitters, particularly dopamine.
A deficit of dopamine basically means an inability to attenuate the evidence from your strept receptors, all the signals coming from the body that you're not currently moving.

1:00:44 So if you have the pride belief, I'm going to move, I'm going to sit up, walk, drink from this cup, you may have that prior belief, but it's immediately counteracted by and dispelled by very precise evidence that you're not moving.
So you can never actually initiate a movement.
And what you actually see clinically is basically a psychomotoptery or a brady Kinesia.
The point I'm making here all reduces to something very, very simple, which is the precision afforded sensory evidence.
And if you can't get that right and notice it has to be estimated at every timescale, either in terms of sacredic suppression on a ten millisecond timescale, right through to, one might actually argue, an evolutionary timescale.

1:01:36 And I make that argument because precision can also be thought of as a rate constant.
So if I've got some sort of sensory evidence and some prior beliefs, and I now view my belief updating at any level, whether it's sort of my neural activity encoding my beliefs at the moment, or whether it's my neuronal connectivity or encoding what I have learned, or it's neurodevelopment or indeed, at evolutionary timescale, the precision can be read as a rate constant.
So now what we're talking about is a certain quantity that is absolutely crucial for whether I adopt this or incorporate instill this novel experience into my model or not, that depends upon a precision or a rate constant, which means that if one wanted to ask the question, why do some species have the ability to learn whereas other species don't, then I think the answer is, quite simply in their ability to optimize and adjust their learning rate.

1:02:57 Either precision afforded the evidence at hand that drives the learning and I'm wondering whether there are a couple of ways to take that sort of mathematical take on this really single, really important quantity just to make it intuitive.
I'm trying to get back to the copy versus not copy.

1:03:19 So if I can copy, that means that I'm impressionable.
What does that mean?
It means that I will accumulate new evidence very very quickly.
What does that mean?
That means I have the capacity to assign greater evidence or precision to that sensory evidence and suspend the precision of my prior beliefs.

1:03:41 I'm not rigid in my thinking.
I can learn because I am impressionable.
What would that look like?
What would it look like?
You were young.

1:03:50 It would look like you have just been born and you are designed to learn because you have yet to build neurodevelopmentally your model of the world.
Which means that averaged over a lifetime the degree to which you are likely to learn and implicitly enable the spread of ideas and ignite this particular episode of a new tool or a new way of doing things or being then it would look as if you are younger for longer.
So I was just intrigued.
I think Michael was making an explicit reference to the fact that there may be a key difference between certain species, maybe the duration or the timing of the point where you basically switch off your learnability, you switch off your impressionability, and you become an adult and you bake in then.

1:04:55 And then from that point on, you become old and wise and stuck in your ways.

1:04:59 And instead of actually trying to change your mind when something changes, you don't.
You become not conservative in a political sense but you actually try to keep things status quo, commit to the social norms.
But before that you don't.
You explore, you go to discos, you do bungee jumping, you make new friends.
But if it's the case then that the spread of ideas depends upon being a child at heart for longer than that observation about at what point do we get to that epigenetically determined stage of neurodevelopment becomes absolutely crucial and just.

1:05:43 This is the final point.
An even longer timescale I'm wondering whether the same maths can be borrowed or the same concepts at least can be borrowed.
To think about this kind of evolvability from the perspective of people like Stuart Kaufman and the like.
So selection for selectability so again, if you're now reading these rate constants or precisions in an evolutionary setting what you are talking about is basically the mutation rates or the selectability which of course itself can be subject to selective pressure.
So if you commit to this style of thinking about belief updating in a mathematical sense at many different levels or different spatial temporal scales, or at least temporal scales, then it may be that the selection for selectability or the selectability in and of itself is exactly the same kind of quantity that is the learnability.

1:06:52 And being young at heart for longer, that just is the same kind of quantity that is required right down to the level of psychiatric suppression and sensory tennuation that determines when we act to keep the world constant as opposed to no, we actually have to attend to this evidence and update our beliefs.
And if that's the case, then this notion well, I just wanted to close on the importance of cultural niche construction.
Looked at through the lens of this rate of adaptation.
Precision selectability at different levels and how all of these couple to each other in a sort of bootstrapping way and whether that would be a useful view of the spread of ideas sometimes spreading and sometimes not spreading.

1:07:58 Can I just ask it did you laterally sort of leverage sort of the well, actually no.

1:08:12 This is basically setting up Daniel for his perspective.
But I'm just wondering how much people in evo devo and evolutionary psychology I'm thinking here people like Cecilia Hayes and cognitive Gadgets, how much they think about these issues and whether there's the opportunity or whether they have a snakes and matters like view of things from the point of view of evolutionary psychology.
And that's it.
That's all I have to say.
Thank you.

1:08:44 Daniel, your turn.

1:08:50 _Daniel:_

Thank you.
Wow.

1:08:55 Barely know which side of that hand axe to flake the multiscale learning is a great point and perspective.
We can just imagine the extreme cases in the total acceptance of sensory evidence world then that thing defined by its revisiting potentially infrequently of characteristic states that thing ceases to be that thing in that whether that's seen in some positive light, a neutral entanglement light or a dean like light it will cease to be that thing because it will have just simply informationally if not biomaterially accepted the generative processes in positions.
And then the other extreme case would be no attention, see no evil, hear no evil.

1:09:58 And in that case the trajectory from Bayesian mechanics perspective is massive.
It's a trajectory with so much inertia that it can't be moved and that sounds like it would ever happen.

1:10:14 But in fact, when we heard from Hector and Michael that upon seeing an innovation, a great ape does not take up that innovation, their prior on how to accomplish a behavior outcome or even at a higher order, some functional outcome can be seen as massive.
The Bayesian physical inertia of their top down prior dominates these potentially sparse or nonlinearly related cues coming up from the bottom.
So simply by not paying attention to the bottom up cues, there is the imposition of this top down mass.
And so that's a Bayesian mechanical way to understand well, if we had no priors at all, no prior, no problem, but then we dissolve.
But if we have the Titanic prior, then it's a fragile strategy.

1:11:14 And so if the niche were very simple and unchanging, that may be locally an adaptive strategy.
And on certain axes of phenotype where there can be regularities, we do see those kinds of strategies.
Like a bacterium that has selected to live in a constant temperature geothermal niche may come to entrench in its protein structure and in its gene regulatory networks and so on.
An embodiment that sharpens and sharpens and sharpens its capacity to compete in that regularity from a temperature perspective and therefore at the detriment of fitness in changing environments.
So that's one aspect is seeing learning as this multiscale synergetic and ongoing renegotiation process of the updating across multiple scales, some spatial temporal scales of which there are no problems with talking about those using the cognitive ontology like perception, cognition and action.

1:12:32 But then some scales, especially beyond the physical mechanisms that those cognitive ontological terms arose from, it becomes like, well, what does it mean for the population to pay attention to something?
Or what does it mean for the niche to pay attention to something?
So that was one angle on the rates and it speaks to the importance of having flexible and interoperable mathematics and statistics and analysis frameworks.
So we can just qualitatively, even in conversation, start to see that as a starting point, instead of needing to argue up to that point of that being important, for example, in pursuit of transdisciplinary, synthesis, conceptually, epistemically or so that we could explain, predict, design, control, create, pragmatically.

1:13:34 How can we take that multiscale insight as our starting point?

1:13:40 And then I think that leads to a question in the chat which I will ask now.
Mark Fruchman wrote early in the video was the complaint that there was a lack of evidence as to why certain things occurred in the archaeological evidence record?
How does active inference not suffer from the same issue?
And so it's a key question.
Thank you, Mark, for asking.

1:14:05 And was the motivation for one of my underlying motivations for even reading and investigating with this lens was great.
If we can describe everything and we have this very interesting mathematics and so on, how do we go from a technique and a method to moving beyond some limitations of previous analysis techniques with respect especially to the historical record?

1:14:47 We can go to Dean or whomever else has a thought.

1:14:55 _Dean:_

I can throw something in, but I'm not sure it's going to satisfy directly the question.
Maybe somebody else wants to throw something in.

1:15:04 _Karl:_

But.

1:15:07 _Dean:_

I want to indirectly answer the question and I'll loop into what I think might be satisfying part of it.
I think one of the things that in particular that to copy or not to copy paper emphasizes is the observer's perspective.
So rather than just looking at that as something written down on the page, taking up or absorbing that position, the observer's perspective, I think what the two papers.
And one of the things that we tried to highlight, and we're so grateful that Michael and Karl and Hector Beren Millidge to let us look at two things at once was the idea that the papers both raised the specter of and I put quotes around this.
The narrative follows what the implications of start with a story about seeing phenomena x actually are.

1:16:08 Now, one of the implications of that is that when you have a story, you can't have gaps in the plot.
So people who are really story biased and story forward, they want those gaps filled in as quickly as possible.
That's how we comprehend.
But the interesting thing is, if we are actually active inference as opposed to just seeing it as a subject matter or a topic, we can take a game theory approach.
And in games there will be random gas, like Charles Saunders Pierce says, an exhaustive inquiry.

1:16:48 Well, if it's exhaustive, we're also going to need recovery and reflection and so on.
So there will be gaps.
And so the snakes and ladders metaphor to me is like, okay, perfect.
Now we're starting with a game as opposed to the retelling or the manufacturing of starting with a story.
So there's very different mechanisms in the two approaches, right?

1:17:16 There are very different assumptions in the two approaches.
And then the question around modeling as perspective swapping kind of pivots on the stuff that Michael was talking about in terms of how is the change based model, depth capacity either affording or not affording that ability to play with time as opposed to being captured by it?
Because in a story, you've written down what the sequence is.
It's now been applied.
Now, you can interpret that, but in terms of the actual effort of starting with a story, it's now stabilized per se, relatively speaking.

1:18:04 So let's start with a game.
And Karl's heard this before because I asked him a question about a year and a half, maybe two years ago.
Is starting with a game is a prediction matter, expertise strategy or a bias?
Starting with a story is a subject matter, expertise strategy or a bias?
And you can understand why, if you're dealing with historical records, to fall into a default of, okay, well, we have to start with a story.

1:18:37 But I think what Hector and Michael are at least asking us to have a conversation around is, well, so what if we do bring this other way of viewing the circumstances, taking that game strategy and putting it on the same shelf as the story strategy?
So, again, if you look at the assumptions around why gaps have to be filled in as opposed to there will be gaps because the game is on something as simple as that.
And being able to hold the two things up at once can sometimes at.

1:19:19 _Michael:_

Least tell you a little bit about.

1:19:21 _Dean:_

Maybe some of the conditions that you as the observer are.

1:19:28 Inserting on what it is that you're observing or examining.

1:19:38 _Daniel:_

Was it Sherlock who said, the game is afoot?

1:19:44 Maybe?

1:19:45 _Dean:_

Right.

1:19:53 _Daniel:_

Okay.
Yes, Karl, indeed.
Michael or Hector, how is this landing with what you're thinking right now?

1:20:06 _Hector:_

Michael, go ahead.
You always know better than I can pick up from you.

1:20:18 _Michael:_

I'm not quite sure where to begin.

1:20:23 Perhaps thinking in terms of the evolution of both the brain and the body in the Guinness homo we and possibly neanderthals also maybe from as early as three quarters of a million or even at least half a million.
Years ago seem to have undergone an evolution towards a bimodal growth spurt or growth curve caused by the adolescent growth spurt following a period of childhood slowing down of growth which is unique in organis and seems to be related in adolescence to some changes in terms of the agility to react to complex situations or not, as the case may be.

1:21:30 But even before that, in early childhood I'm now talking about the first three or four years of life our infants seem to have exceeded already quite considerably their cognitive ability, particularly with regard to working memory when contrasted against the present great apes.
In other words, there has definitely been not merely an expansion of the brain but in particular changes in the connective systems within the brain which clearly must have an evolutionary physical basis in terms of structure, both inter and, in particular, intra neuronal structure which, when I began to study medicine physiology over a long time ago now, 1960, we could barely imagine.

1:22:41 It was only in the very end of the 1950s, I think 59, if I'm not mistaken, Professor Friston Blanket, correct me, that Cambridge Henry Huxley was doing began to do into neuronal studies on accident potentials.
We were doing them in the lab at Oxford as undergraduates about four years later.
And then I was doing them under Professor Power gleece at gettingham a few years later, still with a practical application, because we were studying the changes in these following orthocryphosphate poisoning, which had a structural situation in Hens, which we were working on, similar to those in humans who had suffered from a massive outbreak of poisoning at Agadir in Morocco when a lot of local people were sold American jet fuel oil rich in orthopesyl phosphates for cooking with.

1:23:45 And there was an epidemic of many deaths which is well known in medical history.
And so some of these early studies, even then, were having applications which now seem almost paleolithic when we think of the work which is being done on interneuronal and also on synaptic connectivity, neuronal transmission and the effects not merely of genetics, such as, for example, synaptic pooling, but also of epigenetic modifications, which no doubt we shall learn a lot more about in the coming decades, but which even now seem to be telling us that the increase in the kind of connectivity or what's the word I'm really looking for?

1:24:42 Perhaps connectivity is not the best word within.
The brain is far greater than anything which is possible within even growing chimpanzees, let alone the adults or other great apes.
And this must have evolved somehow, probably in relation to the appearance, I suspect, of the slowing down of childhood growth followed by the uniquely human Homo adolescent growth spurt which was completely absent one and a half million years ago in early Homo erectus, according to Professor Christopher Dean and others.
And which must surely have been a response or the evolutionary change must have been a response to not merely some kind of magical physiological change, but more likely to the effects of what one might call behavior responses.

1:25:57 And fundamentally it takes us back to active inference and to fundamental changes which are naturally slow to evolve.

1:26:10 And this is the part which is not recognized by most of our colleagues who work with living organisms, on living climates and for that matter, living human communities and individuals.
Their perspective is not that I hope they'll forgive me for saying this which those of us who've been brought up in the natural sciences naturally come to expect.
They don't have the kind of cosmic timescale and cosmic spatial scale of things and of the slowness and the imperceptibility of change which come naturally to those of us brought up from school days in a different tradition.
And I think this is very important because I think there is a big divide still between what 60 years ago we knew as being named the two cultures.

1:27:17 I think this divide still exists as that critic of our paper who claimed we were postmodernists clearly represents the more, shall we say, intuitive relativistic view in which there is something which some of them believe to want to call an ethnographical pleasant, which I think is a contradiction in terms.

1:27:50 Otherwise there could have been no evolution in behavior.
But which wants to compare instead of contrast, as I would have it, what goes on in a few generations, let's say in a community, be it a small one, albeit a large one today, with what went on over many, many generations.
As I said, between 2,200,000 years ago, there would have been at least 80,000 generations if each was 25 years long.
And even that is pushing it a bit, given that adulthood in Homo erectus was very likely achieved before the age of 15 and reproductive success was probably or the next generation was probably only a few years away.
This is important because, as Professor Christian remarked talking about cancer, our longevity has allowed us to and of course on better hygiene and medical knowledge, but particularly our longevity has permitted us to survive in ways that were unthinkable perhaps in many parts of the world barely, well, less than 100 years ago.

1:29:12 It wasn't merely thanks to antibiotics or even better hygiene, but to increases in standard of living going back perhaps perhaps a few hundred years.
But let's not get into that.
What I really want to say is.

1:29:30 _Karl:_

That.

1:29:32 _Michael:_

Next week I have to have a small basal cell neoplasm removed from the side of my nose, which only at the age of 80 or 81 became noticeable, indicating that some of these diseases which we now regard as being part and parcel of our humanity.

1:29:58 Or the aortic stenosis, which was I was diagnosed with my first and only ever incident of cardiac failure about a year ago and has been successfully treated thanks to our modern catheterization processes that allow prosthetes to be prosthetics to be placed on heart valves by a long catheter from the groin.
This kind of thing would have been unthinkable a few years ago.
In fact, I can remember as an undergraduate, as a medical student watching the first ever open heart operations done by Alf Gunning which was regarded in 1960, wherever it was 63 64 as being something that might never might never succeed.
And nowadays these operations on our heart are just regarded as everyday occurs in cardiovascular units around the world things are changing and they're changing with an acceleration which we can only barely appreciate even those of us who've now outlived our four school years and ten and are on the verge of defunction.

1:31:24 However, we have to think in terms of the and this again is important of the exponential, if you like, rather crudely scale at which things are happening and which are so influencing many people, many of our colleagues in the humanities and in the social studies and in indeed studies of animal behavior, including climate behavior of course.

1:31:57 And this I think is detracting from an appreciation of the long time scale and the over which evolutionary processes have necessarily still take place.
I don't believe in gerdschmidt's hopeful monsters, magical genes some people believe that there's a magical gene in Homo sapiens switched on our cognitive ability.
I think this is wishful thinking.
Indeed it's magical thinking in my view.
However, I suppose my own training would lead me to want to say that.

1:32:38 But there have been exceptions and one exception I should like to mention by name is an emeritus professor of archaeology who is eminent in Paleolithic studies at York University.
Now Professor Jeff Bailey who over 40 years ago was pointing out the incommensurability of the timescales of recent archaeology and if you like, ethnography with those of the Paleolithic and the Pleistocene and human evolution and this was not really well regarded at the time although it influenced me very greatly.

1:33:18 There have been honorable exceptions who have certainly influenced me.
We do, as I say, stand on the shoulders of others.
We try to make one or two small comments advances in both methodology and in theoretical influences and deductions and I think that we are finally coming to possibly begin to see how to bring together thanks to especially Professor Friston's insights and methodological what I'm trying to say, methodological proposals and advances.
We're going to see that it might be possible to square the circle, to bring together the evolutionary, very slow evolutionary development of the hierarchical mind which characterizes our Guinness and actual processes which can underpin this undergird.

1:34:55 It can bring together the Darwinian view which most of us espouse in the west with a few exceptions, which are too well known to be worth mentioning here.

1:35:12 I'm sure Daniel knows more about them than I do.
But it's beginning to bring together the theory of evolution of species by natural selection of and within species and the within part is important and it's beginning to bring it together with what we can appreciate about human behavior which is so different from that of the great apes.
And here I just like to make one final point, which is that in another paper, which Hector and I were co authors, along with Professor Wright Reed of UCLA in Neuroscience and Bio Behavior Reviews last year, we pointed out that there has been too much, in our view, hopeful or wishful thinking about the human nature of great apes.

1:36:17 Certainly their behavior is very different from that of many other orders of mammals and not to mention other phyla, other classes.
Within the animal kingdom.

1:36:35 However, there is a big difference.
And I think this difference is best emphasized by going back to the growth curve of humans and of human behavior in relation to our childhood.
In particular, our infants are capable by about the age of three of putting of combinatorial thinking in ways that are virtually impossible or outside the scope of the behavior of most great apes most of the time and almost certainly in the wild.
And this, I think, demands an explanation which is more than simply saying no, the apes are really more like us, it's just that we don't recognize this.
No, I think that there is a difference here and that the timescale has to be taken into consideration, which it often is not.

1:37:39 And most important and this brings me back to my last point and the first one which is that finally we're beginning to get together thanks to Professor Christensen's insights to seeing the possibility of tying together the biological evolution and if you like, the psychological evolution.
Certainly I would say the neurobiological evolution which has characterized Algenus and characterizes it today in a unique way.
And with that, that's my case.

1:38:23 _Daniel:_

Thank you, Michael.

1:38:37 Many ways to go.
The dinner plate balanced on top of the stick.
And I think that's the cognitive moment where the top down constraints and opportunities of our enabling architectures, which for a long time included primarily what was on board and then over the last several thousand years progressively included niche modifications and stigmaic modifications like writing.
And so, just like in the SPM toolkit for studying brain function, there are brain regions that have statistical connections that aren't necessarily anatomically connected and vice versa.
And when we consider information spaces we have similar connectivity patterns.

1:39:38 Some are like information anatomy and some are more like information physiology in narrative or rhetorical spaces that becomes part of our extended cognitive selves and leave to others in the best possible way those who want bright lines of what is a self.
There are analytic frameworks that respect continuities and discontinuities with an emphasis on the respect, the continuities.
We want them to be differentiable and integrated and generalized coordinates of motion and the continuous time active inference models and the path integral formulation and then the discrete time generative model, which is also a map, not the territory, helps us understand saltatory maneuvers over multiple timescales.

1:40:47 And looking back at the literature and the discourse discussions like well, is evolution gradual or general and jumping?
These have been some of the biggest touch points.

1:41:06 Are things slowly changing or fast changing?
Those are where certain lines were drawn and the methodological developments, Bayesian graphs and so on and so on have provided an instrumentalist lens that as a matter of fact does integrate these frameworks methodologically.
That is a claim that hardly anyone dissents from.
And then what happens with respect to our past, present and future when we realize that we're, after the moment of intra and among disciplinary tension, not pushing the rock up the hill anymore or trying to bring somebody else along, but gardening in a space that already is how we need it to be?

1:42:32 _Michael:_

Could I make a comment?
Anil, Seth just occurred to me that when we think of the formant frequencies that affect all of the harmonics and other aspects of our vocalizations whether speech, chanting, song or even whistling, perhaps it is unlikely or improbable that these very many variants which occur in different languages throughout the world with their very, very different characteristics and which almost certainly Dean had begun to evolve quite considerably by the time that earlier writing appears about 5000 years ago.
But it's still unlikely that these can be taken back into the past on a slow evolving timescale such that they can be related directly in a direct evolutionary line to the vocalizations, let us say, of great apes from a common ancestor that we have with them 6 million years ago.

1:43:54 If we accept this unlikelihood, then it seems equally unlikely to me that we can talk about cultural transmission or technological transmission in a slow, uniform manner, invariant manner, over the past, let's say, 2 million years, from which we have information about different technical skills and technical abilities or at least, shall we say, technical possibilities that were exploited by our Guinness homo.
And therefore I would argue that it is equally likely that the unawareness of what people, what individuals were actually enacting the unawareness by bystanders onlookers, or even the very protagonist protagonists of those activities themselves was a continuous, incontinenuous evolution over, let us say, 80 or at least 60,000 generations in a continuous, invariant manner.

1:45:14 This seems unlikely, and it seems equally unlikely that the same is true of different linguistic, shall we say, abilities or aptitudes.
In other words, as Professor Christensen has remarked in more than one paper, it does seem that the advantages that were taken were taken not in a continuous manner, but in a discontinuous manner when particular communicative skills had developed.
In some groups, such as to be able to widen their social scope for active inference and had evolved by natural selection within a shared framework of adaptive prior beliefs favoring alignment of common expectations and joint activities affecting their ecological niche, formation or development.

1:46:21 And this, it seems to me, is a very expedient way of looking at how things happened or likely to have happened.
Whether we will ever be able to produce a theoretic in terms terms of formal Bayesian proposal for this, I don't know.

1:46:42 I would like to think so, but I really don't know how.
I don't have the competence to begin to do this myself, but I think that if it is possible, it will certainly be, to put it mildly, a challenge to those who tend to think that there is a rapid jump or rapid jump took place which, shall we say, a small gap.
There's only a small gap that separates us from the great apes of the equatorial latitudes of the Old World.
I think that that took a much longer period of time.
And I don't think that to compare what modern even, shall we say, in inverted commerce, relatively simple or primitive communities do, or how they act, is commensurable with the behavior of modern great apes.

1:47:47 Frankly, I would like to challenge this, and I would hope that it might be possible to produce a model which will permit the theoretic, which will permit the evolutionary process to be at least interpreted in an alternative fashion.

1:48:13 Sorry, I didn't mean to be long winded.
I apologize.

1:48:19 _Daniel:_

The classical information is inscribed on the holograph in the classical sedimentary layers is Daniel, you're muted.
Sorry.
In the holograph, we have the inscription of the classical information and the quantum cognitive moment is the unpacking or the rotation of what is on the holograph into the information space.
And that, I think, was provocatively raised when you asked, what if this was all there ever was?
What if there wasn't a second hand axe to find at that field site?

1:49:05 That's the interpretive moment and how we interpret it is everything.

1:49:19 So in our final ten minutes of this continuous 53.1, if each of us could provide a kind of closing just several minutes, or any several thoughts on anything they'd like to add into this session, or any directions that they would like to seed or prompt for next week's 53.2.

1:49:50 _Hector:_

I have something, Daniel, that we like to contribute before we close the session.
I would like to take advantage of Professor Friston with us because I have some questions for him that have to do with the free energy principle and the to copy and not to copy, if you allow me to just formulate it.
And first thing I would like to do is that there were some losses in my argumentation before.
I want to make clear that chimpanzees learn socially.

1:50:21 This is something we know for sure.
So there is social learning and there is even cultures, as Professor Andrew Witten in St.
Andrews has proven, has demonstrated.
So there are some cultural tradition.
What is lacking is accumulation of complexity.

1:50:37 What is called by Michael Tomasello ratcheting up.
Okay?
So from one generation to the next, every generation builds upon what was produced in last generation.
So you have a tool implement and you modify it, you make it more complex.
So our technology is the result of many people accumulating their knowledge.

1:50:56 So it's kind of a joint endeavor.
This I wanted to make clear.
And what the models proposed, theoretical and other kind of models, is that copying with fidelity is key to have this accuracy of complexity.
So what I wanted to correct is that the puzzle is that high rates of innovativeness does not relate in an action of complex technology because there is a lack of copying with fidelity what is called true imitation for some and for Bruce and ambient, I think they call it impersonation.
So I see someone doing something, I copy the means and the result.

1:51:40 So chimpanzees are more prompted or likely to emulate, which is copying the end result, but by their own devices so they can do different things to produce the same result.
And it appears that coping with fidelity is key.
And I'm cutting this long explanation.
I just wanted to correct this for the sake of purity of science.
And now my question for Professor Friston, if you allow me.

1:52:08 There is something interesting that the team of Andrea Wheaton in St.
Andrews observed and that is in our paper, that there was one instance that I know of when there was this kind of accumulation of complexity in chimpanzees.
And the thing was possible because these chimpanzees that combined two different techniques to make something more complex, we could be a kind of primigenous example of what we call this action of ratcheting up of behavior.
They did it because they had performed or enacted these behaviors before.
And this is for me it's very intriguing because thinking of how in 2010 there is this paper by Priest and other people where they talk of the generative models under the free energy principle.

1:53:00 They talk of an active inference like generative model are not a structural representation, nothing that you enact.
You enter with your whole body, so to speak.
Correct me if I'm wrong, Professor Friston.
So I'm thinking that these guys, these impulses that were able to have this complex tool product, they had enacted the behaviors independently before.
So I'm wondering if this enacting the behavior before allowed them to overcome surprise health because this would be would go to the core of this idea of an active inference.

1:53:32 Like if you have performed those things separately with your body then the surprise is kind of bounded and you can produce this more complex product.
I mean, I don't know if that was clear enough but this is something that is intriguing to me.

1:53:54 _Daniel:_

Sure Karl, as your last thoughts, feel free to address that or anything else.

1:54:01 _Karl:_

Well, yes, I'm just reflecting on that, I think very important question.
I mean it is certainly the case that all of the active inference formalism both in neuroscience but also in terms of ensemble dynamics and self organization of collections of things rests upon a generative model of the consequences of my action.
Even to the extent you could argue from a telogical perspective that all our perception is just in service of deciding what's the best thing to do next and literally how to move next.
Just acknowledging there are only a very limited number of ways you can actually change the universe.

1:54:48 You can either move a striated muscle or you can secrete something.
There's not much else you can do.
And so it becomes very important in terms of your characteristic state of being and to have the right generative models that choose the right ways to move your muscles or to secrete things.
And that places embodied action or having embodiment and activism at the center of the generative models.
And it certainly makes sense to me from the point of view of both a statistician and a machine learning enthusiast that it would be much easier to revise or update a generative model in the sense you were intimating in terms of accommodating the next kind of behavior.

1:55:50 I'm not sure whether this was composing a sequence of behaviors but certainly being able to incrementally, embellish or adopt a behavior if you had already a precursor that was inherent in the structure or could be scaffolded within your generative model.
So the idea here is that everything that goes on on the outside has to be in some structural and dynamic way recapitulated on the inside in order for you to control the outside.
And this of course is at the heart of early formulations of things like the free free energy principle.
Cybernetics Roshbi's Good Regulator theorem would say literally that and subsequent formulations in terms of laws of requisite variety that the degrees of freedom on the inside have to correspond to the degrees of freedom on the things on the outside that have to be controlled, namely the environment.

1:56:51 So I think that's absolutely right.

1:56:53 That if you had already established through having an internal model of a particular behavior, a particular way of deploying my actuators and making sense of that and being able to infer, it was me that did that and this.
Is me doing that and this is the kind of thing that I do then you are in a much stronger position to learn or incorporate or to imitate something that you have witnessed novo and mathematically, the reason why that becomes easier is that the cost of belief updating in its most general mathematical sense.
So I'm not talking about personal beliefs, I'm just talking about any belief entailed by the structure, the connectivity, the activity, or indeed say, neural activity.
Any belief updating comes along with a cost.

1:57:53 And that cost can be variously articulated in terms of a failure to generalize informationally.

1:58:01 Thermodynamically it has a cost via Landauer's principle.
But mathematically it's interesting that the cost is the relative entropy between your prior and posterior beliefs.
So this will be like a computational cost, a complexity cost.
What that means is to make these steps, be they gradual or be they big jumps, they can only be made if they're, to use one of your words, if they are suitably bounded in terms of the complexity, cost.
Which means the degree of belief updating literally, the relative entropy or the chaos divergence between the implicit posterior and prior after the update is sufficiently small.

1:58:50 Which means, literally, you're changing your mind in a sort of mathematical sense, in the most efficient way possible.
So if you're already close to and have the right kind of generative model to do imitation of a de novo behavior in virtue of the fact you've done it before, that means that the complexity cost of actually committing to that and revising and belief updating your generative model now becomes within a tenable range, it becomes acceptable.
So that would certainly make sense if I were simulating that.
And we've been talking about ways of all sorts of different questions, the questions in the chat Dean's questions and the plea from Michael, how would you make this mechanics work in terms of resolving various hypotheses and evincing insights into how all of this works?
I think at the end of the day you're going to have to simulate it.

1:59:51 And this has not been done very much in the setting of the free energy principle or active inference certainly, but there now are a number of papers coming out within the past year or a few months and it might be interesting to go to those.
And I'm thinking of, for example, a paper by Casper Hest group that looked I think the final write up is something like One Small Step for Mankind or something, but it was originally entitled Ideas Worth Spreading.
So it's explicitly using the basic mechanics of belief updating to look at how spreadable, how copyable certain beliefs were framed in the, in the current age of the internet and sort of tweets and the like.
And the same kind of theme has also been taken up by colleagues of Conor Hines and Maxwell Ransted in terms of simulating epistemic communities where coming back to Michael's use of the importance of epistemic spread and copying and imitation being basically an epistemic spread that's now starting to be simulated.

2:01:10 So I think we are on the cusp in the world of active inference, at least on having mechanics out there that's actually realized in silicon that you can start to intervene on a model, things of this kind or that kind.

2:01:24 And speaking to Dean's question earlier on, it strikes me that people in Climatology must face exactly the same problem.
Is this missing data or did this thing actually go away?
And of course, it's a really important question to answer that.
In principle, you can do it if you've got a model of those legacy data, but you have to have a model, which means you got to basically have an in silico sort of digital twin of the way you think it works.
And then you can compare two generative models or digital twins on the way it works and see which has the greatest evidence in light of the historical data that clearly hasn't been done either in climate change or or your field.

2:02:09 But in principle, that would be the way to do that.
I'm sorry.
I've gone over time.
Sorry.

2:02:17 _Daniel:_

It's totally fine.
My reflection on that again, anyone else who wants to have any last words is in the Par et al.
2022 textbook.
There is attention to two kinds of surprise plain surprise, which is an information theoretic quality quantity associated with an observation with respect to its prior, and the second being Bayesian surprise, which is what you just described the cost of movement, which is related to the divergence of movement.
And I think in that difference between that was surprising and I surprised me or I have changed, are two aspects of the scenario.

2:03:09 Because to just be surprised doesn't require one to change at all.
One can just say every day, wake up, check the news, I can't believe that they're doing that.
You can just be surprised again and again.
And then there's the Bayesian surprise with the belief updating.
And that is really where the semantic advances of the Bayesian mechanics are just beginning to mature.

2:03:43 _Dean:_

I hate the last word, but I hope it isn't so.
The provocations have been dropped in 530 and 53 one, and Daniel and Dean have avoided being provocateurs so far.
What I'm really looking forward to is in 53.2 whether we can declare game on, because I think if we do, if we have that to look forward to, we can push the narrative to the end of the timetable and we can start to continue to enhance the conversation that we initiated today.
So I just want to say thank you to all of you for all of the care and passion that you shared with us.
And I'm just happy as can be.

2:04:30 _Michael:_

So thank you.

2:04:33 _Daniel:_

Thank you.
Any final comments?
Hector or Michael?

2:04:37 _Hector:_

No, just thank you for having us and sharing this time with us.

2:04:41 It was been great discussion.
Thank you.

2:04:44 _Michael:_

Well, thank you very much.
It's been.
Most profitable session.

2:04:51 _Daniel:_

Excellent.
Karl, any last thoughts?

2:04:56 _Karl:_

Again, I've enjoyed it greatly.
It's a real pleasure to actually speak to all of you, but in particular, Michael and Hector.
You're actually using words, spoken words, very embodied, very active.

2:05:14 Lovely.

2:05:15 _Daniel:_

Excellent.
All right.
Till next time.
Thank you, everybody.

2:05:20 _Michael:_

Bye.
