49360	170150	00:49	We're here in Acdam stream number 53.0, and our goal is to learn and discuss a pair of papers. The first paper is Snakes and Ladders in Paleoanthropology from Cognitive Surprise to Skillfulness a Million Years ago. The second paper is to copy or not to copy from Chimpanzees to the foundation of Human Technological Culture. Please lead in with your big questions.	Our goal is to learn and discuss a pair of papers	Snakes and Ladders in Paleoanthropology
171640	241944	02:51	For the Snakes and Ladder paper, there were a number of questions that sort of enabled the authors to go forward with their ideas. How far was observational learning involved? What does this say about the irregular appearance of this regular technique in the Pleistocene spatial temporal record?	For Snakes and Ladder paper, there were several questions posed	Snakes and Ladder 1
242062	391712	04:02	Dean Obeidallah: Why do chimpanzees not live in a complex technological world? Why does innovation fail to translate into technological cumulative complexity? What ingredients must be present from a free energy principle standpoint for innovation to take root in a community? And we'll have a dessert session where we bring up some future topics and ideas.	Copy or not to Copy raises a number of interesting questions about innovation	Copyright
391766	485330	06:31	The shift between snakes and ladders model of evolution and learning comparisons across species. Both papers there is much to say and discuss around learning as an uptake exercise. What might we learn when strategies as analysis are approximated with active and inference as parentheses tool uptake? That's my big question.	Both papers discuss learning as an uptake exercise	Inference and learning in the archaeological literature
486580	605188	08:06	How does the free energy principle and active inference serve as a historical framework or approach? And Ali, who is joining for some discussions, proposed the question how can self organized systems use copy discard functions to store information.

605274	814392	10:05	Phylogenetic modeling could have played a part in relating biological and technological behavior in homo. They wrote into copy or not to copy. That it is proposed here were fundamental for faithful copying, which underpins social transmission of technology's, cumulative culture and culture. How does all of that play out when we observe the world around us?	Snakes and Labs paper proposes that copying is fundamental for social transmission	Snakes and Ladders in Human Culture
814526	1206550	13:34	Cognitive surprises favoring anomalous behavioral propensities to sporadic expression can explain snakes and ladders appearances and disappearances of paleolithic skills in the early and middle Pleistocene. Here a prosaic approach merely inverts that narrative approach to interpreting the deep past.

1209180	1406048	20:09	 innovations represent an anomaly, and innovators are unorthodox actors or protagonists. Predicted consequences of any observed innovative behavior will be too imprecise for the cons specific to make sense of that novel or unorthodox behavior. When sense cannot be made, copying cannot take place.	So what is the implication for innovations? What is the prediction error	Inventions and the cognitive consequences
1406154	1871498	23:26	The zone of bounded surprisal allows any potentially novel or unorthodox behavior to be copied. No copying occurs when innovations observed deviate markedly from usual chimpanzee behavior. This can explain stakes and ladders appearances and disappearances of paleolithic skills in the early and middle class scene record.

1871594	2074930	31:11	What if all roads, be they rail or paved, lead to an active Rome or Romeference? How much can we schedule and how much is dependent on the sophistication of our hierarchical model? Without figures or formalisms, we were able to rethink the linearity and the structure of the stream.

2075270	2214846	34:35	What can you add about the published priors? It's a canonical example of cumulative culture. We begin with keys and then start a process of unlocking. There are no cole's notes version that will both make sense and do justice.	Daniel: What can you add about the published priors	Published Priors and the Literature
2215028	2359366	36:55	Snakes and ladder paper. Evidence of early and middle clustened behavior is distributed in disconcertingly uneven ways between 2,200,000 years ago. Certain creatures may have evolved deep generative models with the ability to predict the consequences of their actions. This is a key aspect of active inference under the fep.

2359478	2544306	39:19	There is a difference between a spatiotemporal snakes and ladders picture of disappearances of tiny huntergatherer bands and appearances of others. The latter model individual idiosyncratic or unorthodox activity. Such idiosyncratic behavior may trump prevailing expectations that normally are unsurprising.

2544338	2747650	42:24	In late middle Pleistocene, Bflcts were made by precursors of Hsapns in Africa and neanderthals in Europe. Nappers and nappers are people that actually form and shape these tools. Differences testify to structural priors that inherit from epigenetics.	Bflcts show uneven spatial distribution of tool usage during Pleistocene	Free Energy in the early Pleistocene
2750070	2981260	45:50	Evidence seems to imply the adaptive evolution of human neurobiological propensities that support prospective memory and tool making. Such behavior draws on short term and long term working memory, episodic and procedural memory, and prospective memory. The continuity between the papers is what we'd really like to emphasize here.

2981810	4004920	49:41	Innovative behavior can be regarded as a latent variable a plausible policy. This kind of innovative behavior is risky owing to its deviation from those phenotypical responses that selection is favored in a specific ecological niche. Trait deviations can have untoward consequences that even may threaten an innovator's survival before reproductive age.	Second perspective focuses on how information spreads in each individual brain	Inventing and copying in the Human brain
4005080	4119010	1:06:45	As argued elsewhere, working memory is a complex multidimensional concept. Evolution by natural selection is inherently conservative. Active inference brought about modification of adaptive behavior sorry. So much to unpack with what active inference allows.

4119780	4226070	1:08:39	When we talk about generative models, we're talking about two kinds of time. One that's continuous and one that's discrete. Sometimes getting to the answer comes about in kind of strange and wonderful ways. Sometimes things happen suddenly because we meander.	We talk about discrete and continuous time in generative models	Generative Models and Zero preparation
4226920	4514964	1:10:26	Figure 4.3 from Par Pazulo and Friston's 2022 active inference textbook. It shows a discrete time representation of a generative model. In continuous time, the decision of the time window and the treatment of time is one of the most absolutely fundamental decisions in a model.

4515002	4885000	1:15:15	Dean Obeidallah: What do we pay attention to as an outcome desensitization? This only becomes problematic when contingencies in the environment, when the environment changes over time. Actions can also become resistant to change after repeated experience because agents build up highly confident beliefs about the reward probabilities under each action.

4885150	5083770	1:21:25	So here's a paper, a variational synthesis of evolutionary and developmental dynamics. We used an explicit, discontinuous, multiscale or scale friendly jump. Can have bottom up causation modifying the extended genotypic thing. I hope that we'll have more sessions to talk more about this paper and related work.

One of the things that really speaks to very clearly and makes a strong case around is the role of sensory attention.

5309622	5550260	1:28:29	In some work I've juxtaposed Buckminster Fuller's life and work in times with that of William Blake. Sometimes things that seem really distal and unrelated when brought together tend to learn a lot. Being able to have 1ft in both of those realms really helps.

5550330	5615540	1:32:30	All right, well, I would just like to echo your words. We really appreciated, even, dare I say, working with the authors in this zero and even negative dot one, the first of its kind interval. So I'm very much looking forward to the coming one, two, and potentially beyond.	Daniel: These papers initially felt like two pillowy beds of plain text	A Farewell to The Science Papers
