410	9410	1	B	0.78767	Hello and welcome.
9940	12528	3	B	0.89026	It's March 17, 2023.
12614	14524	4	B	0.72314	We're here in ActInf Livestream
14572	16290	5	B	0.99722	Number 53.0.
16820	18844	6	B	0.73146	Welcome to the active institute.
18972	25068	7	B	0.95611	We're a participatory online institute that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference.
25164	27436	8	B	0.9996	You can find us at the links on the slide.
27628	33400	9	B	0.99983	This is a recorded and archived live stream, so please provide feedback so we can improve our work.
33550	36200	10	B	0.99883	All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome.
36350	48300	11	B	0.99456	We'll be following video etiquette for live streams, head over active inference.org to learn more about the institute and getting involved with learning groups and projects.
49360	58956	12	B	0.59921	We're here in Acdam stream number 53.0, and our goal is to learn and discuss a pair of papers.
59148	71220	13	B	0.88	The first paper is Snakes and Ladders in Paleoanthropology from Cognitive Surprise to Skillfulness a Million Years Ago by Hector Manrique, Carl Friston and Michael Walker.
71640	86360	14	B	1	The article was posted to Sci Archive in 2022 and the second paper is to copy or not to copy, that is the question from Chimpanzees to the foundation of Human Technological Culture.
86780	91492	15	B	0.99999	This paper is with Menrique and Walker as authors.
91636	95512	16	B	0.6447	Fristenless it was also uploaded to Psy Archive.
95576	103240	17	B	1	And recently, as we have been delighted to discover, the paper has been accepted in Physics of Life reviews.
103320	109372	18	B	0.99999	However, the quotes that we're drawing from and reading from today are drawn from the Psy Archive version.
109436	117512	19	B	0.99976	Just so people know and like all the videos, we're here to make an introduction for some of the dean and the materials.
117596	120710	20	B	0.99905	It's not a review or a final word.
121240	135716	21	B	0.99953	In this 53.0 video, we're going to introduce ourselves, say hello, and then we are going to call it like we see it with the aims and claims abstract roadmap keywords.
135828	145000	22	B	0.95	And there are no figures or formalisms in these papers, but I think we'll have enough bounded surprise to navigate nonetheless.
145160	150092	23	B	0.54755	So let us begin with introductions and then we'll head into big questions.
150226	150956	24	B	0.79082	So. Dean.
151138	154008	25	A	0.50263	Thanks, Danny.
154024	154376	26	A	0.94657	I'm Dean.
154408	155580	27	A	0.99908	I'm here in Calgary.
156000	163410	28	A	0.88464	I'm not going to do much around the warm up question piece because I've got a big question coming up, so I'll pass it over to you.
163780	167132	29	B	0.69827	I'm Daniel, I'm in California and agreed.
167276	170150	30	B	1	Please lead in with your big questions.
171640	178516	31	A	1	Well, I'm going to start by just sort of highlighting the big questions that the authors have, if that's okay.
178538	179910	32	A	0.35934	I'll just read them out.
180220	190340	33	A	0.77929	So for the Snakes and Ladder paper, there were a number of questions that sort of enabled the authors to go forward with their ideas.
190420	191780	34	A	1	Two questions arise.
191940	205484	35	A	1	First, what is it that could provoke cognitive awareness as to the possibility of fashioning stone hand axes in relation to the affordances of raw materials and potential advantages for minimizing bioenergetic effort?
205612	214050	36	A	0.9999	Secondly, what does this say about the irregular appearance of this regular technique in the Pleistocene spatial temporal record?
214420	233428	37	A	0.99999	Also, how was remembered awareness retrieved from personal, short and long term memory transmitted as knowledge to others in whose memories it could become embedded with a degree of fidelity sufficient to enable intergenerational or intercommunal diffusion?
233604	237300	38	A	0.99998	How far was observational learning involved?
237380	241944	39	A	0.9994	Do you want me to read the CRNC, or do you want to do that yourself?
242062	247112	40	B	0.6052	All right, I'll read the questions from the authors in Copy or not to Copy.
247256	253996	41	B	0.99973	They wrote, Why do chimpanzees not live in a complex technological world?
254178	260012	42	B	1	Why does innovation fail to translate into technological cumulative complexity?
260156	264156	43	B	0.99947	Does it owe to a limited capacity to copy with fidelity?
264348	266924	44	B	0.99998	What is the implication for innovations?
267052	282200	45	B	0.99999	What ingredients must be present from a free energy principle standpoint in innovators minds brains and in observers mind slash brains for innovation to take root in a community and be transmitted between generations?
287860	289970	46	A	0.72757	Yeah, great questions.
290580	327084	47	A	1	Now, how do we want well, we know how we want to do this, but one of the things before we get too far along is we, as hosts today, really want to honor the fact that a lot of time has been spent making sure that the ideas that the authors want to bring into the public domain are very clear and that we don't read a whole bunch into it.
327122	329624	48	A	1	Now, we're not going to speculate.
329672	332560	49	A	0.94588	We're not going to go off on any kind of tangent here.
332630	343272	50	A	0.99926	We're going to try to focus strictly on the arguments that they are putting forward, because they're putting forward some pretty strong and I think, well evidenced arguments.
343436	351620	51	A	0.95108	So although there's lots of questions being asked, they're also trying to provide a few very defendable answers.
353240	353990	52	B	0.99995	Absolutely.
354840	362824	53	B	0.9999	That is to prelude the questions that we, Dean and I and Ali are asking.
363022	378140	54	B	0.62	And then we're going to dive largely into verbatim quotations from the texts, and we'll have a dessert session where we bring up some future topics and ideas.
379440	381964	55	B	0.99999	What big question brought you into this?
382002	385384	56	A	1	53 dean okay, so apologies.
385512	391712	57	A	0.22872	There's going to be a lot of reading today, so if you don't like my voice, you're going to just read this and hit the pause button.
391766	396108	58	A	0.99997	But anyway, the attention topical transition is paper one to paper two.
396214	403220	59	A	1	And we're not really spending a lot of time right now saying which came first because we think of them as a pair.
403720	413012	60	A	1	The shift between snakes and ladders model of evolution and learning comparisons across species with special attention given to innovation as copying ability.
413076	418368	61	A	0.99997	Both papers there is much to say and discuss around learning as an uptake exercise.
418564	433676	62	A	0.99958	If as reviewers, people reading these papers, we were to take an active and then in between that and inference anthropologist, archaeologist, comparative psychologist approach to combining these manuscripts.
433708	445492	63	A	1	And then I singled out many examples of where the authors speak expressively around combining combinatorial, and you can read that on your own.
445546	466772	64	A	0.9997	If we were to look at combinations, what might we learn when bicameral, for example, two eyes and bi temporal meaning holding up then and now strategies as analysis are approximated with active and inference as parentheses tool uptake, for example, telescopes and microscope usage.
466916	472440	65	A	0.99997	After before or concurrent with compounding strategy uptake.
472780	474220	66	A	0.99996	So that's my big question.
474290	478908	67	A	1	And I think we're probably not going to get close to an answer until the dot two.
478994	485330	68	A	0.8553	That's why it's a big question because I think it's going to be able to span a little bit of a window here.
486580	487330	69	B	0.99992	Great.
487780	491170	70	B	1	And I wrote a shorter question.
491620	506124	71	B	1	Apart from other applications, for example, in research and development or in other fields or looking towards the future, how does the free energy principle and active inference serve as a historical framework or approach?
506272	527420	72	B	0.99737	So whether we lean towards Aristotelian Causation Philosophies or Tinbergen's approach to ethology behavioral analysis, how does a historical explanatory power fit in amongst the wise, the plurality of wise in our investigations?
527760	538690	73	B	1	And Ali, who is joining for some discussions, proposed the question how can self organized systems use copy discard functions to store information?
539540	547830	74	B	1	A little bit of an externalization from our category theory developments that I'm sure will arise later.
548200	551990	75	B	0.998	So you go for the top, I'll go for the bottom.
552360	552772	76	A	0.97	Okay.
552826	572788	77	A	0.69957	So just before I start, I want to really emphasize the fact that the authors I think to really comprehend what the authors are trying to put forward as an idea here, you have to really spend some time thinking through the aims of the papers and the claims.
572804	574424	78	A	0.50268	We placed a heavy emphasis.
574552	576508	79	A	0.99967	We're going to give a lot more time over to that.
576594	595152	80	A	0.87826	It's going to seem like we're going to give a lot of time over to the keys because having talked to the authors prior to coming on and doing this live stream set, they use those terms of the key and the key to unlocking some of these ideas that have been held for a long time.
595206	601392	81	A	0.9998	So apologies again if it seems like we're text heavy or dialogue heavy.
601536	605188	82	A	1	But in order to really appreciate what's going on, you have to kind of get it out there.
605274	615940	83	A	0.99985	So for the Snakes and Labs paper, provide a hypothesis, a paradigmatic account around how variational free energy is both individual ontogenetic and collective.
616020	643250	84	A	0.83647	Phylogenetic modeling could have played a part in what could now be described as a methodological fep paradigm or relating biological and technological behavior in homo, snakes and ladders in this context pertains to appearances and disappearances of Paleolithic skills in the early and middle Pleistocene record.
643880	651632	85	A	0.99987	Our proposal invokes a methodological paradigm grounded in existential principles that underpin the evolution of living organisms.
651776	684320	86	A	0.62333	It is that some, at least of the irregular, regularities and regular irregularities of phenomena attributable to homo in the Pleistocene record reflect the kinds of plausibility anomalous behavior outcomes that doubtless occurred often in a stakes and ladder model of evolution in early members of Ardenus, regardless of their skeletal paleospecific taxonomy.
684820	685376	87	B	0.99995	Awesome.
685478	691680	88	B	0.61834	I'll read the bottom and then feel free to explain the side by side visually.
692260	694656	89	B	0.99994	They wrote into copy or not to copy.
694848	714084	90	B	0.94641	An aim is to introduce the notion that chimpanzees and other great apes show considerable limitations in their ambiguity or zone of bounded surprisal to overcome cognitive surprisal induced by innovative or unorthodox behavior, which is rarely is copied precisely or accurately.
714212	722830	91	B	0.99999	So things that can be innovated in a moment but do not have the ability to be recognized and carried forward.
723360	733040	92	B	1	And they discussed the circumstances under which Pleistocene homo underwent remarkable evolutionary adaptation of neurobiological propensities.
733380	735244	93	B	0.97486	Cerebral aspects are discussed.
735292	744740	94	B	0.99999	That it is proposed here were fundamental for faithful copying, which underpins social transmission of technology's, cumulative culture and culture.
746920	751636	95	A	0.9003	So I think what we're going to be doing is holding up two things at once.
751818	758788	96	A	1	The two things are copying as repetition and copying as origination, if there is such a word.
758874	766004	97	A	0.99997	But essentially of these images here, there are copies that were simply cut and pasted so they were repeated.
766132	772680	98	A	1	And then there was one representation between those two that's an origination.
772760	778236	99	A	0.89217	It didn't exist to be copied, but now it can be.
778418	792668	100	A	0.99886	So now what we're going to be doing is looking at, okay, so how does maybe all of that play out when we're observing the world around us, when we're taking things in and trying to reduce our surprise?
792764	795124	101	A	1	How many things are we being deep faked on?
795242	811130	102	A	0.99998	How many things are action action oriented representation therefore manageable as two very different places of understanding or appreciation, maybe?
813740	814392	103	B	0.99856	Great.
814526	814936	104	B	0.55405	All right.
814958	823180	105	B	0.81713	I'll go for the first of the sections and then feel free to comment on them or to pick up on the second sections.
823520	838364	106	B	0.99936	So in snakes and Ladders, they wrote, cognitive surprises favoring anomalous behavioral propensities to sporadic expression, can explain snakes and ladders appearances and disappearances of paleolithic skills in the early and middle Pleistocene.
838412	852740	107	B	0.99985	Record some behavioral outcomes attributable plausibly to individual members of homo unable to maintain orthodox behavior responses when faced with cognitive surprises, which is surprisal in the Bayesian terminology.
853640	860468	108	B	1	Such individuals may show a particular neurobiological propensity for exploring unorthodox possibilities.
860644	883440	109	B	1	The propensity has evolved further in humans than in great apes, which, unlike even our very young children, our larvae seem unable to envisage how things might be as well as how they actually are, whereas by coupling recall of past experience with prospective memory, humans are capable of blending reality among different potential spheres.
887380	902112	110	A	0.5467	Statistical considerations of classical population genetics are incommensurate with notions that Darwinian fitness and Pleistocene homo increased imperceptibly through gradual dual inheritance.
902176	915530	111	A	0.56921	Coevolution inherited changes proceeded in well nigh invariant lockstep with heritability of active behavioral and technological changes.
915900	937948	112	A	0.9759	Although ontogenetic autopoiesis may involve action perception cycles, a phylogenetic consequence could include unawareness by companions that those exceptions might allow new cooperative opportunities for minimizing the group's variation of free energy by performing unaccustomed behavior to attain dubious benefit.
938124	966040	113	A	0.77831	Though foresight of fluent communication innovations often must have disappeared unremarket, seen as useless and their creator's prowess as misplaced energy and wasting time needed for satisfying the group's existentially implacable, energetics prepotent, routine behavior, and prosocial early homo plausibly resulted in failure to become aware of the potential of idiosyncratic active outcomes.
966620	979896	114	A	0.99997	Here a prosaic approach merely inverts that narrative approach to interpreting the deep past, which draws for its inspiration on humane and social studies.
980088	993328	115	A	1	The inversion subordinates the narrative approach to critical scrutiny, such that the narrative approach no longer seems to be the most appropriate or most parsimonious interpretation available.
993494	998224	116	A	1	Now, again, what we're doing is trying to avoid the situation where we're cherry picking.
998272	1004964	117	A	0.99977	So if you want to pause and read what's been written in context, please feel free to do that.
1005002	1012680	118	A	0.99988	But we just want to make sure that we touch on the highest peaks in this range.
1013500	1016330	119	B	0.99998	Yes, the full papers are out there.
1016780	1032440	120	B	0.5589	We're linearizing and curating in this zero, which has been an incredible experience and that has helped us grasp some of these points, hopefully, so we can take them further.
1032600	1035964	121	B	0.88	And I'll read the quote and then you can go into the red zone.
1036092	1036944	122	A	0.99619	Yeah, go for it.
1036982	1055140	123	B	0.79633	In Snakes and Ladders, they wrote the argument proposed here about a neurobiological propensity to an individual enactment in modifying stone, considered from the standpoint of the free energy principle, is not concerned with a null hypothesis of innate latent spontaneity.
1055560	1064612	124	B	1	Instead, it is directed towards interpreting irregular regularities and regular irregularities in the Pleistocene snakes and ladders.
1064676	1072488	125	B	0.99987	Record of appearances and disappearances of Bflcts, which we're going to get to tools.
1072664	1077576	126	B	0.54641	Given presence of BF lCTs in widely differing biotopes.
1077688	1084012	127	B	1	Which likely led to differential behavioral evolution of appropriate subsistence strategies and diets.
1084156	1101860	128	B	0.63759	There is widespread comparability of the principal morphological attributes of BF lCTs of diverse Petrology at sites with contrasting paleo environments and different spatiotemporal contexts or paleoanthropological taxa.
1102360	1113652	129	B	0.99996	This renders unlikely any notion of a straightforward mendelian genetic basis favoring BF Lct outcomes by natural selection for a specific behavior adaptation.
1113796	1135650	130	B	1	The circumstantial evidence seems to apply the adaptive evolution of human neurobiology propensities that support prospective memory in tool making, together with short term working memory, including haptic working memory, long term working memory, and long term procedural memory and episodic memory of past matters and things.
1137780	1156632	131	A	0.86707	So I'm doing a tease here, because on the previous slide, I starred one of the claims and then the last claim on this slide here, my note is essentially, I'm just going to read the part that doesn't again, have me speculating memory broken into types, as you can see here.
1156686	1159460	132	A	0.99916	Working memory, long term, procedural, et cetera.
1159540	1161764	133	A	0.85	And now being applied instrumentally.
1161892	1177070	134	A	0.99993	Did all the memory types at some threshold of uptake afford a parallel processing of time, given time's potential variance over the simpler sequential sense of change as the starter pack priority today?
1177520	1186690	135	A	0.99989	When I say starter pack priority today, how much about what we do today is being projected or overfit onto the deep past?
1187460	1194210	136	A	0.99999	This is a question that Michael's presentation in the 53 one is going to have much to say.
1194900	1197596	137	A	0.99999	Also the last claim of the copy or not to copy.
1197628	1199824	138	A	0.99986	So a bit of a teaser.
1199872	1206550	139	A	0.99879	You're going to want to show up for 53 one, because I think Michael's presentation is going to really open up a lot of eyes.
1209180	1209930	140	B	0.99995	Awesome.
1210620	1215844	141	B	0.79922	Into to copy or not to copy, we go to their claims.
1215972	1222120	142	B	0.99997	So just to read some of the first parts, what is the implication for innovations?
1222860	1226056	143	B	0.63	A sinaquanon for one to spread.
1226168	1237068	144	B	0.99994	So something that must happen to spread is following its conception by one mind, namely the hmm hierarchically, mechanistic mind of the protagonist brain.
1237164	1244112	145	B	0.69207	It must then be apprehended by another mind, namely the hmm of an observer's brain.
1244176	1246656	146	B	1	And we're going to come back to that on the roadmap.
1246848	1253380	147	B	0.98456	Here, innovations represent an anomaly, and innovators are unorthodox actors or protagonists.
1253880	1272140	148	B	0.99909	Their policy selection is in a sense, faulty, in the sense that their ensuing behavioral outcomes are in market contrast to those of their fellow actors or agents who deploy orthodox responses that reduce discrepancies between predictions and sensation.
1272640	1275608	149	B	0.99999	Thus, innovators fail to fulfill their predictions.
1275784	1292704	150	B	0.99999	If innovations be regarded as behavior outputs, theirs are then responses that fall outside the repertoire typical of their community, and hence ceterais paribus all of the things equal increase the prediction error, e.
1292742	1299140	151	B	0.87	G the level of cognitive surprisal in their exchanges with the surrounding eco niche.
1302280	1314520	152	A	0.71629	Predicted consequences of any observed innovative behavior will be too imprecise for the cons specific to make sense of that novel or unorthodox behavior.
1315500	1319870	153	A	0.99993	When sense cannot be made, copying cannot take place.
1321520	1322510	154	A	0.99974	Very clear.
1325360	1338576	155	A	0.76907	When brains cope with high levels of cognitive surprisals, a plausible answer is that it is when the holding capacity of working memory increases from two to three.
1338758	1349024	156	A	0.99999	Working memory in this setting corresponds to the temporal depth of generative models that generate or predict the consequences of successive actions.
1349072	1359690	157	A	0.65508	This transition increases temporal horizon, which amplifies cognitive versatility and one of my favorite things, recursive thinking.
1360460	1369740	158	A	0.99	A working memory or detemporal model able to entertain diverse novel Bayesian beliefs is more likely able to recognize and remember innovative behaviors.
1370560	1392000	159	A	0.98	And it's easier for chimpanzees to perform complex action that involve considerable motor demands than it is for them to reproduce actions that are simple and undemanding with regard to motor dexterity and yet unorthodox with regard to their habitual behavioral repertoire.
1394680	1395428	160	B	0.90531	Great.
1395594	1401030	161	B	0.399	I'll just joke and meme internally as we carry forward.
1404520	1406048	162	B	0.98758	Yeah, go for the top half here.
1406154	1407992	163	A	0.53716	All right, I'll do the first three.
1408126	1418292	164	A	0.99786	When considering early Pleistocene behavior, we need not assume memories were less complex psycho cognitively than are ours.
1418356	1428940	165	A	0.99996	It is prosaically sufficient to infer that they were simply less frequent owing to earlier consolidation of cerebral networks in Homo erectus's smaller brain.
1429520	1433644	166	A	0.37	And we're going to get into something called the zone of bounded surprisal here.
1433682	1451540	167	A	1	And after the ZVS restricted them, observations by early Homo erectus were translated often into activity intermediate between I love that emulation and imitation owing to limited foresight.
1452360	1464180	168	A	0.6562	That or there zbs limited their ambiguity to join up the mental steps involved in planning and to infer counterfactual possibilities.
1464340	1472380	169	A	0.73	The focus of the Zbs is on the observers and their ability to make sense of an observed innovation.
1473040	1487250	170	A	0.98	The ZPs allows any potentially novel or unorthodox behavior to be copied provided that the ranges or the levels of surprise provoked in observers are tolerated or manageable by.
1489940	1494728	171	B	0.45963	There'S bilateral neuronal activation in some brain regions.
1494924	1511796	172	B	0.99995	When some tools are being fashioned, activation is bilateral because fashioning stone requires precise and accurate monitoring by right hemisphere neurons of the left hand holding the future artifact as well as the action planning.
1511828	1519296	173	B	0.99911	It performed by the right hand holding a hammerstone which are monitored by left hemisphere neurons.
1519428	1530536	174	B	0.50527	Together they coordinate continuously changing sensory motor representations with appropriately changing hand movements undertaken in an organized forward sequence of perception action with feedback.
1530728	1556180	175	B	0.99879	Entertaining multiple and varied predictions in the Bayesian framework represented as probability densities in alternate models generated about reality enables the narrowing of cognitive gaps or lessening of cognitive dissonance or surprisal when conspecifics are seen to carry out unusual or unorthodox behaviors that paves the way for horizontal and vertical transmission.
1557020	1575336	176	B	1	The working memory capacity of chimpanzees seems to be below that tipping point at which multiple mental spheres or possibilities can be entertained simultaneously for pitting against an observed novel behavior while keeping cognitive surprisal within a tolerable range unsurprisingly.
1575448	1582860	177	B	0.99995	No copying occurs when innovations observed deviate markedly from usual chimpanzee behavior.
1583760	1585324	178	A	0.99822	Can I just throw something in here?
1585362	1589644	179	A	1	Now, at this point we'll step back and think about this as a live stream.
1589772	1599476	180	A	0.97206	We are trying to avoid a tipping point by placing a heavy weighting on the aims and claims relative to most of the live streams that we've done in the past.
1599578	1606944	181	A	0.99997	This is a big build up, but think of this as your classic barbell analogy.
1606992	1609908	182	A	0.6664	We've just tipped one plate on the bar.
1610074	1614376	183	A	1	Now we're going to look at the bar and then we're going to look at the other plates on the other side of this.
1614398	1615880	184	A	0.99985	When we get to the keys.
1621090	1622682	185	B	0.99997	You can go for the first abstract.
1622746	1623602	186	B	0.99786	I'll do a second.
1623736	1624354	187	A	0.99943	You got it.
1624392	1624594	188	A	0.66	Okay.
1624632	1644518	189	A	0.68	A scientific paradigmatic account suffices to interpret behavior evolution in early homocognitive surprises favoring anomalous behavioral propensities to sporadic expression can explain stakes and ladders appearances and disappearances of paleolithic skills in the early and middle class scene record.
1644684	1655798	190	A	0.87	The account applies to the principle of stationary action which underpins the free energy principle to self organizing systems at an evolutionary timescale.
1655974	1675886	191	A	0.99994	Unusual personal attainments, often explained by invoking progressive ascent of evolutionary phylogenetic ladders of cognitive and technical abilities could be disregarded in a hominid community that failed to imagine or articulate possible advantages for its survivability.
1675998	1691954	192	A	0.54357	Such failure, as well as diverse fortuitous demographic accidents could erase from collective memory the recollection of exceptional individual conduct which disappeared down a snake, so to speak, of the human evolutionary puzzle.
1692082	1695890	193	A	0.99	The puzzle discomforts paleoanthropologists.
1696050	1697480	194	A	0.99	The gloves are on.
1699070	1716746	195	A	0.80447	Some explain it away with the self justifying assertion that separate paleo species of Homo differentially possessed cognitive abilities that allegedly underlay the differential presence or absence in the Pleistocene archaeological record of traces of particular behavioral outcomes or skills.
1716858	1734094	196	A	0.53374	An alternative methodological perspective grounded in the fundamental relationships between organisms and their environments affords parsimonious prosaic deflationary account for appearances and disappearances of behavior, outcomes, and skills.
1734142	1737814	197	A	0.95192	Thus the title snakes and Ladders great.
1737932	1741058	198	B	0.62	And the Abstract of Copy or not to Copy.
1741234	1756010	199	B	0.77	A prerequisite for copying innovative behavior is the capacity of observers brains, regarded as hierarchically mechanistic minds, to overcome cognitive surprisal by maximizing the evidence for their internal models via active inference.
1756750	1781860	200	B	0.48935	Unlike modern humans, chimpanzees and other great apes show considerable limitations in their ability or zone of bounded surprisal to overcome cognitive surprisal induced by innovative or unorthodox behavior, which rarely is copied precisely or accurately, most can copy adequately what is within their phenotypically habitual behavioral repertoire in which technology plays a scant part.
1782710	1793430	201	B	0.99922	Widespread intra and intergenerational social transmission of complex technological innovations is not a hallmark of great ape taxa over 3 million years ago.
1793580	1801180	202	B	0.99469	Precursors of the genus Homo made stone artifacts and stone flaking was likely habitual before 2 million years ago.
1801630	1815840	203	B	0.93413	After this time, early Homo erectus left traces of technological innovations, though faithful copying of these and their intra and intergenerational social transmission were rare before a million years ago.
1816370	1827730	204	B	0.99996	This likely ode to a cerebral infrastructure of interconnected neuronal networks that bounds the expressivity of internal world models entailed by their functional architecture.
1828070	1841462	205	B	0.99927	Brains were smaller in size than ours, and cerebral neuronal networks ceased to develop when early Homo erectus attained full adult maturity by the mid teen years, whereas their development continues until our mid 20s.
1841516	1847682	206	B	0.90952	Nowadays, Pleistocene Homo underwent remarkable evolutionary adaptation of neurobiological propensities.
1847746	1849366	207	B	0.94317	Cerebral aspects are discussed.
1849398	1858090	208	B	0.99998	That it is proposed here were fundamental for faithful copying, which underpins social transmission of technologies, cumulative learning and culture.
1859310	1860060	209	B	0.99994	Great.
1862450	1864014	210	B	1	One of the most amazing.
1864212	1866670	211	B	0.53357	Roadmap became road.
1866740	1871498	212	B	0.89415	Rail became train station clearinghouse slides.
1871594	1872880	213	B	0.99993	So what is happening?
1877750	1887670	214	A	1	I think the great gift that the authors have provided Daniel and I here is the opportunity, because this work is talking about sequential time.
1887820	1891926	215	A	1	And when on that timeline did things happen?
1892028	1897126	216	A	1	Which came first or why did something that we thought came after?
1897308	1902058	217	A	0.98578	Suddenly we find new evidence that maybe it didn't come after.
1902144	1904134	218	A	0.99985	Maybe it was co occurring.
1904262	1922794	219	A	1	And so what I wanted to do in this particular slide was talk about things like timelines and timetables around the idea of a learning destination, assumptions that learning does have some sense of convergence.
1922922	1932030	220	A	0.99692	So my question was, well, what if all roads, be they rail or paved, lead to an active Rome or Romeference?
1932190	1934354	221	A	0.58536	Like, what is this journey that we're on?
1934392	1936850	222	A	0.99999	What is this interstate that we exist within?
1937000	1951626	223	A	1	And why do we always assume that what we're looking at is the ties between the rails, instead of making sure that when we're talking about a tipping point, we're talking about the fact that the entire underlying structure can hold up?
1951728	1959094	224	A	1	The vehicle that Daniel and I are basically sitting on right now and moving forward with back and forth?
1959222	1962826	225	A	0.99996	So the timelines and timetables to learning destinations are not uptakes.
1962938	1966670	226	A	1	Someone else's formatting is not your outing of a figure.
1966820	1975294	227	A	0.46	Okay, so I've never been on an official dig site, but I have come across dinosaur bones being in Alberta.
1975422	1981314	228	A	1	And so you stumble across these things and whoa, what's that right.
1981432	1990246	229	A	0.97259	In an otherwise field of clay, how much can we schedule and how much is dependent on the sophistication of our hierarchical model?
1990428	2000410	230	A	1	And again, I've practiced this tutrenes, Allendo and Las plateaformas unuenue with apologies to Hector.
2000830	2002198	231	A	0.99997	Where are we departing?
2002294	2007900	232	A	0.84181	All we know is that platforms one and nine let's go.
2008510	2009450	233	A	0.3247	Vamos.
2009950	2011074	234	B	0.99983	All aboard.
2011222	2013482	235	B	0.6014	But great visualization.
2013626	2015450	236	B	1	The papers do have sections.
2015610	2033490	237	B	1	However, without figures or formalisms, we were able to and drawing on the unique subject matter and contributions, able to also even reconsider the linearity and the structure of the stream.
2035030	2040966	238	B	1	The keywords are displayed on the slide just to quickly read through them.
2040988	2058410	239	B	0.79567	In Snakes and Ladders free energy principle fep paleolithic enactment irregular regularities and regular irregularities, haptic working memory tasks prospective episodic and procedural memory phylogenetic and ontogenetic timescales favoring anomalous behavioral propensities to sporadic expression.

2075270	2077730	241	B	1	What can you add about the published priors?
2079830	2099482	242	A	0.65	Well, I just think it's interesting because we've always used this image of the sort of the infinite and antherence ref which I've always really liked because I just momentarily lost the strange loop piece.
2099536	2100998	243	A	0.99999	What is that mobius?
2101094	2102054	244	A	1	Is it a mobius?
2102102	2109782	245	B	0.9995	Right, a mobius stripped, also developed by here Mcscher and Doug Hofstadter into the strange loop concept.
2109846	2110314	246	A	0.99959	Right.
2110432	2116670	247	A	0.99008	So all I wanted to do is add the fact that maybe there is these branch lines.
2117010	2132622	248	A	1	And when we're talking about published priors, I know that in the chronological time they came first, but if we were now to go to them post having read these papers, what would that reveal?
2132766	2133122	249	A	0.99053	Right?
2133176	2135906	250	A	0.52844	Like is a branch less important than the trunk?
2135938	2137270	251	A	0.76	I guess, I don't know.
2137340	2143202	252	A	0.9999	Without a trunk there are no branches, but without branches there's no totality.
2143266	2146600	253	A	0.99961	So that's what I was kind of laying out there.
2147210	2152726	254	B	0.96772	Also, with respect to the literature, it's a canonical example of cumulative culture.
2152758	2166890	255	B	0.51671	It's all at once and the timing of which through Kronos publications were added in is by no means the Kronos or the Cairos of the learner or the researcher.
2167050	2175700	256	B	0.93964	So going from just the past and the present, two min two of the literature to the past, present and future.
2176470	2188340	257	B	1	Three with literature expands into the key points with another disclaimer for your health.
2189030	2192882	258	A	0.99998	There are no cole's notes version that will both make sense and do justice.
2192946	2196226	259	A	1	The analysis research arguments is laid out in these papers.
2196418	2200434	260	A	0.65531	We begin with keys and then start a process of unlocking.
2200562	2203734	261	A	0.987	All right, so how do you want to do this, Daniel?
2203782	2208326	262	A	0.87631	Do you want to split each one of the slides or do you want to just swap slides?
2208358	2208826	263	A	0.99839	I'll do one.
2208848	2209498	264	A	0.98237	You do one?
2209584	2209930	265	B	0.922	Yes.
2210000	2211014	266	B	0.9996	You go for this slide?
2211062	2212394	267	B	0.94213	You go for even slides?
2212442	2213866	268	B	0.99856	I'll do odd slides.
2214058	2214846	269	A	0.92	Okay.
2215028	2217402	270	A	0.95771	All right, so this is all the keys.
2217466	2220720	271	A	0.99999	There are 17 of them from the Snakes and ladder paper.
2221250	2225006	272	A	1	Again, I really strongly recommend you have a read of this.
2225108	2232882	273	A	0.88637	It's a fantastic paper, but if you want the one and a half times speed version of hearing it, this is what it sounds like.
2233016	2243878	274	A	0.754	Evidence of early and middle clustened behavior is distributed in disconcertingly uneven ways between 2,200,000 years ago.
2243964	2265114	275	A	0.80953	Our proposal is that some, at least of the irregular, regularities and regular irregularities of phenomenal attributable to homo in the Pleistocene record reflect the kinds of plausibly anomalous behavior outcomes that doubtless occurred often in a sacred ladders model of evolution in early members of our genus.
2265162	2280430	276	A	0.96388	Regardless of their skeletal Paleospecific taxonomy, increasingly complex extractive and concomitant or consequent procedures appear in several parts of the world at various times towards the end of the Lake Pleistocene.
2280590	2288840	277	A	0.99996	Some seem to have arisen separately and independently in a snakes and ladders fashion and with different outcomes at different places and times.
2289450	2295270	278	A	0.82989	Self evidencing underwrites much of the following arguments, however, there is an important nuance.
2295610	2302134	279	A	0.99999	Certain creatures may have evolved deep generative models with the ability to predict the consequences of their actions.
2302262	2309610	280	A	0.99933	This kind of creature now has the capacity to entertain counterfactual futures under different actions.
2310030	2313274	281	A	0.99997	This is a key aspect of active inference under the fep.
2313322	2321214	282	A	0.9943	Namely, actions and plans are selected on the basis of minimizing expected free energy under that plan.
2321412	2333598	283	A	0.99993	In terms of Bayesian mechanics, evolution and natural selection can be regarded as natural Bayesian model selection, which is also known as structured learning in the cognitive sciences.
2333774	2337058	284	A	0.99918	Evolution thus develops imperceptibly and intermittently.
2337234	2359366	285	A	1	And the fep concept is biologically and especially neurobiologically relevant both at ontogenetic levels of cellular dynamics, neural circuitry and behavior, and at phylogenetic levels of populations evolved through natural selection of biological adaptations and adaptability.
2359478	2362858	286	A	0.99999	Just before we move on because there's a bunch of other keys here.
2363024	2377054	287	A	0.62	I hope it makes sense that not only are we setting the bars up or the plates up on either end of the bar, if we're talking about a tipping point, we as the agent who are going to now bring that bar down to our chest and then reextend ourselves.
2377182	2381380	288	A	0.99999	We don't want the tipping point to be the bar comes down and then squishes us.
2381830	2390134	289	A	0.99978	So us setting this up, there's not a tipping point as a threshold is met and over the whole thing goes.
2390252	2392200	290	A	1	The tipping point is here.
2393450	2394886	291	A	1	Is there some agent.
2394988	2401000	292	A	0.5433	That's actually capable of we're talking directly about that.
2403790	2420910	293	B	0.98082	Continuing with snakes and ladders doubtless tried and trusted routines predominated, and whoever performed them with daily efficiency was trusted by the group, whereas eccentric or idiosyncratic conduct was treated with indifference and not retained in collective memory or lore.
2421330	2430530	294	B	0.89345	prepotent routine behavior plausibly resulted in failure to become aware of potentially idiosyncratic, inactive outcomes.
2431030	2447750	295	B	0.85464	There is a difference between a spatiotemporal snakes and ladders picture of disappearances of tiny huntergatherer bands and appearances of others, and the snakes and ladders model of individual idiosyncratic or unorthodox activity.
2448410	2475138	296	B	0.96556	Heterogeneous composition renders the former picture inappropriate for making predictions, whereas the latter model individual idiosyncratic or unorthodox activity by focusing on the information, theoretic, and energetic constraints on biological neurobiological and psychosocial evolution allows for the consideration of whether, by doing so, it may offer a reasonable interpretation of the material record.
2475304	2486500	297	B	0.99976	In particular, the uneven distribution of stone hand axes and evidence of paleolithic combustion between 2,200,000 years ago.
2486810	2511660	298	B	1	The marginal relevance of stone about 3 million years ago for the existential biological imperative of maintaining homeostatic integrity and consequent reproductive success and survival of inarticulate Hominina plausibly led stones to be regarded as quintessentially, predictable, and unsurprising, and crucially, lacking epistemic affordances implicit in tool use.
2512050	2516334	299	B	0.78404	Nevertheless, an individual could entertain more expressive I.

2524390	2534130	302	B	0.99999	She might discover novel ways of attaining predictable or unsurprising outcomes through her behavior, and its outcome may well have been disregarded by her companions.
2534550	2544306	303	B	0.91192	All the same, such idiosyncratic behavior may trump prevailing expectations that normally are unsurprising and therefore favor minimization of variational.
2544338	2567870	304	B	0.82066	Free energy in line with the free energy principle, it is unclear by what mechanism transmission of any conjectural package could have been sustained over the spatiotemporal dimensions involved, and so, with respect to some kinds of tool usage, it is imprudent to infer that they reflect an unbroken tradition of manual behavior handed down from generation to generation.
2568210	2579970	305	B	0.99999	If a generation lasts 25 years on average, then 200,000 years imply 8000 generations, which presents a major challenge for the culture history approach to interpretation.
2583570	2595762	306	A	0.89188	In late middle Pleistocene, Bflcts were made by precursors of Hsapns in Africa and neanderthals in Europe, probably both used in the similar ways.
2595816	2603010	307	A	0.95865	Nevertheless, the uneven spatial temporal distribution of Bflcts is undeniable.
2603670	2614046	308	A	0.65197	Cognitive and manual designs and strategies for responses in common to underlying neurobiological propensities shared by the early middle Pleistocene.
2614098	2618650	309	A	0.98771	Nappers and nappers are people that actually form and shape these tools.

3016178	3018258	348	A	0.99998	So we're back to the brain based stuff.
3018444	3034080	349	A	0.87	A useful lens is the free energy principle, which underpins a generative hierarchically mechanistic mind or hmm surprising or uncharacteristic sensory and physical states are precluded via a minimization of variation of free energy.

3101822	3124810	355	A	1	In many respects, the words are synonymous with invention and inventor, though these often connote post hoc recognition, the imperative to maximize the expected information, curious behavior responding to epistemic affordance resolves uncertainty and thereby reduces the long term average of prediction errors in the future.
3124960	3138650	356	A	0.99999	However, this kind of innovative behavior is risky owing to its deviation from those phenotypical responses that selection is favored in a specific ecological niche.

3210010	3220940	365	B	1	This means, by definition that innovative behavior is both unlikely to be evinced in any given phenotype and crucially difficult to recognize when observed by another.

3264290	3275190	371	B	1	The ability to do that dynamically and to conduct complex computations suggestive of high attentional executive control implies sensitivity to both previous experience and the current context.
3275350	3298974	372	B	0.99587	Perhaps the overriding of top down predictions implies that those complex attentional and strategic components of working memory that distinguish humans from chimpanzees plausibly familiarity by conspecific observers with the actions demonstrated in an experiment kept their surprise associated with the demonstrated actions within a manageable range.
3299022	3301490	373	B	0.58	And this in turn prompted copying.

3310226	3317714	375	B	0.9989	It's easier for chimpanzees to perform complex actions that involve considerable motor demands than it is for them to reproduce actions that are unorthodox.
3317762	3330940	376	B	1	With regard to their habitual behavior repertoire, brains must shoulder an additional energetic cost whenever novel associative behavior responses are introduced that may override those already present.
3332130	3344530	377	B	1	The acceptability of reproducing a novel artifact may owe at least as much to the ways in which broadly similar copies might be used with predictably accurate outcomes.

3513266	3519370	390	A	0.99152	That's being restated, we already talked about it earlier in our introduction.
3519870	3542960	391	B	0.5482	Yes, it reflects many of the so called biological attributes that archaeologists study in terms of cranial volume and developmental trajectories, and reaches towards some of those more ineffable or at least unrecorded cognitive phenotypes like working memory, ability to integrate diverse stimuli and so on.
3544130	3545360	392	B	0.54	More on that.
3546130	3560740	393	B	0.99665	Homo erectus observers brains may have lacked neuronal networks efficient enough for enabling them to develop innovative behavioral responses in the early Pleistocene that were habit forming a zone of bounded surprise here and after Zbs restricted them.
3561590	3586430	394	B	0.54055	Possibly, observations by early Homo erectus were translated often into activity intermediate between emulation and imitation, owing to limited foresight about the significance of precise manipulations for determining the practicality and effectiveness of an outcome dimly envisaged, their ZVS limited their ability to join up the mental steps involved in planning and to infer counterfactual possibilities.
3587810	3598258	395	B	0.99998	That is a fundamental aspect of active inference that selection of actions and plans is based on minimizing the free energy to be anticipated in undertaking them.
3598344	3599890	396	B	0.99979	Minimizing effort.
3600310	3610898	397	B	1	And also extremely interestingly, as we explored in Live Stream 52 with Lancelot Costa, free energy is not the only discrepancy measure, and one that was mentioned was the Earth mover's distance.
3610994	3626634	398	B	0.99997	So it's interesting to think about active inference with the Earth mover's distance if you are actually moving earth zones abounded surprisal ZVS are different from the zones of latent solutions ZLS proposed by Tenney et al.

3651110	3671510	400	B	1	The focus of the zbs concept is on the observers and their ability to make sense of an observed innovation encoding and subsequent copying of an innovation depends on the degree of disparity or surprisal between predictable behavior which are those typical of the species and the perceptual incoming information about novel behaviors.
3671850	3683838	401	B	1	The ZVS allows any potentially novel or unorthodox behavior to be copied provided that the ranges or levels of surprisal provoked in observers are tolerated or manageable by them.
3684004	3703490	402	B	1	The ZPs is constrained by the capacity of a species'cerebral neuronal network as opposed to potentially a sociocultural explanation which might argue that the continuity or pattern overall of a tool's appearance would be rather constrained by the capacity of a social group's transmission capacity.
3703910	3708290	403	B	0.58482	It's a yes and they're proposing a different tack.
3709290	3716210	404	B	0.86366	Zbs focuses on the observer of an innovation and hence ZLS and Zbs can be useful complementary concepts.

3862412	3880166	419	A	0.99757	Hence, defining that patterns of sequence specific activation are strongest when performing at greatest speed implies that investigating fine grained patterns of activity requires participants to cope with a strong manual challenge.

4215592	4226070	448	A	0.99677	So I'll turn over the actual diagram now to you and be able to talk a little bit about that in terms of how we shape that in terms of discrete and continuous time.
4226920	4227428	449	B	0.99992	Awesome.
4227514	4257144	450	B	1	Well, this is Figure 4.3 from Par Pazulo and Friston's 2022 active inference textbook that we have textbook groups at the institute around and two different taxonomic groups, maybe generative modelus erectus and generative modelus habilis or something like that, are juxtaposed in a way that highlights their structural similarity but also calls attention to some of their details.
4257272	4261352	451	B	0.99875	On the top is a partially observable Markov decision process.
4261506	4265890	452	B	0.74	And this is a discrete time representation of a generative model.
4266980	4279284	453	B	1	The hidden states are evolving through time and there's a past, present and future which are indexed with temporal markers time minus one, time right now, time plus one.
4279322	4282336	454	B	0.68	And at each time there's the emission of observables.
4282368	4283808	455	B	0.99997	That's the tail of two densities.
4283904	4291844	456	B	0.56967	It can emit generative AI densities from hidden states or it can dean hidden states from observables.
4291892	4304252	457	B	0.95715	That's the A matrix D is the prior b describes how those hidden states change through time and G shapes policy selection through expected free energy that intervenes in how hidden states change through time.
4304386	4312048	458	B	0.7	And more briefly in the continuous time generative model rather than explicit representation of past, present and future.
4312214	4336790	459	B	1	The approach taken is much more resonant with generalized coordinates of motion or a Taylor series expansion in which all past, present and future time points are implicitly predicted through the specification of the derivatives of increasingly high order around the target variable latent state x.
4337820	4339336	460	B	0.97863	There's a lot more to say.
4339438	4354430	461	B	1	But when I saw Dean bring in the straight and the wavy and the kind of meta train track that together they enabled seeing, I thought 4.3, that's where we wanted to be.
4355040	4356910	462	A	0.98	And here's the interesting thing.
4357360	4390436	463	A	0.61487	Even in that representation, if you were to suddenly realize that you liked the relaxing meandering route, that you're not always in a hurry, you would probably have a better chance of realizing that in continuous time the suddenness would occur as you stretched your window of analysis out, which again seems counterintuitive, but that's what the representation affirms.
4390628	4404104	464	B	1	And one last note on this before you introduce the next one is in this Figure 4.3 we see a crystallization of methodological pluralism in active inference.
4404232	4409512	465	B	0.99986	So all questions of the form how does inference, active inference treat x phenomena?
4409576	4411720	466	B	0.99999	Even for a specified subsystem?
4411880	4416352	467	B	1	There is no a priori reason to favor the left or the right foot.
4416486	4420224	468	B	1	We want the barbell loaded on both sides before we bench press it.
4420342	4435220	469	B	0.68	And so even the decision of the time window and the treatment of time, which is one of the most absolutely fundamental decisions in a model, let alone further structural learning questions which were mentioned earlier in the quotations.
4435880	4445320	470	B	0.99999	Even at that most fundamental divergence between discrete and continuous time generative models, the active infra Ant absolutely has a decision.
4448560	4451616	471	B	0.99989	So what do you see here and what do we want to bring in?
4451718	4454976	472	A	0.99277	Yeah, this was Ryan Smith's paper.
4455078	4469430	473	A	0.81	And what I like about this is he broke it down into decision active inference just to if you want to go back and have a look at that live stream set.
4472040	4484292	474	A	0.99997	What he was trying to speak to there was that a lot of stuff that's going on in folk psychology doesn't contradict what we now kind of understand in terms of how we can model things out using active inference.
4484356	4501180	475	A	1	And again, you can explain the diagram better than I can, but I think what's interesting here is to decide to make a choice to copy or not to copy.
4501920	4504800	476	A	0.76	To throw a stone or not to throw a stone.
4505380	4514964	477	A	0.992	There's two slides here that we kind of have to kind of pull together again for what I wanted to focus on, which is on the next slide next.
4515002	4521750	478	A	0.99997	But here what I want to do is kind of talk about this paragraph on the bottom left hand side.
4523080	4526420	479	A	0.92565	You have a paper about sensory attenuation.
4526840	4532548	480	A	0.99969	What do we pay attention to as an outcome desensitization?
4532644	4539576	481	A	0.99059	This only becomes problematic when contingencies in the environment, when the environment changes over time.
4539758	4540056	482	A	0.5573	Right.
4540078	4545084	483	A	0.58928	So we are talking about things that agents do in time and in place.
4545202	4556960	484	A	1	But what this paper was talking about was sort of the folk psychological and some of those stories that we've used to try to explain things and focuses on what's going on in the envelope, what's going on in the niche.
4557620	4568196	485	A	0.99996	This highlights an important distinction between this type of habit formation and other mechanisms promoting habitlike patterns of behavior in decision active inference, for example.
4568298	4578452	486	A	0.99983	Actions can also become resistant to change after repeated experience because agents build up highly confident beliefs about the reward probabilities under each action.
4578596	4588836	487	A	0.99995	If contingencies, change could take a very large number of trials for agents to unlearn such beliefs.
4588868	4595980	488	A	0.99981	So I wanted to throw this in as a complement to the habitization stuff that was in the copied or not to copy paper.
4596130	4598510	489	A	0.9999	Do you want to explain the diagram real quick?
4598880	4608780	490	B	1	My only comment there is with respect to Ali's question about copy discard, the shadow of to copy or not to copy is to discard or not to discard.
4608940	4623044	491	B	1	Because if people have been hitting their rocks one way and somebody else even if the functional mirror neurons allow one to understand that one is doing it differently, there's a whole variety of things that can happen and not.
4623082	4639500	492	B	1	All of them involve the successful contagion of even an resolutely positive improvement on tool use and especially with complex trade off frontiers and partially obscured views and all these other social complexities.
4640000	4649320	493	B	0.99995	That is going to mean that to copy or not to copy to discard or not to discard copy discard becomes a central piece in compositional.
4649400	4653920	494	B	0.99998	Accounts of surprise minimization under the hierarchically mechanistic minds.
4655540	4665872	495	A	0.96842	So on this slide, which was just a continuation of that live stream set or deck, I'm going to drop down to the fourth paragraph.
4665936	4685412	496	A	0.99989	If the highest value in an outcome space was specified for observing tasting ice cream in the policy and the policy space included, either choose don't move or choose walk to the ice cream truck and buy ice cream.
4685556	4695068	497	A	0.75	A deciding active agent, active inference agent will infer that walking to the ice cream truck and buying ice cream is the highest probability policy.
4695154	4698376	498	A	0.99996	That is, it will form the intention to go buy ice cream.
4698408	4713292	499	A	0.99958	In addition, when considering the range of cases involving goal directed choice, we have been unsuccessful at identifying examples where the policy would play a role inconsistent with representing desired outcomes.
4713356	4714724	500	A	1	Now, here's an interesting thing.
4714762	4734936	501	A	0.99997	Even back then, if you look at the ice cream cone and you ask it to the third person now, Daniel and Dean looking at the slide, is the ice cream truck closer to us as we're viewing this or further away from us than the actual ice cream cone is?
4735038	4744284	502	A	1	You get one sense of it and then if I grab this line at first it appears that the ice cream cone truck is closer to us.
4744322	4753408	503	A	0.99999	If I do this, however, and I grab this line just like that, pull that away.
4753574	4755692	504	A	1	Now all of a sudden, what's in the foreground?
4755756	4757340	505	A	0.72	The ice cream cone.
4757500	4771600	506	A	0.57202	So oftentimes when we're trying to figure out what we desire or what our goal is, we're completely unaware of how we're setting up our own frame, what rule we're actually following.
4771680	4775424	507	A	0.99983	If we have a rule, we're completely unaware of it.
4775482	4784890	508	A	0.68	And yet that has a huge decision implication on what's the desired foreground background here?
4786140	4800510	509	A	0.99994	How are we coming about to this idea that this one shape which we're going to have to arrive at by removing things is more advantageous than just leaving it the way it is.
4800820	4809408	510	A	0.61852	So just to have one perspective on something unidirectional versus to be able to have those two perspectives on something.
4809494	4824176	511	A	0.84215	So again, this was in comparison to a folk psychology narrative of telling how we might come to behaving versus the active inference.
4824368	4832536	512	A	0.52825	What Ryan wanted to do in his paper was say they're not fighting with one another.
4832718	4848088	513	A	0.55	And oftentimes, if you actually understand that you've made a lot of choices that you're not even aware of, that your generative model sometimes is a reduction to some rules that you may or may not even be able to articulate.
4848184	4849390	514	A	1	And that's fine.
4850740	4855532	515	A	0.99728	Yes, it will influence what you do present as an articulation.
4855676	4863780	516	A	0.99995	It doesn't change what we now understand as the mechanisms that are present and that may help us.
4863850	4865910	517	A	0.98658	In terms of some of that predictive process.
4868360	4873110	518	B	0.99992	Awesome live stream 46 way back when.
4873960	4877648	519	B	0.9761	All right, just a few more pieces to bring into the puzzle.
4877744	4885000	520	B	0.62229	So I'll give the first description on each of them and then Dean, feel free to kind of bring in why you wanted these to be here.
4885150	4898200	521	B	0.99378	So here's a paper, a variational synthesis of evolutionary and developmental dynamics which was written with Friston, myself, Constance Knight, Par and Campbell.
4898360	4925940	522	B	0.97901	We recently uploaded it to archive and one of the main novelties or contributions of this paper was in contrast with previous multiscale biologically oriented active inference or fep models which used the formalism of nested POMDPs to model nested Markov blankets, thus creating one bigger and bigger tree with finer and finer leaves.
4926460	4960896	523	B	0.58784	We used an explicit, discontinuous, multiscale or scale friendly jump such that within the lifetime, the intra generational action perception loops and also developmental loops that we heard about in some selections from the papers today that that particular partition that thing, over the course of its life in an ecologically embodied way can have bottom up causation to this higher order thing, which is a population thing.
4961078	4973910	524	B	1	And this higher order extended genotypic thing also uses the exact same particular partition mathematics and framing that we see across systems in active.
4974360	4989324	525	B	1	And another way to look at that is here in the center is one thing with a blue ring going around it at a given level and it is itself composed of these smaller things which also are composed of even smaller things.
4989522	4995420	526	B	0.8	And also that main blue ring is playing a role in potentially a larger thing.
4995570	5008560	527	B	0.59	And this is the scale friendliness or the scale freeness of the fep formalism discussed in an ontogenetic phylogenetic setting within and amongst generations.
5008980	5039880	528	B	1	And rather than utilizing this graphed bigger and bigger POMDPs strategy, we introduce an explicit discontinuity in that things at a lower level are sampled or instantiated from a higher level distributional thing and the differential success of those within generation trajectories can result in bottom up causation modifying the extended genotypic thing.
5040030	5046460	529	B	1	I hope that we'll have more sessions to talk more about this paper and related work, but just wanted to give that quick overview.
5047040	5062352	530	A	1	And I don't have a lot of deep background in biology, so the reason why I was hoping that you would be interested in at least touching on this is because I think, again, we're back to so which have we chosen to do?
5062406	5072260	531	A	0.9998	Have we chosen to zoom in on the scale friendly or have we zoom in on the scale friendly or zoom out onto the scale free?
5072410	5083770	532	A	1	And I think we get a better understanding when we're able to appreciate the differences and put them back together in sort of our own model.
5086460	5087208	533	B	0.97201	Great.
5087374	5088910	534	B	0.99967	On to the next.
5090400	5105804	535	B	0.75181	Here is a paper with Sean O'Connor who led this effort and myself from the end of 2022 predictive Processing interpretation of the Mirror test and implications of a reflection prediction for human cognition.
5105932	5125884	536	B	0.93	And just to read one sentence from the abstract, we hypothesize that a reflection prediction upon which our predictive processing interpretation of the mirror test is built may also offer a novel perspective to understand how humans locate themselves relative to a mirror, imitate others and are self aware from a social perspective.
5126032	5130408	537	B	0.99949	So what have you seen in that mirror mirror on the screen?
5130494	5132090	538	B	1	And why did you want it here?
5134460	5149820	539	A	0.98785	Because I think the sensory first of all, I strongly recommend people get this paper and read it because I thought it was an excellent paper and it should become on part of more people's reading lists.
5150420	5166304	540	A	0.99	One of the things that really speaks to very clearly and makes a strong case around is the role of sensory attention and bringing the concept of sensory attenuation into the world of predictive processing.
5166432	5179204	541	A	0.94	And I think it would be something that would be helpful for people to understand, especially if you're thinking that, for example and I don't forget, Danny, you'll know what this is.
5179242	5195644	542	A	0.99998	But one of the things that was talked about in this paper was the idea that if you believe you do not have a limb, then one of the things that you could do is come up with a way of a mirror showing you without that limb, even if you already possessed it.
5195682	5214512	543	A	0.97319	So it's reinforcing what Hector and Michael Andy Clark were talking about in terms of so how does active inference help us get to maybe some more plausible answers in prosaic ways?
5214646	5221284	544	A	1	And so the sensory attenuation piece to me was really valuable and tied in with some of the concepts we're talking about here.
5221482	5232020	545	B	0.99772	Yeah, one thought on that is let's grant an effective mirror neuron or recognition capacity, just spatially in terms of tool usage.
5232100	5238296	546	B	0.99996	So that is not always granted with eyesight and partial occlusion of the working locations of tools and all of this.
5238318	5252844	547	B	0.96756	But let's just say that an observer can observe somebody else doing a motor behavior and entirely understands the basis of that motor behavior like the person does a pirouette or they write a line incursive or they play violin.
5252972	5260400	548	B	1	You can have absolute understanding of the mechanisms of the baseball pitcher, of the hockey stick.
5260980	5269136	549	B	0.80416	Yet there are multiple reasons from an embodied and cognitive perspective why the behavior cannot be copied.
5269328	5279288	550	B	0.99989	We can all understand that there are certain sport acts that are not just strength limited and they're not even necessarily dexterity limited that we cannot do.
5279374	5284932	551	B	0.99998	We cannot write in a language we do not know by hand, even though we might have the motor dexterity.
5284996	5306304	552	B	0.88	And so that's a semantic explanation or quite simply and to call back the zone of bounded surprisal an observer may observe a hetero praxis, a different praxis and simply, implicitly or even explicitly believe that's unlikely for me to do.
5306502	5309504	553	B	1	And as it was thought, so it shall be done.
5309622	5330804	554	B	0.59	The innovation is over and then lastly and a little bit most Extrapolatively previously in some work I've juxtaposed Buckminster Fuller's life and work in times with that of William Blake.
5330932	5348616	555	B	1	And the prompting quote from the paper was above zones of bounded surprisal are different from the zones of latent solution in their attempt to explain the lack of cumulative culture in great apes on the basis that cultural complexity is restricted by the limited potentials for individual invention.
5348808	5371988	556	B	0.72875	So Bucky and Blake were both tremendously inventive individuals and to reflect a few lines of some Blake poetry the auguries of Innocence begins with to see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wild flower hold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour.
5372154	5381940	557	B	0.99999	Those are some of the famous opening lines of that poem and they speak to this time representation but the closing lines are less often quoted.
5383260	5393036	558	B	0.82982	We are led to believe a lie when we see not through the eye which was born in a night to perish in a night when the soul slept in beams of light.
5393218	5397868	559	B	0.98747	God appears and God is light to those poor souls who dwell in night.
5398034	5402850	560	B	0.99998	But does a human form display to those who dwell in realms of day?
5403540	5406530	561	B	0.72	And I'll let you get the word on that.
5407220	5408720	562	A	0.59	Well, here's the thing.
5408790	5431540	563	A	1	I want to thank again the authors who are going to be joining us for the one and two for allowing us to pull two of their papers into proximity and allow us to talk about them so proximally because we I think I speak for both of us, but you can correct me on this, Daniel.
5431620	5463020	564	A	0.93	I think with the use of active inference and our continuous updating with active inference as a way of strategizing are coming to realize that sometimes things that seem really distal and unrelated when brought together, you as the person who is looking at two things at once with both of your eyes open tend to learn a lot.
5463190	5482708	565	A	0.74	And so whether it's pulling Buckminster Fuller and Blake into the same slide deck or talking about to copy or not to copy and snakes and ladders it's actually a real treat to be able to bring things that seem like well, conventionally.
5482804	5486040	566	A	0.99999	That was field work and this is lab work.
5486190	5510064	567	A	0.99991	Being able to have 1ft in both of those realms really helps the person who likes to go back and forth who is moving from a position of being really familiar with the subject matter to being somebody who can actually get into the predictive matters because they're more comfortable in doing the update thing.
5510262	5512720	568	A	0.99781	They're not quite so stuck and bound.
5513960	5521300	569	A	0.77	And that means when I see ZLS and ZVS beside one another makes me very, very happy.
5521450	5542830	570	A	0.99436	So that's why I wanted you to get acknowledged for some of the work that you've done in terms of this isn't the first time that you seen an advantage in bringing two things that don't seem like they belong on the same table and bringing them together and kind of going, whoa, look what happens when you do.
5545480	5545988	571	B	0.74227	Great.
5546074	5546420	572	B	0.99998	Thanks.
5546490	5549268	573	B	0.99994	Any final comments or I'll give a final thought.
5549434	5550260	574	A	0.99757	Go for it.
5550330	5555832	575	B	0.95614	All right, well, I would just like to echo your words.
5555966	5568700	576	B	0.9999	We really appreciated, even, dare I say, working with the authors in this zero and even negative dot one, the first of its kind interval.
5570560	5582210	577	B	0.99997	These papers initially, to me at least, felt like two pillowy beds of plain text.
5583060	5585970	578	B	0.91174	Can't think of any other way to say it right now.
5586420	5599440	579	B	0.54881	However, once we dug at that field site and we brushed off some of those uni and bifacial tools and ideas, there was just more and more to find and explore.
5600180	5607080	580	B	0.99731	So I'm very much looking forward to the coming one, two, and potentially beyond.
5608540	5609944	581	B	1	And we hope you've enjoyed this.
5609982	5611370	582	B	0.96	53.0.
5612780	5613828	583	A	0.53379	Thanks, Daniel.
5613924	5614392	584	B	0.77295	All right.
5614446	5614856	585	B	0.5241	Thank you.
5614878	5615252	586	A	0.99785	Dean.
5615316	5615540	587	B	0.69419	Farewell.
