410	960	A	0.546256959438324	You.
7860	9410	B	0.872096598148346	Hello and welcome.
9940	12528	B	0.8797155022621155	It's March 17, 2023.
12614	14524	B	0.6060720682144165	We're here in active Livestream.
14572	16290	B	0.750673770904541	Number 53.0.
16820	18844	B	0.8058606386184692	Welcome to the active institute.
18972	25068	B	0.5337912440299988	We're a participatory online institute that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference.
25164	27436	B	0.8681511878967285	You can find us at the links on the slide.
27628	33400	B	0.5309205651283264	This is a recorded and archived live stream, so please provide feedback so we can improve our work.
33550	36200	B	0.8395857214927673	All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome.
36350	48300	B	0.5648888349533081	We'll be following video etiquette for live streams, head over active inference.org to learn more about the institute and getting involved with learning groups and projects.
49360	58956	B	0.7435436844825745	We're here in Acdam stream number 53.0, and our goal is to learn and discuss a pair of papers.
59148	71220	B	0.91566002368927	The first paper is Snakes and Ladders in Paleoanthropology from Cognitive Surprise to Skillfulness a Million Years Ago by Hector Manrique, Carl Friston and Michael Walker.
71640	86360	B	0.8631419539451599	The article was posted to Sci Archive in 2022 and the second paper is to copy or not to copy, that is the question from Chimpanzees to the foundation of Human Technological Culture.
86780	91492	B	0.9201086163520813	This paper is with Menrique and Walker as authors.
91636	95512	B	0.9009541869163513	Fristenless it was also uploaded to Psy Archive.
95576	103240	B	0.9702720046043396	And recently, as we have been delighted to discover, the paper has been accepted in Physics of Life reviews.
103320	109372	B	0.9388418197631836	However, the quotes that we're drawing from and reading from today are drawn from the Psy Archive version.
109436	117512	B	0.7326991558074951	Just so people know and like all the videos, we're here to make an introduction for some of the dean and the materials.
117596	120710	B	0.6272425055503845	It's not a review or a final word.
121240	135716	B	0.8077124357223511	In this 53.0 video, we're going to introduce ourselves, say hello, and then we are going to call it like we see it with the aims and claims abstract roadmap keywords.
135828	145000	B	0.6571890115737915	And there are no figures or formalisms in these papers, but I think we'll have enough bounded surprise to navigate nonetheless.
145160	150092	B	0.8600380420684814	So let us begin with introductions and then we'll head into big questions.
150226	150956	B	0.617027759552002	So.
151138	154008	B	0.5844668745994568	Dean thanks, Danny.
154024	154376	A	0.7564190030097961	I'm Dean.
154408	155580	A	0.8681977391242981	I'm here in Calgary.
156000	163410	A	0.65652996301651	I'm not going to do much around the warm up question piece because I've got a big question coming up, so I'll pass it over to you.
163780	167132	B	0.5759752988815308	I'm Daniel, I'm in California and agreed.
167276	170150	B	0.7535005211830139	Please lead in with your big questions.
171640	178516	A	0.8116893172264099	Well, I'm going to start by just sort of highlighting the big questions that the authors have, if that's okay.
178538	179910	A	0.7708371877670288	I'll just read them out.
180220	190340	A	0.6501502990722656	So for the Snakes and Ladder paper, there were a number of questions that sort of enabled the authors to go forward with their ideas.
190420	191780	A	0.7145224809646606	Two questions arise.
191940	205484	A	0.8752639889717102	First, what is it that could provoke cognitive awareness as to the possibility of fashioning stone hand axes in relation to the affordances of raw materials and potential advantages for minimizing bioenergetic effort?
205612	214050	A	0.8648815155029297	Secondly, what does this say about the irregular appearance of this regular technique in the Pleistocene spatial temporal record?
214420	233428	A	0.9051486253738403	Also, how was remembered awareness retrieved from personal, short and long term memory transmitted as knowledge to others in whose memories it could become embedded with a degree of fidelity sufficient to enable intergenerational or intercommunal diffusion?
233604	237300	A	0.9287685751914978	How far was observational learning involved?
237380	241944	A	0.8215667605400085	Do you want me to read the CRNC, or do you want to do that yourself?
242062	247112	B	0.841774582862854	All right, I'll read the questions from the authors in Copy or not to Copy.
247256	253996	B	0.5249327421188354	They wrote, Why do chimpanzees not live in a complex technological world?
254178	260012	B	0.8244401812553406	Why does innovation fail to translate into technological cumulative complexity?
260156	264156	B	0.7720662355422974	Does it owe to a limited capacity to copy with fidelity?
264348	266924	B	0.875741720199585	What is the implication for innovations?
267052	282200	B	0.8207061886787415	What ingredients must be present from a free energy principle standpoint in innovators minds brains and in observers mind slash brains for innovation to take root in a community and be transmitted between generations?
287860	289970	A	0.8065590858459473	Yeah, great questions.
290580	327084	A	0.5830212831497192	Now, how do we want well, we know how we want to do this, but one of the things before we get too far along is we, as hosts today, really want to honor the fact that a lot of time has been spent making sure that the ideas that the authors want to bring into the public domain are very clear and that we don't read a whole bunch into it.
327122	329624	A	0.7477598190307617	Now, we're not going to speculate.
329672	332560	A	0.6456583738327026	We're not going to go off on any kind of tangent here.
332630	343272	A	0.6411667466163635	We're going to try to focus strictly on the arguments that they are putting forward, because they're putting forward some pretty strong and I think, well evidenced arguments.
343436	351620	A	0.6620087027549744	So although there's lots of questions being asked, they're also trying to provide a few very defendable answers.
353240	353990	B	0.4650449752807617	Absolutely.
354840	362824	B	0.9216439723968506	That is to prelude the questions that we, Dean and I and Ali are asking.
363022	378140	B	0.7625899314880371	And then we're going to dive largely into verbatim quotations from the texts, and we'll have a dessert session where we bring up some future topics and ideas.
379440	381964	B	0.8159781098365784	What big question brought you into this?
382002	385384	A	0.6675654649734497	53 dean okay, so apologies.
385512	391712	A	0.5781143307685852	There's going to be a lot of reading today, so if you don't like my voice, you're going to just read this and hit the pause button.
391766	396108	A	0.8453452587127686	But anyway, the attention topical transition is paper one to paper two.
396214	403220	A	0.7343037128448486	And we're not really spending a lot of time right now saying which came first because we think of them as a pair.
403720	413012	A	0.8324759602546692	The shift between snakes and ladders model of evolution and learning comparisons across species with special attention given to innovation as copying ability.
413076	418368	A	0.6486793756484985	Both papers there is much to say and discuss around learning as an uptake exercise.
418564	433676	A	0.882230281829834	If as reviewers, people reading these papers, we were to take an active and then in between that and inference anthropologist, archaeologist, comparative psychologist approach to combining these manuscripts.
433708	445492	A	0.6710318326950073	And then I singled out many examples of where the authors speak expressively around combining combinatorial, and you can read that on your own.
445546	466772	A	0.891455888748169	If we were to look at combinations, what might we learn when bicameral, for example, two eyes and bi temporal meaning holding up then and now strategies as analysis are approximated with active and inference as parentheses tool uptake, for example, telescopes and microscope usage.
466916	472440	A	0.8938781023025513	After before or concurrent with compounding strategy uptake.
472780	474220	A	0.7806742787361145	So that's my big question.
474290	478908	A	0.5095959305763245	And I think we're probably not going to get close to an answer until the dot two.
478994	485330	A	0.8026850819587708	That's why it's a big question because I think it's going to be able to span a little bit of a window here.
486580	487330	B	0.7671424746513367	Great.
487780	491170	B	0.8311567306518555	And I wrote a shorter question.
491620	506124	B	0.8956108093261719	Apart from other applications, for example, in research and development or in other fields or looking towards the future, how does the free energy principle and active inference serve as a historical framework or approach?
506272	527420	B	0.8936481475830078	So whether we lean towards Aristotelian Causation Philosophies or Tinbergen's approach to ethology behavioral analysis, how does a historical explanatory power fit in amongst the wise, the plurality of wise in our investigations?
527760	538690	B	0.8966631293296814	And Ali, who is joining for some discussions, proposed the question how can self organized systems use copy discard functions to store information?
539540	547830	B	0.8853743076324463	A little bit of an externalization from our category theory developments that I'm sure will arise later.
548200	551990	B	0.6596261262893677	So you go for the top, I'll go for the bottom.
552360	552772	A	0.584351658821106	Okay.
552826	572788	A	0.7721703052520752	So just before I start, I want to really emphasize the fact that the authors I think to really comprehend what the authors are trying to put forward as an idea here, you have to really spend some time thinking through the aims of the papers and the claims.
572804	574424	A	0.8213092684745789	We placed a heavy emphasis.
574552	576508	A	0.6239174008369446	We're going to give a lot more time over to that.
576594	595152	A	0.7732236385345459	It's going to seem like we're going to give a lot of time over to the keys because having talked to the authors prior to coming on and doing this live stream set, they use those terms of the key and the key to unlocking some of these ideas that have been held for a long time.
595206	601392	A	0.5649375319480896	So apologies again if it seems like we're text heavy or dialogue heavy.
601536	605188	A	0.6817632913589478	But in order to really appreciate what's going on, you have to kind of get it out there.
605274	615940	A	0.8758023977279663	So for the Snakes and Labs paper, provide a hypothesis, a paradigmatic account around how variational free energy is both individual ontogenetic and collective.
616020	643250	A	0.867233395576477	Phylogenetic modeling could have played a part in what could now be described as a methodological fep paradigm or relating biological and technological behavior in homo, snakes and ladders in this context pertains to appearances and disappearances of Paleolithic skills in the early and middle Pleistocene record.
643880	651632	A	0.742563784122467	Our proposal invokes a methodological paradigm grounded in existential principles that underpin the evolution of living organisms.
651776	684320	A	0.8660125732421875	It is that some, at least of the irregular, regularities and regular irregularities of phenomena attributable to homo in the Pleistocene record reflect the kinds of plausibility anomalous behavior outcomes that doubtless occurred often in a stakes and ladder model of evolution in early members of Ardenus, regardless of their skeletal paleospecific taxonomy.
684820	685376	B	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
685478	691680	B	0.7970037460327148	I'll read the bottom and then feel free to explain the side by side visually.
692260	694656	B	0.7141662836074829	They wrote into copy or not to copy.
694848	714084	B	0.6957074403762817	An aim is to introduce the notion that chimpanzees and other great apes show considerable limitations in their ambiguity or zone of bounded surprisal to overcome cognitive surprisal induced by innovative or unorthodox behavior, which is rarely is copied precisely or accurately.
714212	722830	B	0.5502058863639832	So things that can be innovated in a moment but do not have the ability to be recognized and carried forward.
723360	733040	B	0.6893284916877747	And they discussed the circumstances under which Pleistocene homo underwent remarkable evolutionary adaptation of neurobiological propensities.
733380	735244	B	0.883883535861969	Cerebral aspects are discussed.
735292	744740	B	0.8218745589256287	That it is proposed here were fundamental for faithful copying, which underpins social transmission of technology's, cumulative culture and culture.
746920	751636	A	0.796867847442627	So I think what we're going to be doing is holding up two things at once.
751818	758788	A	0.6722644567489624	The two things are copying as repetition and copying as origination, if there is such a word.
758874	766004	A	0.7529361844062805	But essentially of these images here, there are copies that were simply cut and pasted so they were repeated.
766132	772680	A	0.8698691725730896	And then there was one representation between those two that's an origination.
772760	778236	A	0.6260051727294922	It didn't exist to be copied, but now it can be.
778418	792668	A	0.8478854298591614	So now what we're going to be doing is looking at, okay, so how does maybe all of that play out when we're observing the world around us, when we're taking things in and trying to reduce our surprise?
792764	795124	A	0.49394333362579346	How many things are we being deep faked on?
795242	811130	A	0.8427338600158691	How many things are action action oriented representation therefore manageable as two very different places of understanding or appreciation, maybe?
813740	814392	B	0.7671424746513367	Great.
814526	814936	B	0.4896697998046875	All right.
814958	823180	B	0.7778314352035522	I'll go for the first of the sections and then feel free to comment on them or to pick up on the second sections.
823520	838364	B	0.8029215335845947	So in snakes and Ladders, they wrote, cognitive surprises favoring anomalous behavioral propensities to sporadic expression, can explain snakes and ladders appearances and disappearances of paleolithic skills in the early and middle Pleistocene.
838412	852740	B	0.791655957698822	Record some behavioral outcomes attributable plausibly to individual members of homo unable to maintain orthodox behavior responses when faced with cognitive surprises, which is surprisal in the Bayesian terminology.
853640	860468	B	0.8758130073547363	Such individuals may show a particular neurobiological propensity for exploring unorthodox possibilities.
860644	883440	B	0.5684927105903625	The propensity has evolved further in humans than in great apes, which, unlike even our very young children, our larvae seem unable to envisage how things might be as well as how they actually are, whereas by coupling recall of past experience with prospective memory, humans are capable of blending reality among different potential spheres.
887380	902112	A	0.8509386777877808	Statistical considerations of classical population genetics are incommensurate with notions that Darwinian fitness and Pleistocene homo increased imperceptibly through gradual dual inheritance.
902176	915530	A	0.8725989460945129	Coevolution inherited changes proceeded in well nigh invariant lockstep with heritability of active behavioral and technological changes.
915900	937948	A	0.7803567051887512	Although ontogenetic autopoiesis may involve action perception cycles, a phylogenetic consequence could include unawareness by companions that those exceptions might allow new cooperative opportunities for minimizing the group's variation of free energy by performing unaccustomed behavior to attain dubious benefit.
938124	966040	A	0.7633708715438843	Though foresight of fluent communication innovations often must have disappeared unremarket, seen as useless and their creator's prowess as misplaced energy and wasting time needed for satisfying the group's existentially implacable, energetics prepotent, routine behavior, and prosocial early homo plausibly resulted in failure to become aware of the potential of idiosyncratic active outcomes.
966620	979896	A	0.656512975692749	Here a prosaic approach merely inverts that narrative approach to interpreting the deep past, which draws for its inspiration on humane and social studies.
980088	993328	A	0.6632572412490845	The inversion subordinates the narrative approach to critical scrutiny, such that the narrative approach no longer seems to be the most appropriate or most parsimonious interpretation available.
993494	998224	A	0.5700480937957764	Now, again, what we're doing is trying to avoid the situation where we're cherry picking.
998272	1004964	A	0.7785972952842712	So if you want to pause and read what's been written in context, please feel free to do that.
1005002	1012680	A	0.5420238375663757	But we just want to make sure that we touch on the highest peaks in this range.
1013500	1016330	B	0.5843651294708252	Yes, the full papers are out there.
1016780	1032440	B	0.9599515795707703	We're linearizing and curating in this zero, which has been an incredible experience and that has helped us grasp some of these points, hopefully, so we can take them further.
1032600	1035964	B	0.5981680154800415	And I'll read the quote and then you can go into the red zone.
1036092	1036944	A	0.5779587030410767	Yeah, go for it.
1036982	1055140	B	0.8766477108001709	In Snakes and Ladders, they wrote the argument proposed here about a neurobiological propensity to an individual enactment in modifying stone, considered from the standpoint of the free energy principle, is not concerned with a null hypothesis of innate latent spontaneity.
1055560	1064612	B	0.6868384480476379	Instead, it is directed towards interpreting irregular regularities and regular irregularities in the Pleistocene snakes and ladders.
1064676	1072488	B	0.8937052488327026	Record of appearances and disappearances of Bflcts, which we're going to get to tools.
1072664	1077576	B	0.8736196756362915	Given presence of BF lCTs in widely differing biotopes.
1077688	1084012	B	0.9094933271408081	Which likely led to differential behavioral evolution of appropriate subsistence strategies and diets.
1084156	1101860	B	0.8370019793510437	There is widespread comparability of the principal morphological attributes of BF lCTs of diverse Petrology at sites with contrasting paleo environments and different spatiotemporal contexts or paleoanthropological taxa.
1102360	1113652	B	0.6604129076004028	This renders unlikely any notion of a straightforward mendelian genetic basis favoring BF Lct outcomes by natural selection for a specific behavior adaptation.
1113796	1135650	B	0.8560696840286255	The circumstantial evidence seems to apply the adaptive evolution of human neurobiology propensities that support prospective memory in tool making, together with short term working memory, including haptic working memory, long term working memory, and long term procedural memory and episodic memory of past matters and things.
1137780	1156632	A	0.6923394203186035	So I'm doing a tease here, because on the previous slide, I starred one of the claims and then the last claim on this slide here, my note is essentially, I'm just going to read the part that doesn't again, have me speculating memory broken into types, as you can see here.
1156686	1159460	A	0.7807008624076843	Working memory, long term, procedural, et cetera.
1159540	1161764	A	0.8304017186164856	And now being applied instrumentally.

1197628	1199824	A	0.7300916314125061	So a bit of a teaser.
1199872	1206550	A	0.8091806769371033	You're going to want to show up for 53 one, because I think Michael's presentation is going to really open up a lot of eyes.

1215972	1222120	B	0.9033494591712952	So just to read some of the first parts, what is the implication for innovations?
1222860	1226056	B	0.8359906673431396	A sinaquanon for one to spread.
1226168	1237068	B	0.8714973330497742	So something that must happen to spread is following its conception by one mind, namely the hmm hierarchically, mechanistic mind of the protagonist brain.
1237164	1244112	B	0.8636416792869568	It must then be apprehended by another mind, namely the hmm of an observer's brain.
1244176	1246656	B	0.8048723340034485	And we're going to come back to that on the roadmap.
1246848	1253380	B	0.8104291558265686	Here, innovations represent an anomaly, and innovators are unorthodox actors or protagonists.
1253880	1272140	B	0.5452041625976562	Their policy selection is in a sense, faulty, in the sense that their ensuing behavioral outcomes are in market contrast to those of their fellow actors or agents who deploy orthodox responses that reduce discrepancies between predictions and sensation.
1272640	1275608	B	0.7067394256591797	Thus, innovators fail to fulfill their predictions.
1275784	1292704	B	0.6303318738937378	If innovations be regarded as behavior outputs, theirs are then responses that fall outside the repertoire typical of their community, and hence ceterais paribus all of the things equal increase the prediction error, e.

1321520	1322510	A	0.5721468925476074	Very clear.
1325360	1338576	A	0.7975184917449951	When brains cope with high levels of cognitive surprisals, a plausible answer is that it is when the holding capacity of working memory increases from two to three.
1338758	1349024	A	0.8891372680664062	Working memory in this setting corresponds to the temporal depth of generative models that generate or predict the consequences of successive actions.
1349072	1359690	A	0.9044357538223267	This transition increases temporal horizon, which amplifies cognitive versatility and one of my favorite things, recursive thinking.
1360460	1369740	A	0.5871502161026001	A working memory or detemporal model able to entertain diverse novel Bayesian beliefs is more likely able to recognize and remember innovative behaviors.
1370560	1392000	A	0.6167857050895691	And it's easier for chimpanzees to perform complex action that involve considerable motor demands than it is for them to reproduce actions that are simple and undemanding with regard to motor dexterity and yet unorthodox with regard to their habitual behavioral repertoire.
1394680	1395428	B	0.7671424746513367	Great.
1395594	1401030	B	0.7401739954948425	I'll just joke and meme internally as we carry forward.
1404520	1406048	B	0.6519326567649841	Yeah, go for the top half here.
1406154	1407992	A	0.7123904228210449	All right, I'll do the first three.
1408126	1418292	A	0.6663514971733093	When considering early Pleistocene behavior, we need not assume memories were less complex psycho cognitively than are ours.
1418356	1428940	A	0.7121056914329529	It is prosaically sufficient to infer that they were simply less frequent owing to earlier consolidation of cerebral networks in Homo erectus's smaller brain.
1429520	1433644	A	0.8976066708564758	And we're going to get into something called the zone of bounded surprisal here.

1473040	1487250	A	0.8310794830322266	The ZPs allows any potentially novel or unorthodox behavior to be copied provided that the ranges or the levels of surprise provoked in observers are tolerated or manageable by.

1737932	1741058	B	0.7775985598564148	And the Abstract of Copy or not to Copy.
1741234	1756010	B	0.7868906259536743	A prerequisite for copying innovative behavior is the capacity of observers brains, regarded as hierarchically mechanistic minds, to overcome cognitive surprisal by maximizing the evidence for their internal models via active inference.
1756750	1781860	B	0.5510827302932739	Unlike modern humans, chimpanzees and other great apes show considerable limitations in their ability or zone of bounded surprisal to overcome cognitive surprisal induced by innovative or unorthodox behavior, which rarely is copied precisely or accurately, most can copy adequately what is within their phenotypically habitual behavioral repertoire in which technology plays a scant part.
1782710	1793430	B	0.6085708737373352	Widespread intra and intergenerational social transmission of complex technological innovations is not a hallmark of great ape taxa over 3 million years ago.
1793580	1801180	B	0.8487898707389832	Precursors of the genus Homo made stone artifacts and stone flaking was likely habitual before 2 million years ago.
1801630	1815840	B	0.8274142146110535	After this time, early Homo erectus left traces of technological innovations, though faithful copying of these and their intra and intergenerational social transmission were rare before a million years ago.
1816370	1827730	B	0.8594092726707458	This likely ode to a cerebral infrastructure of interconnected neuronal networks that bounds the expressivity of internal world models entailed by their functional architecture.
1828070	1841462	B	0.6167830228805542	Brains were smaller in size than ours, and cerebral neuronal networks ceased to develop when early Homo erectus attained full adult maturity by the mid teen years, whereas their development continues until our mid 20s.
1841516	1847682	B	0.5464190244674683	Nowadays, Pleistocene Homo underwent remarkable evolutionary adaptation of neurobiological propensities.

1849398	1858090	B	0.7717067003250122	That it is proposed here were fundamental for faithful copying, which underpins social transmission of technologies, cumulative learning and culture.
1859310	1860060	B	0.7671424746513367	Great.
1862450	1864014	B	0.9680508375167847	One of the most amazing.
1864212	1866670	B	0.7804031372070312	Roadmap became road.
1866740	1871498	B	0.7442877888679504	Rail became train station clearinghouse slides.
1871594	1872880	B	0.758782148361206	So what is happening?
1877750	1887670	A	0.9708322286605835	I think the great gift that the authors have provided Daniel and I here is the opportunity, because this work is talking about sequential time.
1887820	1891926	A	0.8231711387634277	And when on that timeline did things happen?
1892028	1897126	A	0.8191068172454834	Which came first or why did something that we thought came after?
1897308	1902058	A	0.7278161644935608	Suddenly we find new evidence that maybe it didn't come after.
1902144	1904134	A	0.833332896232605	Maybe it was co occurring.
1904262	1922794	A	0.6967546939849854	And so what I wanted to do in this particular slide was talk about things like timelines and timetables around the idea of a learning destination, assumptions that learning does have some sense of convergence.
1922922	1932030	A	0.8661383390426636	So my question was, well, what if all roads, be they rail or paved, lead to an active Rome or Romeference?
1932190	1934354	A	0.8655872941017151	Like, what is this journey that we're on?
1934392	1936850	A	0.7232000231742859	What is this interstate that we exist within?
1937000	1951626	A	0.4913082718849182	And why do we always assume that what we're looking at is the ties between the rails, instead of making sure that when we're talking about a tipping point, we're talking about the fact that the entire underlying structure can hold up?
1951728	1959094	A	0.9351003766059875	The vehicle that Daniel and I are basically sitting on right now and moving forward with back and forth?
1959222	1962826	A	0.8299551606178284	So the timelines and timetables to learning destinations are not uptakes.
1962938	1966670	A	0.5656430125236511	Someone else's formatting is not your outing of a figure.
1966820	1975294	A	0.7224851846694946	Okay, so I've never been on an official dig site, but I have come across dinosaur bones being in Alberta.
1975422	1981314	A	0.5582642555236816	And so you stumble across these things and whoa, what's that right.
1981432	1990246	A	0.8894070386886597	In an otherwise field of clay, how much can we schedule and how much is dependent on the sophistication of our hierarchical model?
1990428	2000410	A	0.8072874546051025	And again, I've practiced this tutrenes, Allendo and Las plateaformas unuenue with apologies to Hector.
2000830	2002198	A	0.8940677046775818	Where are we departing?

2013626	2015450	B	0.8003230094909668	The papers do have sections.
2015610	2033490	B	0.5689064264297485	However, without figures or formalisms, we were able to and drawing on the unique subject matter and contributions, able to also even reconsider the linearity and the structure of the stream.
2035030	2040966	B	0.8084180951118469	The keywords are displayed on the slide just to quickly read through them.

2075270	2077730	B	0.9151455163955688	What can you add about the published priors?
2079830	2099482	A	0.8376582860946655	Well, I just think it's interesting because we've always used this image of the sort of the infinite and antherence ref which I've always really liked because I just momentarily lost the strange loop piece.
2099536	2100998	A	0.790345311164856	What is that mobius?
2101094	2102054	A	0.8440439105033875	Is it a mobius?
2102102	2109782	B	0.8626280426979065	Right, a mobius stripped, also developed by here Mcscher and Doug Hofstadter into the strange loop concept.
2109846	2110314	A	0.5664745569229126	Right.
2110432	2116670	A	0.8259191513061523	So all I wanted to do is add the fact that maybe there is these branch lines.
2117010	2132622	A	0.8832407593727112	And when we're talking about published priors, I know that in the chronological time they came first, but if we were now to go to them post having read these papers, what would that reveal?
2132766	2133122	A	0.7360090017318726	Right?
2133176	2135906	A	0.5298405885696411	Like is a branch less important than the trunk?
2135938	2137270	A	0.5854561924934387	I guess, I don't know.
2137340	2143202	A	0.7126917839050293	Without a trunk there are no branches, but without branches there's no totality.
2143266	2146600	A	0.8784295916557312	So that's what I was kind of laying out there.
2147210	2152726	B	0.7705681920051575	Also, with respect to the literature, it's a canonical example of cumulative culture.

2203782	2208326	A	0.8970376253128052	Do you want to split each one of the slides or do you want to just swap slides?
2208358	2208826	A	0.6131572127342224	I'll do one.

2212442	2213866	B	0.8376388549804688	I'll do odd slides.

3546130	3560740	B	0.5292763113975525	Homo erectus observers brains may have lacked neuronal networks efficient enough for enabling them to develop innovative behavioral responses in the early Pleistocene that were habit forming a zone of bounded surprise here and after Zbs restricted them.
3561590	3586430	B	0.566007673740387	Possibly, observations by early Homo erectus were translated often into activity intermediate between emulation and imitation, owing to limited foresight about the significance of precise manipulations for determining the practicality and effectiveness of an outcome dimly envisaged, their ZVS limited their ability to join up the mental steps involved in planning and to infer counterfactual possibilities.
3587810	3598258	B	0.8401479125022888	That is a fundamental aspect of active inference that selection of actions and plans is based on minimizing the free energy to be anticipated in undertaking them.

4110160	4119010	B	0.8693628311157227	Just as a reminder, the more extensive quotes are great resources to see in the final versions of the paper and so on.
4119780	4135540	B	0.8638465404510498	And in the following couple of slides we wanted to bring in a few other directions a sampling of the extra resources that Dean and I were looking through in our zero preparation.
4135880	4140970	B	0.8860403299331665	And do you have any comments on this before I describe this side by side?
4141500	4147304	A	0.8298255205154419	Yeah, I think it's good that you show the two representations on the right side of the screen.
4147422	4159240	A	0.48218870162963867	I think oftentimes we think of things of interstate as here are the two train tracks and they are in perfect parallel.
4159400	4169970	A	0.8077770471572876	What I also think often happens is the shortest distance between two points from formalism aspect is a straight line.
4170580	4180624	A	0.8090501427650452	But when what we're talking about is generative models, we're talking about two kinds of time one that's continuous and one that's discrete.
4180752	4202270	A	0.856704592704773	And our ability to uptake something may be afforded when we meander slightly so the representation on the left isn't to remove the idea of the barbell or to impose on the model that it has to be direct.
4203280	4209836	A	0.8714591264724731	Sometimes getting to the answer comes about in kind of strange and wonderful ways.
4210018	4215524	A	0.7534851431846619	Sometimes things happen suddenly because we meander.
4215592	4226070	A	0.9062513709068298	So I'll turn over the actual diagram now to you and be able to talk a little bit about that in terms of how we shape that in terms of discrete and continuous time.
4226920	4227428	B	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
4227514	4257144	B	0.7920671105384827	Well, this is Figure 4.3 from Par Pazulo and Friston's 2022 active inference textbook that we have textbook groups at the institute around and two different taxonomic groups, maybe generative modelus erectus and generative modelus habilis or something like that, are juxtaposed in a way that highlights their structural similarity but also calls attention to some of their details.
4257272	4261352	B	0.8884490728378296	On the top is a partially observable Markov decision process.
4261506	4265890	B	0.8618665337562561	And this is a discrete time representation of a generative model.
4266980	4279284	B	0.8700970411300659	The hidden states are evolving through time and there's a past, present and future which are indexed with temporal markers time minus one, time right now, time plus one.
4279322	4282336	B	0.7777613997459412	And at each time there's the emission of observables.
4282368	4283808	B	0.8047975897789001	That's the tail of two densities.
4283904	4291844	B	0.886194109916687	It can emit generative AI densities from hidden states or it can dean hidden states from observables.
4291892	4304252	B	0.8973603248596191	That's the A matrix D is the prior b describes how those hidden states change through time and G shapes policy selection through expected free energy that intervenes in how hidden states change through time.
4304386	4312048	B	0.8322421312332153	And more briefly in the continuous time generative model rather than explicit representation of past, present and future.
4312214	4336790	B	0.5197502970695496	The approach taken is much more resonant with generalized coordinates of motion or a Taylor series expansion in which all past, present and future time points are implicitly predicted through the specification of the derivatives of increasingly high order around the target variable latent state x.
4337820	4339336	B	0.8175157904624939	There's a lot more to say.
4339438	4354430	B	0.6716539859771729	But when I saw Dean bring in the straight and the wavy and the kind of meta train track that together they enabled seeing, I thought 4.3, that's where we wanted to be.
4355040	4356910	A	0.5371078848838806	And here's the interesting thing.
4357360	4390436	A	0.5418009757995605	Even in that representation, if you were to suddenly realize that you liked the relaxing meandering route, that you're not always in a hurry, you would probably have a better chance of realizing that in continuous time the suddenness would occur as you stretched your window of analysis out, which again seems counterintuitive, but that's what the representation affirms.
4390628	4404104	B	0.891975998878479	And one last note on this before you introduce the next one is in this Figure 4.3 we see a crystallization of methodological pluralism in active inference.
4404232	4409512	B	0.8869112730026245	So all questions of the form how does inference, active inference treat x phenomena?
4409576	4411720	B	0.7614868879318237	Even for a specified subsystem?
4411880	4416352	B	0.6802303194999695	There is no a priori reason to favor the left or the right foot.
4416486	4420224	B	0.8642473816871643	We want the barbell loaded on both sides before we bench press it.
4420342	4435220	B	0.7450065016746521	And so even the decision of the time window and the treatment of time, which is one of the most absolutely fundamental decisions in a model, let alone further structural learning questions which were mentioned earlier in the quotations.
4435880	4445320	B	0.7920190691947937	Even at that most fundamental divergence between discrete and continuous time generative models, the active infra Ant absolutely has a decision.
4448560	4451616	B	0.8904544711112976	So what do you see here and what do we want to bring in?
4451718	4454976	A	0.8283027410507202	Yeah, this was Ryan Smith's paper.
4455078	4469430	A	0.790615975856781	And what I like about this is he broke it down into decision active inference just to if you want to go back and have a look at that live stream set.
4472040	4484292	A	0.7966904640197754	What he was trying to speak to there was that a lot of stuff that's going on in folk psychology doesn't contradict what we now kind of understand in terms of how we can model things out using active inference.
4484356	4501180	A	0.6001530289649963	And again, you can explain the diagram better than I can, but I think what's interesting here is to decide to make a choice to copy or not to copy.
4501920	4504800	A	0.8039702773094177	To throw a stone or not to throw a stone.
4505380	4514964	A	0.767376720905304	There's two slides here that we kind of have to kind of pull together again for what I wanted to focus on, which is on the next slide next.
4515002	4521750	A	0.8712155818939209	But here what I want to do is kind of talk about this paragraph on the bottom left hand side.
4523080	4526420	A	0.8721743822097778	You have a paper about sensory attenuation.
4526840	4532548	A	0.7631388306617737	What do we pay attention to as an outcome desensitization?
4532644	4539576	A	0.8691966533660889	This only becomes problematic when contingencies in the environment, when the environment changes over time.
4539758	4540056	A	0.5664745569229126	Right.
4540078	4545084	A	0.8933228254318237	So we are talking about things that agents do in time and in place.
4545202	4556960	A	0.8720282912254333	But what this paper was talking about was sort of the folk psychological and some of those stories that we've used to try to explain things and focuses on what's going on in the envelope, what's going on in the niche.
4557620	4568196	A	0.7211882472038269	This highlights an important distinction between this type of habit formation and other mechanisms promoting habitlike patterns of behavior in decision active inference, for example.
4568298	4578452	A	0.6955726742744446	Actions can also become resistant to change after repeated experience because agents build up highly confident beliefs about the reward probabilities under each action.
4578596	4588836	A	0.7796005010604858	If contingencies, change could take a very large number of trials for agents to unlearn such beliefs.
4588868	4595980	A	0.8650137186050415	So I wanted to throw this in as a complement to the habitization stuff that was in the copied or not to copy paper.
4596130	4598510	A	0.8871954083442688	Do you want to explain the diagram real quick?
4598880	4608780	B	0.7758476734161377	My only comment there is with respect to Ali's question about copy discard, the shadow of to copy or not to copy is to discard or not to discard.
4608940	4623044	B	0.6224377155303955	Because if people have been hitting their rocks one way and somebody else even if the functional mirror neurons allow one to understand that one is doing it differently, there's a whole variety of things that can happen and not.
4623082	4639500	B	0.5524886250495911	All of them involve the successful contagion of even an resolutely positive improvement on tool use and especially with complex trade off frontiers and partially obscured views and all these other social complexities.
4640000	4649320	B	0.7884246706962585	That is going to mean that to copy or not to copy to discard or not to discard copy discard becomes a central piece in compositional.
4649400	4653920	B	0.7826611995697021	Accounts of surprise minimization under the hierarchically mechanistic minds.
4655540	4665872	A	0.9134657382965088	So on this slide, which was just a continuation of that live stream set or deck, I'm going to drop down to the fourth paragraph.
4665936	4685412	A	0.6637065410614014	If the highest value in an outcome space was specified for observing tasting ice cream in the policy and the policy space included, either choose don't move or choose walk to the ice cream truck and buy ice cream.
4685556	4695068	A	0.7918059229850769	A deciding active agent, active inference agent will infer that walking to the ice cream truck and buying ice cream is the highest probability policy.
4695154	4698376	A	0.6284370422363281	That is, it will form the intention to go buy ice cream.
4698408	4713292	A	0.7132605910301208	In addition, when considering the range of cases involving goal directed choice, we have been unsuccessful at identifying examples where the policy would play a role inconsistent with representing desired outcomes.
4713356	4714724	A	0.8006978631019592	Now, here's an interesting thing.
4714762	4734936	A	0.8100745677947998	Even back then, if you look at the ice cream cone and you ask it to the third person now, Daniel and Dean looking at the slide, is the ice cream truck closer to us as we're viewing this or further away from us than the actual ice cream cone is?
4735038	4744284	A	0.7069818377494812	You get one sense of it and then if I grab this line at first it appears that the ice cream cone truck is closer to us.
4744322	4753408	A	0.7905888557434082	If I do this, however, and I grab this line just like that, pull that away.
4753574	4755692	A	0.7023840546607971	Now all of a sudden, what's in the foreground?
4755756	4757340	A	0.6023039221763611	The ice cream cone.
4757500	4771600	A	0.5592640042304993	So oftentimes when we're trying to figure out what we desire or what our goal is, we're completely unaware of how we're setting up our own frame, what rule we're actually following.
4771680	4775424	A	0.5587298274040222	If we have a rule, we're completely unaware of it.
4775482	4784890	A	0.6643303036689758	And yet that has a huge decision implication on what's the desired foreground background here?
4786140	4800510	A	0.7089412212371826	How are we coming about to this idea that this one shape which we're going to have to arrive at by removing things is more advantageous than just leaving it the way it is.
4800820	4809408	A	0.8463001251220703	So just to have one perspective on something unidirectional versus to be able to have those two perspectives on something.
4809494	4824176	A	0.8560143113136292	So again, this was in comparison to a folk psychology narrative of telling how we might come to behaving versus the active inference.
4824368	4832536	A	0.8287500739097595	What Ryan wanted to do in his paper was say they're not fighting with one another.
4832718	4848088	A	0.5456799268722534	And oftentimes, if you actually understand that you've made a lot of choices that you're not even aware of, that your generative model sometimes is a reduction to some rules that you may or may not even be able to articulate.
4848184	4849390	A	0.4958067536354065	And that's fine.
4850740	4855532	A	0.8138847351074219	Yes, it will influence what you do present as an articulation.
4855676	4863780	A	0.634146511554718	It doesn't change what we now understand as the mechanisms that are present and that may help us.
4863850	4865910	A	0.8513631820678711	In terms of some of that predictive process.
4868360	4873110	B	0.9510182738304138	Awesome live stream 46 way back when.
4873960	4877648	B	0.6265661716461182	All right, just a few more pieces to bring into the puzzle.
4877744	4885000	B	0.9047722816467285	So I'll give the first description on each of them and then Dean, feel free to kind of bring in why you wanted these to be here.
4885150	4898200	B	0.8724957704544067	So here's a paper, a variational synthesis of evolutionary and developmental dynamics which was written with Friston, myself, Constance Knight, Par and Campbell.
4898360	4925940	B	0.5901265144348145	We recently uploaded it to archive and one of the main novelties or contributions of this paper was in contrast with previous multiscale biologically oriented active inference or fep models which used the formalism of nested POMDPs to model nested Markov blankets, thus creating one bigger and bigger tree with finer and finer leaves.
4926460	4960896	B	0.8739411234855652	We used an explicit, discontinuous, multiscale or scale friendly jump such that within the lifetime, the intra generational action perception loops and also developmental loops that we heard about in some selections from the papers today that that particular partition that thing, over the course of its life in an ecologically embodied way can have bottom up causation to this higher order thing, which is a population thing.
4961078	4973910	B	0.8677886128425598	And this higher order extended genotypic thing also uses the exact same particular partition mathematics and framing that we see across systems in active.
4974360	4989324	B	0.8787495493888855	And another way to look at that is here in the center is one thing with a blue ring going around it at a given level and it is itself composed of these smaller things which also are composed of even smaller things.
4989522	4995420	B	0.8525258302688599	And also that main blue ring is playing a role in potentially a larger thing.
4995570	5008560	B	0.8292784094810486	And this is the scale friendliness or the scale freeness of the fep formalism discussed in an ontogenetic phylogenetic setting within and amongst generations.
5008980	5039880	B	0.6531867980957031	And rather than utilizing this graphed bigger and bigger POMDPs strategy, we introduce an explicit discontinuity in that things at a lower level are sampled or instantiated from a higher level distributional thing and the differential success of those within generation trajectories can result in bottom up causation modifying the extended genotypic thing.
5040030	5046460	B	0.8020071387290955	I hope that we'll have more sessions to talk more about this paper and related work, but just wanted to give that quick overview.
5047040	5062352	A	0.7186799049377441	And I don't have a lot of deep background in biology, so the reason why I was hoping that you would be interested in at least touching on this is because I think, again, we're back to so which have we chosen to do?
5062406	5072260	A	0.8481103777885437	Have we chosen to zoom in on the scale friendly or have we zoom in on the scale friendly or zoom out onto the scale free?
5072410	5083770	A	0.7180851101875305	And I think we get a better understanding when we're able to appreciate the differences and put them back together in sort of our own model.
5086460	5087208	B	0.7671424746513367	Great.
5087374	5088910	B	0.5784209966659546	On to the next.
5090400	5105804	B	0.9122191667556763	Here is a paper with Sean O'Connor who led this effort and myself from the end of 2022 predictive Processing interpretation of the Mirror test and implications of a reflection prediction for human cognition.
5105932	5125884	B	0.7758357524871826	And just to read one sentence from the abstract, we hypothesize that a reflection prediction upon which our predictive processing interpretation of the mirror test is built may also offer a novel perspective to understand how humans locate themselves relative to a mirror, imitate others and are self aware from a social perspective.
5126032	5130408	B	0.8633237481117249	So what have you seen in that mirror mirror on the screen?
5130494	5132090	B	0.7013534307479858	And why did you want it here?
5134460	5149820	A	0.9734554290771484	Because I think the sensory first of all, I strongly recommend people get this paper and read it because I thought it was an excellent paper and it should become on part of more people's reading lists.
5150420	5166304	A	0.7527510523796082	One of the things that really speaks to very clearly and makes a strong case around is the role of sensory attention and bringing the concept of sensory attenuation into the world of predictive processing.
5166432	5179204	A	0.6928092241287231	And I think it would be something that would be helpful for people to understand, especially if you're thinking that, for example and I don't forget, Danny, you'll know what this is.
5179242	5195644	A	0.7914018630981445	But one of the things that was talked about in this paper was the idea that if you believe you do not have a limb, then one of the things that you could do is come up with a way of a mirror showing you without that limb, even if you already possessed it.
5195682	5214512	A	0.7991082072257996	So it's reinforcing what Hector and Michael Andy Clark were talking about in terms of so how does active inference help us get to maybe some more plausible answers in prosaic ways?
5214646	5221284	A	0.867034375667572	And so the sensory attenuation piece to me was really valuable and tied in with some of the concepts we're talking about here.
5221482	5232020	B	0.8213686943054199	Yeah, one thought on that is let's grant an effective mirror neuron or recognition capacity, just spatially in terms of tool usage.
5232100	5238296	B	0.6212756633758545	So that is not always granted with eyesight and partial occlusion of the working locations of tools and all of this.
5238318	5252844	B	0.8282015323638916	But let's just say that an observer can observe somebody else doing a motor behavior and entirely understands the basis of that motor behavior like the person does a pirouette or they write a line incursive or they play violin.
5252972	5260400	B	0.8087729811668396	You can have absolute understanding of the mechanisms of the baseball pitcher, of the hockey stick.
5260980	5269136	B	0.6911781430244446	Yet there are multiple reasons from an embodied and cognitive perspective why the behavior cannot be copied.
5269328	5279288	B	0.8149285316467285	We can all understand that there are certain sport acts that are not just strength limited and they're not even necessarily dexterity limited that we cannot do.
5279374	5284932	B	0.6047897338867188	We cannot write in a language we do not know by hand, even though we might have the motor dexterity.
5284996	5306304	B	0.670249879360199	And so that's a semantic explanation or quite simply and to call back the zone of bounded surprisal an observer may observe a hetero praxis, a different praxis and simply, implicitly or even explicitly believe that's unlikely for me to do.
5306502	5309504	B	0.7945505976676941	And as it was thought, so it shall be done.
5309622	5330804	B	0.8306970596313477	The innovation is over and then lastly and a little bit most Extrapolatively previously in some work I've juxtaposed Buckminster Fuller's life and work in times with that of William Blake.
5330932	5348616	B	0.66317218542099	And the prompting quote from the paper was above zones of bounded surprisal are different from the zones of latent solution in their attempt to explain the lack of cumulative culture in great apes on the basis that cultural complexity is restricted by the limited potentials for individual invention.
5348808	5371988	B	0.6304919719696045	So Bucky and Blake were both tremendously inventive individuals and to reflect a few lines of some Blake poetry the auguries of Innocence begins with to see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wild flower hold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour.
5372154	5381940	B	0.6653233766555786	Those are some of the famous opening lines of that poem and they speak to this time representation but the closing lines are less often quoted.
5383260	5393036	B	0.608458936214447	We are led to believe a lie when we see not through the eye which was born in a night to perish in a night when the soul slept in beams of light.
5393218	5397868	B	0.7840440273284912	God appears and God is light to those poor souls who dwell in night.
5398034	5402850	B	0.8634305596351624	But does a human form display to those who dwell in realms of day?
5403540	5406530	B	0.807713508605957	And I'll let you get the word on that.
5407220	5408720	A	0.617152214050293	Well, here's the thing.
5408790	5431540	A	0.782753586769104	I want to thank again the authors who are going to be joining us for the one and two for allowing us to pull two of their papers into proximity and allow us to talk about them so proximally because we I think I speak for both of us, but you can correct me on this, Daniel.
5431620	5463020	A	0.517988383769989	I think with the use of active inference and our continuous updating with active inference as a way of strategizing are coming to realize that sometimes things that seem really distal and unrelated when brought together, you as the person who is looking at two things at once with both of your eyes open tend to learn a lot.
5463190	5482708	A	0.7900761961936951	And so whether it's pulling Buckminster Fuller and Blake into the same slide deck or talking about to copy or not to copy and snakes and ladders it's actually a real treat to be able to bring things that seem like well, conventionally.
5482804	5486040	A	0.6298521757125854	That was field work and this is lab work.
5486190	5510064	A	0.7965749502182007	Being able to have 1ft in both of those realms really helps the person who likes to go back and forth who is moving from a position of being really familiar with the subject matter to being somebody who can actually get into the predictive matters because they're more comfortable in doing the update thing.
5510262	5512720	A	0.6466217637062073	They're not quite so stuck and bound.
5513960	5521300	A	0.9843451380729675	And that means when I see ZLS and ZVS beside one another makes me very, very happy.
5521450	5542830	A	0.5690184831619263	So that's why I wanted you to get acknowledged for some of the work that you've done in terms of this isn't the first time that you seen an advantage in bringing two things that don't seem like they belong on the same table and bringing them together and kind of going, whoa, look what happens when you do.
5545480	5545988	B	0.7671424746513367	Great.
5546074	5546420	B	0.6283750534057617	Thanks.
5546490	5549268	B	0.8708855509757996	Any final comments or I'll give a final thought.
5549434	5550260	A	0.4859412908554077	Go for it.
5550330	5555832	B	0.5095770359039307	All right, well, I would just like to echo your words.
5555966	5568700	B	0.8937804698944092	We really appreciated, even, dare I say, working with the authors in this zero and even negative dot one, the first of its kind interval.
5570560	5582210	B	0.6589878797531128	These papers initially, to me at least, felt like two pillowy beds of plain text.
5583060	5585970	B	0.4892788827419281	Can't think of any other way to say it right now.
5586420	5599440	B	0.5734652876853943	However, once we dug at that field site and we brushed off some of those uni and bifacial tools and ideas, there was just more and more to find and explore.
5600180	5607080	B	0.9864076375961304	So I'm very much looking forward to the coming one, two, and potentially beyond.
5608540	5609944	B	0.9455570578575134	And we hope you've enjoyed this.
5609982	5611370	B	0.6335617899894714	53.0.
5612780	5613828	A	0.7800778746604919	Thanks, Daniel.
5613924	5614392	B	0.4896697998046875	All right.
5614446	5614856	B	0.8529649376869202	Thank you.
5614878	5615252	A	0.6498749852180481	Dean.
5615316	5615540	B	0.5942320823669434	Farewell.
