"Unknown","00;00;07;18","00;00;31;07","Hello. Welcome to the item flab livestream number 28.1. It's September 7th. 2021. Welcome to the Active Inference Lab. We are a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at the links on this page this is a recorded and an archived live stream, so please provide us with feedback so we can improve our work."
"Unknown","00;00;31;29","00;01;06;01","All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and we'll follow video etiquette for live streams today on September 7th and next Tuesday, we're going to be discussing this paper on computational phenomenology then. We haven't set the paper for 29 yet, and then we have a few papers set for October. Today, the goal is just to learn and discuss this very cool paper towards a computational phenomenology of mental action modeling, meta awareness and attentional control with deep parametric active inference."
"Unknown","00;01;06;18","00;01;33;27","And we're really appreciative that Lars, the first author, is here to discuss with us. So we're just going to start where we start and go from there, I guess. I think each of us here probably brought some questions, and anyone who has a question in the live chat can ask it. So let's just introduce ourselves and end with the author and go from there."
"Unknown","00;01;34;09","00;02;08;04","So I'm Daniel, I'm a post-doc in California, and I'll pass it to Dean Maury. I'm Dean, I'm retired, I'm in Calgary, I'm in Canada. And the work that I do ties in nicely with this idea of being able to bring some precision to how we learn. So I will say, who can I positive of Dave de Mayo is usually on mute and maybe takes the speech mode, which is fine."
"Unknown","00;02;08;24","00;02;30;25","Right? But welcome Dave and we'll pass to Lars. So Lars, welcome to this discussion and just thanks again for joining. We're happy to hear any introduction and then we'll go from there. Yeah, sure. Well, thanks. Excuse me. Thank you. Thanks for having me. I'm kind of excited to be here. Something fun a couple of hours ahead of us."
"Unknown","00;02;32;15","00;02;51;06","Just sending regards from the other coauthors as well. Obviously, like a lot of these papers, this has emerged in collaboration with other people and they couldn't make it here today. So but I'm glad to be here. So my name is Lars. I'm based at my affiliation is with the University of Lille in France. I'm doing my Ph.D. there."
"Unknown","00;02;52;08","00;03;15;10","And my focus is explicitly on meditation, actually, and that's what I'm interested in. It's what brought me into academia. I had a first stint in academia and physics a while ago and kind of left it and went into corporate stuff for a little while. And then was drawn back in by this. Interested in, in meditation. Sorry, there's a bit of background."
"Unknown","00;03;15;14","00;03;43;27","I don't know if you can hear it, but yeah, I guess I'll leave it at that. The kind of genesis here was from that from that angle through meditation and ending up in Karl's lab and and asking questions around attention and better awareness through that lens of practice. And that's where this kind of paper emerged from. So so we'll get into that little bit more detail cool."
"Unknown","00;03;44;03","00;04;17;23","And where did active inference come into play? Was it from something you were learning about from that practice perspective? Like you mentioned or a theory driven perspective? Or did a collaborator bring it to the table? It was a collaborator. So I, I sort of came into computational neuroscience looking explicitly to contribute to the field of meditation research. And so I'd reached out to a lab in New Alternatives Lab, who was one of the coauthors, and joined the lab there."
"Unknown","00;04;17;23","00;04;52;29","And they had a like an ongoing relationship with conferences lab because Jeremy Matta is one of the coauthors here, did his postdoc over at UCLA. And so they had a bit of an idea for an attention project using active inference. And I kind of came in not really knowing very much about it, but eager to learn. And then was sent off to London with a pretty open blank check, as it were, like see if you can figure out how to apply this to meditation and attention."
"Unknown","00;04;52;29","00;05;21;21","And we had some, some, some directions that we were thinking about. And then what ended up emerging was this hierarchical sort of deep parametric stuff oh, interesting how it kind of came to. Yeah, it really was. Right, right, right place, right time. They were looking for somebody. The physics background with an interest in meditation and computational neuroscience. And I sent them an email and that was pretty much the extent of the interview process."
"Unknown","00;05;21;21","00;06;03;09","And off I went oh, well, welcome Stephen Dean or Stephen. And if you have a question, you can raise your hand or of course, anyone in the chat room maybe. Dean, did you want to talk about a crosswalk or something like that that I'm yeah, I want to do that later, but I don't mind asking. So click to get the background about the meditation piece because when I before I picked up the paper, what I was wondering about was how precision plays a role in learning and especially when you moving from novel contexts and trying to familiarize yourself with something."
"Unknown","00;06;04;05","00;06;27;02","And so for me, my curiosity was around the idea that when you have the simple model and then you move to these more nested paradigms, you're kind of moving from the unplanned because you can't plan your perception to the plan. The idea of being able to think about your thinking. And so that transition was what really fascinated me."
"Unknown","00;06;27;02","00;07;15;27","So now that you brought up the idea of meditation, I wonder how meditation goes from the unplanned to the plan. So you've opened up a Pandora's Box for me because now my original question is kind of now been taken down this tangent. So I'm curious, right? Well, I mean, I can speak to that a little, a little bit the the, the, the idea for me going in here was to see I mean, just intuitively as soon as I got familiar with active inference, there was a resonance there in terms of how the mass seems to echo a lot of the kinds of ways that people talk about practice in general."
"Unknown","00;07;16;06","00;07;44;21","There's this sort of balance between you know, attention and the, the, the, that our perception is this, this combination of prior and observation and you know, that idea and like how these two things are balanced and getting into the optimal space there is very, very close to start thinking about mindfulness, obviously as a way of paying attention and increasing the impact of the sensory observations."
"Unknown","00;07;44;21","00;08;16;26","But then also things like, don't know mind beginners mind this kind of fresh kind of stance that is very common in Zen, but in other in other areas as well. And so already there is this kind of like, oh, there's something, there's something here. And so I arrived at Carl's lab and what I started out with was just getting familiar with the attention literature, because that's at least, you know, a good way in for meditation because at least in the very beginning, that's what it's all about."
"Unknown","00;08;16;26","00;08;42;03","And in some ways it's about that. Right to the end. But so the question was, how do we talk about paying attention within the already? And I was really fortunate because I was kind of coming into the space when all the scaffolding and the math I needed to start talking about this in a more practice related way or metacognitive way was already there."
"Unknown","00;08;43;05","00;09;10;11","All they really needed was somebody to come in and ask a question that was, for me, phenomenal. Logically driven, which was in meditation. You are paying attention for sure, right? You are deliberately paying attention to some object, you know, traditionally the breath, but really the aim of the game is or an additional part of that which is really, really important is being able to monitor where your attention is."
"Unknown","00;09;10;20","00;09;29;18","And so in other words, being able to pay attention to attention. And so that's where that kind of shift happened. Right. And you mentioned like thinking about thinking, it's like, well, OK, so if we know some of the math about, you know, what it means to pay attention, what would it mean to pay attention to attention? And what would it mean to be able to have control over the attentional states?"
"Unknown","00;09;29;29","00;09;54;14","And how would this how would we make that an allowable thing within within the framework? Yeah, so exactly the deep affective framework kind of set the scene for that. And Kaspar Kasper sells work sort of gave that gave the hint and that was on a different precision in the model. And here we're just talking about likelihood decision and then that kind of created this, this opportunity then."
"Unknown","00;09;54;14","00;10;20;27","Right? That then becomes almost generalizable across and that's where we can get to it a bit later. But really what I'm more excited about in this, in this whole work in paper really is what we start to enter into in the discussion at the end, pointing to the fact that we can generalize this across precision throughout the model that could then be interpreted in as different forms of mental action and what that might mean for understanding."
"Unknown","00;10;21;22","00;11;14;00","Yeah, I mean, it gets broad at that point. Yeah. Awesome. Thank you for the summary and welcome blue at all the at feline so Steven with the raised hand and then any child or anyone else for the race help yeah. Welcome. Yeah, I was really curious. I like the are you saying about the generalizability or the potential for generalizability in your so extending beyond neuro phenomenology to phenomenology in general I suppose is an I'm I'm curious how how you see action potentially coming in with meditation because you talk about sort of reflecting on mental states like breathing is an action I suppose but in many cases they use meditation because you're reducing the amount of"
"Unknown","00;11;14;00","00;11;35;03","action that's happening in the amount of visual stimulus because of often the eyes and shuts you know bodies contains and and now I see that you know OK so how does this then come back into an action state. And I know that there's a kind of in between you know Vipassana type meditation on the body senses or like you mentioned the breath."
"Unknown","00;11;35;03","00;12;05;07","But I'm curious how you see that kind of an active piece starting to come in through this. Mm hmm. Thanks for the question. And it's a really central one because, I mean, I guess to give a little bit more history to this paper, there is this is also building on a little bit of some of the intuitions of previous work by Anton Jeremy and another collaborator, Giuseppe Piccone."
"Unknown","00;12;05;16","00;12;39;07","And they wrote a paper called On the Epistemic Value of Inaction, which speaks to this. This points, I think, to in the from the from the outset, we can kind of separate mental action and overt action. And in meditation, you know, you're putting yourself in this situation where you deliberately don't have that much overt action, right? You're sitting still and yet you're doing things you're definitely doing things with your mind, even sort of do nothing."
"Unknown","00;12;39;07","00;13;20;03","Meditation is still a kind of doing in a sense. It gets a little bit sticky, but the for me sense of your question, the the cessation of overt action puts you in this highly epistemic state, because now the sort of self evidencing side of the equation, you're putting yourself in the situation where that is harder to access so that you you no longer can fulfill your expectations through, you know, action acting in the world."
"Unknown","00;13;20;03","00;13;41;20","Right? So like if you were to sit down and start getting agitated or bored rather than this sort of fulfilling the expectation there that you shouldn't be bored by going and doing something, you have to stay bored. And there's a certain discomfort that can arise from that. And then the role of mindfulness or acceptance in that moment becomes central."
"Unknown","00;13;41;28","00;14;04;08","But then what it allows then for is that that your model has to update. And if the model can't be sort of can't find evidence for it, well, then you got to you got to update it. And there you get to this notion of Vipassana, right? Which is like inside clear seeing inside, right, is that you're learning something through through that that wasn't available to you in the moment before."
"Unknown","00;14;04;27","00;14;24;23","And so I apologies to everybody out there who's maybe very into the meditation. This is very sort of hand wavy way. I'm talking about it especially kind of like matching it over to the over to active inference, a very sort of loose way. But that was kind of the, the, the gut intuition anyway coming into it and remains remains the, the intuition."
"Unknown","00;14;24;23","00;14;51;19","And I think there's this really for me anyway and where I'm kind of seeing my, my AI career with this going just is the very beginning of an exploration of how to how to articulate meditations and different practices, what they how they might cash out in terms of precision dynamics, different forms of learning, different forms of optimization and what that might mean for us."
"Unknown","00;14;51;19","00;15;18;26","So I think that's why I want to start with attention, because it's pretty uncontroversial, as it were, and just start building up the building blocks and be able to start making more and more interesting inferences about what it might mean to be doing other kinds of practice awesome answer. Thank you. So blue or just go for a blue hi."
"Unknown","00;15;18;26","00;15;52;17","So I don't know if you had a chance to watch the second or like the preliminary discussion we did yesterday, but something that came up was in the idea. So Daniel, can you flip to the circle about tension and tension here? It's like this one. Yeah, that one. So something that came up there when we were discussing this figure was like this the street steps between like distracted awareness of distraction and redirection of attention and focus."
"Unknown","00;15;53;01","00;16;24;12","Like, you know, there's kind of like an intuitive feeling that the distracted awareness of distraction and redirection of attention back to focus is like street like there's a transition instead of money going from focused, distracted. And something that I thought about was like, you can become so intensely focused on something and like the example that I'll give you because you're late, it's like going down a scientific rabbit hole, like reference after reference after reference."
"Unknown","00;16;24;20","00;16;47;22","And so you're still on task, you're still correctly paying attention to what it is you're supposed to be paying attention to. But like you're so focused that you're finally off task because you just start getting interested in other things. And so it's kind of a gradual transition from focus. Like you're still focused, but you're you're like focused on the wrong thing and like where in the do you think that kind of like focus?"
"Unknown","00;16;47;22","00;17;16;04","And so you're so focused, you're not paying attention, like where does that come into this? Or how how do you think to model something like that? Yeah, thanks for the question. So this model that we're seeing here is, of course, a bit of a caricature, right? It's it's it's it's in to it a sort of description of what's happening because you're right, there's degrees of distraction and meditation."
"Unknown","00;17;16;04","00;17;33;04","We talk about you actually can classify these you know, those when you sit down to try and pay attention to the breath. There are times when you've totally forgotten that you were even meant to be meditating and you were like gone. Right? You're thinking about something completely different. And then the timer goes off and you become aware that you were completely gone."
"Unknown","00;17;33;04","00;17;51;10","But then there's other things that are much more subtle, right? That's like you. Maybe you notice some sound in the room or, you know, some sensations in the body, but still somewhere in you're awareness, the breath remains present, but maybe less and more in a background foreground kind of situation. And so, like, are you distracted then or not?"
"Unknown","00;17;52;01","00;18;19;01","And to what extent and all these things and kind of everything in between. Right. So in terms of how that would cash out here, the first thing to point out, too, is that the precision parameter that we're talking about is a continuous parameter. And so it doesn't have to be relating to discrete states. And we could have been free to granular, like make more granular via attentional state."
"Unknown","00;18;19;01","00;18;48;24","So I'm just distracted or focused and sort of have grades of, of focus. Would it be impossible? But then the other thing that isn't modeled here is what are you distracted by here? Distraction was just not paying attention to the thing. But in reality, distraction is your attention being grabbed by some other stimulus and for some particular reason."
"Unknown","00;18;49;07","00;19;14;05","And that is not shown in this video, something that we were hoping to start to work on in the future. Part of the reason why we didn't go down that direction here in detail is because there's still a, I think, a really central part that is is difficult to tease out still at the moment, which is attentional resource."
"Unknown","00;19;14;23","00;19;41;26","Now, in some ways you could you could run this simulation and given the preferences on wanting to be paying attention, if you put that preference on a bunch of different observations, there's nothing stopping the agent just paying attention to all of it. Right, maximally and having really high precision observations across the board. Now that doesn't seem to be what we're able to be."
"Unknown","00;19;41;26","00;20;04;00","There seems to be like a a finite, something finite about it. And so when you're paying attention to one thing, it's at the exclusion of something else. And maybe part of practice and part of what you're getting in meditation is that that is softening a little bit. Your ability to sort of pay attention more than one thing or have more allocation of resources there in some way that might be learned over time."
"Unknown","00;20;04;00","00;20;35;03","But that's not that's not shown on here, which is why you don't get that what you're talking about, that kind of intuitive, organic feeling of what it means to be what it really needs to be distracted awesome. I have a question. And then Blue. So we've talked a lot about how spatial goals are set and even how some symbolic goals are set like sentence structure, but how are cognitive goals set?"
"Unknown","00;20;36;06","00;20;54;04","So are they reducible to sensory preferences? If so, just the preference for, you know, some salt and sugar, that's not going to really reduce your options in the city. So how do we set those higher level and these increasingly like abstract and ephemeral cognitive goals?"
"Unknown","00;20;56;10","00;21;27;29","Yeah. Now, thank you for that. Then this is the question I'm working on right now, actually on a follow up paper where I'm trying to take this model and and specifically model focus, attention, meditation. And in that and in practice in general, the the question of motivation and goal is really central. And where where in the model are you actually putting like how are you driving the attention behavior or meditation behavior?"
"Unknown","00;21;29;05","00;22;00;24","One of the ways the way that I did it here was to say that in this kind of setup that the agent is given an instruction, hey, I want you to pay attention to this stimuli. And that that then translates to them wanting to see themself in an in the attentional focused state. And so the way that the dynamics here are driven is by having a preference on that attentional state and observations of that state."
"Unknown","00;22;00;24","00;22;29;22","So that kind of like metacognitive observations of seeing yourself paying, paying attention here. Yeah. Thank you. So 02 there, we put a preference on those on exactly and just as a side note there you might think like, but do those observations exist really? Are they sincere observations? What kinds of observations are these? And I think that's a valid, valid question."
"Unknown","00;22;29;23","00;22;54;12","It's something we talked about for a while, but my intuition here is that if I were to ask you the question, what are you paying attention to right now? Right. And you're going to be able to give me an answer from having observed something. And so there's some kind of an observation there that you're able to make that you can use to infer what attentional set that you're in."
"Unknown","00;22;54;17","00;23;44;18","So anyway, that's where the preferences is. Is there you know, I prefer to observe myself paying attention exactly. So then the question is what is it that drives you know, like a practice? And I've been inspired by some of the work by Mirza and colleagues on sort of seen classification or seen as perceived perception where there there seems to be this attentional driving of attentional policy's given another kind of preference which is to resolve a scene which is to clearly perceive a scene."
"Unknown","00;23;46;00","00;24;19;01","And that's actually the way that I'm I'm starting to think about, at least in a practice context in like a meditation context, because in reality when you're meditating it's not so much that you're trying to pay attention to the breath, although we talk about it like that, it's more like you're trying to be continuously aware of the breath so you have some kind of a preference on perception or being able to be sort of being able to resolve a hidden state."
"Unknown","00;24;19;15","00;24;47;27","And that that is then what drives the kind of dynamics behind the scenes that's pretty interesting. Thank you for the response. Blue so that kind of slides in nicely to what I was going to ask. So as a follow up to my question earlier and also to Daniel, Daniel, can you look to the mind wandering side? Yes, thank you."
"Unknown","00;24;49;22","00;25;14;29","So I had a question here, and these are two different models. The one on the left specifically is from the mind like this two by a Ph.D. who works with you meditators. Right. And so and then the one on the right, I'm not sure if that's an explicit meditation task, but I just think there is an interesting context here."
"Unknown","00;25;15;10","00;25;36;19","So the people on the right, which is the neuro model of mind wandering. So do you have like this paradigm where you're on task, which is like in the meditation context, they focus on the breath or I mean, maybe it's not focused on the breath, but I, I think about meditation as, you know, being present and in the present, being in your body, aware of your hands, feet, breath, etc.."
"Unknown","00;25;36;27","00;25;57;04","Yes. So there's this model where you're on task, which is like focused on what you should be focused on in presence and then mind wandering. They talk about as the pursuit of internal goals, which I thought was interesting. But I think about that in terms of like thinking about your shopping list or all the things that you're not supposed to be thinking about while you're meditating."
"Unknown","00;25;57;04","00;26;23;17","Right. Like you just going off and pursuing your own internal goal oriented thoughts. And then they have separate the categories for being actually off task, which is like where you're not thinking about anything. You should be thinking about just thinking about like random, like whatever nonsense. And so I just wonder like, do you or could you think about making those kinds of distinctions in this kind of like and it goes from, from being focused on the right things to focused on the wrong thing."
"Unknown","00;26;23;17","00;26;28;26","Like, where does this off task come into play? I'm just curious if you have any thoughts on that."
"Unknown","00;26;31;18","00;27;21;23","I'm not exactly sure how they talk about off task, but what I could talk about here is the distinction between To me, the distinction here comes down to the meta awareness piece, right? Where on task is pretty understandable off task. You could imagine just doing something else, but aware of that fact, you know, like I've just decided to change and start focusing on something else, but there's sort of a metacognitive awareness of the fact that you are doing something else, whereas mind wandering is this slightly, or at least the way we're talking about it here, different situation where you're distracted or you're paying attention by what I say distracted has been paying attention to something"
"Unknown","00;27;21;23","00;28;02;18","you hadn't intended to pay attention to, but also not aware of that fact. Right? You haven't updated the fact that you're that that's happening. And that's the crucial piece here that we're trying to regulate, right? With practice or whatever in an intentional in an intentional task. And for that distinction, I think I think active inference kind of you know, it almost gives you that for free in a sentence to kind of show you where where that phase would be in that spot we were kind of showing in the results is that that period of of updating of where your attentional state is where you sort of think it's one, but it's actually another."
"Unknown","00;28;03;18","00;28;33;07","So you think you're paying attention or you're somewhere you don't really know where you what you're doing, but you're you're distracted is then how we would sort of express that or catch that out computationally because I don't yet know in terms of active inference. So it is. So I just wonder is like off task or my wondering like I had never thought to split those two apart until I found this paper and maybe check it out at the have time at some time."
"Unknown","00;28;33;18","00;28;55;02","But, but really like I think about this mind wandering. Is this like epistemic exploration? Is that like, I mean, is it exploitation when you're on task and you're focused on what you should be and then know you know, we think about active inference in terms of optimizing exploration, exploitation. Is there room in the model for that epistemic exploration or is that always like a bad thing?"
"Unknown","00;28;56;22","00;29;15;08","Is it always a bad thing? You know, I don't have a I don't have a good answer for you, to be honest. This is what we kind of want to go towards. And I was saying you know, what are you distracted by and what's the why behind the default mode that work? Basically, like, what is what is the value of that?"
"Unknown","00;29;15;18","00;29;49;00","On the one hand, I could imagine that, yeah, there's a there's sort of like an epistemic wandering through state space and future possibilities and just sort of monitoring of potential negative outcomes in the future would for which there's obviously value. And I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing. I think 11, I practice context anyway. It's like that that action can also lead to discomfort now and anxiety now because you're sort of simulating future bad events."
"Unknown","00;29;49;00","00;30;13;12","And there's actually a great paper. Kasper wrote a good paper on that deep. I read it. Yeah, the simulated future events. Well, and so often meditating like frees up space in your mind. I mean, I don't know if you've had the experience where you're not thinking about some other problem, but like you'll be meditating and like, well, we'll have this like brilliant flash of brilliance or like key moments of insight, right?"
"Unknown","00;30;14;17","00;30;43;16","So this was like insight, but it's maybe not insight into like stuff it's internal, like deep spiritual discovery, bit of insight into some external problem that you're having. So there's this, there's that. And so I wonder, like that might be the difference between off task and my wandering. Like if you're off task, it's like maybe a non beneficial or like there's no excuse for it's just like doing blah, blah, blah, whatever and then mind wandering might be like exploring your neural space and in like a recombination phase, I think about that."
"Unknown","00;30;43;16","00;31;06;16","So anyway, it's just something interesting interesting. I think the the notion of insight and the kind of why practice leads to that is really exciting place to start thinking about. Like what is it about paying attention in a particular way that leads to these moments of Aha, right."
"Unknown","00;31;09;08","00;31;33;15","Thanks. I'm going to read a question from Dave. Dave wrote a practice I've been following based in Naropa Institute's Schemata Practice, but not much stress there is to attend only intermittently say permit mind wandering during the outbreath but attend during the In-breath there are two effects. Obsessional thoughts are dis attended without intending to dis attend to any content."
"Unknown","00;31;34;03","00;31;57;17","The motion of this attention of the transition from this attentive to attentive occurs many times the usual return gently to resting the attention on the breath happens several times a minute, rather than several times per hour. Does anyone else do this or discuss it? Maybe to warn against it? Close parentheses hyphen to your knowledge. Hmm. I like that."
"Unknown","00;31;57;17","00;32;17;03","I didn't know. I haven't heard of a practice like that before, but in the way that you're describing it, I could see why that would be really, really powerful and really useful. Because one of the pitfalls I can tell how this conversation is going to go more and more into meditation, I think is but but I'm, I'm, I'm I'm up for that."
"Unknown","00;32;17;03","00;32;43;16","I'm game. But one of the, one of the pitfalls, of course, in, in practice is, is all the subtle ways in which resistance can come up towards our own minds. And if we are paying attention and we start to see distractions as things that are stopping us from paying attention and that we don't want right. Then it creates this tension and is actually counter to what we want to be going for."
"Unknown","00;32;43;16","00;33;07;24","And I could see how by deliberately leaving mind wandering happening and coming back sort of cuts that tendency to have resistance to to thoughts which actually just ends up perpetuating them or giving them more potency in the mind was really the aim is to pay attention to the breath. And it's funny because when we say pay attention, we think like it's this like focus thing and reality."
"Unknown","00;33;07;24","00;33;41;03","90% of it is relaxation and letting go and letting go of the resistance to distractions. Distractions come and then we come back, back to the breath. And that's what kind of does, does the work. So I would love to I'm going to look into that a little bit more detail. That style of practice would be interesting to see when we have a more fleshed out version of this, like how different approaches to practice might lead to different kind of learning outcomes at different rates, et cetera, that topic of distraction."
"Unknown","00;33;41;03","00;34;21;17","It's like if somebody were a captain and they cited something very subtle, that would be a distraction. They'd be on task so then there's this aspect of the multiple levels, like there's the ice skating and then there's higher, higher and modeled in this paper greeting Scott at slower and slower kind of clicks of the model. And so it's just interesting that, yeah, what a distraction implicitly says that it's not on task because if it was even something that was unexpected, that drew the regime of attention that way, if it were relevant for the task then it would still be considered not a distraction."
"Unknown","00;34;21;24","00;34;51;17","Part of the relevant stimuli for the task, but the exact same stimulus might be off task in a different context. Like 5 minutes later. Yeah, yeah, completely. I mean, if somebody is trying to talk to you and share something with you, you only paying attention to the sensations in your hands is not very helpful. But I think what we're kind of flirting with here as well is is this notion of task and goal and on task and off task."
"Unknown","00;34;52;00","00;35;32;19","And I think in a I mean, you know, meditation context, that's a really, you know, difficult, difficult thing to define. There's a big difference between somebody who comes into practice because they want to you know, sleep a little bit better or not be so stressed or have a little bit more ease in a relationship to somebody who comes in and says, you know, I'm in it for really understanding myself and who I am and what I am and for questions, deeper questions of like awakening and you know, expanding awareness and these kinds of things."
"Unknown","00;35;32;19","00;36;02;05","And those intentions and motivations are, you know, these task fires that you're setting over this whole thing and are driving the way that you practice. And, you know, traditionally what is sort of said again and again and again is that defining that is pretty important in terms of what you're going to get out of the practice, because to pay attention to the breath, to just pay attention to the breath without really understanding why and where it's leading to leading is is one thing."
"Unknown","00;36;02;26","00;36;30;13","Whereas having it within a context of a wider program and goal is is a completely other other situation. Now, modeling those in active inference is interesting, right? I would say that the latter sorry about the background noise here, but the latter example there of thinking a bit more broadly is, is having some kind of a preference on your own happiness, right?"
"Unknown","00;36;30;13","00;37;06;08","Like your own model fitness. Ultimately, you know, if we kind of go on the affective inference kind of view, you know, Kasper throw that like affect or in some ways related to how well you're doing and how and how well your model is, is predicting. And so to have that as the as the intention rather than just paying attention to the breath, but seeing how paying attention to the breath can can lead to that ultimately is a different kind of goal, goal statement than than the sort of narrow attentional task itself."
"Unknown","00;37;07;10","00;37;30;12","Thank you, Lars Dean and then Scott Yeah. I like to think yeah I think like, you know, I'm like, OK, I think you're talk, I think your topic lends itself to wanting to gallop ahead because it gets people so excited about this idea of moving from subliminal to liminal to kind of a limit to like precision around edges."
"Unknown","00;37;30;12","00;37;58;03","Right? So that transition gets people excited because now they say, oh, I could think of ways that I can use this in whatever it is that I'm trying to figure out. So at some point that transition, pulling that transition apart but not breaking it is is going to have to we're going to have to sit down and really parse that with you because it feels to me like we're doing a that is RB 28 or 29."
"Unknown","00;37;58;03","00;38;26;07","We're doing the point two right now because everybody wants to really get this thing going because that because it's, it's kind of exciting stuff, right? Like you've given us this, this backpack of stuff and we're like opening it up and it's all this candy and we're but I'm still really kind of interested how that, how that goes from subliminal, which cannot be planned and cannot be thought out because we're talking about act sensory and activation to thinking about thinking."
"Unknown","00;38;26;07","00;38;53;27","Because when I, when I see the diagrams themselves, they're there. But it doesn't really help me understand that any better because I still think that's a really, really tough bridge to build. Yeah, you know what I'm saying? I know it's there, but it's still hard for me to get my head around. I think I think I know what you mean and what you're referring to, which is like, where does the where does the structure come from in the first place?"
"Unknown","00;38;53;27","00;39;18;24","Does everything. Yeah, well, we know where it comes from in the first place and we know where it ends up. It's the transition in between it's those Caspar got us to the third layer. Now we've gone to a deep transitional. We we generated a context. We're thinking about our thinking it's metacognition. It just appeared. It just emerged. So how does that how does the math work on that?"
"Unknown","00;39;21;06","00;39;47;28","This I think I think what you're getting at there, I mean, there's kind of two ways that you could think about a model like this is like either you say, well, the structures in place and what's changing through learning is the the precision on observations, essentially. Like you become aware of it, it becomes something that can factor into your perceptual beliefs."
"Unknown","00;39;47;28","00;40;17;18","Updating that's one way around. Or you can say that there's something about human development and maybe the evolutionary process that sort of leads to this sort of structure growth and learning. And then the question is, well, how does that come about? The first question is a little bit easier to answer. Then the second question because obviously structured learning with an active inference is still an ongoing area of investigation."
"Unknown","00;40;17;18","00;40;52;00","And research and how exactly that comes about questions of neuroplasticity. And this is quite it's quite difficult to grapple with. And then how why do particular practices and different parts in life lead to certain things in others? But then to take the other stance or the other way to talk about this, which is I think what you were saying and correct me if I'm wrong, but it's assumed that the structures here that we have some kind of a deep hierarchical parametric structure that is giving rise to metacognition."
"Unknown","00;40;52;00","00;41;17;27","How do we go from being not aware at all of the contents of our mind to being aware of the contents of our mind? Right. Yeah, let's it's kind of a contradiction, right? Because the way it's set up is it's a bridge to everywhere where it's not a bridge to somewhere. And then somehow in that bridge to everywhere metaphor, we select out a particular and we give it our focus or our attention."
"Unknown","00;41;18;12","00;41;50;16","And so I'm not saying that the that the math doesn't work. I think the anchor piece is that at the basic level, nobody's going to argue that we have a Markoff blanket and we're going to we're going to statistically move closer to what we think is going to happen next. We're going to update it's that it's the last piece which is we're now thinking about our thinking that just seems to pop out and make itself available, you know, because we've now built up a set of priors but I don't I'd like to see how the math explains that."
"Unknown","00;41;51;04","00;42;17;02","That's what I'm because it's still a it's still a distributed set until it collapses to what we focus our attention on. And so it seems like a contradiction. And maybe that's what it is. Maybe that's what the math is trying to explain to us. I'm still not sure if I've completely grasped the the point of interest here, what all that how the transition works."
"Unknown","00;42;17;09","00;42;41;09","Again, I'm sure you'll be able to explain it. But what I'm seeing is a transition to first starting out being very open and then the mind is able to buckle down, for lack of a better expression, and get its attention on something starts out open and then it moves to something closer. What I'd like to see is how the math explains that."
"Unknown","00;42;42;10","00;42;45;02","That makes sense. I think so. I think so."
"Unknown","00;42;47;03","00;43;13;25","Dean, maybe one way to say it would be just looking at figure five, like the lower levels are certainly outside of our control and the higher levels are moving towards phenomenology, whereas the lower level in traditional neuroscience would be seen more as like sensory processing. And yeah, it's indeed similar kinds of models. So how do we kind of bridge not just the science humanities gap, but like the parameter experience gap?"
"Unknown","00;43;14;05","00;43;41;26","And then what is that sort of marsh between them? And is it really the case that just by nesting this model that we know in love, we ended up getting the or a structure of cognition is that the or a structure? Does that exist as part of a broader family of related models? Is it just about finding patterns of nodes that explain variance in multiple components of phenomenology and physiology?"
"Unknown","00;43;45;19","00;43;46;13","That's the question."
"Unknown","00;43;50;22","00;44;28;06","Well, I for me, it all comes down to precision within the model. Then that's kind of how I been thinking about this, is that the sensory level, that first level, there are multiple places that you can start to identify patterns to school patterns and then start to layer on top of that a confidence or a precision over that which we have evidence for, how that's mediated in the brain for various various places."
"Unknown","00;44;28;06","00;45;00;26","But the precision then itself itself becomes this thing that you can layer on top of your entire sensory experience and gives you this kind of internal flexibility as to how you're how you're interacting, interacting with the world, and then the modeling of how those precisions are being driven you know, without your awareness is then what what those states that be matrix at the second level would be would be encoding as you're starting to learn."
"Unknown","00;45;01;20","00;45;25;28","OK, so this, you know, my attention gets grabbed by this or that or like these are the kinds of and here we're talking explicitly about attention, but there's other precisions around that. You can start to understand how they are evolving and then also learning where you're where your reach of control is like how much of how much of this can I control and influence and what does that mean and what are the impacts of that?"
"Unknown","00;45;26;14","00;45;54;05","And kind of what I find exciting about exciting about this because you can kind of see how different forms of precision control and awareness would lead to different kinds of model optimization. And you can calculate the free energy, you know, based on on how different precision profiles are defined and evolving and kind of over time. That's something that you would hope to be able to learn."
"Unknown","00;45;54;25","00;46;13;27","And then the question is like, how do you actually learn that? Well, by paying attention by paying attention to how it's changing. And that's not always easy. And sometimes things in life, you know, make us pay attention to it. You start to notice, like, I'm the kind of person who gets. Yeah, thank you. Exactly. This figure here that gets impacted in these ways."
"Unknown","00;46;13;27","00;46;35;13","But I think there's a really important thing to say around the role of a teacher in this, as well as somebody who can point these things out. And in doing so, direct your attention in a way that you wouldn't have thought to previously and to noticing like, hey, there's this pattern in my mind that I hadn't thought of as a pattern."
"Unknown","00;46;35;13","00;46;53;10","I just thought of this or hadn't even thought of it. It's just happening and then as soon as I start to see it as a pattern or something, I can start to model. And then you've got this kind of emergence of a of a higher level structuring or understanding or grasping or modeling expectation over these patterns that were previously unconscious."
"Unknown","00;46;54;25","00;47;18;08","Thanks. I'm going to just read a comment with no response needed from the live chat and then go to Scott. So Joshua Benjamin wrote, All psychic ability seems to be subconsciously driven. One is of the active and subconscious mind would be magical to say at least people that already have their active and subconscious mind working as one also seem to have identical palmistry between their left and right palms."
"Unknown","00;47;19;12","00;47;44;15","Interesting observation, Scott Yeah. Thank you. I'm sorry I was delayed in coming in, but I'm always thrilled as soon as I drop into the conversation. It's like being with family. So this is so wonderful. What a great conversation. I wonder if you could comment a little bit on the attention versus intention. It feels like part of what we're talking about and let me let me comment on that a little bit."
"Unknown","00;47;44;17","00;48;06;13","Is following up on Dean's exploration there. I was thinking I always talk to people about the aha moment. If you know that if you know the punchline to a joke and someone tells you a joke, it's just not funny because you know the punch line. And so the aha moment is the same as that moment of Eureka. When you get out of the bathtub and run around yelling Eureka that you do you understand something?"
"Unknown","00;48;06;13","00;48;33;11","It's a paradigm shift like Thomas Kuhn in the structure of scientific revolutions talks about that you shift from not knowing something to also knowing. So those I'm a addict for those moments. I love ignorance as a result. So I wonder if you could talk a little bit about going from attention to intention. I am coming to the belief from working with you folks and others in similar explorations that the mind actually doesn't exist at all in the brain."
"Unknown","00;48;33;11","00;49;17;12","The mind is always in society and in language, always the brain gets tuned into a local mind by exposure or by perception. And then that become the attention turns into intention. You adopt like a bowerbird, you adopt nascent models from the externality there's no on board feral consciousness in my assertion here. So you develop it and cultivate it based on your exposure to the environment as you build it up the attentions your teachers out there in the world, whether they're formal teachers or informal, can help you convert attention to intention because the models get developed based on their explanatory power of your environment, right?"
"Unknown","00;49;17;12","00;49;42;07","If they get cast aside, if they're not as helpful in closing free energy gaps, for instance. So I just wanted to throw those things out there. And following up with Dean, to me, the paradox of the frizzled between consciousness and unconsciousness is not something that we can resolve. It's something that we can observe and maybe manage in some ways with these models."
"Unknown","00;49;42;19","00;50;07;07","But the paradox is, one thing I always told my kids is the only time you see reality is when you're seeing paradox, and any time you're seeing the absence of paradise, you are seeing a model. And when people say they want to resolve paradox, it means they want their model to win. Here, it feels like, as Dan was alluding to, that there are multiple models that are in place simultaneously, and the multiple models maybe can give us a sense of the shift from attention to intention."
"Unknown","00;50;07;17","00;50;13;29","Anyway, your comments are welcome thanks, Scott. Thank you for that. Lots of interesting points there."
"Unknown","00;50;16;08","00;50;49;24","I'll just pick out one of the things you said there around insights and these aha moments and from and this isn't present here again in a certain kind of falling into a dense trap here, a little bit of running forward with it. But if you imagine here that what what's being afforded by paying attention to new ways to dynamics and precisions within our generative model and how and how all these things are evolving you know we're gaining in model kind of structure and complexity ultimately."
"Unknown","00;50;50;08","00;51;17;25","And one of the bits of work that I find really interesting from Carl and other colleagues is around insights. And they've been talking about it in the context of psychedelics specifically as these moments of model reduction, Bayesian model reduction, whereby you lose a bit of model structure and there's this liberating aspect of that and there's this sort of knowing aspect of that too."
"Unknown","00;51;17;25","00;52;00;06","And it's not that you've sort of learned something new, you've kind of unlearn something, and in that you you gain in model fitness as well. You know, there's this kind of improvement of the state of affairs by, by, by doing that. And so you could imagine a scenario whereby in playing this game of paying attention to how things go and how things are in the mind specifically, your model structure is kind of gaining complexity, but you're also identifying places that can be reduced and you get this sort of cyclical growing of complexity and reduction, which matches on really, really nicely."
"Unknown","00;52;00;06","00;52;27;24","And I have to be really careful sometimes to not try and like recapitulate things that I like from sort of practice theory into science and really be grounded in in the act of inference. But nevertheless, there's our kind of what's to say that that kind of nicely matches to the cycles of practice, to the cycles of, of insight and growth that does come in this sort of non nonlinear and cyclical way."
"Unknown","00;52;28;29","00;53;00;14","Thanks. LA's blue so this doesn't really like a question, but it's more of a comment. So Scott was kind of talking about inverting attention or intention to attention but I think that that's all sort of something that's cyclical. So you can convert attention to intention and intention to attention. You intend to pay attention, attention gives you an attention that's like way tongue twister but but like where does imagination come into play that right?"
"Unknown","00;53;00;15","00;53;35;24","Like there's tension intensive but where is the exploration, the creativity and does active inference allow for maybe this components on attention and attention and imagination good question. I think of imagination a lot in terms of generative practices. So like stage generation practices like Lovingkindness gratitude forgiveness, these kinds of things. And for me, the way that I think about that is you are using your imagination to generate the goal observation, the goal state."
"Unknown","00;53;36;10","00;54;02;19","Right? Which then allows you then to set a prior over that to aim for. So if you evoke in your mind the A may you be happy. So I'm imagining a situation where you are happy and now that is a possible future state that I can put a prior over. And once I've done that, then the machinery of active inference starts coming into play to achieve that kind of goal."
"Unknown","00;54;02;27","00;54;36;03","And that's a very, very hand-waving and very loose. And again, like I can, I can sense that people out there might be cringing to this kind of way of talking about, about these models. But, you know, an answer to the question, that's kind of how I how I think about at least that form form of imagination that's some point to stuff thinking about how our cultural environment scaffolds our preferences and our Cheerios, our end directness, which is something that came up in navigation."
"Unknown","00;54;36;03","00;55;01;23","Now it's coming up in cognitive navigation and setting up these higher order parameters. Scott I just wonder why is it cringing from the math perspective, the like? Because I'm a humanities guy and the math always freaks me out. So I want to understand, though, what is it about the you're a math person steeped in the math. What is it about what you just said that makes you uncomfortable with the math?"
"Unknown","00;55;02;07","00;55;39;28","And how might math be? Why is it stretching the math or how might the math be extended to to accommodate that crunchiness problem? Yeah, and I'll thank Scott good question. The reason I say that is because these models can pretty much model anything, right? You can you can adapt them to make almost any point that you want. And so if I start saying, oh, this is how it is and this is what imagination is and does, well, then I can sort of ad hoc play with the model until it until it until it makes that point."
"Unknown","00;55;40;23","00;56;12;08","And what I've really tried to do here in this paper is be very careful with that and to allow the dynamics to emerge intrinsically from moves in the mathematics that are like allowed and and and don't make many assumptions because really all we're doing here is having a higher level that is dramatizing precisions on the low level. And then we're just running it and seeing what kind of dynamics emerge."
"Unknown","00;56;12;17","00;56;37;01","And interestingly, the dynamics that are merger are aligned with the expectations. But if I go too far the other way, which is really easy to do with this because you have especially in a practice meditation context, there's really detailed phenomenological models of all kinds of mental dynamics. And it'd be very easy to say, you know, just gerrymander act of inference to describe all of that."
"Unknown","00;56;37;01","00;56;59;12","And so that's why I'm trying to just be a little bit careful in how I talk about it. Won't just follow up the one of the things so this may be rationalization, but so I'm a lawyer, so I was a rhetorician. And so when we have incommensurable is in the law we use rhetoric to glue them together. And it's not crazy glue."
"Unknown","00;56;59;12","00;57;21;02","Crazy glue doesn't fill gaps. It's rhetoric is epoxy, right? Glue, glue stuff together and fills the gaps, right? Crazy glue to stick stuff together. And so the reason I'm talking about that is, is it again, I asserted before that the mind actually exists in language that's very weird, in loose language I'm using there. The mind exists in language."
"Unknown","00;57;21;02","00;57;41;04","It exists in material culture. We're born feral and we get a brain gets tuned to a local mind. Let's go with that for a second as a posit. So you have nothing on board when you're born what is it? I guess another way of asking the question, can the math construct consciousness through a feral mind with no social exposure?"
"Unknown","00;57;42;01","00;58;06;15","That's my question. And I'd beginning to believe that nothing. Yes, there's imagination. Of course, there's a lot of lateral thinking, but all the things are borrowings from the externality is my assertion. Now, that's not the imagination. You can mix and match in different ways, but if you're isolated and have no question is I guess, will the math generate a consciousness without any external input?"
"Unknown","00;58;07;00","00;58;36;21","And I think the answer is no. And so therefore it feels to me like the brain is a mind instance instance and the mind actually, doesn't it paradigm radically weird and different. I don't. Maybe there are people who say this I don't know. I just don't know enough about the mind studies, but it feels like we can allow ourselves to not feel cringing about the extension, the math."
"Unknown","00;58;36;21","00;58;58;11","Now, again, I'm not the math guy. I'm the crunchy I'm the crunchy side of this. But by if we recognize that these source of the mind stuff is external, maybe that's OK and it's processed in the brain anyway. I don't know if that's something that needs responding to but it's to me this is very interesting because this is that metaphysics jump and is it metaphysical or not?"
"Unknown","00;58;58;11","00;59;23;19","I don't know. I, I mean, I don't, I don't have much resistance to what you're saying there. I don't think these things happen in a vacuum. And I think, you know, just intuitively you know, that kind of a cognitive structure would not emerge without some kind of, you know, societal or back and forth, multiple nodes in the network working working together on this."
"Unknown","00;59;23;19","00;59;32;20","And, you know, anecdotally, a line that always sticks with me and from the Buddha of all people is you know."
