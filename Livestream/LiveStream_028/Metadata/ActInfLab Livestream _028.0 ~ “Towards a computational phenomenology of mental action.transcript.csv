"Speaker 1","00;00;07;21","00;00;34;22","Hello and welcome to the active inference live its active live live stream number 28.0 on September 6th 2021 we're going to be talking about the paper towards a computational phenomenology of mental action modeling, better awareness and attentional control with deep parametric active inference welcome to the Active Inference Lab. We are a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference."
"Speaker 1","00;00;35;00","00;01;05;13","You can find us at the links on this page. This is a recorded and an archived live stream, so please provide us with feedback so that we can improve on our work. All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and we'll be following good video etiquette for live streams. Thanks. A turn blue and Stephen and Dean. Nice fun to have a dot zero crew together here you'll see a slightly updated version of the upcoming Streams calendar, which you can get at from this short link here."
"Speaker 1","00;01;06;25","00;01;32;16","September 7th and 14th. We're going to be discussing this paper. We're going to be discussing it this one. And then we don't have a paper for 29 and then we have some papers set with authors for all of October. Also check out the tabs to see other series other than the Tuesday paper centric walkthroughs and of course anyone's welcome to co-organised an event or to be the guest for one of these types of streams."
"Speaker 1","00;01;33;25","00;01;58;15","All right so today in 28.0 we're going to be just learning and discussing this paper that was already mentioned by Sanford Smith has met out first in Lutz and Ramstad out only a few weeks ago, which is kind of cool to see and there's going to be a time to talk about it's a super interesting paper and if you want to participate in 28.1 or two, you should get in touch."
"Speaker 1","00;01;58;15","00;02;17;02","Otherwise, if it's after that time, then check out those videos and maybe find another one to participate in. But I'm just looking forward to hearing what you all were excited about by way of introduction. Just want to hear from everybody and what was exciting to them about this paper or made them want to join for the zero."
"Speaker 2","00;02;23;28","00;02;54;00","If I could go first. Daniel here. Thanks. I'm really excited to interested to see them moving beyond a computational approach to neuro phenomenology, which I've seen before, and into this broader idea of what they're calling computational phenomenology, which was about a claim and has more relevance potentially to other applications which I'm interested in and applied active inference context."
"Speaker 2","00;02;54;00","00;03;01;27","So, you know, we see how that old claim can be applied nice."
"Speaker 1","00;03;02;26","00;03;03;05","OK."
"Speaker 3","00;03;05;00","00;03;15;12","So for me, I thought it was like ultra meta the paper really got into the hierarchical levels of organization, which I'm always excited to see and talk about."
"Speaker 4","00;03;18;07","00;03;37;25","But for me it was the fact that I am doing some writing right now, and I am interested in the idea that there is a way of putting this into some sort of a geometric relationship as well as the computational relationship tool."
"Speaker 1","00;03;38;06","00;04;02;13","OK, the paper is let me just re frame. It is towards computational phenomenology of mental action modeling, meta awareness and attentional control with deep parametric active inference in neuroscience of consciousness published about two weeks ago. 27th of August. Does someone want to read the three aims of the paper."
"Speaker 3","00;04;05;25","00;04;24;15","So go ahead. The three aims are to explicitly model meta awareness to account for the computational consequences of meta awareness on cognitive control. And lastly, to provide a computational account of mental COUBERTIN action OK."
"Speaker 1","00;04;25;04","00;04;32;19","And then maybe the second part sure."
"Speaker 3","00;04;33;19","00;04;59;23","Hormonally speaking, the crucial thing to note about these cognitive processes is that they are about other such processes. The deployment and control of attentional states and processes, for instance, are quintessentially essentially a higher level ability, less such states and processes monitor and monitor and modulate other typically lower level perceptual states. Third order, higher level processes in turn oversee these attentional practices."
"Speaker 3","00;05;00;05","00;05;28;29","We can be aware of our attention being grabbed and make a deliberate decision to focus our attention elsewhere. It would seem then that effective self-regulation of attention depends on the ability to access, evaluate and control the quality of these attentional processes themselves in the same way that attentional processes are necessary to consciously access, assess and control lower level perceptual states interesting areas."
"Speaker 1","00;05;29;21","00;05;54;24","It's just interesting to see that the kind of framework that helps a robot navigate now it's being used in a little bit of a different way, like nesting within our self and coming closer to our experience and other things which often are said to be unable to be directly observed. So it's quite a cool topic Stephen, any thoughts or do either of you want to read the first abstract?"
"Speaker 4","00;05;56;07","00;06;24;28","I got a quick thought before we get to the abstract in the introduction of the paper. I just want to read this really quickly. It's in the paper, but computational terms, the central place of confidence, reliability and effect of self-regulation speaks to the key role of precision or inverse variance of implicit beliefs. And then they talk about probabilistic and posterior Bayesian beliefs that describe a probability distribution over some late in quality days."
"Speaker 4","00;06;24;29","00;06;50;28","But this was the thing that I found really interesting. Bayesian beliefs about Bayesian beliefs can in certain situations become propositional and the way that they are estimated optimize controlled precisions. In a nutshell, quantify our confidence in our beliefs, say how confident we are about what we know about state of the world, about their relationship to our observations, or about how these states change over time."
"Speaker 4","00;06;52;08","00;07;21;09","Being able to place numbers around that. Soon as I read that and saw it in relationship to a proposition, I found that really interesting and one it was really curious to see now. So how is that thread going to play out now? I wasn't that wasn't part of the three things that were in the previous slide, but I think it was really important and something that was it has to be a name or a claim of the paper because it's pretty fascinating."
"Speaker 1","00;07;23;00","00;07;48;16","Good call. It's almost like a background assumption whether post hoc justified by empirical appeal or not, that precision is what matters, which is kind of the other side of the coin from uncertainty like high precision means low uncertainty and vice versa. And sometimes they're framed. So I think I totally agree that is a claim in paper. OK, Steven, want to go for abstract one yeah."
"Speaker 2","00;07;52;16","00;08;47;23","OK. Matter awareness refers to the capacity to explicitly notice the current contents of consciousness and has been identified as a key components for the successful control of cognitive states. Such as the deliberative direction of attention. This paper proposes a formal model of matter, awareness and attentional control when using hierarchical active inference to do so, we cast mental action as policy selection over higher level cognitive states and at a further hierarchical level to model matter awareness states that modulate the expected confidence or precision in the mapping between observations and hidden cognitive states."
"Speaker 1","00;08;49;06","00;09;27;11","Nice. Yeah, there's a lot of terms, some of which we're going to go into in the keyword section but pretty distilled down description of their contribution. And we're going to unpack it more. OK, abstract to we simulate the example of mind wandering and its regulation during a task involving sustained selective attention on a perceptual object. This provides a computational case study for an inferential architecture that is apt to enable the emergence of these central components of human phenomenology, namely the ability to access and control cognitive states."
"Speaker 1","00;09;28;12","00;09;49;18","We propose that this approach can be generalized to other cognitive states, and hence this paper provides the first steps towards the development of a computational phenomenology of mental action and more broadly of our ability to monitor and control our own cognitive states. Future steps of this work will focus on fitting the model with qualitative, behavioral and neural data."
"Speaker 1","00;09;50;13","00;09;55;14","OK, for topics, any thoughts or we can refine."
"Speaker 4","00;09;56;13","00;10;00;17","First first steps. That's the emphasis here. Just first steps."
"Speaker 1","00;10;01;23","00;10;25;20","Yep. I'm pretty excited to get to this the generalized model of mental action because it's like almost like the new tool enables asking about phenomena that we already know and then it reveals a whole new stage space of kind of the model feeding back to the kinds of regimes of attention that we designed for ourself or modifications or information inputs."
"Speaker 1","00;10;26;23","00;11;04;06","OK, roadmap. So this paper has an interesting layout. It is just an introduction that brings up the non active inference sections related to the scientific study of mental action and about how it's been computationally modeled outside of active inference. Then there's a methodology paper that first has more of a model building a narrative, and then the empirical results from a simulation that has a few different layers of detail layered on."
"Speaker 1","00;11;04;07","00;11;27;25","It's not just one single model. There's a few little variants that help get out which parts of the model are contributing which behavior and why. Then they have a more general discussion and give some directions for future research. And that's where some of these big claims about computational phenomenology go. And then there's a conclusion. So any thoughts on the roadmap."
"Speaker 2","00;11;30;28","00;12;08;22","Yeah, I was going to I think that this gives a good sense of the way that they're trying to enter into this space. Looking at the opacity and transparency of phenomenology and trying to sort of bring back that neuro phenomenology into this wider phenomenology. And so by by sort of looking at the experience now, the question that sort of sort of comes up with this is because obviously a lot of the work here with Ramstad and others has been around in body cognition and stuff like that."
"Speaker 2","00;12;09;01","00;12;27;13","So they sort of going into this idea of trying to set it up so that they can target phenomenology while still keeping around mental states and cognition so there's an interesting as you know, ontological dance. They're trying to find a way through here, which I think is kind of interesting."
"Speaker 1","00;12;30;10","00;12;50;24","Any other comments on the road map? OK, so the key words were free energy principle, active inference, neuro phenomenology, metacognition, opacity, transparency, focus, attention, mind wandering and mindfulness. So perhaps blue with FFP."
"Speaker 3","00;12;52;21","00;13;24;17","And so this slide I pulled out of the livestream 15.0. So the free energy principle is based on three aspects. The observation of self-organization, which brings us to the second aspect, which is that living organisms can be described as stochastic dynamical systems possessing attractors. And then lastly, the states in which the self-organizing system is at a point in time can be identified by the interactive role they play within the multilevel self-organization scheme."
"Speaker 3","00;13;25;18","00;13;45;21","And then this is related to in the slide from 14.0 multi-stage systems ensembles infer thermodynamics and variational Bayesian inference that I thought was applicable here as we're going through this hierarchical awareness meta awareness tool."
"Speaker 1","00;13;45;29","00;13;48;15","It just even as an afterthought."
"Speaker 2","00;13;48;21","00;14;24;24","Yeah, yeah. I think this is good good to characterize this. And also I know that Maxwell mentioned how that multilevel graph, he's kind of gone back on it a bit but it does show that whole question and it's a really good diagram to show both that there is this multilevel nested sort of multi scale thing going on and also it's kind of a contested is a contested or kind of evolving part of the whole field because it's people sort of putting out things and then they're maybe backtracking a little bit and so I think, yeah, I think it's quite a good thing to bring up."
"Speaker 1","00;14;26;17","00;14;59;05","Definitely not a settled area. That's why it's so fun to just have these discussions on the topic because even the paper is not the end result. It was first steps and we're going to see in this discussion. The motor skills system is almost like psychologically nested or mentally nested within one agent, whereas previously we've been talking a lot about multi scale systems in the context of, you know, a bunch of ants making the colony, bunch of communicating individuals making the community."
"Speaker 1","00;14;59;11","00;15;25;26","So it's like that's like multi-skilled systems out and getting spatially bigger and this is kind of getting more ephemeral, but also having this very interesting influence on the lower level models so for active inference, the key word, we can look at what the authors wrote because it's always cool to see just how did they define this? How do they frame what active inferences for this paper?"
"Speaker 1","00;15;26;14","00;15;56;00","And they wrote that at the root of these advances is a biologically plausible neurocognitive and behavioral modeling framework called Active Inference. Active inference provides us with a Bayesian mechanics, that is the mechanics of knowledge driven action and active perception which explains from first principles how autonomous agents can thrive within their ever changing environments. Active inference descends from and is closely related to Bayesian brain theory and predictive coding."
"Speaker 1","00;15;56;25","00;16;38;01","And then this green one I thought was very interesting in how they said it was active inference casts perception learning and action as essentially being in the same game, that of gathering evidence for the model that underwrites the existence of the agents. So just on the diagram that we've seen with the four different kinds of nodes with a blanket states of in and out going in, the internal and external states like to see that the three that constitute the organism, let's say, are all in the same game, just bring sort of a unity of action and inference to how we think about at the very least, other systems that already have this structure like input"
"Speaker 1","00;16;38;01","00;16;53;13","output systems, which some people speculate describe all classes of systems or computational systems. So it's just like the way that they made that clear effective inference without tying it to a specific model implementation. I thought was very well set."
"Speaker 2","00;16;53;15","00;17;28;11","Steven and also this does give a flexibility as knowledge evolves because as Mark Soames has been talking about the way attention may be moved around more the base of the brain and using more kind of attentional biological you know, inactive questions, that wouldn't necessarily be a problem for this because this this modeling isn't completely tied to some sort of frontal cortex model of thought."
"Speaker 2","00;17;28;11","00;17;54;24","It's kind of it's broader. So I think that's that's quite interesting. And to see how that cool using the term behavioral model in the framework and they sort of yeah, the way they positioned it because having gone the whole way in talked about biological and going down the the full multi scale biology, they've kept it kind of in the brain but they brought in that behavioral element which I think neuro phenomenology maybe doesn't do as much."
"Speaker 1","00;17;56;03","00;17;59;20","Good segway blue one to describe this one."
"Speaker 3","00;18;01;12","00;18;36;05","So so no phenomenology in the words of the authors I know phenomenology has been described as the search for generative passages between the neuro biological, phenomenological and mathematical levels of description going beyond the description of mere isomorphism is between these levels to our mutual epistemological and mythological methodological accountability and cross-fertilization, cross-fertilization know phenomenology aims to bridge the gap between these kinds of data via the formal, metaphysically neutral levels of the description provided by mathematic and computational work."
"Speaker 3","00;18;36;18","00;19;01;06","And I pulled this cartoon out of this paper because I thought it was kind of a neat perspective on visual and phenomenology. So talks about the biological structures as predetermining the world of the organism and then their phenomenology as a praxis between the first person account of the organism and the neuro descriptions of these structures. So that that was a kind of the point of this."
"Speaker 1","00;19;02;06","00;19;34;23","Nice find very interesting figure. Looks kind of like a sci fi human novel, but it's kind of cool OK, to talk about one specific kind of neuro phenomenology, like a first person experience that is desired to be modeled potentially even in a computational direction. Here you're focusing on this metacognition aspect. So just the yellow parts they wrote, we define meta awareness in this context."
"Speaker 1","00;19;35;04","00;20;01;22","As the ability to explicitly notice the current content of a conscious episode for our purposes. As discussed in the text, we defined states of meta awareness as those third order, which we'll get to states of the system that are about and enable the opacity of second order. Attentional states metacognitive states thus function analogously to attentional states which enable the opacity of first order perceptual states."
"Speaker 1","00;20;02;07","00;20;33;26","So it's going to be a three layer nesting doll. The role that the second model plays over the first is going to be analogous to the role that the third model plays over the second. But that doesn't mean it's dynamics are going to play out in the exact same way. And this last part was very interesting. Like mental action refers to goal directed internal behavior without necessarily having a direct consequence on the external environment, e.g. as the muscular action paradigmatic example of mental action is covert attention."
"Speaker 1","00;20;34;23","00;20;52;02","So what an interesting topic. You know, the whole think of X or don't think of X. I don't play any language games on the livestream but many of those exist and they have to do with inducing mental action. So that's just so interesting that that's what this framework is going to be exploring."
"Speaker 1","00;20;54;03","00;20;56;08","OK, Stephen, go for it."
"Speaker 2","00;20;57;23","00;21;25;29","Yeah. And without, you know, putting too much pressure on the paper to go further. But is it that question of skill performance and the phenomenology of being in the flow or being in a state of sense, making it be interesting how that neurobiological phenomenology, phenomenological passages can extend out into some of that kind of work, which is obviously highly complex."
"Speaker 2","00;21;25;29","00;21;29;26","But, you know, this might give us clues. So that's good."
"Speaker 1","00;21;30;19","00;21;55;21","Yep. Cool. And then this is just I found this link Trailblazing Ants Show Hints of metacognition when seeking food. And recent research has shown that bees, when faced with a difficult task, simply opt out of doing it, a behavior that may be interpreted as a form of metacognition, at least computationally. Now it seems that ants might be capable of a similar mental feat despite their tiny, simple brain."
"Speaker 1","00;21;56;03","00;22;23;16","So it's like, what computational attributes are we going to assign to it? But that's just how Bach is, or that's just how ants are versus this variable is the one that we're experiencing because of this. So that's just kind of a topic that's going to come up probably multiple times. OK, how about transparency and opacity? What does it mean in someone's words or reading here?"
"Speaker 4","00;22;28;16","00;22;47;09","Right. Can I bring a little different angle to this? I mean, to understand that how the contrast of transparency and opacity works but when I was bring it when I was trying to figure this out, to help somebody who was walking into a situation oriented to a lot of the data around them, that they would otherwise be overwhelmed with."
"Speaker 4","00;22;47;09","00;23;09;29","One of the things we talked about was the difference between Liminality and just getting a generalized sense of the orientation space and then limits all of these sort of filling in the details and getting an understanding where the edges are so that you don't bump into them and hurt yourself. And so I get the transparency and opacity piece and how it's explained in the paper."
"Speaker 4","00;23;10;12","00;23;39;01","But for a person who's trying to move from the generalized to the more specific I think I think it's the opacity piece speaks clearly to the difference between that and what something that's clear but I also think that the details get filled in when you can have an understanding what the limits are and not just only understand that it's now in your in your field of awareness, which is how they're describing this, which is your where's your focus?"
"Speaker 4","00;23;39;01","00;23;39;28","Where's your attention."
"Speaker 1","00;23;41;26","00;24;05;18","Einstein? I put this goldfish meme. It's the story about the goldfish and what is water, and the elder one is aware of water. Then the younger ones are unaware of the water that they swim in cough, cough. And then it's kind of like the two mental extremes, like water is opaque. You can think of water being like cloudy to this fish maybe it has a different vision."
"Speaker 1","00;24;05;28","00;24;25;00","So then it can see that there's a drop off in vision. It infers that it's in opaque waters of water or something that it can ask about the conditions of, whereas the small fish in this example, it's clear. It's like transparent. So they're seeing through it. Ergo, it's transparent to them. So they're imperceptible. So the green ones are accessible to the system."
"Speaker 1","00;24;25;00","00;24;43;22","You're aware of it. It's like water that has an opaque tint, as in the transparent means, like you just can't differentiate it experientially. And that's a philosophical framework by, I think Matt Singer, which has probably been influential right?"
"Speaker 2","00;24;44;10","00;25;40;07","Yeah, highly influential, I think. And increasingly so. I think. I think that I think this could be pushed a bit further because I think it's OK to state this as almost a philosophical piece, but I'm bringing in stuff like mental space psychology, which hasn't really been incorporated in this area. But, you know, these subconscious sort of opaque or transparent awarenesses are part of our could be part of a deeper way of knowing if we assume that thinking is through our senses, if sense, if actually the process of the brain is not all in the box, but it's recapitulating stuff through the sensory world around us, even in the subconscious that would tie in quite well"
"Speaker 2","00;25;40;07","00;25;43;26","with this, but also give a bit more of a computational grounding."
"Speaker 4","00;25;45;25","00;26;03;01","The other thing too, Daniel, if you'd written the words opaque and transparent in a white colored in a white colored font with that white background they'd still be opaque, but we wouldn't see them on the back, on the white background. And so that's again where."
"Speaker 1","00;26;03;28","00;26;05;01","They could call in."
"Speaker 4","00;26;05;01","00;26;28;05","Order to be able to bring the idea forward. It isn't just a comparison of transparency to something that actually has a sense of tangibility there's this other part of it that we we'll pick it up because there is a contrast, there is some differentiation and is not always just have to be the something's clear and something has depth."
"Speaker 1","00;26;30;00","00;26;30;24","Thank you, Stephen."
"Speaker 2","00;26;32;01","00;27;08;17","Yeah, that's a really good point. And actually that can extend as well to the size of the space you're in. So if you start to imagine the relationships of these kind of subconscious senses of how close or far certain ideas are that changes depends on the size of the actual room you're in. And I imagine the different colors of the room, the light in the room as well might affect how many thought about this before that might affect the transparent states as well, because there may be some sort of calibration going on, you know, so it might be quite profound to be in a blue room in terms of what your transparent states end up"
"Speaker 2","00;27;08;17","00;27;10;28","recapitulating. So that's interesting."
"Speaker 1","00;27;11;14","00;27;21;08","We'll come back to, I think, a niche modification and design a regime of attention who made this slide or what did it mean to anyone?"
"Speaker 3","00;27;22;10","00;27;52;20","So this is my in the focused action I thought was an interesting key word the authors didn't use it once. If you search the paper and then as a Google search, you search for focused action and you get all kinds of life coaching. Oh, just like, whoa, OK. I don't think that that's maybe the intention here. So this is just the typical active inference where you have internal states perception, external states and action that are all connected and and partitioned by a markup link."
"Speaker 3","00;27;52;21","00;28;14;19","It so so in the I'm extrapolating based on what I think that the authors mean here, low precision is unfocused and it's low precision also in terms of perception because perception is also when you like register, you just saw something. They talked about the oddball and like, you know, you're seeing an image, seeing an image, seeing an image."
"Speaker 3","00;28;14;19","00;28;34;00","And then all of a sudden the image is different. And it's like, oh, I wasn't even paying attention to what I was seeing at all. So it's that perception can also have this kind of unfocused quality. So so I related this to like a low precision kind of perception or action as unfocused and where it's high precision where you're focused on what you should be focused on."
"Speaker 3","00;28;34;00","00;28;37;09","That's, that's focused thanks."
"Speaker 1","00;28;37;09","00;29;01;17","There's one known that is under the reward paradigm plus minus valence avoid approach, a sort of forward, backward, linear mindset we can say, oh, well, not just do we diagnose happiness or sadness or on a linear scale, but it's a goal. And so just what are the aspects of our experience or of just the outcomes of systems that can be said to be related to focus and attention and action?"
"Speaker 1","00;29;02;00","00;29;05;29","So how about just mind wandering since it's really a topic."
"Speaker 3","00;29;07;13","00;29;52;06","So this is so here, these are different papers. And so Mind Wandering has been explored in several different contexts. But specifically, like the figure on the left is by Wanda Hassan Kemp and she studies she's at the Mine Life Institute and so study is directly meditation and the effects on the brain. And so here it just kind of shows the different brain regions that are activated during meditation or also it's like where you have awareness and then your, your mind is wandering, you become aware through your mind just wandering, and then you shift your mindset back to like, oh, I better be paying attention to my meditation, for example, focusing on my breath or whatever."
"Speaker 3","00;29;52;11","00;30;35;14","And then you have a state of focus again and this kind of contrasting neural model of mind wandering. This is a 2016 paper and here they discuss this in a very different way. So when I think about mind wandering, it's easy to think about in the context of meditation, but here they describe like, OK, if you're focused on a task that's on task and then mind wandering is actually pursuit of internal goals, which I thought was interesting, like you're still focused, but you're focused on your shopping list or whatever internal thing that you want to focus on, even though you're like this is like mind wandering."
"Speaker 3","00;30;35;14","00;31;01;16","And then they call this off focus is epistemic exploration. This is like the exploratory, like where your mind what I think of as mind wandering, they call this off focus. And so I thought that that was kind of a different paradigm and not something that I'm used to hearing, like where you're just where you catch yourself like why was I thinking about red balloons and, and, you know, frogs with three legs, like where you just find yourself in this intellectual state, like, what am I thinking about?"
"Speaker 3","00;31;01;17","00;31;11;24","I was even thinking that whereas mind wandering is like, you really are thinking about like some something else that's like you should be thinking about, but not it's not exploratory, which I thought was kind of interesting."
"Speaker 1","00;31;13;01","00;31;33;07","All the things I'd say about that on the bottom right. First, it doesn't look like there's a transition from the bottom left to the bottom right. So it could just be that the dynamics, attractor dynamics of this dynamical system are such that when you just down project these massive data sets of neuroimaging, you get certain transition dynamics, which is totally the case."
"Speaker 1","00;31;33;07","00;31;59;19","Like you're sleepy before you fall asleep and then, you know, different people accelerate or have different dynamics. But there is kind of a trajectory so that was one point was these could be very nuanced states. And then the space and the transitions that exist or don't can be important and the second thing is that the y axis has to do with some neuro activity, some neuro marker where it's low in the bottom too, and high in the middle."
"Speaker 1","00;31;59;19","00;32;27;20","One but then the x axis is behavioral results. So the idea would be that there might be some correlation between like, wow, it was like they did 30 seconds of really good task and then there was 15 seconds where they totally didn't do the task or was variable. And then if you found a neural change that was like immediately preceding that or after it or during it, that's the kind of cross data set connections that this research is getting towards."
"Speaker 1","00;32;28;02","00;32;41;07","But instead of just putting this into the broad framework of dynamical systems and statistics, now we have a process theory like active inference to explore some of the dynamics that give rise to those patterns. So blue and then deep."
"Speaker 3","00;32;42;18","00;33;14;28","So interestingly, there is a correspondence, so it does map what was found and I had to like read into the paper to kind of find this out. But the mind wandering in the left image does map actually to the mind wandering in the image on the right or the brain regions are super similar. So I mean, I read to just make sure that there was some cohesion and there is so so it's like interesting to me to think about this off task, like what, what is like off task versus mind wandering and what like for me, if you're meditating and are not like focused on the thing, like you're off task, but it's I don't"
"Speaker 3","00;33;14;28","00;33;19;10","know, it's super interesting. I just wanted to clarify that one point though, that there's, there is a cohesion there."
"Speaker 1","00;33;20;00","00;33;21;06","Thanks. Blue team."
"Speaker 4","00;33;21;26","00;33;50;29","Yeah. I used to have to work with people who were at a real like I got to be polite because I'm being recorded. They had, they had a real joy out of that of looking at time on task. This was something that was a something that they found really, really important. And so if you were task designing, you were supposed to be able to create something in your in your design scheme that would keep people focused all the time."
"Speaker 4","00;33;51;09","00;34;22;25","And in the meantime, there's a whole bunch of interesting papers that have come out in terms of creativity and tangential thinking. And mind wandering as an actual gift for taking what's in the task and making it your own like if you're mind wandering, you're not it's not a disconnected thought that you're having. And unless you're really being distracted by the video, game or the music or whatever, it's usually something tangential to the task at hand."
"Speaker 4","00;34;22;25","00;34;42;24","And it's it's essentially an embodying exercise. So to I think this is good stuff just because I think lots of times mind wandering. If you're, if you're focused on how many minutes was a person focused or concentrated is seen as a negative when from creative stance it's a really important thing to do."
"Speaker 1","00;34;44;16","00;34;46;09","Thank you, Dean. And then Stephen."
"Speaker 2","00;34;48;03","00;35;15;04","Yeah I think it's it's useful to see a transition. The sun is just some sort of transition state between the regime regime of attention where you're on task and invasion of attention, where your mind wandering. So I think that that opens up questions of how things you know, liminal space is between states and the need to like if you're always going back on task."
"Speaker 2","00;35;15;04","00;35;34;08","Yeah, it would. And you're not getting beyond that state of losing focus and that that could be a problem. I mean, it can be a problem if the mind wandering doesn't get back on task as well, I suppose. But so I think that's that would, that would make a lot of sense I think."
"Speaker 1","00;35;35;03","00;36;15;16","Nice how about mindfulness? So just the yellow part then blue or anyone can give a thought on what they added or mindfulness for the purpose of this work, they're going to focus on regulatory cognitive control strategies in which an agent seeks to control their mental states. By becoming aware of the state as a cognitive process as opposed to regulation strategies where one remains engrossed in the contents of the state this style of regulation is central in mindfulness related intervention, where patients learn to change their relation to thoughts and emotions rather than change the thoughts and emotions themself."
"Speaker 1","00;36;16;03","00;36;41;03","So this is pretty interesting. So becoming aware of the state as a cognitive process is like, This is a thought. I'm having a thought. There's many many praxis, many knowledge traditions built around this which you mention or have people with experience talk about. And the alternative is like when you feel X, feel the X and B the X, that's sort of the opposite."
"Speaker 1","00;36;41;07","00;37;11;09","Q So we're thinking like mental action cues for action, like cues for a sport teen's favorite topic, and then there's cues for mental action that are verbal or have other modes of being delivered. And what are the cues for mental action that leads to different regimes of attention, like Stephen said? And then how are the measurements that we're going to make from different modalities going to inform that study and the kind of modeling that integrates across them, which we'll get to as well?"
"Speaker 2","00;37;11;11","00;37;41;14","Stephen Yeah, this is a useful piece here and it's good to distinguish between I mean, often with children, for instance, there's now more emphasis on mindfulness that believes that big push to just get them busy, you know, make them do sports, make them do this, make them do the other. So they're so busy with something they can't think about anything else but actually saying to them, OK, you're going to be in a space where you could think of other things and you're going to work on how to not focus on other things, has some benefits."
"Speaker 2","00;37;41;14","00;38;17;14","I think there's some slight downsides of that if someone's got trauma, because then it opens up the space for those things to be coming into play. So I suppose I think this is really helpful to to see where they're going. And it'll be interesting to know how this plays out because there's always a danger if someone tries to scale this type of work because it's it's also easier to use the insights in this type of work to try and capture someone's attention at scale or capture many people's attention by using some of the levers here as much as it is for the person on the inside to be able to resist all the distractions and"
"Speaker 2","00;38;17;14","00;38;22;02","the, the flashes and light that they keep getting exposed to in their daily life."
"Speaker 1","00;38;22;24","00;38;23;27","Thanks, Stephen Blue."
"Speaker 3","00;38;27;04","00;39;13;21","Yeah, kind of. I want to just follow, Stephen said. So I don't know that the children or even like us adults being constantly exposed to flashing blue light like the smartphone, like instant dopamine addiction fulfillment thing. Is necessarily the opposite of mindfulness. I think that that that feeling is maybe the elimination of boredom, which you can have mindfulness with boredom or mindfulness while doing nothing and mindfulness or not doing nothing so you can you can have actually not sitting in mindfulness meditation, but but routine through this is called like, you know, meditation practice."
"Speaker 3","00;39;13;21","00;39;30;15","The meditation off the map, right? So like there's, there's the conscious placement of the mind during the meditation session. But then when it's over, you carry that into your daily life by constantly like asking yourself like, where is your mind? Which is like that's, that's the image I put in about the Olympics, the song, Where Is My Mind?"
"Speaker 3","00;39;30;22","00;39;59;26","So, so there is the ability to carry mindfulness even if you're very busy, you can still practice mindfulness in your daily life without taking time to sit on the cushion. So I think we are starving our children of boredom which maybe is I'm more focused on or more worried about a lack of creativity, because I think that that boredom process where your mind is really wandering to red balloons and frogs with three legs like that is where the creative, the creative nature tends to bubble up."
"Speaker 1","00;40;00;28","00;40;21;12","Awesome. And I won't mention the person's name, but I hope that they've emailed us, they have emailed us. I hope they talk more about it, but they have related these aspects of active inference to the yoga of action, karma, yoga, and, and basically like the way that action exists in the world. So I hope start what my knowledge area is."
"Speaker 1","00;40;21;12","00;40;53;10","So look forward to learning about that though. So before we jump into the paper, this has been a nice long background because there's a lot to say and it's pretty interesting. Look at this fun April 1st April Fools Day with Stephen and Blue and I. But they write in this paper that the key technical innovation presented in the paper is an extension of the active inference framework derived from the work of Hespe and all 2021, which was the paper that we discussed in livestream number 19."
"Speaker 1","00;40;53;25","00;41;17;27","So if you want kind of the kernel of what this discussion is about, then check out number 19.0 and .1.2. And we were talking then about affect and about the way that that made deep agents. So listen there to learn more. And now we're going to be doing a few of the similar things, seeing some similar figures. So that's a good background."
"Speaker 1","00;41;17;27","00;41;47;14","Listen, OK, figure one does anyone want to give a first description? It says in the caption, a probabilistic graphical model showing a basic generative model from moment to moment perception OK, so the observation oh is going to be used across different layers, but here is the model of perception. So we can debate whether it's realism or not later."
"Speaker 1","00;41;47;14","00;42;09;23","But this is kind of like the retina or the sensor of the camera. Oh, it's like did a photon hit it or not? This is an observable that you measure with the sensor as each level is going to be a hidden state, so-called, because it's not directly observed, but it's inferred from observations through a which is a mapping."
"Speaker 1","00;42;09;28","00;42;39;27","So like this could be day and night and this could be photon hitting versus no photon hitting. And then you can imagine the mapping there, but we'll see how they nest and get more complex than that. And then D is the initiator, it's a prior overhead and stage, which turns out to be important because as you compute the likelihood of different hidden states being the case, moment to moment or through time, you need to start with an idea of essentially how likely certain states are and how closely they map to observations."
"Speaker 1","00;42;40;18","00;43;08;27","That's the kernel of the Bayesian modeling that we're going to elaborate a lot like multiple successive times. But this is the underlying system that can be thought of, like photons hitting the receptor and the mapping to underlying states as influenced at least initially by a prior. OK, any comments on one? Or we can go to the next generalization and to OK."
"Speaker 1","00;43;09;00","00;43;38;08","So two is a BS graph showing a basic generative model of perception with precision. So it has the same terms and you know, DSA as above DSA. Oh, but now there's a new node and each shape just out a first pass represents some value that can be taken by a variable and then an edge that connects two states is like a relationship between them."
"Speaker 1","00;43;38;17","00;43;58;23","And there's different kinds of nodes, there's different kinds of edges slightly, and how they influence each other, but they just mean that they influence each other. And that's important because the edges actually in the grand scheme are very sparse. It's not an all by all model. So this model is extremely more tractable to compute than like an all by all matrix is just estimating the coefficients of how related terms are."
"Speaker 1","00;43;59;07","00;44;19;24","So it's a very constrained model space, but it still describes a lot of system in the second figure adds in this gamma sub A, which is the precision, which is one over the uncertainty. So just as we had talked about those being two sides of the coin, earlier, this is like uncertainty slash precision depending on which way you want to think about it."
"Speaker 1","00;44;20;05","00;44;56;11","High uncertainty, if you're really unsure, that's low precision and vice versa, but it still maps onto the sensory outcome in both these cases. After the sensory outcome occurs, then there's an update. The prior becomes the posterior after getting a precision weighted updating, and that's just how Bayesian updating works. So this is a Bayesian scheme for updating that initially doesn't include a precision on the A, and now it does include a precision on the any thoughts on two before three?"
"Speaker 2","00;44;57;18","00;45;22;13","Yeah, I think it's interesting. It's good to note that the the expected precision is is tied to the likelihood mapping. It doesn't try and tie itself directly to the study. This is in the way that the state is being. So that's that helps to really notice that and make that clear because that gives the logic a little bit more clarity."
"Speaker 2","00;45;22;13","00;45;27;26","I think that's often a bit that's not teased out as often as it has been here. That's quite useful."
"Speaker 1","00;45;28;06","00;45;52;20","Awesome. Cool. And what else is interesting so good observation that uncertainty is connected only to the mapping. So it's not uncertainty about the state, it's about the mapping in this formulation. Now we're going to see a similar move and two things happen in figure three to bring that previous model into this kind of twice generalized space of generative models of action and perception."
"Speaker 1","00;45;53;03","00;46;28;25","The first thing is that now there's observations through time versus out of moment with just one observation. So subscript one, two, three through time, three time steps. Then here's that DSA oh stack and then B is the transition matrix between states through time so we talked about that and other streams before. And then again, a similar move, just like you pointed out, Steven, how the the uncertainty or like the intervention in this case, the policy pie, it's actually modulating the transition mappings rather than the states themself."
"Speaker 1","00;46;29;09","00;47;01;16","So I'm sure that has very interesting computational properties that I don't know the details of, but I think that some components that make it amenable perhaps to message passing or to the variational inference methods. But that's definitely an interesting observation that you made is true and it happens again here in a totally different way. And then PI, the policy selection is influenced by preferences which play into the calculation that's expected free energy as well as this baseline prior E."
"Speaker 1","00;47;02;02","00;47;37;19","So we've seen this one before and this is how policies are selected over for the next time. Step based upon the expectations of hidden states and observations through time in relationship to prior see how they're apt to perform before starting this sequence of events, and then the way that they calculate their preferences over observation states, which also relates to how you said the body centric inference yeah."
"Speaker 2","00;47;37;27","00;48;05;11","This this might be a question, Daniel, for them, but we know it says preferences over outcomes and it's goes into the expected free energies. They're almost like different ways you could wait the way the expected free energy terms are presented. You know, over maybe Hamilton's least action verses resolving is to be doing something like that. I'm not I'm not sure we can answer that."
"Speaker 2","00;48;05;11","00;48;06;29","But yeah, that makes sense."
"Speaker 1","00;48;06;29","00;48;28;19","It's a preference for sensory states. And then we saw in the Model Stream one with Ryan Smith, like if you wanted to have a very weak preference in the Matrix, it would be like one versus 1.1 just making those numbers up. But the point is like they're relatively close. It's like a 64 to election so that the preference is very weak and then you could also set it up to 100 versus one."
"Speaker 1","00;48;29;04","00;48;49;17","But then if you think about that, like when you're just totally thirsty and you're willing to engage in all kinds of actions, that's how you could computationally put in direction as well as magnitude of preferences over outcome. Some people described, you know, maybe some individuals have a broad sensory tolerance, others have a narrow sensory tolerance or preference."
"Speaker 2","00;48;51;06","00;49;03;08","So I say, yeah, so it's almost like you can you can narrow, you can either open up or narrow down the amounts of options that are going to be available by setting the gap here."
"Speaker 1","00;49;03;19","00;49;38;00","And then in the absence of preference, if you don't have a preference for pheromones, it's just going to be a diffusion walk. So that's how preference plays into the decision making. But also other pieces do to OK. So then here here's where we introduce this second nested layer with the deep generative model of mental action. So here the same D as a oh is recapitulate it from the orange, but an O is split into two nodes."
"Speaker 1","00;49;38;18","00;50;10;22","One is an estimate of the state, but also it's passing or connecting to the precision to uncertainty. So the features that were being discussed like up until figure three as being just part of how the inference was performed are now still doing the same exact role. They're just being emitted by the state through the A. S sub one of two like the second level in parentheses through the eight matrix at the second level."
"Speaker 1","00;50;11;01","00;50;20;21","And then that's resulting in these two outputs. So this could be like a nested layer of thinking or a nested layer of concurrent programing or a nested layer of formality."
"Speaker 4","00;50;20;27","00;50;47;28","Dean And I'm going to get the author to make sure that I'm getting this right. But the more something I remember what Kepler talked with his effective piece and then there's a take five, which we'll get to. But to me the figure is one, two and three aspect of this are the unplanned parts of it, the figure four that asks the question, Why am I here?"
"Speaker 4","00;50;48;10","00;51;13;07","Yes, why am I trying to pay attention to? It's kind of the transition in space. And then the figure five is where we can actually do some planning because we're saying for ourselves now, pay attention because we're putting idea that second order or paying ideas to ideas piece. So I think up, up and up until this point, up until figure four, it was unpalatable."
"Speaker 4","00;51;13;18","00;51;25;15","What we're modeling a figure for, we start a transition and then in figure five, we can actually incorporate a plan if if we so choose, if that's part of our policy base point."
"Speaker 1","00;51;25;20","00;51;43;12","These are really helpful labels like apply at the first level, what am I trying to do? So in the case of the light hitting the receptor? And then is it day or night when we introduce policy that would be like, should I swivel the cart? You know, move my sunflower head left or right move my camera left or right under the preference for light."
"Speaker 1","00;51;43;29","00;52;03;13","Now, if you didn't a preference, it wouldn't matter, right? If you don't know where you're going, it doesn't matter where you go. But if you have a preference vector that gets increasingly stringent, you're going to pursue those policies that will lead to getting the observations that are in line with your preference. Now, here the second level. So this is again, what are my perceiving?"
"Speaker 1","00;52;03;13","00;52;25;03","What am I trying to do? That's the motor cart with a visual receptor. And then here the hidden state again, it's just the same exact placement. Now, obviously, the first layer is what am I paying attention to? And the policy is a policy over attentions. So that's what makes this model nothing outside of the smaller perceptual level model."
"Speaker 1","00;52;25;05","00;52;28;13","So Blue did want say something or no. OK then Stephen, go for it."
"Speaker 2","00;52;32;08","00;53;03;26","So it's treating the precision and it's somehow merging that with the states too and pushing that through another matrix and probably doing I know Brian Smith talks about a cycle of six in terms of when they model, they go through six, you know, it will iterate through six and then the next level will just sample the sixth, the sixth, the sixth, you know the sixth data point, so to speak in the, in this in the faster data going below."
"Speaker 2","00;53;05;05","00;53;19;20","But I'm, I'm not sure how how does that work with the two being combined and the two are combined basically to give you the higher 02. Is that right?"
"Speaker 1","00;53;22;06","00;53;43;07","So I don't know about the six specifically, but here you can see like at the first time point of the slower model this is like the hour hand. There's like the estimation or inference overstates one, two and three and everything about them, like what's the hidden state and the mapping and the observation which you can then conditionals the inference on a subset of those variables."
"Speaker 1","00;53;43;07","00;54;03;15","But that's what the whole model is. And then then it's like you're estimating at time one about time one, two and three. And then at time two, you're also estimating over that trajectory. But the slower hand is like the our hands. OK, continue because I think this is where five is where you're getting that, Dean. It's totally the contribution of the paper."
"Speaker 1","00;54;03;25","00;54;27;06","So they summarize the saying that they make three and this is the 19 aspect all four. A lot of this structure, they summarize that they make three novel contributions to parametric active inference models of cognitive control. The first contribution is to stipulate a fully defined attentional and awareness states as the mechanism of opacity control at different hierarchical levels."
"Speaker 1","00;54;27;28","00;54;53;16","The second is to provide a formal definition of attentional and meta awareness control via an account of higher level policy selection. The third is to formally demonstrate the relationship between awareness states and the capacity for deliberate attentional control. We're going to look at that model in FIG. five, and it's still going to be like sort of the abstract skeleton of the model, and then there's going to be a simulation results."
"Speaker 1","00;54;53;29","00;55;34;24","So that was kind of all the background actually to their primary contribution. Now in FIG. five, we see this explicitly three layer model and this is the primary contribution is this model topology and architecture. And then the interpretation of the higher order states in terms of the opacity, transparency, and then eventually a more generalized perspective on mental action and bring this all together with a model that does basically the same trick around the second layer as happened around the first layer."
"Speaker 1","00;55;35;03","00;55;58;21","So these layer one and layer two are the exact same from figure four. And now there's this third green layer where the states are asking the unobservable question how aware of my how aware am I of where my attention is? And then the policy question is, am I trying to maintain awareness of my attentional state or something like that?"
"Speaker 1","00;55;58;21","00;56;13;05","We can get at what exact wording these parameters map onto, but totally interesting shape and structure of the model and question. So any thoughts are what was exciting to people about figure five, Stephen and then anyone else."
"Speaker 2","00;56;14;28","00;56;43;06","Yeah, it's interesting. It's exciting to see it's got some similarities to the valence, the deeply felt effect valence has been a higher level sort of calibration, I suppose in a way they might try and find a way to put those two together, you know, when you say, you know, I'm aware of where my attention is, but what kind of awareness is that?"
"Speaker 2","00;56;43;06","00;56;50;07","Awareness is a feeling. It feels good or is it something else? So yeah."
"Speaker 1","00;56;50;21","00;56;54;11","Nice dinner blue. Otherwise we can."
"Speaker 4","00;56;55;11","00;57;25;23","I just want to say a couple quick things. So the way that they laid the paper out, this made a really good case for why they were focusing on the transparency and the opacity opacity piece. And they don't make any claims around whether or not a person who's looking at a white page with white text written on or on it can actually see that white text or whether or not the size of the font is so large that you're only seeing one pixel in the letter A on that page."
"Speaker 4","00;57;25;23","00;57;49;18","So you can't even see the eye. But I think both of those things matter when we're talking about attention as well. How can you pay attention to something where you can't see the contrast or how can you pay attention to something where the proportions are so out of whack that they just don't make any sense to you? Now, I know they're not talking about that here, but it would seem to me that that would also be a part of where this computational piece would be really, really helpful."
"Speaker 4","00;57;49;27","00;58;09;09","Because to a learner, sometimes it's easy to see the tunnel within the mountain sometimes it's really, really hard to be able to pick something up off the page when it's either way out of proportion or there isn't any contrast. So I just wanted to kind of I want to I want to give the authors credit. And I think I hope I think I know where they're going next."
"Speaker 1","00;58;11;14","00;58;12;02","Thanks. Yeah."
"Speaker 4","00;58;12;23","00;58;13;04","Cool."
"Speaker 1","00;58;14;13","00;58;55;11","Let's go into a little one. All this talk of the formalities that is kind of interesting. And then we can also ask the authors to explain a little bit more to us. But just to get at how does this as state subtest. So through time across time points at the second level. So that's going to be what we're focused on is the how this is kind of at the intersection of perhaps you could even say the bottom up and the top down signaling or at the very least it's at sort of a, you know, mid level street in a scale of streets of variables from local neighborhoods like down here in the bottom cluster to"
"Speaker 1","00;58;55;11","00;59;20;22","sort of regional hubs to this broader connection that is happening. And even slower or deeper timescale or way, we're kind of looking at this middle piece as a as perhaps an example of again how factors from bottom up and top down interact. And then it's kind of like Legos. Maybe it can be generalized from there and you can say, OK, let's nest this within that or see what happens if you connect over here."
"Speaker 1","00;59;21;06","00;59;58;25","But they write mathematically the attentional and meta awareness state inference is calculated based upon three sources of evidence read prior beliefs. So this is the B and the S layer two. So those are like what is previously influencing that layer specifically. So that's what happened before at that layer. Direct perceptual evidence e.g. the metacognitive observation of one's attentional state, Blue and Orange is sending evidence based on the precision beliefs of the level below."
"Speaker 1","00;59;59;12","01;00;19;10","So maybe that's where if you know, you just opened your eyes in the morning and it's too bright and you don't have the resolution now, you can't make the good mapping between fine grained details because your resolution from a sensory perspective, like the precision, is adopted for a different regime of environmental regularities. So there's perhaps many ways to model this."
"Speaker 1","01;00;19;26","01;00;46;25","So there is then they say something that was kind of interesting for the ascending messages from the continuous expected precision to the discrete states. We use Bayesian Bayesian model reduction for the derivation. So first in 2018 to evaluate the marginal likelihood under the priors associated with each higher level state. This gives in the case of the attentional evidence for example, and then the equation that has these components that are here."
"Speaker 1","01;00;46;25","01;01;14;23","So it sounds probably extremely technical, but it's a pretty interesting topic that we'll look at just in another slide because it is really important to understand how this bottom up continuous info becomes translated to discretely different states. And then this is just to note that this is like the general structure of the model which you can imagine is also computer variables, but then they preset to mental states associated with just specific parameters that they chose."
"Speaker 1","01;01;15;07","01;01;28;05","So especially the simulation is just like a parameter combination. It's not all the possible dimensions one could explore. So that was just to note so here. So yeah. Stephen, go for it. Before we go to model reduction."
"Speaker 2","01;01;28;25","01;01;55;01","I think this is helpful to, to think about that, how that top level has that impact. So you can imagine you know, you wake up sometimes you're at home and you wake up and it's just and slowly you just you see the room you expect to see, OK. And there's the other times when you wake up and you've going to witness and there's that jolt because the prior expectations were still locked into like you're dreaming about waking up at home or you so you're not home."
"Speaker 2","01;01;55;06","01;02;13;28","And there's that so it's almost like you're fulfilling your expectations. These these higher level could just sort of percolate out as you enter into certain states. Or into certain rooms. So I think that's quite a nice way of thinking. Top, top down, bottom up. And that being about perception as well."
"Speaker 1","01;02;14;26","01;02;48;11","Cool. Nice point, deep priors, narrative priors. How did I get here with sensory priors at the moment to moment? So here's the paper with Christine Parr and Zeidman from 2018 slash 19 Bayesian model reduction. So the yellow parts are highlighted but just one green part and then kind of a take away here as we consider structure learning and hierarchical or empirical Bayes that can be regarded as a metaphor for neural biological processes like abduct of reasoning."
"Speaker 1","01;02;48;28","01;03;16;22","So I know that that's what we're kind of excited about. And the paper that we brought up of Majid Bene but that's super interesting. Like just to kind of skip to the last sentence, how are they going to be using model comparison of Bayesian models to explore abduct of reasoning and one takeaway, but really would be great to have people who know more about this topic have a little bit more insight would be like we can compare Bayesian models that only vary in their priors."
"Speaker 1","01;03;17;09","01;03;35;06","It's really easy to compare the similar structures of models that just vary in, like whether they think it's going to be a Gaussian centered at five or centered at seven. There's a lot of tools that help you very rapidly compare that, but if you have two totally disparate model, two programing languages, they're predicting different things it's really hard to compare them."
"Speaker 1","01;03;35;19","01;03;59;08","So the Frequentist comparisons can be very intractable as well as sampling and simulation based ones that are just like brute force or they can have stringent requirements, like the hierarchical likelihood ratio test is only applicable to certain subsets of frequentist modeling. So structure learning is hard. What is the structure of causation? What's the structure of the data, the shape of the data and like you brought up."
"Speaker 1","01;03;59;26","01;04;35;29","So how can we frame this question and challenge about learning about structure of data in terms of model comparison or updating of priors among models that have similar structures, but just different quantitative variables. And so Bayesian model reduction is a way that you can do this kind of structured learning. And one loose analogy is the lasso regression which tries to restrict to a very small set of few strong factors in a dataset that might have, like many weakly interacting factors, it kind of truncates the distribution just as like give me the most relevant ones."
"Speaker 1","01;04;36;12","01;05;09;29","And if it just massively interacting, then, you know, Soviet. And that kind of a regression is going to have a similar use, which is to converge upon a smaller number of things that are really informative while keeping the model also similar, which should be reminiscent of like the Bayesian information criteria actually as well. And then here's in that paper, and it relates to what we read earlier how do you go from like quantitative continuous estimates in this case coming from perceptual updating of like that retina sensor?"
"Speaker 1","01;05;10;14","01;05;44;09","How do we how do we plug in from the continuous and mapped to categorical discrete selection of models? So mapping from continuous to continuous, you can just do like a dilation or some other function mapping, but it gets a little bit different when you want to map between these worlds of continuous and discrete. And it turns out that the way it works is that inference is performed within an infant, among a family of models, Bayesian models that are using parameters like quantitative difference and parameters to describe structural connections between variables."
"Speaker 1","01;05;44;27","01;06;13;10","So here's like let's just say that block is zero and Y is one. Then here's like all the combinations of linear models that were used to generate the different models. So this is the exhaustive frequentist approach. And then here what's happening is the Bayesian model is estimating the relevance of each of up to 20 parameters and then estimating a credible interval, which is 90% in this case, 90% of the time it's within this interval."
"Speaker 1","01;06;13;11","01;06;32;29","We think that's where it's likely to be under some value of stringency. That's the red blur. And then you prune the ones that are like not significantly different from zero. So it doesn't mean that they're not zero or they're not playing a role or the proteins don't touch, but it means that you can actually structurally simplify the relationship between variables."
"Speaker 1","01;06;33;13","01;06;58;07","So that's moving from continuous evidence about models of a discrete family to a reduced model that could potentially be extremely parsimonious. So that's just the Bayesian model reduction. But that's like I guess a sub component of this paper so wanting to know more about how it comes into play or if there's an analogous process on the generative way down."
"Speaker 1","01;06;59;03","01;07;01;21","OK, any thoughts on that or just that was one little?"
"Speaker 2","01;07;03;04","01;07;32;09","Well, I was just thinking, I mean, I'm not sure if I've got this potentially right, but I can see this brings in the idea of how action can be used to think like in creative abducted work. You know, you can start to actually create entropy or create confusions to create some possible outcomes. And the art of the creative process isn't necessarily the creation of random novel ideas."
"Speaker 2","01;07;32;09","01;07;52;17","It's being able to prune back. I think it comes a bit back to the idea that task related our focus. My wondering, you know, the ability to then go backwards and forwards and that might tie in with this ability here to do this. I I'm not sure, but it sounds like this would tie into that somehow."
"Speaker 1","01;07;53;06","01;08;21;00","Well, we'll ask the authors. OK, next onto the simulations. Also, people can just leave when they need to this section is going to provide the simulation results that show how the model described in the previous section and genders, opacity, transparency, phenomenology, so outputs the model that recapitulate some of the dynamics that have been described in other experiments. And then they're going to use that agent with a three layer generative model."
"Speaker 1","01;08;22;13","01;08;50;05","OK, so first was just the any OK, any thoughts on like what the simulation is or just to contextualize it before we talk more about it, OK, the code is available. It's a collab book. It's pretty cool and it makes a lot of the graphs so nice work for the authors. Maybe we can walk through it or ask about certain parts, but cool that it's an interactive notebook."
"Speaker 1","01;08;51;00","01;08;58;03","OK, anyone want to describe seven make sure."
"Speaker 3","01;08;58;04","01;09;18;17","Well, so here it says just the yellow part says in the first half of the trial the agent is in the focused state which confers a higher precision, i.e. the agent is generally more confident about how the observations map on states and the second half of the trial, the precision drops as the agent moves into the distracted state."
"Speaker 3","01;09;18;27","01;09;35;14","As a result, their beliefs about latent states are updated more slowly. So this is kind of like I wasn't really paying attention. Did I just see a car flash in front of me? I don't really know because I wasn't really paying attention. Whereas if you're focused on the screen and watching the car, do you see every flash and you know exactly when it flashed."
"Speaker 1","01;09;36;18","01;10;02;17","Nice way to put it blue. So the blue is what happened. It's like a tone, like a lower PC, even like a lower tone versus a higher tone that happens some frequency of the time. And then it is just this is an agent that's artificially held with a total focus date for the later half. At that, it just switches instantly and we're exploring how this is at the first level."
"Speaker 1","01;10;03;00","01;10;28;25","So to go back to figure five that's the perception is as the first level. And then that is an estimate that's changing through time. And so when it's focused, it's like higher highs and sharper and lower lows and then distracted. So it's just more like, wait, what stuff's more just spread out and it maybe has a different recovery or similar speed, but lower to rise."
"Speaker 1","01;10;29;16","01;11;00;21","So that's how they say that that's how they make their claims about the way that the attentional state influences anyone by making the likelihood mapping more or less informative because if it's uninformative likelihood mapping, then why does the sensory input matter go with your gut? But if it's very precise, you want to go with what your line guys are telling you, and that is reflecting in Fig. eight this phenomenological cycle."
"Speaker 1","01;11;00;21","01;11;32;03","So these can be discrete just via that mechanism of like the continuous to discrete estimation. And they write that this is the diagram of the phenomenological cycle that occurs during sustained attention tasks. The process cycles through being focused, becoming distracted, becoming aware of this distraction and then refocusing. So it's cool because it's like it looks like internal external states in a way, and action and then states like it's, it's a four, it's a ood odi loop or there's so many other fourfold models."
"Speaker 1","01;11;32;27","01;11;45;16","But what are we actually looking at here? We're looking at the dynamics of that attractor state as it wanders. So I feel like since both of you have thought about attention or awareness, maybe what did this look like or what does this mean to you?"
"Speaker 4","01;11;47;18","01;11;57;08","Do you think that we we attend through steps all the time. I know that for the simulation, they want to be able to see that in order to be able to do the calculations. But you think people do that."
"Speaker 3","01;11;59;24","01;12;24;17","So I think that the system focus too distracted is maybe not discrete. Like that might be like a like a more of a continuous transition, but definitely like as soon as I'm aware that I'm distracted, like the attention gets redirected. Like that is the awareness of distraction as a discrete, like bam, oh, and then the redirection of attention is, is also like I can replace it and then I'm focused again."
"Speaker 3","01;12;24;29","01;12;29;20","But then there's the transition. So it's just this top left corner where it's a little fuzzy for me."
"Speaker 1","01;12;30;20","01;13;02;06","I really agree with that blue like awareness of distraction to redirection of attention. That's like, you know, the eye of Mordor, it just go somewhere else, OK? But then the distracted to the awareness of distraction is actually that same, but it's the eye, the cognitive metacognitive eye of Mordor turning its eye on a lower level estimate. So I agree that actually this from from from noon to six, it looks it's pretty interesting how it maps, but then do we think about focus and distraction as part of a continuum of a single variable?"
"Speaker 1","01;13;02;18","01;13;22;16","Or is this like, yeah, is there can you wobble or is there like more dimensions to just being super strongly, obsessively doing something? How far do you pull back? What if you have to, you know, put down the first pen to pick up a different pen? You're pulling back from the goal, but you're moving towards it. So that's the kind of deep policy questions that are so cool."
"Speaker 1","01;13;22;18","01;13;23;16","We're raising blue."
"Speaker 3","01;13;24;09","01;13;49;11","Well. So it's cool because here it's this gamma function, right? So the gamma is the precision. And so just by changing the gamma and like you can change the gamma incrementally, however you want to change the gamma like 0.01.1. Oh001. And then by changing that gamma, you can really get that shift like computationally from focus to distracted by just by changing that precision metric."
"Speaker 1","01;13;50;08","01;14;16;05","Yep. And I mean, that's kind of imagine the little headband when people are paying attention and what do you do? So here I copy to the left side of I think five and then just laid it next to here. So these are the questions that again each layers asking the blue layers like the perception layer and related to the policy that's going to get those perceptions in line with preferences."
"Speaker 1","01;14;17;00","01;14;41;29","So moving the cart back and forth to be in the right amount of light. Then hidden mental states are about paying attention and then what influences the precision and emits a precision variable and an observable at a higher level, just like a sub one second level. Here's like a three and here is now the slow one, but it's happening actually at every time point."
"Speaker 1","01;14;42;29","01;15;10;26","So again, you can probably elaborate this in various ways and ask like how many times steps of action are calculated per attentional state? How many intentional states are calculated per metacognitive state? Are they all in the flow? It's so interesting. So here then they also put down the specific matrices. I assume the ones that we'll see in this collab notebook, these are just like the parameters."
"Speaker 1","01;15;10;26","01;15;35;21","They are going to illustrate some of the dynamics that are going to be interesting for the fields. But again, these are parameters that could be learned or updated or could reflect not just a two by two option all right. So maybe even copying this slide again here figure ten yes. OK, so here are the three layers of the model."
"Speaker 1","01;15;36;09","01;16;04;08","And so the bottom layer is playing the oddball paradigm. So it's like listening to like regular tones. And then once in every X percent there's a differential tone. But also that could be like which one of these security events is anomalous or which one of these trades would be effective amidst the prior that? 90% probably not. So it starts off focused and since all systems are normal on the sensory side and it gets distracted, it returns to being focused."
"Speaker 1","01;16;05;08","01;16;29;15","This is the true state at each level is the top. So the bottom layers, like the percept of the sound, this is the attention, this is the meta awareness. And then this you see at the change point from being distracted to focus, there's a switch point in the third level. So then everything's normal, the sensory level and then it's distracted and then the oddball happens at 21 or something."
"Speaker 1","01;16;30;01","01;17;15;17","And then that like flips it, it says flips it back into attention and then that continues and it stays in that state until an event happens. And so this is just simulating out the dynamics. But the idea with this kind of graph is that we can scan along and look at how changes in one level either are influencing each other statistically, causally within our model, not necessarily about the real world, but just literally causally because we specified it in our model and then do parameter fitting be like, Whoa, we can explain 95% of the variance in this behavioral dataset even though we didn't observe the red or the orange, we observed this or their task"
"Speaker 1","01;17;15;17","01;17;33;06","variability. But then we have enough data points from enough individuals and from time series of this individual events that start to add in some other measurements. And there's a lot of data to do inference on these higher order states about any comments on ten OK."
"Speaker 3","01;17;33;27","01;17;57;20","I'm just thinking so sorry. I'm just thinking about how this is going to be used like by companies to keep you working. Like, I just can't help but think about, about thinking about that. Like, are you paying attention now? You're not paying attention. Can we give you an oddball to make you pay attention? Like you're sitting at work and all of a sudden like, oh shit, I wasn't even paying attention."
"Speaker 3","01;17;57;20","01;18;04;05","So yeah, like that I think about that and it's kind of scary and it's kind of, I don't know, it's real."
"Speaker 4","01;18;05;04","01;18;28;26","I think blue. If people actually tried to do that, I think they would be more misinformed than they would be informed. As I said, for half a dozen years, I work with people who whose goal was to pull apart and sort of get a better understanding of this time on task piece. And they're no closer today to understanding it than they were a decade ago."
"Speaker 4","01;18;28;26","01;18;49;28","And they spent a lot of time on it because I don't know that this literally maps into an appreciation or understanding of what on task versus off task is. There's tangents to tasking. And I don't think that this really gives us a sense of what that is. I think the blue layer does speak to the unplanned level. I think that the middle layer does speak to transition."
"Speaker 4","01;18;50;06","01;19;03;25","And I think the talk of green and red does speak to plan well. But if people if that if somebody in an organization thinks that they're going to have a better sense of how they're going to determine whether a person was on task or not, I say good luck with that."
"Speaker 3","01;19;04;18","01;19;24;00","So I actually have a colleague that's developing a way to to determine if a person's in the flow state or not, which is a very different, very interesting like with physiological. So attentional is different, like are you paying attention versus are you are you in flow? And it's really interesting and they've got some some decent results so far."
"Speaker 4","01;19;24;10","01;19;44;14","Yeah, well, they can they can count the numbers. So Sackett is just the caddies. And I looked at the whole visual memory thing and all of that literature and it's still not it's still they're still not getting any closer to understanding when a person is on or off task because they want to break it down to that kind of a binary."
"Speaker 4","01;19;44;14","01;20;01;02","I say let them continue to let them to continue to do that because again, I'm not sure if it's nefarious, but I think it has the potential to become that. So I'd like them to go and spend all their time on it because they're not going to figure it out. Keep them distracted."
"Speaker 1","01;20;01;27","01;20;04;08","Odean laying down breadcrumbs."
"Speaker 4","01;20;04;26","01;20;05;15","I love it."
"Speaker 1","01;20;05;29","01;20;35;18","Carry on Figure nine is going to be that same cycle of four that we were talking about on eight. And now in addition to just the sort of qualitative label, we're going to map that on to the structure of the model that we were to discussing. So here, like the redirection of attention is being framed as a policy to apply at the second level."
"Speaker 1","01;20;36;12","01;21;24;23","So where is the action part? The second level is this orange one here on a figure five. So that is influencing what one is paying attention to through time. And then that is being mapped here. And similarly, you can read through and just work through the combinatorics here of what these mapped to from a dynamical systems perspective, like walls in a parameter neighborhood or regime or attractor states or manifolds that's in one area in a distracted state described by a wide range of continuous parameters that map on to the categorical distinction of the true state being distracted, but the perception being that one is focused just work through what these distinctions are is pretty interesting."
"Speaker 1","01;21;25;22","01;21;52;08","I yeah. Anything to I don't know. It's kind of cool. OK, 11 is going to be another kind of just like in seven, they had the attention at the second layer at one parameter level and then they just like turn down the dimmer in figure 11, they're going to have a high meta awareness and then turn down the dimmer to the low that awareness at the S3."
"Speaker 1","01;21;52;23","01;22;37;05","So recapitulating the way that they added this third layer to hospital, 20, 21, they're recapitulating figure seven in how they vary the parameters changing through time. But now you can see the dynamics are totally different, like the spiking between focus and distraction is actually happening faster during the period of fixed time at awareness. Whereas during the period of low meta awareness actually it's like there's longer intervals, it's like, well what just happens, I was having low matter awareness, the time just flew by or maybe there's another interpretation, but it's just a nice plot that gets at how just a parameter combination can give us insight into the structure of the model."
"Speaker 1","01;22;37;17","01;22;59;12","So we kind of have a graphical doorway to the programing doorway. And this is like the outcome oriented data science way because this is just input in a model, it's just in a machine learning notebook. It doesn't really even explicitly invoke the graphical structure that we just we've been talking about the whole time, but it is that embodied in a simulation all right, Dean."
"Speaker 4","01;23;01;02","01;23;14;20","No, I'm going to talk to the author tomorrow. Okay. So if it brings up the thing about is it moral, I guess. Yes. Yeah, I won't I won't bring up what I what I just talk about is the crosswalk analogy. I'm just going to leave it at that."
"Speaker 1","01;23;16;09","01;23;47;15","I can see you being a great crosswalk guard you way. So figure 12. This is kind of B+ figure. I thought this was an awesome figure. And one I know that will return to many times a based graph of a deep generative model of mental action, generalized over all precision parameters so now that attentional state, the likelihood mapping is going from a potentially binary state like we saw here, focused or not."
"Speaker 1","01;23;47;15","01;24;16;01","I mean, yeah, the likelihood mapping kind of like the Dark Side of the Moon album cover can emit like five simultaneous outputs. It can output a tuple or a vector from a computational prospector perspective, and it can output what we talked about here, but it can also emit an uncertainty and potentially even other things connecting to multiple of these lower level parameters."
"Speaker 1","01;24;16;20","01;24;38;03","So now there can be an uncertainty over the priors, whereas in the previous simulations, D just stood alone and there wasn't uncertainty around it. So just sort of taking the next step and just being like, OK, if we went from estimating the valence with the actual like plus or minus, are things going better or worse than expected? And we just said, OK, what's the sister of Valence Reward?"
"Speaker 1","01;24;38;09","01;25;15;10","The sister is the uncertainty and the precision and their relationship. So now this paper, that's why it builds on has 20, 21 because it fills in the other complement there which is the precision modulation by higher level states rather than the valence modulation by higher level states. How well are things going. And then that insight to generalize into the variation and from a top down level has strong precedent in Bayesian modeling where it's related to like the parametric empirical Bayes and hierarchical Bayes so big lot of philosophical questions about what a parameter means, challenges and influencing it."
"Speaker 1","01;25;15;10","01;25;46;29","But this is relatively generalizing step in the publications oh yeah, exactly that. It's the same higher level affective states applied likelihood precision rather than model precision and then note that this evidence is only available when higher level likelihood precisions is non-zero, i.e. when the state is opaque to some degree. As a result, the transparency opacity distinction can be directly related to the evidence calculation."
"Speaker 1","01;25;48;21","01;26;09;13","So what does that mean or just interesting? Like we don't notice something that we do, so it's kind of gets transparent and then it becomes opaque and then we observe it. In this model, it puts us over a threshold of observation that takes us off task as defined by policy. OK, onto the implications and bigger questions. So Blue, go for it."
"Speaker 3","01;26;09;28","01;26;35;19","Well, so just to last point, like I wonder if, you know, have you ever felt so focused? You're distracted? Like that's that's a common thing. For me and maybe it's focused on the wrong task. But but it's also like you're focused to the exclusion of everything else. So I just wonder how that goes into this transparency, opacity like gradients maybe."
"Speaker 3","01;26;35;23","01;26;46;19","So. So anyway, and then yeah, onto implications and bigger questions so I think about. Oh, sorry, go ahead. Did you have something some response to oh."
"Speaker 1","01;26;48;12","01;26;48;26","Go for blue."
"Speaker 3","01;26;50;10","01;27;23;18","So yeah, so implications and bigger questions. So here like when so I obviously got one during this discussion about being so focused that you're that you're not paying attention. But also if we're talking about adding hierarchical levels so I wonder about here beyond meta awareness, I wonder about collective consciousness. Like so is there, you know, when you realize that you're part of a collective and then when the collective develops some kind of meta consciousness like so so it makes me think about, about that and about maybe how to model something like that."
"Speaker 3","01;27;24;00","01;27;51;29","Maybe an answer, for example, because there's there's the individual level and then there's definitely like the society structural level, the consciousness of the colony maybe. I mean also, you know, stimulation theory, like so. So at what level, like becoming aware that we're in a simulation? Like, like, where does that fit into the hierarchical nesting of this deep you know, meta awareness funny stuff."
"Speaker 1","01;27;52;02","01;27;59;25","I would have thought that that's where we would get, you know, but that's kind of what it has come to. Any thoughts on at the end before we go to the next slide?"
"Speaker 4","01;28;00;09","01;28;09;16","No, I think it ties in nicely with the what do we mean in a cognitive metacognitive is over and I'm going to bring up the crosswalk tomorrow."
"Speaker 1","01;28;09;24","01;28;39;25","Yep. So this future of phenomenology slash neuro phenomenology, just whatever we want to call it, here's just a few angles on what is slash has and will happened. There's multi-modal brain measurements on SPM, where are they staying? But just it lays out in 2007 and earlier but in that textbook and in the online documentation, kind of generalized frameworks for harmonizing across different modalities of neuroimaging behavioral imaging hidden state modeling."
"Speaker 1","01;28;40;08","01;29;09;06","So a lot of the seeds are in SPM what we can talk about integrating now other than that in a laboratory setting like EEG and at the same time together, but increasingly, you know, even at home, physiological sensors, wearables, cameras and environmental sensors, the capacity for models that involve multiple humans and finding the synchronize and attunement among them under environmental changes."
"Speaker 1","01;29;09;16","01;29;31;16","And this is like the work of hyper scanning and MDMA and other a lot of other people in that field thinking about cyber physical systems like what if the state is inside the head purportedly of a human is that different than if this state is purportedly inside of a software which ones get to be affect which ones get to be what standing and then also it helps us and always is important."
"Speaker 1","01;29;31;16","01;29;54;29","Maybe you'll go here with who and why and how, Dean but really just all these axes that phenomenology has been addressed from developmental multicultural neurodiversity, a lot of historical perspectives that also is continuing to weave together and not being said to be obsolete or simplified by a computational model."
"Speaker 4","01;29;59;12","01;30;05;29","Yeah. You want no more phenomenology gone? Read some Sean Gallagher nice."
"Speaker 1","01;30;05;29","01;30;08;04","Dunno about that, but it sounds cool there. Nice."
"Speaker 4","01;30;08;19","01;30;08;28","Yeah."
"Speaker 1","01;30;09;21","01;30;41;22","Anything there or lost? OK then. Here is just one paper that kind of came out on a closing note, like how it connects out maybe to other areas. This was looking at behaviors across a bunch of different fruit fly species, drosophila, and then here's the big figure or one of them kind of mapping just like you might map genes being correlated or might map neural activations to be correlated across different regions of the brain."
"Speaker 1","01;30;42;11","01;31;16;13","Those same matrix methods, tensor methods, fundamentally covariance estimation can be used to study different kinds of relationships. So earlier we saw like the neural activity in the behavior here, the heatmap is like behavior to behavior. They're looking for pure behavioral co variation. But then what's really cool about this paper is that they use several techniques from information theory, which we see all the time in FIP information, thermo cool going that way, but then also puts it explicitly in a comparative evolutionary framework."
"Speaker 1","01;31;17;07","01;32;01;11","So this is really moving towards models that can just very seamlessly integrate different kinds of data as easy as integrating the same kind of data, just the matrix, this type AF data by type of data rather than type by type A. So these kinds of models that cross data input types need to be connected to broader traditions like thinking about development, ecology, evolution, and it's just also interesting how these fields, which are increasingly data rich, are going to be using different cutting edge theoretical frameworks so that just one closing thought about where's evolution in this, where's developments, where is what are we doing?"
"Speaker 1","01;32;01;11","01;32;15;21","All these components that discussion elicits. So any last thoughts otherwise thanks blue and Stephen and Dean because this was fun to work on and I think we all got to learn a lot here."
"Speaker 3","01;32;17;16","01;32;21;21","Yeah so more tomorrow."
"Speaker 1","01;32;21;28","01;32;34;14","Yep I know I know it's only if we've just been so not on topic OK. All right. Thank you again. Thanks everyone for watching piece out by."
