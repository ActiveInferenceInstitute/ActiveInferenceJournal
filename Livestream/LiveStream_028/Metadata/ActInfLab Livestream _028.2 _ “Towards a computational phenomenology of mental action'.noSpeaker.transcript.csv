"Unknown","00;00;07;12","00;00;36;23","Hello and welcome everyone to the Active Inference Lab. This is Active Lab Livestream number 28.2 on September 14th. 2021. And we're going to be having our two follow up discussion on the paper towards a computational phenomenology of mental action modeling, meta awareness and attentional control with deep parametric active inference. Welcome to the Active Inference Lab. We are participatory online lab."
"Unknown","00;00;36;27","00;01;03;19","That means you can participate. That is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at the links here on this slide this is recorded at an archived live stream. So please provide us with feedback so that we can be improving our work all backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here. We'll be following good etiquette for live streams and see who joins in at this short link."
"Unknown","00;01;03;26","00;01;33;02","You can find the calendar of events for 2021 as well as all the other kinds of streams that we do related to kind of wild card guest streams and the more technically oriented model streams and math streams. And we have some preliminary decisions for what we'll read in 29 today though we're here to continue the discussion on tape paper which is the towards a computational phenomenology of mental action paper."
"Unknown","00;01;33;19","00;02;17;10","And again we'll see who joins and see where we go. I wrote down a few comments and questions, but I know that there's many ways it can go and of course everybody who's watching live definitely leave us questions and comments and we can address them on the stream everyone's participating. Who's here at this time? We can start with just some introductions and warm ups since there's only a few of us, we can say hi and reminisce on what brought us to this paper or even where we'd like to go for the dot to where we jumping off from or too as we're in that kind of the middle of the gangplank, the middle of the"
"Unknown","00;02;17;10","00;02;51;17","diving board. So I'm Daniel and I'm a researcher in California, and I think today I wrote down the pieces that I wanted to, if not resolve, just at least explore a little bit. And it had to do with annotating that generalized model of mental action and seeing if we could find words in a language or scenarios or exercises, thought experiments, find some tangible ways to interact with these different aspects of uncertainty."
"Unknown","00;02;52;02","00;03;19;28","And then on a more theoretical note, ask how are those maybe related to neurological function or certain kinds of measurements that are made in the laboratory? But just at the experiential level, are there cases where we actually can get in touch with some of these different qualitatively different kinds of uncertainty so either Dean or Steve. Go ahead, Stephen and Andy."
"Unknown","00;03;21;17","00;03;51;24","Yeah, yeah. Good morning from Toronto. Yeah, I'm interested to sort of pursue what we're talking about in the last session and I'm very interested in the fact that I'm a bit like him to some extent, process orientated psychology by the ENDOWS, which comes out of some work around information theory in the seventies, this idea of really getting into the process from within and the phenomenology."
"Unknown","00;03;51;24","00;04;19;23","So this, this, this paper starts to look at giving actual models or at least a heuristic as well for thinking about how we phenomenology can be doing stuff from the inside. And for me that's exciting because psychology can be kind of limiting because it's always this external or modeling of people which then sort of but how can we get and look at some of the structures of how we operate at some level."
"Unknown","00;04;19;27","00;04;51;08","So this, this is cool. I think this is the first one of the first papers that really gets into that phenomenology beyond a philosophical point of view and starts to sort of give a few handles on it. And that's where I'm interested. So I'm going to pass this over if it's OK. Dean. OK, morning. My name's Dean. I'm in Calgary and a few years back I read a book by a Lost Four by the name of Douglas Hofstadter it's called A Strange Loop."
"Unknown","00;04;52;06","00;05;35;06","And yeah, sort of trying to put some sort of a context on when I read that book and then this paper Hostetter doesn't really get into the the perception of I'm aware of planning to make a plan because I can think about my thinking so a lot of this plan, policy of attention and then all of the math that supports that and then he sort of doesn't really get into and then what I attend to tells me what I'm losing focus on, which is what this paper also talks to so again, I'm just trying to try to put these two ideas side by edge."
"Unknown","00;05;35;20","00;06;02;05","And without saying either one of them is more correct. I think they're very compliment free. So yeah, that's where I kind of was looking at this and saying, this is really interesting. So yeah, that's right. I'm kind of coming at this from so on. The Hofstadter, the strange loop and the give me some works that I really love as well as Mind's Eye with Debit."
"Unknown","00;06;02;26","00;06;38;20","Yeah, it does seem like his focus is on how symbols are computed upon, which makes sense given his kind of computational focus. And so we've talked a lot about how syntax and semantic layers can be seen within active inference, and that doesn't have phenomenology in the picture at all. And that's why the sort of question about how computers interpret syntax and how that becomes semantics is orthogonal."
"Unknown","00;06;38;27","00;07;03;00","It's kind of you could take one take on another whether computers have experience or not. Like you don't need to think that computers are having an experience or not to ask how a programing language is compiled or interpreted. So there's sort of that two by two with how meaning is made in a computational sense. And then how our meaning is made and experienced."
"Unknown","00;07;03;29","00;07;58;18","So that's definitely an interesting piece and Stephen, you wrote like From the inside, what do you think differentiated this approach rather than the theoretical or the philosophical and what does it look like for an academic work or for a work of research to not just be theoretical or philosophical Yeah, this is a good question. Well, the I suppose having sort of mechanisms and identifiable relationships between aspects of experience, i.e. thinking about thinking and our sense of accuracy in our predictions and things like that gives a way for stuff to relate to each other."
"Unknown","00;07;58;18","00;08;30;01","Otherwise, it tends to be one thread of that. So be it consciousness. Be aware ness, be that one thread then can be mused about and we could get quite an interesting philosophical explanation of what it is. The thing is though, that you can't really process that or try to emulate the process of that on its own. There needs to be something else that is somehow Like you say, the body, what's the body?"
"Unknown","00;08;30;01","00;08;57;07","You know, some sort of sensory feelings, some sort of sense of predictions about something else. And normally that seems to be where things fall down a bit, ends up going off to the neuroscience world. And again, which is great but still ends up being a kind of a model of the brain, right? So you in this neuro phenomenology world where it's kind of explained in phenomenology but through the brain."
"Unknown","00;08;57;07","00;09;33;12","But again, I can't the brain has got no feelings inside it, you know, so you can't be your brain. I think we think we can because we have all these pictures of brains as if they are people. But so I think it's interesting questions. I don't really quite thought about it this way, but I think there's something about having different aspects of our phenomenological being able to meaningfully relate and not end up being kind of a deep explanation of one strand."
"Unknown","00;09;33;16","00;10;00;29","I don't know if that makes sense. It also makes me think about in Hofstadter Girl Astrobiology Web, one of the main strange attractors is the Turing Test. So that's the question about how you can identify on the other side of the blanket, some other system in another room. How do you know whether it's a human or whether it's a computer or whether it's aware or not?"
"Unknown","00;10;01;11","00;10;26;00","So there's been all kinds of thought on that, and it's almost like what happens when you take that as a fundamental unknowable? How do we respect what's on the other side of the wall and maybe even give it an affective parameter while recognizing that we have the same and we're experiencing it, but we're never going to be able to experience what's on the other side of the wall."
"Unknown","00;10;26;09","00;10;49;16","We're going to be only able to experience our interactions with what's coming across. And I think that's why Hofstadter and Dennett worked well together, because Dennett, with the intentional stance, is kind of like saying, it's simple. It doesn't really matter if you're playing chess. It doesn't matter if you're playing somebody who's human or a supercomputer or something. It's about what's on the board."
"Unknown","00;10;49;28","00;11;07;08","And in a way that's kind of like the way that we're addressing. It's about the sensory input coming in and how we're modeling the external states. So if it's in the other room, the Turing test is on the outside of our blanket. We're experiencing what's inside, and that could be an illusion, or it could be super real or all."
"Unknown","00;11;07;08","00;11;38;03","It's real depending on again, which philosophy you decide to lean towards. But the question about how we interpret in experience our own parameter ization of these models is really secondary from the implications of what's on the other side of the veil. Stephen Yeah, that's a really useful lens to bring to play actually. And actually the game brings us back out maybe so that we're not suddenly focused only on the individual isolated from the world."
"Unknown","00;11;38;22","00;12;06;29","But one thing that I think is really interesting with that is with active influence, there's this what an active influence you're going to go down that route is. You know, you have them, you know, with your body. So ultimately the active agent can check in and I think what you just saying, there is one thing that I would know over a period of time if something was alive is if they had to reflect on some aspects of our discourse, OK?"
"Unknown","00;12;08;03","00;12;30;17","And it was something which neither I could know or they could know. I but when they checked in with themselves, they came up with an answer which I could find plausible. That makes sense. So there's no way that you you know, you know, there's those things are what you feel about this. Well, I and then you come up with something and he's like, we there's a knowing that you come up with."
"Unknown","00;12;30;17","00;12;58;25","Right. But that wasn't in your semantic lexicon of preprogramed stuff. You're able to check in somehow. And that's the sort of thing an artificial machine can't do unless it can check into some some way of knowing. Because if it wasn't known before, how could it have ever been programed into the supercomputer? So this kind of interesting it comes up in this paper with a question about transparency and opacity."
"Unknown","00;12;59;09","00;13;26;04","So again, the kind of what is water transparent states are the ones that you see right through. So you actually don't perceive them directly like air. And then the opaque states are the ones kind of like, you know, the map, black wall you can see it really well. And so this question about how a prompt can almost like a phase transition move something from being transparent to opaque, like how does your leg feel right now?"
"Unknown","00;13;26;28","00;13;57;02","And it moves it from being a transparent state, potentially one that attention is not being paid to to an opaque state, which is something that attention is being paid to. That's one of the major contributions of this paper, which is to take Messenger's framework of transparent and opaque states as applied to phenomenology and bring that into the affective framework developed by Hespe at all for the deep parametric active inference."
"Unknown","00;13;57;15","00;14;13;19","So it is like these multiple threads coming together and then it's just so appropriate that attention is kind of the thread that links it. And precision and awareness are kind of coming together in new ways yeah. Yeah."
"Unknown","00;14;15;28","00;14;27;17","The two things I wrote down and of course anyone watching live definitely ask random questions no off topic questions, no such thing exist. Not, not forbidding such questions."
"Unknown","00;14;30;03","00;14;56;03","So one thing as kind of addressed earlier was I thought it'd be fun to annotate figure 12 a bit and explore some of these qualitatively different forms of uncertainty and but maybe a lead in topic again, anyone can just feel differently or ask a question a leading topic was like, how do we think about uncertainty? Greetings fellow sir."
"Unknown","00;14;56;18","00;15;32;06","Blue gits or uncertainty in remote work. Just how often when you send a message you don't get that instantaneous feedback that you would in a video conversation or in an in-person conversation because the time lag is very different. So it's almost like you're left hanging with the uncertainty, or you have to come to a new way of understanding your uncertainty because you're not or you're expecting not to hear from them."
"Unknown","00;15;32;06","00;16;04;08","Oh, I know that they're on the other side of the world, so I'm expecting not to hear from them for the next hours. Just I wondered what sorts of these personal level uncertainties applied to the remote case and then thinking about the remote team as its own active inference entity, are there uncertainties that exist for located or remote teams that don't necessarily find themselves simply explained by personal level affect?"
"Unknown","00;16;04;25","00;16;40;15","Are the things that teams are uncertain about that people are certain about, like a hung jury or a split election or decision? Are there things that people are uncertain about but that groups can be quite certain about you yeah, but that's just things that we can just return to in any time now. Just got my package through for my mum for baby clothes from England."
"Unknown","00;16;40;15","00;16;43;11","So I'm back. Nice, nice."
"Unknown","00;16;48;23","00;17;20;20","Blue wants to say something. Yes, Blue yes. So just to that point, I mean, I think that that's like the, the kind of like lifeline or ask the audience like in the, you know, when you have uncertainty about a question, I mean, an individual can be uncertain, but the cloud can have some certainty and it doesn't there's something about guessing the weight of a bison or some story like that, like where, you know, the I think it was the median value was exactly the weight of the bison, like from this entire divergent crowd."
"Unknown","00;17;21;08","00;18;01;24","I'm not sure the exact I don't remember the exact story. It's just kind of thing to my memory. But I mean, I think that definitely the the crowd knows what the individual can't maybe there's many. Oh, yeah. Stephen, go for it. Yeah. Yeah, that's an interesting one. And you mentioned in and also, I suppose there's this question, well, let's say we take, you know, Bayesian statistics, you know, if it's a distributed sense of something, well, so when you've got a very large number, there may be this distributed sense, which is if people have got a feel for it, I mean, I suppose it assumes that there's not complete noise, that the people have got some"
"Unknown","00;18;01;24","00;18;41;15","kind of idea, that group, that there's some knowing. But in a team and stuff there is this question and this may be really what types of things we're evaluating is with a team or a group because teams tend to have a particular teleology if we're trying to get a handle on something into subjective, I mean, a classic case would this would be say in a marketing agency or something like that, or with a film, you know, you might want to get a sense of you might get market research, but you also want the creative team might get a sense of what is you know, what's, what's, how is this going to land?"
"Unknown","00;18;41;21","00;19;08;25","You know, what's and that might be an integrated thing and it might be you have a creative director that is pushing out their one vision because they're trying to be novel. They're trying to give something that breaks the group expectations however, you also then want to stay within I mean, a classic one would be like Ricky Gervais was before the when he did his what was it?"
"Unknown","00;19;08;25","00;19;34;08","The It's not the Oscars, but he did the other one, the glowing Golden Globes. At some point, he he had to kind of wait what he could get away with. Right so there would have been a whole load of people sort of seen how that could get tweaked and nudged so that it basically fits on that very near edge and that's you know, that that would tie quite well with the fact that you need to have more."
"Unknown","00;19;34;20","00;20;02;25","You can't it's not just multi-sensory integration on one person. That's enough. You might need multi intersubjective awareness integration to get a better sort of integration. Right. You need to know how others thinking through other minds or theory of mind. You need to kind of have an estimate of how others will feel about your stimuli from an affective dimension and blue."
"Unknown","00;20;02;25","00;20;34;14","I think the example with orcs and guessing the weight, it's Francis Galton, Sir Francis Galton perhaps. And I just looked it up, it was 787 fairgoers who predicted the weight of this animal and that the average was extremely close, even though of course many individuals probably were over or under by vast margins and it ties this back to the strange loop and Aunt Hillary, the ant colony in GB."
"Unknown","00;20;35;07","00;21;03;01","And when does collective decision making work? Collective decision making among cortical neurons, it seems to work pretty well. That's kind of what evolution has shaped. Why did it work for predicting the weight of that ox? Well, potentially many people were familiar with how much animals weighed. Another answer is that it was within an order of magnitude. Like you could probably say, well, it's probably about £100 and it's probably not £10,000."
"Unknown","00;21;03;19","00;21;36;26","So when there's balance to the estimate rather than it being distributed over like many orders of magnitude, there's a case for the average being something that can be taken and that actually has analogy to a lot of these mean seeking distributional techniques that we utilize, like the case where the actual distribution might be very rough, but we use variational techniques that can pursue, for example, the mean of the distribution and just set the weight of our distribution that we control."
"Unknown","00;21;36;26","00;22;17;20","Q And sit with only one or a few parameters right over the bulk of the distribution rather than getting into the 100 parameters that might describe the actual underlying distribution. And so it's like under what cases can distributions be well approximated by their mean and by many independent estimates? And under what cases might you be looking, just like Steven said, with a marketing agent trying to be creative or novel under what cases are you actually looking not to estimate the mean, but rather to propose a counterfactual or to make something that is going to succeed by virtue of its novelty?"
"Unknown","00;22;18;21","00;22;46;14","See the yeah. No, it takes you into this world of the of the rural community. I don't know if it's rural America, you know, they will have their wisdom about those types of things. They're fairgoers. They they probably got quite an insight into animals. You know, they I bet you could get a pretty good idea of how slippery it would be to try and grab hold of that baby hog, you know, in a way that the city folks wouldn't have a clue."
"Unknown","00;22;46;19","00;23;25;18","So it's this kind of contextual social view, like now in quiet, you know, that I think that's a good thing to to bring in as well. When we think about participation, you know, this notion that can be in different communities outside of the the cities, which, you know, and the advertising agencies and these dominating kind of media sort of leaders of Thor, I think it shows how we need to be able to bring in these more disparate ways of experiencing the world."
"Unknown","00;23;27;09","00;23;49;26","Well, when it's seen that there's a mean or an average like there was the famous like an average American survey or something like the dimensions of the average person, but then like no single person was within a tolerable limit of that average. Yet there was an approximation versus casting it into the experience. Like how will this be received by different people?"
"Unknown","00;23;50;06","00;24;16;04","It includes in the question the need to think through other minds and that no one was thinking through the animal when they had to predict the weight. That's that external, the third person psychology, and it was estimating a physical attribute. So it's not like they were trying to do anything different. But now if you asked on a scale of one to ten, how do we estimate how happy this animal is?"
"Unknown","00;24;16;27","00;24;37;05","The variance around that estimate is going to be a very different kind and potentially an irreducible kind. We're not just looking for a point estimate to converge on. Maybe there's differences in opinion, and that is something that would be revealed through that question. Whereas if you're wrong about the weight, it's just because maybe you're not used to it or something like that."
"Unknown","00;24;37;17","00;25;13;13","Stephen Yeah, yeah. That's a good that's a good point to bring in as well is when looking and say also we maybe would want to bring in this Bayesian inference as well. Like if you could have multiple rounds, you know, like with calories and some of the demonstrations, it would be interesting I to be able to have some way of looking at something and using multiple iterative rounds, which they do in a lot of processes like future search and other kind of group participatory processes and also though to break apart the generative models at play."
"Unknown","00;25;13;20","00;25;41;19","So and this is this is the challenge is with a lot of things is with normal statistics you'll get an answer, you'll get a graph if you just take all the numbers and divide by X, right? And then so someone's now got research results. But the thing is, like you say, it makes a difference if you've got three models, two models, five models, one model going on of the reality that they're trying to in theory that that the weight of the cow, there's probably one model."
"Unknown","00;25;41;19","00;26;10;21","There might be a couple of different ways of trying to think about how to go to that model. But, you know, this is sort of a fairly clear proposition. But if you do have more than one generative model or one contextual engagement that's been used, he's in the out and then having a way to iteratively do Bayesian inference and active inference on each of those models so they can be teased apart would look like it be a useful thing."
"Unknown","00;26;11;29","00;26;55;27","Cool. Dean. Yeah. I just can say to Stephen's point, there's a book called The End of Average by Todd Rose that speaks to those times when finding the mean doesn't really work. And you do have to kind of pull that generative model apart so if you're if you're interested in that, there's there's a great reference thanks. Ding. And then this idea of updating, it's almost like we have a vertical updating, which we're going to look at when we look at the deep parametric model, it's an updating within the agent, within the system, passing up and down, top, top down, bottom up."
"Unknown","00;26;56;01","00;27;21;15","But it's an updating inside of the agent versus the updating laterally or across the ensemble of similar agents. Like imagine if the people, instead of putting their weight estimate for the for the ox into a box, they actually talked about it. There's cases where you could imagine that would actually make a worse estimate. Like a really persuasive person is convinced they have high precision about their estimate."
"Unknown","00;27;22;04","00;27;51;19","They're wrong but they have high precision. And then in that case, it's possible for them to shape group outcomes like a more stubborn peg whereas there's other cases where when maybe it's less important to be precise on a point estimate but like to brainstorm maybe sharing ideas early on helps increase that temperature and updates people's models in a way where just having them in separate lanes and then coming together to converge at the end."
"Unknown","00;27;51;19","00;28;32;03","It's it's too late for those ideas to be meaningfully compared because they're of such different type. Whereas again, if everybody is constrained to we're fitting something about weight only then maybe it's ok to combine them later on in the process. Blue So I was trying to put the paper just now, but I think that they've looked at that actually like when you have really strong conviction about your beliefs or ideas, they look at the how information is spread in networks and really like those people that are very strong in conviction they like contaminate their neighbors in the graph essentially."
"Unknown","00;28;32;11","00;28;56;03","So it's really neat to kind of see this like information propagation and how it really does start with the people with the strongest convictions it's almost like, yeah, yes, people are spreading information based upon a few things, but up there on the list would be how precise they are about it and also how they want to be seen."
"Unknown","00;28;56;17","00;29;17;05","So both of those are like first and second level estimates of precision about one's self metacognition I won't raise my hand if I'm not totally sure or you know, I'm watching a live stream, but I'm not sure if this is a good question to ask. Hint it is, but then you don't know. So you don't make the action versus how will even other people perceive it."
"Unknown","00;29;18;04","00;29;46;12","That was probably less important in an anonymous guess about weights but as we talk about issues that are increasingly social, those become the drivers. Maybe 90% of people in a room or in a country feel a certain way, but it still isn't perceived as something that's OK to share. Stephen Yeah. This also ties into when a lot of context, there's actually a mediator chap who's a mediator."
"Unknown","00;29;46;12","00;30;17;17","He had a really good quote. He actually came up with it was saying how process both conscious and unconscious, implicit and explicit has a greater impact on outcomes than substance, i.e. so if you can bring people together like we're saying, then they're going to try and work together. Being able to the process through which people interact can have a bigger impact on the outcome than the substance, partly because of exactly what blue was saying."
"Unknown","00;30;18;03","00;30;41;14","And you were saying, you know, around whether someone becomes a dominant voice, whether certain information, if it all becomes about the substance, it's very easy to get trapped in this who's right, who's wrong? Well, if in this instance, we're trying to get a different handle on things or to try and get a an active influence, we need that process to be given a chance."
"Unknown","00;30;42;14","00;31;07;12","So I think that's quite a nice actually, we had a good conversation yesterday with a Gary Kirkham. Actually, that's a lot of devices to work through sort of interesting processes where they mix different artists and one thing there is when they go into the action space of exploring, they would have the director watching or the they have like a device there to play right watch watching."
"Unknown","00;31;07;29","00;31;27;14","And in some ways the people who are in it, they just are totally immersed in it. They can't really reflect on where they are at that moment. It's just in there and there's all this information and the people on the outside are watching and you could say, I suppose they're actively inferring or what might be easy to say this Bayesian integration and waiting."
"Unknown","00;31;27;19","00;31;53;01","And then afterwards they will be told what works, what didn't work, and then they can bring that to their conscious awareness and maybe bring that in again with some. But that process in a way needed to be just a live in process and not to cognitive for the person to give good quality, fuzzy information. So two things there."
"Unknown","00;31;54;02","00;32;19;15","First is what do we say about active inference? It's a process theory. It's a corollary of free energy principle, and it probably draws on many other domains as well, but it's a process theory, it's not a state theory. And in the Elias 2018 interview, first it talks about process versus state. So that's a lot like this process versus substance you derived these are a set of patterns for how systems update."
"Unknown","00;32;20;10","00;32;44;26","And so it is about the process of active inferencing, which I hear people using sometimes, which even differentiates it even more from being just a static substance theory. Like it's a static theory about active entities. It's like kind of, but it's actually a dynamic theory about static and dynamic entities because you could have an active inference agent that is just a thermometer."
"Unknown","00;32;45;01","00;33;12;02","So its affordances are nil, they can't act, but we can still put it within this Bayesian Graph framework. It doesn't need to be far from equilibrium, it doesn't need to be intelligent, it doesn't need to be actively foraging for information. We know the model can go all those places, but it's almost like with the process theory, you can explain active and passive processes, whereas with a substance theory you're able to explain static things pretty well."
"Unknown","00;33;12;11","00;33;38;25","But then there's always this question about using the static theories to apply to dynamic systems, and then also to connect to the first piece of what you said and to return to maybe some of the threads in this paper. You talked about how that was a mediator. And so mediation can look like so many things from diplomacy, negotiation, maybe even marketing like you raised earlier."
"Unknown","00;33;39;04","00;34;27;23","But mediator sounds a lot like meditation like the mediation is like we're we're not just going to make a call and then you're going to live with it. It's like we're going to mediate. Now what are we mediating when we meditate, are we mediating our thoughts? And these kind of mindfulness cues that Lars was providing last week like putting the distance between oneself and their thoughts in a way, it's like being a meta mediator or somehow mediating lower level cognitive processes through the process, not the substance that we call meditation blue so maybe like, what are we meeting mediating in meditation?"
"Unknown","00;34;27;23","00;34;56;19","That's like a super interesting question. And I wonder if it's you know, like the information transmission in the brain or maybe propagation or like the ongoing, like wandering mental wandering maybe. So there's, you know, if, if essentially meditation cuts that information transmission, right? So, so when you just are like letting go, let go of the thought, right? Like the thought has just let go so that the thought doesn't keep wandering around."
"Unknown","00;34;56;19","00;35;12;09","And I wonder if the thought spreads like I don't know. I mean, I know my background no science, but I don't know enough about or maybe no one knows enough about the brain and functionality to know like does a thought propagate like from one region of the brain to another region? Of the brain, like stimulate a new thought, right?"
"Unknown","00;35;12;09","00;35;54;15","Like and is that how like mental wandering maybe works? I mean, I don't know. I mean, it's just it's just hypothetical. But but maybe we're cutting that information transmission process off when we're mediating through meditation Stephen. Yeah, it's interesting. I thought blue about is actually funny because just watching this video and process orientated psychology and it was talking about moving between modalities, you know, like, you know, it could be, you know, I have a thought having seen something and then maybe it processes into how I hear it and how I see it, how I color it, you know, like it could be, you know, this, it could be interesting how the different sensory modalities these"
"Unknown","00;35;54;15","00;36;22;10","could, you know, could hold a thought for a period of time and then pass it back again because synesthesia obviously is an interesting one on that. And I've just seen an interesting paper, actually, that talks about how the vows, i.e. a whole they mapped out four colors and they find that there's like a color map for how people see and that maps across Swedish and English."
"Unknown","00;36;22;10","00;36;50;24","I think it was Swedish and English so that's interesting as well that there could be, you know, these subconscious, colorless things. Stephen Blue yeah. So I mean, I really don't know that we know enough about a thought and like this reminds me of our guestroom with Shana Dodson. Like, what is the fundamental unit of a thought? Right. And and so I know in a biological sense, like the fundamental unit of a thought really kind of has to be the action potential."
"Unknown","00;36;50;24","00;37;13;00","But like is it one action potential? Is it like some critical number of action potentials that instantiates a thought? So I don't know. And definitely like there is that that propagation or like a spreading some contagion maybe to like other brain regions in synesthesia. I think that that's been pretty well established like that. There's like some crossover wires."
"Unknown","00;37;13;00","00;37;32;11","And so like you get auditory perception, for example, in the visual cortex. And so I know that there's that relationship. So that kind of does like lend itself to this idea of like the thought propagating through different areas of the brain that but that's in a very incorrect sense. I just wonder even in normal people, does a thought like what is the thought?"
"Unknown","00;37;32;11","00;37;53;07","How many actual potentials make up a thought? And then does that can that move around like within a region or to different regions? Is that actually what's happening? I mean, I don't know that we can quantify that at all, but it's just it's interesting to think about not to always come back to Aunt Hillary, the ant colony in GEB, but that's the analogy that Hofstadter makes."
"Unknown","00;37;53;07","00;38;24;09","It's as if ensembles of neurons are transiently activated, and even for the same word, it's a different ensemble of neurons, which is increasingly what molecular neuroscience is showing to be the case. And similarly with the ant colony, it's like the task group is assembling and disassembling and reorganizing the idea of a thought is still that noun centric approach which would lend us to want to find a static representation versus like a thinking unit or something that reminds us that it's a process."
"Unknown","00;38;24;17","00;38;52;23","The thinking is a process. So one comment and then a nice question in the chat about the mediator and then meditation. So let's go to figure five, which is again one of the main contributions of the paper so it's this three level nested structure and the outputs of one level influence a lower or an interior of nested model."
"Unknown","00;38;52;26","00;39;28;27","So on the bottom in blue is the perceptive states, like what am I perceiving? Is it light or dark the second level is the attentional layer. So contrast this with, for example, lstm or other types of attention based neural network architectures which are not based upon first principles per se. And then what this paper adds in is not just the affective components, but actually this precision of how aware am I of where my attention is."
"Unknown","00;39;29;11","00;39;57;29","So then thinking about the mediation and meditation, I thought, well, one mediation that might be happening in active inference is the mediation between epistemic and pragmatic goals. So that's kind of like a seesaw. And there's some sort of negotiation happening with free energy minimization that is balancing. It's mediating these two goals. When the two goals are perfectly aligned, great, then it's like we agree."
"Unknown","00;39;58;16","00;40;20;06","But when they don't perfectly align, when the pragmatic goal just wants to run up the mountain, and then the epistemic goal wants to ask, should we look around and see if there's another way that might be better in the long run? Yeah. Can we go around? Exactly. Dean Solenoid. Yep, the solenoid or flow. And so there's sometimes a tension there."
"Unknown","00;40;20;06","00;40;49;19","And so that's one type of mediation. But then using the mediator more like that, the higher level diplomat here, it's almost like the green layer is serving as a mediator of attention by calling awareness to it. And this is awareness of awareness. That's why it's metacognition, but it's mediating the dynamics of the second layer, which end up cascading to influence the perceptive layer as well."
"Unknown","00;40;50;05","00;41;29;00","But in a sense it is mediating the activity of the second layer. And certainly this is the level that in the paper they're saying is where meditation rests. That's why when we just had active inference plus attention, we didn't have papers on meditation but now that we have active inference plus metacognition, awareness of attention, we bring in this whole experiential dimension with meditation Stephen One question I might have here at that bottom is, So what am I perceiving?"
"Unknown","00;41;29;00","00;41;48;01","So that's kind of fair enough. And there's that kind of what's you know, I was just thinking about and then what am I trying to do now? There an interest rather than what am I trying to perceive? She's kind of interested in how they went for that because I mean, I'm just thinking about that could be that time."
"Unknown","00;41;48;01","00;42;13;06","For instance, I'm perceiving someone's on those things. I'm perceiving someone's got a bit of food in their teeth, right? And what I'm trying to do is listen to what they're saying. But I just think that they're food and it's kind of out there. So then what am I paying attention to? But what am I trying to do is interesting because in some ways you could say, what am I trying to do?"
"Unknown","00;42;13;25","00;42;45;10","I think implicitly saying, what am I trying to do with my sensorial apparatus? But it's a bit longer rather than what am I trying to do, which could be a higher policy level thing. Yep. Great question. I think one possible answer, and this relates to potentially the slightly different way that active inference partitions problems than other domains, is your preference would be that the other person doesn't have your preference at the first level would be to see no food in the teeth."
"Unknown","00;42;45;23","00;43;09;26","So there's two states in that preference vector in the in the C vector, which isn't going to be shown here, but the preference would be to not see the food and then the policy of the first perceptive layer is ocular motor. The policy is what can be controlled at that first level. So you could avert your eyes as a policy."
"Unknown","00;43;10;09","00;43;31;28","That's one way of not getting the visual stimuli. However, you can still hold it in your memory that is likely to be that case. So that's an example of like a hidden state, which is the state of the food. All you're going to get is photons corresponding to whether there might be food there or not. And then you're doing Hidden State Inference now, even though it's visual."
"Unknown","00;43;32;06","00;43;56;19","So it's like, why is it a hidden state if it's visual? Because it's actually you're on board state estimate of something that's out there. You're seeing it through visual mechanisms. But at the first level, the policy is for how you can move your eyes, not some other higher level policy. Yes, even. Yeah, that's so that's quite a good way of thinking about it."
"Unknown","00;43;56;19","00;44;27;16","And I think it also shows like how it is probably more easily tractable. When you say you have the visual, you have something fairly clearly on the visual or a particular sensory modality. Then you could see how the attention shifts. Now, what we see in our in much of our life, but maybe not so much in meditation because we we are able to tune to certain sensory routes more clearly."
"Unknown","00;44;27;17","00;44;52;05","But in daily life, it's all mashed together so much that it probably part of the reason why it becomes in perceivable because you know, your body might be in the mode of the bigger goal, i.e. getting to work on time and then your visual thing in that real time is trying to listen to the conversation with the ticket collector has got a bit too food in their mouth, in their tooth or whatever."
"Unknown","00;44;52;13","00;45;17;00","So you and it would all become hard to make this tractable because this this isn't necessarily set up to think about multi sensory integration. Not that it can but that would start to distort this is probably easier to think about this, whereas a fairly clear modality of play. Another thing to do is we don't necessarily talk about goals in the active inference ontology."
"Unknown","00;45;17;07","00;45;43;19","We have preferences which are over sensory outcomes and policies which are action capacities, action sequences that we're choosing so goals are the right word and people know what we're talking about. But in this model there is no goal for anything. They're just preferences and policies. So I want to read this question, which is going to be interleaved with a definition, and then it will be an interesting question."
"Unknown","00;45;44;03","00;46;10;13","So Liberty wrote, still reading through the paper, Aren't We All? Which seems deeply complimentary to Matt Singer's account of M Autonomy. So I just want to read a definition of M autonomy, since it wasn't a term I was very familiar with. And this is a paragraph written by Christoph Léger, who is also in active inference community. So it's kind of thanks for going out in front and helping us be clear about our definitions."
"Unknown","00;46;10;24","00;46;45;23","And so what Christoph wrote was in his recent article, Messenger 2015 argues for new construal of mental or M autonomy with the M as a functional property which consists in the deployment of a special kind of model, one which represents the self as an epistemic agent. This epistemic self model is. And then here's the quote from that singer a global model of the cognitive system as an entity that actively constructs, sustains and controls knowledge relations to the world and itself."
"Unknown","00;46;46;06","00;47;10;20","Messenger 2015 page two. 72. So good call liberty definitely we're hearing words like epistemic and self modeling and active states that seem to bring us close to active inference. And so their question was how do processes such as intentional inhibition inform a formal account of cognitive control, in your opinion?"
"Unknown","00;47;15;23","00;47;33;12","So we can look at five while this is up and people are thinking or just let me know which slide to go to so Steven first or you want to just reread the question one more time, how do processes such as intentional inhibition inform a formal account of cognitive control, in your opinion?"
"Unknown","00;47;36;00","00;48;21;28","So Stephen, and then anyone else who wants to go for it so intentional inhibition or unintentional uninhibited behavior or inhibited behavior, I suppose you could have it in different ways. I think what for me was interesting with this, when you start getting into how we relate and how we fit into our social landscape, so to speak, with that type of thing is when we because inhibition tends to be something that you're thinking about in a social context within reason."
"Unknown","00;48;22;20","00;48;59;23","It's like that thing about dance as if you're on your own. I feel that is a really good case for where there would be an internal locking module such as the type of work used in mental space psychology to mediate this messing a knowledge structure, because that would then gives you a kind of an embodied and active framework which the brain can actually use as kind of meta model in very personal space."
"Unknown","00;49;01;01","00;49;39;17","So I think that this is a quite a good point here is at what point do we need to have a mediating embodied sort of metaphor or structure in to help some of this pass out into the complex domains of a social setting thanks. Stephen Dean. Yeah, I just think it's interesting that if you if you think about inhibition and you think what the effects of that are, you can actually control the situation."
"Unknown","00;49;39;17","00;50;10;09","If you don't talk because we all hate a void or a vacuum. And so by not expressing, sometimes you pull other people's expression into more than you maybe even anticipate. And so I actually have found people who are less extroverted, a little bit more introverted, tend to have a lot more power in these kind of co variational situations that maybe they believe they possess."
"Unknown","00;50;11;13","00;50;27;02","I know that people that are extroverted think that they're controlling the conversation, but just stare blankly back at somebody and really pay attention and listen. And you'll be amazed at how much control you actually possess in that relationship."
"Unknown","00;50;29;05","00;50;53;28","I've thought on that. But blue first. Go ahead. Minds unrelated. It just reminded me of the sort of street hustle dynamic which is on one hand, that person must be superficially extroverted. I mean, they're coming up and speaking to a stranger. If it's about a chess game or they're selling something or they want you to go to that club in Las Vegas, that is a very extroverted social activity."
"Unknown","00;50;54;15","00;51;21;16","But the art and the science of that street game is actually about what Dean just wrote or said, I guess, like the introversion that brings the other person and elicits them to feel like they should put out their personal information into a void. But if someone's just like cha cha cha cha cha chat, there's no space for them to become vulnerable, to feel like they're part of the conversation and ultimately to reveal personal information."
"Unknown","00;51;22;06","00;51;50;22","So it it shows that, of course, we're using the introverted extrovert little loosely people say, oh, it means they draw their rejuvenating energy from being a loner in public. Like there's different definitions, but it just shows that actually it's not just about saying something or being the first to speak. That can also be a superficial mode of control and that there's a deeper mode of control that actually has to do with picking and choosing your words as well as one to use them."
"Unknown","00;51;51;27","00;52;34;16","Blue anything on that? So unrelated, but just going back to inhibition, Stephen do you want to have something directly related? One, this whole thing just to just as a comment is one thing I remember when they had the press inquiry in London about the Livingston Inquiry and Rupert Maxwell had to give evidence about his newspaper empire one thing that was really noticeable and they were saying this because he was like, you know, he's a very obvious, he's a high level executive, etc. He always took his time like when he was asked a question it was almost like he was always used to having the time to think through his answer, say what you need to"
"Unknown","00;52;34;16","00;52;56;08","do and be able to reply to his own leisure in a way that other people might not. And that also speaks to that power of when someone is presumably quite dominant and being able to be forceful also can they know they can hold the space. And there's probably some element of knowing how much power you have to be able to get away with that and no one else steps in."
"Unknown","00;52;56;08","00;53;23;28","So that's quite interesting. Anyway, thanks, Blue then. Dean. Go ahead, Dean, you've got some retort. So I'm going to go back to Inhibition when you guys are done. Yeah, yeah. No, I think it's just really interesting because I've read some stuff about if you're an FBI interrogator, one of the tactics that's actually trained in the FBI interrogators is to be intentionally inhibited interesting."
"Unknown","00;53;23;28","00;53;53;09","So there's intentional in the social intentionality. And then I think could be otherwise. But it seems like messengers, accounts and liberties question is about the intentional inhibition within the agents as a mechanism of cognitive control. But it brings us right back to this idea of the vertical nesting. And then in that situation, intentional control is kind of cascading from the top."
"Unknown","00;53;54;06","00;54;41;23","But then also there's intentionality laterally, like I am intending to control somebody else's cognitive state. And so that's actually one reason why it's important to have a model that's kind of like Legos in two dimensions because these active inference models, they plug in really well nesting internally. So we can talk about top down cognitive control and maybe have intentional inhibition as a phenomena within a broader science of mental action, which we can get to in 12, but also we can just as fluidly use some of the same variables and some of the same code, some of the same formalisms for the kinds of intentional control that happen laterally so it's like when somebody is taking"
"Unknown","00;54;41;23","00;55;05;12","a deliberate pause or somebody asks a really hard question and then they go and they take their time with the response. That's an intentional cognitive control, which has traditionally been the realm of the sort of psychology perhaps, but then that can be understood to be deployed in a cultural context by which it's being used to intentionally control other states."
"Unknown","00;55;05;27","00;55;40;03","And so we can have a bunch of different agents, each consisting of nested models like this, and we can stack them up vertically as well as have interactions laterally because intentionality is deployed in both of those directions. Stephen. Yeah, and following on to what you're saying, this this then starts to there's a big gap in basically between psychology and sociology, which is this idea of suppose because in many cases teams is one area where it gets looked at, you know, is, you know, is great."
"Unknown","00;55;40;05","00;56;07;06","You can take an average and you can tell your statistical averages, you get used sociology with in many cases and you get your individual. But part of the reason that we end up there is not because they're the most useful places to be is because you can measure them. You can get units of analysis that you can do stuff with and the intersubjective stuff around four or five people is is a huge challenge, right?"
"Unknown","00;56;07;07","00;56;33;28","Because you can't ignore the complexities of the individual, yet you've got the complexities of the group and so this speaks to that, you know, that ability to now start to get in and say, OK, well, let's say we can tease out some generative models or not even generative models to be able to tease things out in a way which maybe can make meaning in group contexts."
"Unknown","00;56;33;28","00;56;57;25","And this participatory sense making, that's, that's really what is moving things forward. I think it almost makes me think of someone who can facilitate a group and it's like, I know you intended to just share what you're excited about, but you're unintentionally exerting cognitive control on other people. By bringing up this topic or by speaking in this way."
"Unknown","00;56;57;25","00;57;34;26","So it helps us look at that vertical intentionality and a lateral social intentionality together or maybe even not just with the same model, but on a common footing of precision, precision within the individual and precision of the team. So it's like these are the real nuts and bolts of where integrative models matter. If we had a totally disjoint model for what was happening inside of a head and then across bodies and brains, we wouldn't have the market to sort of flip back and forth between those currencies per se."
"Unknown","00;57;34;26","00;58;04;02","We would need another third level connector theory. So it's like if you have one theory and in theory B, you need to invent theory C in the middle but if you have just one integrative theory, then it's just a question of how it all works together. Dean. Yeah, just one last quick comment. I think it's really interesting that A, that an inhibition can be seen as a as a as a tactical stance and and a reveal on those Markoff blanket in states."
"Unknown","00;58;04;19","00;58;31;09","I mean, that's I'm not sure it's a cipher because you don't actually know what the other person if they're going to sort of be drawn into something that they otherwise wouldn't. But I just think it's really interesting that we we assume that we have to keep the conversation going and we don't assume that maybe one of the ways to to do that is to not say very much and to give one neurological comment on that."
"Unknown","00;58;32;26","00;59;02;22","Perhaps back in the day, people thought with the higher orders of the brain, the higher thinking processes being the generative and the creative processes, since those are the human specific ones and we're generative and creative and so on. But when you look down to the synapse level, the frontal cortices are actually using inhibitory control. So it's this model where it's like we can actually be creative and we can be generative through the appropriate inhibition."
"Unknown","00;59;03;01","00;59;32;16","We don't need to have this passive midbrain that gets salted into activity by a really smart forebrain. Rather, we can actually have the endogenous wisdom and activity that never ceases with targeted inhibition. Coming from some other parts of the brain. I'm sure that was a simplification blue, so I know you can say more on that. So that totally leads into exactly what I was going to say earlier about inhibition and cognitive control."
"Unknown","00;59;32;23","00;59;56;06","So like if we were in this overly neurologically like non neuron excited state, I mean, that's a seizure, right? So in there you've got over excitation in the brain. It's not always good, but but so I means to what intent like to what extent does intentional inhibition. Right. This is going back to the question. This was based on intentional oppression."
"Unknown","00;59;56;22","01;00;20;25","So when you have intentional inhibition, I wonder if this goes back to what I was saying about meditation, like shutting off the fundamental unit of a thought. So I wonder if intentional inhibition when you refrain from blurting something out or when you practice restraint or or refrain from letting your thoughts wander. So when you inhibit your self this intentional inhibition, I don't know."
"Unknown","01;00;21;02","01;00;46;26","But it's curious to think about does this correspond to, you know, there's activity in the brain. Excitatory makes more action potentials happen and inhibitory makes fewer action potentials happen. So when I do this kind of intentional inhibition, does that inhibit my neurons of a corresponding way? I'm curious. I mean, I would guess because it just, you know, I mean, at least in the meditative sense, I would think inhibition of an action, potential propagating forward."
"Unknown","01;00;47;10","01;01;27;03","So so it's a curious thing to to wonder about to what extent is intentional inhibition exert cognitive control at the molecular level thanks. Please. Steven, yeah, that's actually got me thinking now on something that's quite that, that question about the higher level, lower level, I think and this this is a really interesting piece actually, and it ties back to what I was thinking of asking as well about figure five where you put subliminal processes and maybe conscious processes."
"Unknown","01;01;27;03","01;02;02;07","And I think that's an interesting point on figure five that you use there because maybe it's the middle of it, it's more conscious at certain times. And the top there is actually never quite aware or if you are only able to effectively feel and the, you know, so there might be that it's actually the middle layer there on figure five that's a conscious and I like work that's actually very interesting if it's inhibitory because there's an interesting model I've been trying to work with would do its logical levels and you've got the kind of the identity level."
"Unknown","01;02;02;14","01;02;32;07","So if I map this on the identity level or the face could be seen as what broadcasts where we are and some of that we're conscious of and some of that but not, you know, so and then we've got where our awareness is in the moment. And then we talked about this kind of lower level, which you can only you sort of aware of, but it's again, it's slightly outside of that crystal clear question."
"Unknown","01;02;32;14","01;03;01;17","So I wonder on figure five and maybe this is a question for Daniel because it might be if you put those on there, you know, where you put we got subliminal and awareness and how is this interface mediated? And I'm kind of wondering what I'm paying attention to, maybe what is actually awareness in? I like sort of I could tell you sense and the top one is an awareness in a kind of a a cell, almost like a metaphor."
"Unknown","01;03;01;29","01;03;33;16","It feels like this to try and have that matter awareness, but you can never quite get a handle on it. You know, great point and totally open to anyone's insights or the authors or otherwise. But this first level is, again, about sensory perception. So it is possible that the second level is the reportable, opaque state. That's one of the innovations of this paper."
"Unknown","01;03;34;02","01;04;02;10","And there would have to be another level to make this state at the very top reportable. So it might be the case that this green topmost layer is the felt awareness of where one's attention is, as well as their preferences for where their attention should be, which might be scaffolds by meditation saying It's awesome to focus on this mandala or it's awesome to focus on compassion."
"Unknown","01;04;02;19","01;04;30;06","So these are shaping preferences over policies for how aware one should be. It's great to be paying attention. And then the what is one paying attention to is where those policies are influencing. Yeah, where the attention is being paid. But when somebody says like, you know, there was a car crash and I couldn't look away, it's almost like, well, the first layer is that they were perceiving cars on the road."
"Unknown","01;04;30;27","01;05;11;06","The attention they're reporting is that they were paying attention to that. But then there's this implicit third state that they were aware of where their attention was otherwise they wouldn't have been able to report. I couldn't have looked away. So they were extremely aware of where their awareness was that's what metacognition brings in, that simply attention doesn't. And again, another argument for first principles theories that work really well in this sort of composable way because there are neural network models with so-called attention."
"Unknown","01;05;11;21","01;05;43;13","But where would you put metacognition in? There might be a variety of ways to do that. And maybe some would be practical and some weren't, and maybe some would be implementable with the tools you already have maybe others wouldn't. But here, when we can just look at the skeleton of the model, we can come to some pretty interesting places just by working with what's composed more rather than just sort of trying to make it fit well first and then make it composable and understandable seconds."
"Unknown","01;05;44;03","01;06;12;13","We're beginning with compose ability and comprehensibility and then the question about how it will fit empirical data. Well, it's an empirical question Stephen Yeah, this is interesting, and you can bring in empirical data. You've got the advantage of potentially, say, the subliminal layer. It may not be self-reports, it could be that you could use other measures, you know, brain scanning and other things to give a sense of when what is coming in there."
"Unknown","01;06;13;03","01;06;35;12","And of course, as they mentioned, because attention and again, this is where we get caught in our own need to make sure the literature can hold together. You know, attention as as was mentioned by Lars is kind of relatively uncontroversial. Right. But of course you get we know from phenomena you know you you sort of can't help at some level get into the idea of consciousness."
"Unknown","01;06;35;12","01;07;05;14","Right, because conscious awareness of attention is that kind of interesting thing. So when it goes what am I paying attention to? What am I conscious of? And then you get into phenomenology, phenomenological consciousness or access consciousness coming into play and it gets a bit fuzzier. So but I think at some level you're going to start to hit those in between those two."
"Unknown","01;07;05;15","01;07;36;22","You sort of in that kind of fuzziness of where that sort of goes. And then the next level up again probably is more maybe it's actually more clear from the next level up when you go from attention to matter awareness of attention. But I think the bit this might be a whole shift in ontology even could be that shift from how you perceive even or and how that translates into an attentional state."
"Unknown","01;07;37;20","01;08;07;20","Yep. So to kind of bring it to multi-level or multi-level end multisensory integration, the perception can be of two different kinds, like what gets passed to the agent at each time point might be a visual measurements and a temperature or appropriate reception. And then the policy, what am I paying attention to could be reflected by paying attention to, for example, visual input as opposed to some other type of input."
"Unknown","01;08;08;10","01;08;56;12","And then one could be aware or not of whether they're paying attention to the smell or to the sound or to the light. So how these models get integrated with then non first personal measurements, that's kind of what we explored in this future phenomenology slide with like, OK, where do we bring in empirical measurements? And we kind of align them on the same time series and we can bring in any kind of measurements we don't even need to limit ourself anything that's measured through time of any uncertainty over that measurements we can kind of cobbled together into this model, what are we doing it for?"
"Unknown","01;08;57;02","01;09;34;04","What do we want to know with those measurements? Probably a lot of things that we could address there. Maybe for the 45 minutes, let's at least go to 12 figure 12. Yeah. And talk a little bit about just annotating or exploring this figure. So in five, again, main contribution of the paper one of them was the explicit three level model with what is being perceived, what is attention being paid to and how aware is one of that here?"
"Unknown","01;09;34;09","01;10;10;09","We're dropping back to two layers with the understanding that we could add another level, like a green layer on top of the orange one that then connects back down to the orange one. But look at some of these new parameters that are introduced in this paper, namely all of these gamma subscripts. So gamma are the uncertainty variables. Now there's a gamma with a subscript modulus doing a lot of the other parameters that previously have been presented just as kind of standing alone."
"Unknown","01;10;10;27","01;10;47;00","So like, for example, in FIG. five, you just have like preferences. In the second level, the preferences just exist and the affordances E, they just exist. Now in 12 we're thinking about what does it look like to have an uncertainty or a precision being the inverse of each other. Over D, the prior C, the preferences G, the free energy minimization E, the affordances PI is the policy."
"Unknown","01;10;47;21","01;11;16;19","And then we have an uncertainty over B, which is the matrix that defines the transition between hidden states. So like given that I'm inferring it to be raining outside, what is the transition probabilities of it staying rainy versus becoming not raining? And then we also have a which is the matrix mapping between hidden states and observed states what's the relationship between the observation of photons and whether it's sunny or not?"
"Unknown","01;11;17;03","01;12;05;00","Is it a simple matrix, just a clean mapping? You can just sort of simply have 100% of the time map it? Or is it the case that you're very uncertain about how hidden states are connected to observable outcomes? So those are just just to sort of recap what these parameters in the model mean, but maybe if anybody wants to like highlight one of these precision variables, just what's one that they're drawn to or they're curious about or what's one that might have applications in different systems Daniel and I would speak to it, but I in order for me to sort of explain it in a way that I think would make sense might mean I"
"Unknown","01;12;05;18","01;12;38;16","would have to speak for a while and hijack this. Would people be comfortable with me talking for a couple of minutes, please? OK, so I kind of look at this from the perspective of when in doubt, zoom, zoom in, zoom out in order to compute something. And this is a computational paper I kind of take a whole cloth or a whole markup like an approach of of precise or precision as the paper kind of does a good job of laying out as precise i.e. figure 12."
"Unknown","01;12;39;26","01;13;01;29","So on the topic of meta awareness meeting and collective decision making between the greatest and the smallest distances, that we can be aware of, we have information, geography. If you're searching for meaning and edge precision, things like contrast proportion, there's a fitting process I often think of like the 16th century maps of North America when the explorers first hit the coastlines."
"Unknown","01;13;03;09","01;13;37;19","And then there's information geometry when you're putting a dimensional space together. So that's fixing the topology as a precise representation of difference over distances. I've already shared in the 21 for 28 one that I got this generative model, I call it the Unholy Triad, which is in essence a computational phenomenon, phenomenon ology, context, generator, the translates prediction error reduction, meaning we try to give people a sense of prediction, manage manage and expertize."
"Unknown","01;13;39;05","01;14;13;13","I want them to be able to turn that, that ability to predict, to do a contribution. For me, it was trying to create a professional contribution for high school kids. So what does that mean? It means getting to the GEO, the geometric and the geographic. Yes, is of a situation that you've never been in before. So it's a pretty big markup link and actively it means generalized and transfer regardless of that degree of novelty it means understanding learner availability to phenomena as much as collecting data on learner attention, which what this paper is kind of focused in on."
"Unknown","01;14;14;02","01;14;35;19","It's not about studying the swallow and regurgitating information as a content cycle, which is a standardized form of learning measure, which is also an irony because I had to take these models here and give them just six to 18 year olds by using things like when in doubt, zoom in, zoom out, because they I could present them with this, but this would be Sanskrit to them."
"Unknown","01;14;35;19","01;15;04;12","They wouldn't understand it at all. So then what is a precise proposition as create a professional contribution in the to be materialized with propositional sense? And in the paper, I think I talked about this in 28 one, there was a passage in the paper that talked about and I'll just read it out, it says In computational terms, the central place of confidence and reliability and effective self-regulation speaks to the key role of precision."
"Unknown","01;15;04;26","01;15;30;28","And then they say that's the inverse variance of implicit beliefs. And then they talk about, as an example, probabilistic or posterior Bayesian beliefs that describe a probability distribution over some latent quantity. And I talked last week about going across the street, so there's a calculable risk in that. And then back to the papers says these beliefs are sub personal, meaning that they're unplanned."
"Unknown","01;15;31;02","01;16;09;07","However, the argument pursued in this work is that Bayesian beliefs about Bayesian beliefs can in certain situations become propositional. And and the way that those things are estimated. My control that's referring to has Casper's work persistence in a nutshell, quantify our confidence in our beliefs, say how confident we are about what we know about states of the world, about the relation to our sensory observations, or about how these states change over time by analogy, both physical action and mental or covert action consists deploying and adjusting these quantities without there necessarily being an explicit behavioral counterpart to these covert actions."
"Unknown","01;16;10;08","01;16;33;09","So for me, if we're computing a transformation of unplanned will to metacognitive from perception of I'm aware of planning to make a plan because I can think about my thinking. So what of this policy of attention then? What I attend to tells me what when I'm losing focus. That's what the paper said and I agree check. That's one way of measuring that."
"Unknown","01;16;33;23","01;17;20;03","And in the crosswalk case study, you have two propositions. Both are precise in terms of their they're just some disambiguate ID paths and both are examples of the nesting study, in this case crossing a nest or a roadway. And then what happens regardless of the awareness level inside or outside of the physical and the hypothetical lines? This is what I would be asking people that were going to go into these novel situation is if we don't select right away, if we keep things open, if we keep probability distributed across a propositional horizon of potential street crossings, is precision lost as an openness, as a district, as a distribution collection versus a focal point, attenuation which"
"Unknown","01;17;20;03","01;17;46;18","is I think what this paper was examining, perhaps a way of probing this might be to say that the concept of scale is fluid, that it's the potential for scale change that scale itself overtakes or retreats from as a directional inflation or deflation. And sometimes we talk about that as a directional gradient is centered dissent in this sense scale either obliterates or gap increases, which Scott talked about having an epoxy."
"Unknown","01;17;47;18","01;18;32;17","And I agree with that that what we consider to be inside or outside the lines is not static due to our relationship or between us to the focal point of interest. This is somewhat this is a somewhat conventional explanation of scalable behavior. But I think there's a second part to this we have to keep with that first and that second sense which together with the first part, generates another type of between, which is a matter of the geography in as in edge precision and geometry as in of difference over at once at the exact same time that supports the very notion of and as scale scaling down or scaling up."
"Unknown","01;18;33;17","01;19;20;00","So that's that up and down part we were talking about earlier today in my experience, is very much the addition of this second sense as a parallel probing that works. There's no violations of the bringing in the statistical and the physical mechanics together that active inference parameter arises as an eco v or high occupancy vehicle lane as a metaphor or more than intersectional intersectional is pretty much interventionist and kind of an instructional is only reinforcing view or perspective in the in the each of V lane metaphor you are in as self-organizing, you're noninterventionist because you're a constructor, you're an interactor of lines of streamlines."
"Unknown","01;19;20;13","01;19;41;21","And I use the example of a 28 zero or a 28 one and the way that we set the livestream. So if you're outside the h of lines, you maybe you're rewatching something that you were a participant in, or perhaps you're using the point to part of this as a way of sort of detaching yourself and being able to appreciate scale."
"Unknown","01;19;42;17","01;20;10;22","So math is not the territory, but the math is both the diamond shape on and above the parameter eyes state space, that road that we now see as high occupancy vehicle, it shows the signals meaning the geometric and the restricted fit. The geographics that are two plus in the car mathematical quantity enables again you have opaque passenger cars and transparent traffic congestion reduction check."
"Unknown","01;20;11;07","01;20;32;21","That's what this paper talked about. But I think we also have to consider that the contrast meaning that the text and the background are different colors and the proportion meaning the depth, the feel is adjustable is necessary to dial in the resolution and the resignation Daniel, you spoke about resolution and resignation, mostly about the resolution in the point one."
"Unknown","01;20;32;21","01;21;04;17","And so I wanted to really come back to that a bit. This is collected phenomena. This is not I am attending or I realize that I'm not attending, but I think it's a big part of this attenuation versus collect of thought piece that we're trying to get some sense of order and relationship around. If we want context generation, the N plus the out equal in context to play a formal formal role in what we decide or defiance or is precision."
"Unknown","01;21;05;00","01;21;49;24","It's something to think about when looking at logic as a formalism. The accessing of data collection sets, which we've talked about again quite a bit today, talks about the definition of a precise bigger picture as a distributed collection. And I can say in my work that was coming up with the professional contribution, it also speaks to where there are relationships through lines like like a real physical line and those blankets that we keep talking about as a process and it also talks about what Scott talked about in the letter in the 21.1 is borrowing from the model has both a quantity and a quality determination I think at the end of the day it says"
"Unknown","01;21;49;24","01;22;09;07","instead of just looking at how and why we have to look at the when we're inside and outside the lines the who, our relationship to all of the traffic that could be crossing the road and the which which do we look at or do we look at the figure 12 or do we zoom out and add a third layer?"
"Unknown","01;22;09;07","01;22;34;11","I don't think it really matters as long as we're prepared to look at both. So that is that is to me the essence of what a free energy principle as unpalatable to cognitive metacognitive world looks like. And I don't know that it's easy for people to sort of put all of that into a nutshell. But like I said, it's kind of a whole cloth, whole Markoff blanket thing."
"Unknown","01;22;34;11","01;22;56;16","And as you mentioned, Daniel, in the last in the last live stream, it's it's we want the first principles to be able to generalize and scale up. But I think the only way that that happens if we is if we don't see it as either always inflating or always deflating, but we see both the geometry and the geography sort of working hand-in-glove with that."
"Unknown","01;22;56;16","01;22;58;17","I think that's how we derive a fit here."
"Unknown","01;23;00;24","01;23;02;17","Nice. Jean, thank you."
"Unknown","01;23;04;27","01;23;28;22","Very interesting. I guess Steven or Blue or anyone else, feel free to ask a question, but just a few notes on that. So one is it's a subtle design choice, but notice that the green wraps around the whole box and then the orange wraps around the blue. So it's not just like three Legos placed, one on top of another."
"Unknown","01;23;29;03","01;23;48;05","It actually is a zooming in and out. And so that moves us towards Bucky Fuller's dream of, you know, I went in stairs and out stairs rather than upstairs and down stairs because it's not up and down for everyone. Just say it's in and out because you're on a closed surface. So that was about zooming in and out."
"Unknown","01;23;48;05","01;24;17;03","And it's not that we're even necessarily moving again. We talk about top down and bottom up, and that's vertically how it's arranged here. But perhaps inward, out and outward in will make a lot more sense when we start to think about what these models are really doing. And you brought up the idea of using the dot to and so that was interesting to think about resources and artifacts that might be considered epistemic."
"Unknown","01;24;17;15","01;24;46;11","I mean, it's research. We're talking about papers, but how do we use resources rather than just learn from them? So seeing them as action artifacts rather than just epistemic artifacts and then also just this idea that where will we have precision? Can we have precision in our policies? How do we instructor high schooler or younger their world that they're going to be having a career in?"
"Unknown","01;24;46;11","01;25;08;06","And that's what it sounded like you were working towards, was some sort of, you know, helping them get on a trajectory where they could have support and everything. It's going to be changing a lot. So it's like, I'm sorry, I can't give you precision on whether crypto will be important in 15 years or something like that. It's like we could write a million papers on that and just not know the answer today."
"Unknown","01;25;08;20","01;25;36;08","What can we have precision on and then this really pushes the question where can we exchange our uncertainty and where? What should we focus on so that we can have focus on, if not our own policy? Like I'm going to go on a walk every day, but our own attention and that kind of covert mental action to bring it back to intentionality might be what we will always remain sovereign over is our attention."
"Unknown","01;25;37;01","01;26;32;25","Stephen Yeah, I think the this this nested ness is important, I think because time is part of that as well, because these lower levels happen quicker. And I wondered the what your thoughts are on this in terms of when we look at these different variables that can now come into play on figure 12 I mean, they're kind of OK, you're going to start to have variation or potential to vary how you set because in theory the every one of these values is is is there implicitly just can't be varied right it's like there's there's there's some sort of precision somehow in the system but theoretically now OK you can access or change the precision on"
"Unknown","01;26;32;25","01;27;04;24","your priors and your generative model and your expected free energy as well as on the transition matrix that gets you the sensory states. And of course then this question is OK, now is showing this in one level all these arrows come together somehow. It's like that meshed mystery. Will, how does that happen? I like is it a case that they're all firing out with like, OK, well, this is what it would be like if, you know, my updated of states was to have a different precision."
"Unknown","01;27;04;29","01;27;40;04","This is what it would be like if my generative model was to have a different precision. This is and is there almost like a whole array like imagine going in and out of the screen here of temporal depths or even different sort of combinations of these you know, precision estimates. And maybe the top level has to basically choose and maybe at some point the lower levels, if they don't get chosen very often they die down, you know, i.e. like the seven legged unicorns running across the street isn't selected very often."
"Unknown","01;27;40;04","01;28;16;06","So it's like left to one side but maybe with creative people, they tend to like keep all those things firing, which may not be healthy if you go too far with that. So I mean, because there is a there is a question. There isn't there is how as we start to bring in these other ideas is, OK, so what what was that most that ability to to bring up a precision estimate on an a matrix for looking at observations into states and to integrate these with these others you know, is that is that just, you know, integration?"
"Unknown","01;28;16;10","01;28;42;13","You know, are we going to start to have kinds of things like you were saying if you if you have a particular change in how much the priors are changed and along with the model, you know, then what does that do? Yeah, I actually have some some thoughts on that, Stephen. It's interesting because I think all of these figures and and every paper has their figures because they show their model."
"Unknown","01;28;42;22","01;29;00;22","I think that that model is kind of a reflection. And I think the other thing that tends to happen is if you if you do reflect on, so what what was I trying to perceive in true in terms of a sort of a metacognitive here's no I'm now I'm thinking about a process. I don't think we do that in isolation."
"Unknown","01;29;00;22","01;29;19;15","I think the environment kind of acts as a scrutinize or as well, like you guys are scrutinizing what I'm saying right now, and I'm hoping that I'm not saying something that's so completely obscure that it it sort of continues to build on what we're all sharing in terms of what we're taking away from this. So I think there's an updating of updating."
"Unknown","01;29;19;15","01;30;01;19","And that's when, when Lars was talking about that in the 28 one, I was kind of nodding because yeah, that's, I think that's a, that's a vital component. It's not sort of written out explicitly in this model here, but I think we should assume that when we're zooming in and zooming out, we are reflecting. So we're taking something and we're stretching that time frame and then I think the second thing that we can't sort of leave out if we're context generalizing is that context, that environment is acting as a scrutinize or it's giving us feedback all the time so that we don't get stuck in one place."
"Unknown","01;30;01;25","01;30;25;10","That time actually. And change actually does become something that we're not just of, we're aware of, but we're actually utilizing. So that rate of change pieces, I think we don't necessarily impose it. I think it gets imposed on us. Maybe I'm wrong, but yeah, I haven't seen any evidence to the contrary yet. Actually, that's, that's a good point."
"Unknown","01;30;25;10","01;30;52;24","If I just jumped in there is yeah. I mean, a lot of this stuff could I mean, it actually starts to support the and active approaches in a way. I suppose you actually start to see now that you're back into the realm of, well, how could you start to blend all of that. It almost needs to be maybe hardwired into an active kind of dynamical biological thing, the technical term."
"Unknown","01;30;53;25","01;31;34;18","So because it's not necessarily tractable purely however, there may be parts of it which need to be more cognitively and can only happen at a sort of a more structured cognitive level. You know, so there's this question about what what can be inferred, who acted in the world in different ways. And like you say, the you will find out when you bang into the wall or when you just find out as you drink a cup, you know, you feel that you feel in you know, Hamilton's least action obviously becomes one of the options there is that would come in with the free energy."
"Unknown","01;31;34;18","01;32;07;17","OK, what seems to be the type of configuration of precision estimates that kind of gives the overall least action if that's if that information is available. So now you have a way to integrate those in one context, which may provide the general structure which is good enough to to, to to work with them in other contexts. You know, maybe that there's some sort of plausible."
"Unknown","01;32;07;29","01;32;31;05","So he sort of moves beyond neuro phenomenology and moves a bit beyond the body in you. Now you are in the mind body environment dynamic, you know? Yeah. I think the really interesting part is when in doubt implies you're, you're stuck. You're not maybe taking action. So zoom in, zoom out like don't just do one or the other."
"Unknown","01;32;31;29","01;33;04;23","Be prepared and actively but also from an active inference perspective to infer the geometry and the geography that and I mean, make that explicit. Make that it make that a part of your strategy, your tactics. It's actually it's more inhibited than most people think. But in terms of in terms of what you're going to do is you're not going to get stuck on level one or level three."
"Unknown","01;33;05;00","01;33;29;16","You're going to actually be able to go across levels. That's why there's an envelopment in a lot of these representations. You're already in the nest you're already deciding whether or not you're going to cross the street. Now, what you're asking is, is it more beneficial from a thinking perspective to do that inside or outside the lines? I'm not I'm not passing judgment on which is better, but what I am saying is don't restrict yourself to one or the other."
"Unknown","01;33;30;25","01;34;00;10","Zoom in, zoom out the opacity of the second layer only arises because there is a higher and a lower level right so it's sort of like maybe the series kind of blurs off. And so we have one type of awareness at our experienced tier, and then it rests upon the shoulders of the first and the third level, the green and the blue here."
"Unknown","01;34;00;27","01;34;48;03","And then maybe those spiral off in reality or maybe they don't. We're modeling it this way. And then it's the feedback with reality that we'll update our models based upon Stephen Yeah. And this, this because we've got levels at play and I know you mentioned about zoom in, zoom out, I mean zooms quite an ocular kind of. So I suppose we've got, we there's a, there's a kind of a question in terms of how we language some of this because we want to look at different temple, we've got different levels of abstraction as we see when we then look at things as they map across to other knowledge epistemic systems we've got different we know"
"Unknown","01;34;48;03","01;35;24;24","that the hierarchies have different speeds. I mean in a way that nature in theory doesn't care about the levels in sense, but it might care about the, the speed at which the processing happens. And if it has to go quicker at the lower levels, it has no choice around that and that. But then we've also got this question of Zoom in out scale ups, you know, scale scale happening, some of which is, is is you can't avoid I mean, we've got cells inside our body scale and then we've got organs and then we've got I'm wondering."
"Unknown","01;35;25;26","01;36;02;02","Yeah, well, when we say sky zoom in, is that an intentional capacity? No, no, I just that's a great question because as I said, I don't have any pushback on anything the authors wrote in this paper. I think it's a great paper. And I'm I'm suggesting we hold up the tension and availability because that's what zoom in, zoom out is it's leaving yourself available to what could be considered and included in a definition of what attention is."
"Unknown","01;36;03;01","01;36;29;07","I mean, I'm just I'm saying include both. That's what the zoom in, zoom out does is is what I my one of my available to my avail. Am I making self available to outside the lines metaphorically physically as well as inside the lines? Is that part of my reasoning in terms of of not not necessarily being being afraid of bumping into things that's a good point."
"Unknown","01;36;29;07","01;36;50;04","I mean, one other thing that I think is interesting, when I think from science to visual art, all art is in science. You tend to think of zooming in and out, say with a microscope. You can go in and you see more. Now, in art, you tend to crop. So you have the same roughly the same image. Maybe you get a little bit more detail."
"Unknown","01;36;50;14","01;37;15;09","You just crop in, in, now crop in in terms of how we tend to think information these quite different ideas. It's what you're taking away to leave focus. We're zooming in because we get more detail on something small. We maybe don't focus on all the things that well, you could zoom in and you just expand the you know this the frame gets bigger, right?"
"Unknown","01;37;15;20","01;37;37;07","Is normally it it kind of that's the question. Are you zooming in on an object that's like a penny and it gets to a certain size and it fills your frame of awareness because once you go beyond that, you can't help but crop because you can't fit everything in and you then gain more detail on something that you can't take in other detail."
"Unknown","01;37;37;23","01;38;11;20","So there's there's I mean, even that's a scale dependent thing, right? It's dependent on the organism, right? So for a mouse to zoom in and zoom out, well also can to some extent, without using a tool or an instrument, can we zoom like it's interesting because we can I zoom with my eyes in a way I can focus and I can go in, I can type my most askew."
"Unknown","01;38;11;20","01;38;37;17","I suppose in some ways I can zoom by having the area of my eye that has the most cells be given attention to. A particular part of the eye can take my attentional or fidelity to bear. But some of the things also, like I say, we kind of imagine ourselves as if we've got a binoculars or some other tool in our hands."
"Unknown","01;38;37;17","01;39;17;26","Right. And we because we so it's such an embodied thing to do but actually that's not necessarily, that's not necessarily what we could do without that tool. That makes sense. So there's a, there's a, there is a question there around Yeah. Where, where to and maybe we're able to use maybe that's the thing that's kind of unique about humans is that ability to pick up a microscope and look through it and extend through the tool usage, you know, and that's not necessarily available to other animals."
"Unknown","01;39;18;10","01;39;58;13","And I think I think that the paper speaks to I can I can attend or not attend, and I'll know that I'm attending when I'm not attending. So that's that's that's the sort of inflationary, deflationary part of it. And I and I'm not saying drop that. I think that that's important. But I think if it's only held up as as that you're missing the other two vertices of the triad, the other two vertices being can I also on the on the open end of the triangle relative to that first part, which is the am I or am I not attending?"
"Unknown","01;39;58;13","01;40;21;24","Am I inflating or deflating? Am I going up or down? Is the geometry and the geography? And I think if you put all of I know this sounds very abstract, but after you put it into practice, after you have your checklist that your or your model that you carry in with saying, have I have I addressed all three sides of this, you tend to generate a context much sooner."
"Unknown","01;40;21;24","01;40;51;21","You're mark off blanket becomes more transparent, more tunneling effect into these novel situations. Then I'm waiting around for somebody to point to what I need to attend to next, which is more of the instruction list model again. Right? So I mean, if you want to give a person the ability to make sense sooner, all I'm suggesting is, is that have three vertices, right?"
"Unknown","01;40;51;21","01;41;17;13","Have three corners to this to dimensionalize the space. And again, if you put it into practice, it's, it's, it's pretty easy to transfer from the abstract into actual physical things that you do. I mean, you can, you can decide what the focal point is, what the horizon is. You can decide what the difference is and you can decide what the what the proportions and the contrast are."
"Unknown","01;41;17;16","01;41;33;29","And if somebody says to you, I'm not getting this, you can also explain to them what you're not seeing, which is really, really helpful to the person who's trying to be the be the guide or the way finder thanks. Dean Blue."
"Unknown","01;41;36;00","01;42;00;12","Yeah. I wanted to kind of talk about zooming in and zooming out and using a microscope or not. And so something that I have found in the course of my life is the capacity for mental zooming and zooming out, especially with regard to consideration for others. So like I started life as a kid, like everything was provided for me."
"Unknown","01;42;00;12","01;42;30;17","And then like as a teenager, I was like the most self absorbed creature alive. Right? And so, like, as I've gotten older, like my so I was so focused on just me, right? Just me, me, me, me, me. I'm the center of my world. But then like, you know, you really start to expand that, you know, to consider more and more people and the planet and like all of the consequences of your actions as I developed and, you know, probably really set in at 25, right with full frontal lobe development and the understanding of consequences."
"Unknown","01;42;30;17","01;42;58;13","And you know, this kind of ripple effects, the butterfly effect of all of our actions and so forth, but also in meditation to kind of bring it back in and type of paper. You know, you hope you do this meditation. I mean, I've done meditations where you're doing, for example, loving kindness and you focus on loving kindness and kindness for yourself and your inner circle and then you expand it to include, you know, the people in the room and your extended family and everyone that's suffering the same ailments as you and so forth."
"Unknown","01;42;58;13","01;43;28;11","So you kind of expand your awareness this mental zooming out through, through meditation and yeah, so I just wanted to kind of say like we don't always need a microscope, but, but it is mental and it may also be something that's uniquely human can I can I just respond to that blue? I think you're absolutely right. And the funny thing is, is that again, when when you take it off the page, it's what you're describing."
"Unknown","01;43;28;11","01;44;00;29","What I'm describing, although probably doing a terrible job of it, is identity and feelings when you actually use this this it's approach of being able to hold up three things at once. It's your identity and your feelings that you're really becoming metacognitive up or so is it metacognitive or is it dissolving that identity? Right. And so that's like the question of of Mike Levin expanding the cognitive boundary of the self."
"Unknown","01;44;01;13","01;44;30;27","So in his paper, I don't I'm not sure if you read the composition about himself or not. But but, you know, he talked about this the computational boundary and not just of of a person, but also like a cell and an organ and tissue and so but also a human. And when you've dissolved this computational boundary of the self, you've expanded it, you've dissolved I mean, this is eventually the end goal of meditation is this dissolution of identity, this ceasing of grasping to the South."
"Unknown","01;44;31;04","01;44;55;09","I mean, in many traditions, right? This is the letting go of self grasping and letting go of the idea of the self. And so you have this very expansive consideration of the self. And so it's encompassing all beings in that in that boundary. Yeah, and that's interesting because that's exactly what we used to talk about is what does it mean to go from being a student to being a professional contributor?"
"Unknown","01;44;55;19","01;45;15;09","Well, all I know is it's not an extension of being a student. I have no idea what it means in your particular situation. Right. So it is a dissolving if nothing else. It's a forming and a dissolving at the same time. That's why I said it is still you still have me because I was your influence that got me watching soul."
"Unknown","01;45;15;24","01;45;34;13","And that's exactly what they were talking about. And so, again, it's not a it is it is ephemeral ephemeral. And we can reflect on it and we can have the environment scrutinized on it. And that doesn't destroy everything that's actually building things up."
"Unknown","01;45;37;03","01;46;07;08","Thanks, Steve. Stephen, and this this what you just mentioned in there in terms of dissolving the self and meditation and precision estimates, I think this this could speak to this idea. You know, we talk about the five, the six plus and -1 in terms of how many ideas you can hold in your heads. And we have this idea, you know, with higher thinking, it's pure or we have certain things that we hold in our minds."
"Unknown","01;46;07;08","01;46;32;10","And I can imagine that it's like with meditation, the idea if it's done well because it can you know, you could end up going into some places where you just don't it's not productive. But in a productive sense, it's like you are able to adjust and integrate. You can imagine why the why be why C, why A, why G?"
"Unknown","01;46;32;11","01;47;11;07","Why A and B, OK, it's not that you so you're still accepting that you can go with different precision estimates, but you don't get this kind of attachment or to making certain precision estimates as kind of rarefied things, which we often do, you know, like so we kind of feel like it should be like something or we feel uncomfortable or we get drawn to our kind of, you know, our desires or the things that we get kind of obsessive with or things that we are avoiding."
"Unknown","01;47;11;07","01;47;32;26","So that could be interesting. And the other thing that then can tie to that because I like to mix as well as meditation which this talks about, which is kind of, yeah, you got meditation, you've got action in the world where we can, like you say, with the environment walking around and then we've got ritual and ritual tends to be more in the indigenous approaches."
"Unknown","01;47;32;26","01;47;59;11","But there you're not necessarily trying to dissolve anything it's already it's almost like you're trying to disrupt it. It's not like you've got a nice pure drop. You're hoping to like evaporate and allow to become a mist that we're not refined anymore. It's a bit like, you know, you see that you're going to put on a big mask and a costume and you're going to dance around the fire."
"Unknown","01;47;59;19","01;48;41;13","And until you start to go into another state now that could access another set of informational influences and that may be doing some other things you know, that maybe things which are more useful when we're in a communal integration and social integration or social sense making so it could be like we're trying to regulate as a group, and then meditation is helping us regulate as individuals, and it's neither one's better than the other, but they have different, you know, niche properties for us."
"Unknown","01;48;44;15","01;49;22;01","Too. Well, interesting discussion. Maybe we can each give a closing thought and then I have a short quote to close based on something Dean said, but it's it's a really interesting paper. I think we all enjoyed reading it. It really does point the way towards what does a generalized computational phenomenology or at the very least, without getting experience into the mix, what is a computation or framing of mental action?"
"Unknown","01;49;22;19","01;49;54;19","Is that a paradox in and of itself? Is it impossible? Is mental action just like a no go or is mental action going to be understood to be everything or the iceberg that isn't the tip of the iceberg? Blue so just a final thought, you know, meta, this metacognitive aspect, you know that the idea of identity dissolution and I do think it was mentioned in this paper."
"Unknown","01;49;54;19","01;50;24;11","But just briefly, what about under the influence of psychedelic drugs where we know we have this identity dissolution and this ego dissolution, this expansion of the cognitive boundary. So so when you have psychedelics, how is the metacognitive hierarchy influenced, disrupted? Is it obliterated? Is it enhanced? So I'd be interested to see if the authors go down that road in the future or to see someone, you know, take it to that level."
"Unknown","01;50;24;11","01;50;54;17","Exploring the metacognition of people under the influence of hallucinogenics thanks to Dean, I think back in the two zeros, we were wondering about whether or not this this paper and the stuff that it points to could be used for nefarious purposes. And I think I commented back then that it I used to work with a lot of people who are spending a lot of time with focus and attention on task."
"Unknown","01;50;55;16","01;51;29;28","And I just like to sort of keep that where that is, because I know that's a thing and I'd like to just sort of hold it up with the background of what we're available to that availability piece, because I think that's the more powerful thing and I'm not sure that that's necessarily threatening. But I think if we can have conversations with people about how active inference acts as an availability enhancer, they might be more attracted to this and not necessarily see it as something that people could use for for nasty purposes."
"Unknown","01;51;30;02","01;51;54;03","I mean, there's going to be people out there going to do their nasty thing, but I think there's actually a really, really empathetic and sincere aspect to this that isn't just exploitable, but is really explore horrible and is really kind of cool. We'll have a quantitative framework for saying that we would prefer if they didn't, even though we expect them to behave the way that they're expecting."
"Unknown","01;51;54;19","01;52;38;18","But we'll have an interaction sequence that might change the way that that works Stephen Yeah, a couple of points. Well, one, it might be interesting to see what Adam Safran makes of some of this with the psychedelics as he's just started a postdoc now at in psychedelics at Johns Hopkins. So that B I'd be interested in. And then I suppose the other thing that I've noticed is, as with some of the nefarious actions and I think you're right, but I think also what I've noticed is some of the kind of intuitive, nefarious actions of politics who are particularly adept at getting people on their side."
"Unknown","01;52;39;07","01;52;58;19","It may actually be that some of that they're doing to kind of like some sort of roundabout intuitive artistic route, this might help us reverse engineer how they're doing it. So there might also be some benefits to, to, to understanding what is it they're doing, even if they don't quite know how to describe it."
"Unknown","01;53;01;02","01;53;13;21","Dean, just want to I think you're absolutely right, Steve. And I think if we you if we are able to make this available to more people, their bullshit detectors are going to get really, really improved."
"Unknown","01;53;16;13","01;53;46;26","So the closing quote to hopefully bring some of these threads together, we talked a lot about, you know, distributed versus centralized sense making and what is the role of scrutiny and scrutinize or like Dean brought up and of course GEB Hofstadter spoke from 1979 but another work of art from 1979 was Frank Zappa song Central scrutinize her and just closing with some of the first lines of that poem this is the central scrutinize her."
"Unknown","01;53;47;05","01;54;05;08","It is my responsibility to enforce all the laws that haven't been passed yet. It is also my responsibility to alert each and every one of you to the potential consequences of various ordinary everyday activities you might be performing which could eventually lead to the death penalty or affect your parent's credit rating."
"Unknown","01;54;08;21","01;54;27;10","Thank you everybody though. Fun times. See you in times. See you in times. See you in times. See you in times. See you in times. See you in times. See you in times. See you in times. See you in times. See you in times. See you in times."
