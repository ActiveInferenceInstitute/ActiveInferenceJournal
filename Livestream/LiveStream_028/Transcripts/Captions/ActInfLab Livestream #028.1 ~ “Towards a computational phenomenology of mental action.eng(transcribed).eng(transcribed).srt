00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,759
stream number 28.1

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,799
it's september 7th 2021

4
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,800
welcome to the active inference lab

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,439
we are a participatory online lab that

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,439
is communicating learning and practicing

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,519
applied active inference you can find us

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,160
at the links on this page

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,000
this is recorded in an archived live

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,359
stream so please provide us with

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,000
feedback so we can improve our work

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,520
all backgrounds and perspectives are

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,920
welcome here and we'll follow video

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,160
etiquette for live streams

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,440
today on september 7th and next tuesday

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,120
we're going to be discussing this paper

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,000
on computational phenomenology then we

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
haven't set the paper for 29 yet and

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,320
then we have a few papers set for

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,719
october

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,039
today the goal is just to

22
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,239
learn and discuss this very cool paper

23
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,559
towards a computational phenomenology of

24
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:01,920
mental action

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,840
modeling meta awareness and attentional

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,600
control with the parametric active

27
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,640
inference

28
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,720
and we're really appreciative that lars

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,360
the first author is here to discuss with

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,400
us

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,960
so we're just going to

32
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,040
start wherever we start and go from

33
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,000
there i guess i think each of us here

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,479
probably brought some questions and

35
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,560
anyone who has a question the live chat

36
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,720
can ask it

37
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,159
so let's just

38
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,760
introduce ourselves um

39
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,119
[Music]

40
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,400
and end with a author and go from there

41
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,520
so i'm daniel i'm a postdoc in

42
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,240
california and i'll pass it to dean

43
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,560
good morning i'm dean i'm

44
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,720
retired i'm in calgary i'm in canada and

45
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,159
the work that i do

46
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,920
ties in nicely with this idea of being

47
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,759
able to

48
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,719
bring some precision to how we learn

49
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,680
so

50
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,920
i will

51
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,960
say who can i pass it to so dave um

52
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,000
david

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,320
he's usually on mute yeah he might be on

54
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,800
text-to-speech mode which is fine

55
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,479
right but um

56
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,000
welcome dave and we'll pass to lars so

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,760
lars welcome to

58
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,920
this discussion and just thanks again

59
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,280
for joining we're

60
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,280
happy to hear any introduction

61
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,680
and then we'll go from there

62
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,760
yeah sure well thanks excuse me thank

63
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,440
you thanks for having me i'm kind of

64
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,840
excited to be here it sounds like a fun

65
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,480
couple hours ahead of us um uh

66
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,319
just sending regards from the other

67
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,560
co-authors as well obviously like a lot

68
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,239
of these papers this has emerged in

69
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,319
collaboration with uh other people and

70
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,239
they couldn't make it here today so

71
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,920
um but i'm glad i'm able to be here so

72
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,040
my name is lars um i'm based at my

73
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,319
affiliation is with the university of

74
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,319
lyon in france i'm doing my phd there

75
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,720
and my focus is

76
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,599
explicitly on meditation actually

77
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,560
and that's

78
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,319
what i'm interested in is what brought

79
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,879
me into academia i had a first stint in

80
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,519
academia in physics

81
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,760
a while ago and kind of left it and went

82
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,360
into corporate stuff for a little while

83
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,519
and then it was drawn back in by i'm

84
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,920
disinterested in in meditation sorry

85
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,000
there's a bit of background noise i

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,519
don't know if you can hear it

87
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,360
but um

88
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,040
yeah i'll i guess i'll leave it at that

89
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,440
the the kind of genesis here

90
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,920
was from that from that angle through

91
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,319
meditation and ending up in in carl's

92
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,360
lab and

93
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,120
and asking questions around the tension

94
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,959
and and meta awareness

95
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,080
um through that lens of of practice and

96
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,640
that's where this kind of paper emerged

97
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,840
from so

98
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,040
we'll get into that a little bit more

99
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,359
detail

100
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,480
and where did active inference come into

101
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,440
play

102
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,519
was it from something you were learning

103
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,120
about from

104
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,959
that practice perspective like you

105
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,120
mentioned or a theory driven perspective

106
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,879
or did a collaborator bring it to the

107
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,080
table

108
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,799
it was a collaborator so i

109
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,959
i i sort of came into

110
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,799
computational neuroscience

111
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,519
um looking explicitly to contribute to

112
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,799
the field of meditation research and so

113
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,560
i'd reached out to a lab in lyon

114
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,120
one of the co-authors um and uh joined

115
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,120
the lab there and they had a like an

116
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,238
ongoing

117
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,960
uh relationship with uh carl frisson's

118
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,080
lab

119
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,320
because jeremy matu is one of the

120
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,600
co-authors here uh did his postdoc over

121
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,639
at ucl

122
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,040
and so they had a bit of an idea for an

123
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,240
attention project um uh using active

124
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,240
inference and i kind of came in not

125
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,160
really knowing very much about it um but

126
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,479
you get to learn and then i was sent off

127
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,280
to

128
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,600
london with a pretty open

129
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,240
blank check as it were of like see if

130
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,280
you can figure out how to apply this to

131
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,000
meditation and attention and we had some

132
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,600
some some directions that we were

133
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,880
thinking about but then what ended up

134
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,520
emerging was this uh hierarchical sort

135
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,919
of deep parametric uh um stuff

136
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,360
ooh interesting how it kind of came to

137
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,240
yeah

138
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,320
it really was right right right place

139
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,360
right time they were looking for

140
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,560
somebody

141
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,000
the physics background with an interest

142
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
in meditation and uh computational

143
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
neuroscience and i sent them an email

144
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,720
and

145
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,880
that was pretty much the extent of the

146
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,159
interview process and off i went

147
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,759
cool well welcome steven um dean or

148
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,400
steven if you have a question you can

149
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,880
raise your hand or of course anyone in

150
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,240
the chat

151
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,280
um

152
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,600
maybe dean did you uh want to talk about

153
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,199
a crosswalk or something like that that

154
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,199
yeah i want to do that later but i don't

155
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,919
asking so it's fantastic to get the

156
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,919
background about the meditation piece

157
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,120
because

158
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,120
when i before i picked up the paper what

159
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,520
i was wondering about was how

160
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,240
precision plays a role in learning and

161
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,919
especially when you're moving from novel

162
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,160
contexts and trying to familiarize

163
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,160
yourself with something

164
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,759
and so for me

165
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,560
my

166
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,960
my curiosity was around the idea that

167
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,720
when you have the simple model

168
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,680
and then you move to these um

169
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,840
more nested paradigms you're kind of

170
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,840
moving from the unplanned because you

171
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,720
can't plan your perception to the plan

172
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,319
the idea of being able to think about

173
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,520
your thinking

174
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,160
and so that transition was what really

175
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,000
fascinated me so now that you brought up

176
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,680
the idea of meditation i wonder how

177
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,000
meditation goes from the unplanned to

178
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,080
the plan so you've opened up a pandora's

179
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,000
box for me because now

180
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,160
my original question is kind of now i've

181
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,919
been taking down this tangent so i'm

182
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,560
curious right well i mean i can speak to

183
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,639
that a little

184
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,520
a little bit um

185
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,720
the

186
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,919
the the the idea for me going in here

187
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,360
was to

188
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,560
um

189
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,520
see i mean just intuitively as soon as i

190
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,680
got familiar with active inference there

191
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,039
was a

192
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,800
um a resonance there in terms of how

193
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,720
the maths seems to echo a lot of

194
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,000
the

195
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,319
kinds of ways that people talk about

196
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,120
practice in general there's this sort of

197
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,720
balance between

198
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,599
um you know attention

199
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,599
and the the

200
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,479
the

201
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,080
that our perception is this this

202
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,280
combination of prior and observation

203
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,639
you know that idea and like how these

204
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,800
two things are balanced and and getting

205
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,479
into um the optimal space there is very

206
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,599
very

207
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,440
close to you know if you start thinking

208
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,199
about mindfulness obviously is a way of

209
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,880
paying attention and increasing the

210
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,800
impact of the sensory observations but

211
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,240
then also things like

212
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,360
um

213
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,160
don't know mind beginner's mind uh this

214
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,520
kind of fresh

215
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,479
kind of uh stance that is very common in

216
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,960
zen but in other in other areas as well

217
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,720
and so already there's this kind of like

218
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,919
oh there's something there's something

219
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,319
here um and

220
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,080
so i arrived at

221
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,319
carl's lab and and what i started out

222
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,680
with was just getting familiar with the

223
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,599
attention literature

224
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,199
because that's

225
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,520
at least you know the a good way in for

226
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,360
meditation because at least in the very

227
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,960
beginning that's what it's all about and

228
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,319
in some ways it's about that right to

229
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,960
the end but um so the question was uh

230
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,400
you know how do we

231
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,520
uh talk about paying attention um within

232
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,720
the

233
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,720
already and i was really fortunate

234
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,240
because i was kind of coming into the

235
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,199
space

236
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,000
uh when all the scaffolding and the

237
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,120
maths i needed to start talking about

238
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,479
this in a more

239
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,958
practice related way or a metacognitive

240
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,120
way was already there

241
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,640
all it really needed was somebody to

242
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,360
come in and ask a question that was for

243
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,600
me phenomenologically driven

244
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,880
which was

245
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,760
in

246
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,160
meditation

247
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,440
you are

248
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,279
paying attention for sure right you are

249
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,640
deliberately paying attention to some

250
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,720
object you know traditionally the breath

251
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,120
but really the aim of the game

252
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,640
is uh or an an additional part of that

253
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,240
which is really really important is

254
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,519
being able to monitor where your

255
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,279
attention is

256
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,480
so in other words being able to pay

257
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,959
attention to attention

258
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,200
and so that's where that kind of shift

259
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,480
happened right you mentioned like

260
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,080
thinking about thinking it's like well

261
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,760
okay so if we know some of the maths

262
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,880
about you know what it means to pay

263
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,000
attention

264
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,880
um

265
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,399
what would it mean to pay attention to

266
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,600
attention and what would it mean to be

267
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,640
able to have control over the

268
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,320
intentional states and how would this

269
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,320
how would we

270
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,480
make that an allowable thing within

271
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,920
within the framework

272
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,080
um yeah so exactly the deep affective

273
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,680
framework kind of set the set the scene

274
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,880
for that um and casper casper tells work

275
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,959
sort of gave the gave the hint and that

276
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,240
was on a different precision in the

277
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,360
model and here we're just talking about

278
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,120
likelihood precision and then that kind

279
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,399
of created this

280
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,600
this um

281
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,440
opportunity then right that then becomes

282
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,399
almost generalizable across and that's

283
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,839
and we can get to it a bit later but

284
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,680
really what i'm more excited about in

285
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,040
this in this

286
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,959
uh whole work and

287
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,040
paper really is what we start to hint at

288
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,640
at the in the discussion

289
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,720
at the end um pointing to the fact that

290
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,320
we could generalize this across

291
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,320
precision throughout the model that

292
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
could then be interpreted in as

293
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,480
different forms of mental action and

294
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,160
what that might mean for

295
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,760
understanding

296
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,200
yeah i mean

297
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,399
it gets broad at that point yeah

298
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,320
awesome thank you for the summary and

299
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,959
welcome blue at all

300
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,399
at feline

301
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,920
so stephen with a raised hand and then

302
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,600
any live chat or anyone else with a

303
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,160
raised hand

304
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,160
yeah welcome um

305
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,399
yeah i was i'm really curious i like the

306
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,320
what you're saying about the

307
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,440
generalizability or the potential for

308
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,360
generalizability and you're

309
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,720
sort of extending beyond neuro

310
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,240
phenomenology

311
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,720
to phenomenology in general i suppose is

312
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,680
a name

313
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,480
i'm curious how how you see action

314
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,440
potentially coming in with meditation

315
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,040
because you talk about sort of

316
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,000
reflecting on mental states

317
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,760
like breathing is an action i suppose

318
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,519
but in many cases

319
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,800
they use

320
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,040
meditation because you're

321
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,560
reducing the amount of action that's

322
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,079
happening in the amount of visual

323
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,000
stimulus because of often the eyes are

324
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,040
shut you know bodies contained and

325
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,519
um and now i see that you know okay so

326
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,360
how does this then come back into an

327
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,040
action state and i know that there's a

328
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,279
kind of in between with like i know

329
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,320
vipisana type meditation on the body

330
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,839
senses or

331
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,519
like you mentioned the breath but i'm

332
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,240
curious how you see

333
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,839
that kind of

334
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,399
inactive piece starting to come in

335
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,640
through this

336
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,800
no thanks for the question and it's a

337
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,720
really central one

338
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,959
um because

339
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,720
i mean i guess to give a little bit more

340
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,000
history to

341
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,880
the this paper there was this is also

342
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,079
building on a little bit of some of the

343
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,440
intuitions of previous work by

344
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,240
antoine jeremy and another collaborator

345
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,279
giuseppe pagoni um and they wrote a

346
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,959
paper called

347
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,760
on the epistemic value of inaction

348
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,399
uh which speaks to this this point

349
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,160
um i think

350
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,279
to

351
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,440
in the begin off from the from the

352
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,440
outside we can kind of separate you know

353
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,480
mental action and over action

354
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,160
and meditation you know you're putting

355
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,079
yourself in this situation where you you

356
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,680
know deliberately don't have that much

357
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,079
over action right you're sitting still

358
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,639
um and yet you're doing things you're

359
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,399
definitely doing things with your mind

360
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,560
um even sort of

361
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,279
do nothing meditation is still a kind of

362
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,440
doing in a sense um

363
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,360
although it gets a little bit sticky um

364
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,800
but the

365
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,160
for me

366
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,760
to answer your question

367
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,480
the

368
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,040
the cessation of

369
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,040
overt action

370
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,120
puts you in this

371
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,800
highly epistemic

372
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,839
state because now the sort of

373
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:04,000
self-evidencing side of the equation

374
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,600
you're putting yourself in a situation

375
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,399
where

376
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,639
that is harder to

377
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,959
access so that

378
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,800
um

379
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,680
you

380
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,079
you no longer can fulfill your

381
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,040
expectations through you know action

382
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,399
acting in the world right so like um

383
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,920
if you were to sit down and start

384
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,600
getting um

385
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,920
agitated or bored

386
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,160
rather than the sort of fulfilling the

387
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,519
expectation there that you shouldn't be

388
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,279
bored by going and doing something you

389
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,279
have to stay stay bored and there's a

390
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,800
certain discomfort that can arise from

391
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,839
that and then

392
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,240
the role of mindfulness or acceptance in

393
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,160
that moment it becomes central but then

394
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,720
what it allows then for is that that

395
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,240
your model has to update right if the

396
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,360
model can't

397
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,519
be sort of you can't find evidence for

398
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,120
it well then you gotta you gotta update

399
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,800
it and there you get to this notion of

400
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,639
vipassana right which is like inside

401
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,199
clear seeing inside right is that you're

402
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,440
learning something through through that

403
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,360
that wasn't available to you the moment

404
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,880
the moment before

405
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,880
and like apologies to everybody out

406
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,240
there who's like maybe very into the

407
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,760
meditation that like this is very sort

408
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,360
of hand-wavy way i'm talking about it

409
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,880
especially kind of like matching it over

410
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,800
to the over to active imprints a very

411
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,639
sort of loose way but that was kind of

412
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:17,360
the

413
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,279
the the gut

414
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,079
um intuition anyway coming into it and

415
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,199
remains remains the the intuition and i

416
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,240
think there's

417
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,600
this really

418
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,040
for me anyway and where i'm kind of

419
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,030
seeing my my

420
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,120
[Music]

421
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,639
career with this going just is the very

422
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,120
beginning of an exploration of how to

423
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,399
how to

424
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,920
articulate

425
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,760
meditations

426
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,320
different practices what they how they

427
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,360
might cash out in terms of um precision

428
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,279
dynamics different forms of learning

429
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,519
different forms of optimization and what

430
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,560
that might

431
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,720
mean you know for us so i think that's

432
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,079
why i wanted to start with attention

433
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,160
because it's pretty uncontroversial as

434
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,839
it were and just start building up the

435
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,279
building blocks and be able to start

436
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,120
making

437
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,720
more and more interesting

438
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,480
inferences about what it might mean to

439
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,560
be doing other kinds of of practice

440
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,600
awesome answer thank you

441
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,360
so

442
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,399
blue

443
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,120
or

444
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,079
yes go for it blue

445
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,040
hi so i don't know if you had a chance

446
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,360
to watch the discussion or like the

447
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,440
preliminary um discussion we did

448
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,320
yesterday but something that came up was

449
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,120
um

450
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,360
in the idea so daniel can you flip to

451
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,000
the circle about like uh tension and

452
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,199
attention

453
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,639
um

454
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,759
here the cycle this one

455
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,320
yeah that one so something that came up

456
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,199
there

457
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:43,920
uh

458
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,440
when we were discussing this figure was

459
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,399
like the

460
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,160
the discrete steps between like

461
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,639
distracted awareness of distraction

462
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,040
redirection of attention and focus

463
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,720
like you know there's kind of like an

464
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,959
intuitive um

465
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,759
feeling that the the

466
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,920
distracted awareness of distraction and

467
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,399
redirection of attention back to focus

468
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,160
is like discrete but like there's a

469
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,480
transition that's kind of muddy going

470
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,279
from focused to distracted and something

471
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,440
that i thought about was like you can

472
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,600
become so intensely

473
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,600
focused on something and like the

474
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,639
example that i'll give you because

475
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,320
you'll relate is like going down a

476
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,160
scientific rabbit hole like we're

477
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,920
chasing reference after reference after

478
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,079
reference and so you're still on task

479
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,360
and you're still correctly paying

480
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,279
attention to what it is you're supposed

481
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,279
to be paying attention to but like

482
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,040
you're so focused that you're finally

483
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,639
off task right because you just start

484
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,399
getting interested in other things

485
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,880
and so it's kind of a gradual transition

486
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,120
from focus like you're still focused but

487
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,120
you're you're like focused on the wrong

488
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,720
thing and so i just wasn't being like

489
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,639
where in this model do you think that

490
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,399
kind of like focus until you're so

491
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,920
focused you're not paying attention like

492
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,360
where does that like

493
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,440
come into this or how would you think to

494
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,360
model something like that

495
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,160
yeah thanks for the question so this uh

496
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,240
model that we're seeing here is of

497
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,079
course

498
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,199
a bit of a caricature right it's it's

499
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,319
it's a

500
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,280
it's an intuitive sort of description of

501
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,559
what's happening because you're right

502
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,959
there's degrees of distraction

503
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,039
and you know meditation we talk about

504
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,720
you you actually can classify these you

505
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,400
know those when you sit down to try and

506
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,079
pay attention to the breath there are

507
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,319
times when you've totally forgotten that

508
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,679
you were even meant to be meditating and

509
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,679
you were like gone right you're thinking

510
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:28,960
about something completely different and

511
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,760
then the timer goes off and you become

512
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,200
aware that you were completely gone but

513
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,640
then there's other things that are much

514
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,440
more subtle right this like

515
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,679
maybe you notice some sound in the room

516
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,600
or you know some sensations in the body

517
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,840
but still somewhere in your awareness

518
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,240
the breath it remains present but maybe

519
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,919
less and more in a background foreground

520
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,160
kind of situation and so like are you

521
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,000
distracted then or not

522
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,360
and to what extent

523
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,039
um and all these things and kind of

524
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,640
everything in between right

525
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,679
um so in terms of how that would cash

526
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,280
out here

527
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,799
the first thing to kind of point out to

528
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,640
is that the the precision parameter that

529
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,440
we're talking about is a continuous

530
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,840
parameter and so it doesn't have to be

531
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,320
um relating to discrete states and we

532
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,440
could have been free to um

533
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,080
grand euro like make more granular the

534
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,440
attentional state so it's not just

535
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,400
distracted or or focused um and sort of

536
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,200
have

537
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,320
grades of of focus

538
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,320
would have been possible but then the

539
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,200
other thing that isn't modeled here

540
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,720
is

541
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,720
what are you distracted by

542
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,840
um here distraction was just uh not

543
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,919
paying attention to the thing

544
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,080
but in reality distraction is your

545
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,799
attention being grabbed by some other

546
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,080
stimulus

547
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,280
um and for some particular reason

548
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,320
and

549
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,679
that is not uh shown in in this way

550
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,200
that's something that we're hoping to

551
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,000
start to work on in the in the future

552
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,360
part of the reason

553
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,480
why

554
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,120
uh we didn't go down that direction here

555
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,960
in detail is because

556
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,320
there's still a

557
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,880
i think a really central

558
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,919
part that is is difficult to tease out

559
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,600
still at the moment which is attentional

560
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,720
resource

561
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,240
you know in in some ways you could

562
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,799
you could run this simulation and given

563
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,520
the preferences on wanting to be

564
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,880
paying attention

565
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,480
if you put that preference on a bunch of

566
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,039
different observations there's nothing

567
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,120
stopping the agent just

568
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,200
paying attention to all of it right

569
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,160
maximally and having really high

570
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,880
precision observations across the board

571
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,120
now that doesn't seem to be what we're

572
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,360
able to be there seems to be like a

573
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,919
a finite um

574
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,840
something finite about it and so when

575
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,120
you're paying attention to one thing

576
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,039
it's at the exclusion of something else

577
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,120
and maybe part of practice and part of

578
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,919
you know what you're getting in

579
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,120
meditation is that that you know is

580
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,880
softening a little bit your ability to

581
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,000
sort of pay attention to more than one

582
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,919
thing or have more allocation resources

583
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,679
there in some way that might be learned

584
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,120
over time but that's not

585
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,600
um that's not shown shown here which is

586
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,120
why you don't get that

587
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,559
um

588
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,320
what you're talking about that kind of

589
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,600
intuitive

590
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,880
organic

591
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,360
uh feeling of what it means to be what

592
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,640
it really means to be distracted

593
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,240
awesome i have a

594
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,799
question and then blue so we've talked a

595
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,240
lot about how

596
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,200
spatial goals are set and even how some

597
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,520
symbolic goals are set like sentence

598
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,720
structure

599
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,240
but how are cognitive goals set

600
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,880
so are they reducible to sensory

601
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,120
preferences if so just the preference

602
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,440
for you know some salt and sugar that's

603
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,360
not going to really reduce your options

604
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,520
in the city so how do we set those

605
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,720
higher level and these increasingly like

606
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,400
abstract

607
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,080
and ephemeral cognitive goals

608
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,280
yeah no thank you for that daniel um

609
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,280
this is the the question i'm working on

610
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,960
right now actually and on a follow-up

611
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,000
paper where

612
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
i'm trying to take this model and and

613
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,799
and

614
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,679
specifically model uh focused attention

615
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,039
meditation

616
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,000
and

617
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,640
in that and in practice in general the

618
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,679
the question of motivation and goal is

619
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,159
really central and where where in the

620
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,480
model are you actually putting

621
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,720
like how are you driving

622
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,440
the attention behavior or meditation

623
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,480
behavior

624
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,360
um

625
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,880
one of the

626
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,480
ways the way that i did it here

627
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,919
was to say that in this kind of setup

628
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,080
that the agent is given an instruction

629
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,480
hey i want you to pay attention to this

630
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,679
stimuli and that that then translates to

631
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,240
them wanting to see themselves

632
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,720
um in an in the attentional focused

633
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,280
state and so the way that the dynamics

634
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,960
here are driven is by having a

635
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,880
preference on that attentional state um

636
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,280
and observations of that state so the

637
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,120
kind of like metacognitive observations

638
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,960
of seeing yourself paying paying

639
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,159
attention

640
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,480
here yeah thank you so oh

641
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,280
to

642
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,679
there um we put a preference

643
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:12,480
on

644
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,640
uh those ones exactly

645
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,960
um and uh

646
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,200
just as a side note there you might

647
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,640
think like oh but do those observations

648
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,480
uh exist really are they sincere

649
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,159
observations what kinds of observations

650
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,520
are these

651
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,440
um and i think that's a valid valid

652
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,480
question and something we talked about

653
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,320
for a while but

654
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,919
my

655
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,600
intuition here is that you know if i

656
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,919
were to ask you the question

657
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,679
um what are you paying attention to

658
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:40,960
right now

659
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,000
right

660
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,919
and you're gonna be able to give me an

661
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,960
answer from having observed something um

662
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,080
and so there's some kind of an

663
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,440
observation there that you're able to

664
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,760
make that you can

665
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,080
use to infer uh what attentional state

666
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,840
that you're in so anyway that's where

667
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,039
the preferences is is uh

668
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,080
there

669
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,440
you know i prefer to observe myself

670
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,200
paying attention

671
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,360
exactly so then

672
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,400
the question is what is it that drives

673
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,720
uh

674
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,520
you know like a practice and i've been

675
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,679
inspired by some of the work

676
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:16,880
by

677
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,400
um

678
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,080
uh mirza and colleagues on sort of scene

679
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:24,960
um

680
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,440
classification or scene as a foreseen

681
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,559
perception

682
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,120
we're there there seems to be this

683
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,559
attentional

684
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,840
driving of attentional

685
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,200
policies given another kind of

686
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,120
preference which is to

687
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,760
resolve a scene which is to clearly

688
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,520
perceive a scene

689
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,159
um and that's actually the way that i'm

690
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,880
i'm i'm starting to think about um at

691
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,880
least in a practice context in like a

692
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,159
meditation context because in reality

693
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,640
when you're meditating it's not so much

694
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,440
that you're trying to pay attention to

695
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,559
the breath although we talk about it

696
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,799
like that it's more like you're trying

697
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,159
to be continuously aware of the breath

698
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,640
um so you have some kind of a

699
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,000
preference on

700
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,679
um

701
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,600
perception or being able to be sort of

702
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,520
being able to resolve um a hidden state

703
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,799
and that that is then what

704
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,120
drives the kind of dynamics behind the

705
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,439
scenes

706
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,760
that's pretty interesting thank you for

707
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,120
the response blue

708
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,320
sure that kind of slides in nicely to um

709
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,320
what i was gonna ask so as a follow-up

710
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,159
to my question earlier and also to

711
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,000
daniel's question daniel can you flip to

712
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,440
the mind wandering side yes

713
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,840
thank you

714
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,039
so

715
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,679
i had a question here um and these are

716
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,159
two different models the one on the left

717
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,000
specifically is from the mind life

718
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,360
institute

719
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,960
by a

720
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,520
phd who works with um you know

721
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,000
meditators right and so and then the one

722
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,880
on the

723
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,080
right i'm not sure if that's an explicit

724
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,720
uh meditation task but i just thought

725
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,360
there was an interesting context here

726
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,039
so this paper on the right which is the

727
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,240
neural model of mind wandering

728
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,760
so you have like this paradigm where

729
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,440
you're on task which is like in the

730
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,600
meditation context say focus on the

731
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,600
breath or i mean maybe it's not focused

732
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,120
on the breath but i just i think about

733
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,520
meditation as you know being present in

734
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,919
the in the present right being in your

735
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,840
in your body aware of your hands feet

736
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,159
breath etc yes

737
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,159
so there's this model where you're on

738
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,919
task which is like focused on what you

739
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,080
should be focused on in present and and

740
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,880
then mind wandering they talk about as

741
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,279
the pursuit of internal goals which i

742
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,480
thought was interesting but i think

743
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,600
about that

744
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,520
in terms of like thinking about your

745
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,120
shopping list or all the things that

746
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,240
you're not supposed to be thinking about

747
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,080
while you're meditating right like just

748
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,159
going off and pursuing your own internal

749
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,240
goal oriented thoughts and then they

750
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,000
have a separate like category for being

751
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,760
actually off task

752
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,440
which is like where you're not thinking

753
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,880
about anything you should be thinking

754
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,240
about was just thinking about like

755
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,360
random like whatever nonsense um and so

756
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,520
i just wonder like do you

757
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,279
or could you think about making those

758
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,520
kinds of distinctions in this kind of

759
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,919
like and it goes from from being focused

760
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,360
on the right thing to focus on the wrong

761
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,120
thing like where does this off

762
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,840
task come into play i'm just curious if

763
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,320
you have any thoughts on that

764
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,600
um

765
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,080
i'm not exactly sure how they talk about

766
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,600
off task but what i could just talk

767
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,200
about here is the distinction between

768
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,520
um

769
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,120
to me the the distinction here comes

770
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,960
down to the meta awareness piece

771
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,080
right where

772
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,120
on task is pretty understandable

773
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,000
off task you could imagine just doing

774
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,440
something else but aware of that fact

775
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,279
you know like i've just decided to

776
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,279
change and start focusing on something

777
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,960
else but there's sort of a metacognitive

778
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,720
awareness of the fact that you are doing

779
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,240
something else

780
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,720
whereas mind wondering is this

781
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,480
uh slightly

782
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,679
or at least the way that we're talking

783
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,559
about it here um different situation

784
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,640
where you're distracted or you're paying

785
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,159
attention by when i said distracted just

786
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,760
been paying attention to something you

787
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,679
hadn't intended to pay attention to but

788
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,200
also not

789
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,440
aware of that fact

790
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,840
right you haven't updated the fact that

791
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,640
you're that that that's happening um and

792
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,720
that's the crucial piece here that we're

793
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,799
trying to regulate right with uh

794
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,799
practice or or whatever in in an

795
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,120
intentional in an attentional task

796
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,000
and

797
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,120
for that distinction i think i think um

798
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,640
active inference kind of

799
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,320
you know it almost gives you that for

800
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,760
free in a sense to kind of show you

801
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,600
where where that phase

802
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,960
would be and that's what we were kind of

803
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,480
showing in the results is that that

804
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,360
period of of updating of where your

805
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,720
attentional state

806
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,520
is

807
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,679
when you sort of think it's one but it's

808
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,559
actually another um so you think you're

809
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,399
paying attention or you're somewhere you

810
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:07,760
don't really know where you what you're

811
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,760
doing but you're pa you're distracted is

812
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,760
then how we would sort of

813
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,279
express that or

814
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,840
cash that out

815
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,120
computationally blue is that a quick

816
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,960
follow-up yes

817
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,279
in terms of active inference

818
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,640
um so it is so i just wonder is

819
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,360
like off task or am i wondering like i

820
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,039
had never thought to split those two

821
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,120
apart until i saw this this paper and

822
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,720
maybe check it out if you have time at

823
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,320
some time but

824
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,880
but really like i think about this mind

825
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,880
wandering is this like epistemic

826
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,840
exploration is is that like i mean is it

827
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,440
exploitation when you're on task and

828
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,640
you're focused on what you should be and

829
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,240
then is it you know we think about

830
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,320
active inference in terms of optimizing

831
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,880
exploration and exploitation uh is there

832
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,640
a room and a model for that epistemic

833
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,799
exploration or is it always like a bad

834
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,720
thing

835
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,480
is it always a bad thing

836
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,000
you know i don't have a i don't have a

837
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,600
good answer for you to be honest this is

838
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,360
what we kind of want to

839
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,039
go towards when i was saying you know

840
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,279
what are you distracted by and what's

841
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,279
the why behind

842
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,640
you know the default bone network

843
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,159
basically like what is what is the

844
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,039
value of that on the one hand

845
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,120
i could imagine that yeah there's a

846
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,640
there's sort of like an epistemic

847
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,039
wandering through state space and future

848
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,240
possibilities and just sort of

849
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,720
monitoring of potential negative

850
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,919
outcomes in the

851
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,360
in the future

852
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,640
um with

853
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,919
for which there's obviously value um

854
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,360
and i don't think it's necessarily a bad

855
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,720
thing i think when

856
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,240
when i

857
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,080
you know in a practice context anyway

858
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,159
it's like that

859
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,320
that action can also lead to discomfort

860
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,880
now and anxiety now um because you're

861
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,440
sort of simulating future bad events and

862
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,799
there's actually a great paper casper

863
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,480
wrote a good paper on that

864
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,919
um deep i've read it yeah yeah the

865
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,720
simulated future events well and so

866
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,840
often meditating like frees up space in

867
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,520
your mind i mean i don't know if you've

868
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,799
had the experience but like where you're

869
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,240
not thinking about

870
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,120
some

871
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,320
other problem but like you'll be

872
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,840
meditating and like whoa have this like

873
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,080
brilliant flash of brilliance or like

874
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,679
key moments of insight right like be

875
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,159
possible so there's just like ins but

876
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,080
it's maybe not insight into like some

877
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,240
internal like deep spiritual discovery

878
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,240
but it might be like insight into some

879
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,080
external problem that you're having so

880
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:24,799
there's

881
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,480
there's that and so i wonder like that

882
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,480
might be the difference between off task

883
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,240
and mind wandering like if you're off

884
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,640
task it's like maybe a non-beneficial or

885
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,640
like there's no excuse for

886
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,559
it's just like doing blah blah whatever

887
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,640
and then mind wandering might be like

888
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,039
exploring your neural space and in like

889
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,279
a recombination phase and think about

890
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,039
that so anyway it's just something to

891
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,960
think about going forward

892
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,000
interesting

893
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,159
interesting i think the the the notion

894
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,360
of insight

895
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,320
and

896
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,080
the

897
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,799
kind of why practice leads to that

898
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,120
is really exciting place to start

899
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,799
thinking about like what is it about

900
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,640
paying attention in a particular way

901
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,200
that leads to these moments of

902
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,240
aha

903
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,480
right

904
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,600
thanks i'm going to read a question from

905
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,559
dave

907
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,600
a practice i've been following based in

908
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,559
naropa institute's shamatha practice but

909
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,120
not much stress there is to attend only

910
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,279
intermittently say

911
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,039
permit mind wandering during the out

912
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,600
breath but attend during the in-breath

913
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,519
there are two effects obsessional

914
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,120
thoughts are disattended without

915
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,080
intending to disattend to any content

916
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,559
the motion of this attention dis of the

917
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,080
transition from disattentive to

918
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,360
attentive

919
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,080
occurs many times the usual

920
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,080
return gently to resting the attention

921
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,200
on the breath

922
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,880
happens several times a minute rather

923
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,120
than several times per hour does anyone

924
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,320
else do this

925
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,039
or discuss it maybe to warn against it

926
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,039
close parentheses hyphen to your

927
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,960
knowledge

928
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,799
i like that i didn't know i haven't

929
00:31:58,799 --> 00:31:59,600
heard

930
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,080
of a practice like that before but in

931
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,120
the way that you're describing it i

932
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,640
could see a way that would be really

933
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,679
really

934
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,840
powerful and really useful because

935
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,559
one of the pitfalls

936
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:11,840
i can tell how this conversation is

937
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,559
going to go more and more into

938
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,720
meditation

939
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,279
but but i'm i'm i'm i'm up for that i'm

940
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:18,720
game um but one of the one of the

941
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,200
pitfalls of course in in

942
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,200
in practice is

943
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,200
is all the subtle ways in which

944
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,679
resistance can come up towards our own

945
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:28,640
minds

946
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,000
and if we are paying attention and we

947
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
start to see distractions as things that

948
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,679
are stopping us from paying attention

949
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,679
and that we don't want

950
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,360
right then it creates this tension and

951
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,960
is actually counter to what we want to

952
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,880
be going for and i could see how by

953
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,480
deliberately letting mind wondering

954
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,240
happening and coming back it sort of

955
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,360
cuts that tendency to have resistance to

956
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,440
to thoughts which actually just ends up

957
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,720
perpetuating them or giving them um more

958
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,880
uh potency in the mind whereas really

959
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,480
the aim is to pay attention to the

960
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,080
breath and it's funny because when we

961
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,519
say pay attention we think like it's

962
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,120
this like

963
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,039
focus you know thing

964
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,919
in reality 90 of it is relaxation and

965
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,039
letting go

966
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,440
and letting go of

967
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,320
the

968
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,159
resistance to distractions distractions

969
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,159
come and then we come back back to the

970
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,000
breath and that's what kind of does does

971
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,360
the work so i would love to um

972
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,559
i'm gonna look into that a little bit

973
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,080
more detail that style of style of

974
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,679
practice would be interesting to see

975
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,440
when we have a more fleshed out version

976
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,200
of this like how

977
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,360
um different approaches to practice

978
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,200
might lead to different kind of learning

979
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,519
outcomes at different rates etc

980
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,159
that topic of distraction it's like if

981
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,640
somebody were a captain and they cited

982
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,080
something very subtle that wouldn't be a

983
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,120
distraction that'd be on task

984
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,279
so then there's this aspect of the

985
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,960
multiple levels like there's the eye

986
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,159
circading

987
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,320
and then there's higher higher and

988
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,919
modeled in this paper greeting scott

989
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,720
at slower and slower kind of clicks of

990
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,240
the model

991
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,559
and uh so it's just interesting yeah

992
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,560
what a distraction implicitly says that

993
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,320
it's not on task

994
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,079
because if it was even something that

995
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,960
was unexpected that drew the regime of

996
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,119
attention that way if it were relevant

997
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:19,119
for the task

998
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,960
then it would still be considered not a

999
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,960
distraction part of the relevant stimuli

1000
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,679
for the task but the exact same stimulus

1001
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,599
might be off task in a different context

1002
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,918
like five minutes later

1003
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,520
yeah yeah completely i mean if

1004
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,520
somebody's trying to

1005
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,760
talk to you and you know share something

1006
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,520
with you you

1007
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,359
only paying attention to the sensations

1008
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,599
in your hands is not very helpful

1009
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,359
um but

1010
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:44,320
i think

1011
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,560
what we're kind of flirting with here as

1012
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,918
well is is this notion of task and goal

1013
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,079
and on task and off task

1014
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,280
and

1015
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,520
i think in a

1016
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,160
i mean in a meditation context that's a

1017
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,000
really

1018
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,760
you know um

1019
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,320
difficult difficult thing to define

1020
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,680
there's a big difference between

1021
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,920
somebody who comes into practice because

1022
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,200
they want to

1023
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,040
um

1024
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,320
you know sleep a little bit better or

1025
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,640
not be so stressed or have a little bit

1026
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,440
you know more ease in a relationship to

1027
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,119
somebody who comes in

1028
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,880
and says you know i'm in it

1029
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,160
for

1030
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,240
really understanding myself and who i am

1031
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,119
and what i am and for you know questions

1032
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,000
deeper questions of like awakening and

1033
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
um you know expanding awareness and

1034
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,760
these kinds of things and those

1035
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,079
intentions and motivations are you know

1036
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,760
these task priors that you're setting

1037
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,359
over this whole thing and are driving

1038
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,520
the way that you practice

1039
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,079
and you know traditionally

1040
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,119
what

1041
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,880
is sort of said again and again and

1042
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,079
again is that

1043
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,320
defining that is pretty important in

1044
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,760
terms of what you're going to get out of

1045
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,839
the practice because to pay attention to

1046
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:54,880
the breath

1047
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,280
to just pay attention to the breath

1048
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,880
without really understanding why and

1049
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,599
where it's leading to leading is um is

1050
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:02,800
one thing

1051
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,280
whereas having it within a context of

1052
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,960
you know a wider

1053
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,359
program and goal is is a completely

1054
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,839
other other

1055
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,040
situation now modeling those in active

1056
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,280
inference is interesting right i would

1057
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,240
say that the the latter

1058
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,680
sorry about the background noise here

1059
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,680
but the latter example

1060
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,520
there of you know thinking a bit more

1061
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,680
broadly is is having some kind of a

1062
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,920
preference on

1063
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,880
um

1064
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,680
your own happiness right like your own

1065
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,720
um

1066
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,839
model

1067
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,839
fitness ultimately you know if we kind

1068
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,160
of go on the affected inference

1069
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,400
kind of view of you know casper tell

1070
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,359
that like

1071
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:42,720
affect

1072
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,040
in some ways related to how well you're

1073
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,520
doing and how and how well your model is

1074
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,280
is predicting

1075
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,400
and so to have that as the as the

1076
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,599
intention

1077
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,520
rather than just paying attention to the

1078
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,839
breath but seeing how paying attention

1079
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,440
to the breath can can lead to that

1080
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,520
ultimately is a different kind of goal

1081
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,320
goal statement than than the sort of

1082
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,359
narrow attentional task itself

1083
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,200
thank you lars

1084
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,560
dean and then scott

1085
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,839
yeah i like to think you're i think like

1086
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,839
no i'm on okay i think you're taught i

1087
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,599
think your topic lends itself to wanting

1088
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,599
to gallop ahead because it gets people

1089
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,160
so excited about this idea of moving

1090
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,920
from subliminal

1091
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,359
to liminal

1092
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,599
to kind of a limital like a precision

1093
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,240
around edges right so that transition

1094
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,160
gets people excited because now they say

1095
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,800
oh i can think of a ways that i can use

1096
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,680
this

1097
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,480
in whatever it is that i'm trying to

1098
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,440
figure out um so at

1099
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,960
some point

1100
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,119
that transition pulling that transition

1101
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,119
apart but not breaking it

1102
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,359
is is going to have to we're going to

1103
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,880
have to sit down and really parse that

1104
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,000
with you because

1105
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,800
it feels to me like we're doing a a is

1106
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,280
are we 28 or 29 we're doing the 0.2

1107
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,280
right now because everybody wants to

1108
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,920
really get this thing going because it

1109
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,760
because it's uh

1110
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,359
it's kind of exciting stuff right like

1111
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,920
you've given us this this backpack of

1112
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,520
stuff and we're like opening it up and

1113
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,440
it's all this candy and we're

1114
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,960
but i'm still really kind of interested

1115
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,760
how that how that goes from subliminal

1116
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,160
which cannot be planned and cannot be

1117
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,520
thought out because we're talking about

1118
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,240
act sensory inactivation

1119
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,040
to

1120
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,800
thinking about thinking because when i

1121
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,839
when i see the diagrams themselves

1122
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,320
they're there but it doesn't really help

1123
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,400
me understand that any better because i

1124
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,359
still think that's a really really

1125
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,320
tough bridge to build yeah you know what

1126
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,160
i'm saying i know it's there but it's

1127
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,800
still hard for me to get my head around

1128
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,000
i think i think i know what you mean

1129
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,440
being what you're referring to which is

1130
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,119
like where does the

1131
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,040
where does the structure come from in

1132
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,040
the first place is everything yeah well

1133
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,400
we know where it comes from in the first

1134
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,079
place and we know where it ends up it's

1135
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,800
the transition in between it's those

1136
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,440
casper got us to the third layer

1137
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,320
now we've gone to a deep transitional we

1138
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,880
generated a context we're thinking about

1139
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,599
our thinking it's metacognition

1140
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,640
it just appeared it just emerged so how

1141
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,920
does the con how does the math

1142
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,720
work on that

1143
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,160
this

1144
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,079
i i think i think what you're getting at

1145
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,760
there i mean

1146
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,119
there's kind of two ways that you could

1147
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,640
think about

1148
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,800
a model like this is like either you say

1149
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,800
well the structure's in place

1150
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,119
and what's changing through learning is

1151
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,359
the

1152
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,160
the precision on observations

1153
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,160
essentially like you become aware of it

1154
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,440
it becomes something that can factor

1155
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,359
into your perceptual uh belief updating

1156
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:52,000
um that's one way around or you can say

1157
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,400
that there's something about

1158
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,960
human development and maybe the

1159
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,800
evolutionary process that sort of leads

1160
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,240
to this or structure growth and learning

1161
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,520
um and then the question is well how

1162
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,680
does that come about

1163
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,640
um

1164
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,839
the first question is a little bit

1165
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,760
easier to answer than the second

1166
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,200
question because

1167
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,359
obviously structured learning with an

1168
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,920
active inference is still an ongoing

1169
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,160
area of you know investigation

1170
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,480
research and and how exactly that comes

1171
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,440
about

1172
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,920
questions of neuroplasticity and things

1173
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,920
is quite it's quite difficult to grapple

1174
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,480
with and then how why do particular

1175
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,440
practices and you know different paths

1176
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,560
in life lead to certain things than

1177
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,839
others but then

1178
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,640
to take the other stance or the other

1179
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,960
way to talk about this which is i think

1180
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,640
what you were saying correct me if i'm

1181
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,079
wrong but like let's assume that the

1182
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,960
structure is here that we have some

1183
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,680
kind of a deep hierarchical

1184
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,160
um you know parametric structure that is

1185
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,319
giving rise to to metacognition how do

1186
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:55,200
we go from being uh

1187
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,119
not aware at all of the contents of our

1188
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,920
mind to being aware of the the contents

1189
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,680
of our mind

1190
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,079
right yeah it's kind of contradiction

1191
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,839
right because the way it's set up is

1192
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:08,240
it's a bridge to everywhere it's not a

1193
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,720
bridge to somewhere and then somehow in

1194
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,119
that bridge to everywhere metaphor we

1195
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:15,760
select out a particular and we give it

1196
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,400
our focus or our or our attention

1197
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,400
and so i'm not saying

1198
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,240
that the that the math doesn't work i

1199
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,640
think the anchor piece is that at the

1200
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,880
basic level nobody's going to argue that

1201
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,119
we have a markov blanket and we're going

1202
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,800
to we're going to statistically move

1203
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,040
closer to what we think is going to

1204
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,880
happen next we're going to update it's

1205
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,440
the it's the last piece which is we're

1206
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,680
now thinking about our thinking that

1207
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,520
just seems to pop out

1208
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,839
and make itself available you know

1209
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,839
because we've now built up a set of

1210
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,640
priors but we i don't i i'd like to see

1211
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,119
how the math explains that

1212
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,040
that's what i'm because it's still it's

1213
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,119
still a distributed set until it

1214
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,319
collapses to what we focus or attend on

1215
00:41:58,319 --> 00:41:59,440
and so

1216
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,520
it seems like a contradiction

1217
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,599
and maybe that's what it is maybe that's

1218
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:04,800
what the math

1219
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,760
is trying to explain to us

1220
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,000
i'm still not sure if i've completely

1221
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
uh grasped the

1222
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,400
the point of interest here what what

1223
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,359
what all that how the transition works

1224
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:19,839
again i'm sure you'll be able to explain

1225
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:22,240
it but what i'm seeing is a transition

1226
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,680
to

1227
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,240
first starting up being very open

1228
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,160
and then the mind is able to

1229
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,920
buckle down for lack of a better

1230
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,240
expression and get its attention on

1231
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,800
something it starts out open and then it

1232
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,800
moves to something closer what i'd like

1233
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,319
to see is how the math explains that

1234
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:47,040
that make sense i think so i think so

1235
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:49,200
dean maybe one way just saying it would

1236
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,040
be just looking at figure five like the

1237
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,800
lower levels are certainly outside of

1238
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,640
our control and the higher levels are

1239
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,880
moving towards phenomenology whereas the

1240
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,119
lower level in traditional neuroscience

1241
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,800
would be seen more as like sensory

1242
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,119
processing and yeah it's indeed similar

1243
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,000
kinds of models so how do we kind of

1244
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,240
bridge not just the um science

1245
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,839
humanities gap but like the parameter

1246
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,359
experience

1247
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:16,000
gap and then what is that

1248
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,839
sort of marsh

1249
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:19,280
between them and is it really the case

1250
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,960
that just by nesting this model that we

1251
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,079
know and love

1252
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:25,280
we ended up getting the or a structure

1253
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,800
of cognition is that the or a structure

1254
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,960
does that exist as part of a broader

1255
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,119
family of related models

1256
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,040
is it just about finding patterns of

1257
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,640
nodes that explain variance in multiple

1258
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,119
components of phenomenology and

1259
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,839
physiology

1260
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,400
that's the question

1261
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,119
well i for me it all comes down to

1262
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:54,560
precision

1263
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,960
uh within the model uh then that's kind

1264
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,480
of how i

1265
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,560
been thinking about this is that

1266
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,319
you know at the sensory level that first

1267
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:03,200
level

1268
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,079
there

1269
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,800
are multiple places that

1270
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,800
you can

1271
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,280
start to

1272
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,160
identify

1273
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,480
just patterns you know statistical

1274
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,720
patterns and then start to layer on top

1275
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,359
of that a confidence or precision over

1276
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,599
that which you know we have evidence for

1277
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:24,960
you know how that's mediated in the

1278
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,040
brain for various various places but

1279
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,839
the precision then itself itself becomes

1280
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:35,040
this thing that you can layer on top of

1281
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,000
your entire sensory experience and gives

1282
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,599
you this kind of

1283
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:40,480
um

1284
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,839
internal

1285
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,000
flexibility as to how you're how you're

1286
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,079
interacting interacting with the world

1287
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,079
and then the modeling of how those

1288
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:51,040
precisions are being driven

1289
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,560
you know

1290
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,119
without your awareness is then what what

1291
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,520
those states that that be the b matrix

1292
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,119
at the second level would be would be

1293
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,280
encoding is you're starting to learn

1294
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,920
ah okay so this you know my attention

1295
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,760
gets grabbed by this or that or like

1296
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,359
these are the kinds of and here we're

1297
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,280
talking explicitly about attention but

1298
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,640
there's other precisions around that you

1299
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,359
can start to understand how they are

1300
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:14,880
evolving

1301
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,520
and then also learning where you're

1302
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,440
where your reach of control is like how

1303
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,760
much of how much of this can i control

1304
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,680
and and influence

1305
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,040
and what does that mean and what are the

1306
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,480
impacts of that

1307
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,599
um

1308
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,440
it's kind of what

1309
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,680
i find exciting about exciting about

1310
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,680
this because you can kind of see how

1311
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,800
different

1312
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,200
forms of precision control and awareness

1313
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,520
would lead to different kinds of

1314
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,680
model optimization and

1315
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:42,800
you can

1316
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,640
calculate the free energy you know based

1317
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,760
on on how different precision profiles

1318
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,720
are

1319
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,520
defined and evolving and kind of

1320
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,119
over time that's something that you

1321
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:54,880
would hope to be able to learn

1322
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,560
and then the question is how do you

1323
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,560
actually learn that well

1324
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,040
by paying attention by paying attention

1325
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,960
to how it's changing um and that's not

1326
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,200
always easy um and sometimes things in

1327
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,720
life you know make us pay attention to

1328
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,319
it you know start to notice like i'm the

1329
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:10,400
kind of person who gets yeah thank you

1330
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,800
exactly this figure here that gets

1331
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,119
impacted in these ways but

1332
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,440
i think there's a really important thing

1333
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,560
to say around the role of a teacher in

1334
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,319
this as well somebody who can point

1335
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:23,920
these things out

1336
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,119
and

1337
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:27,599
in doing so direct your attention in a

1338
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,280
way that you wouldn't have thought to

1339
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,760
previously into noticing like hey

1340
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:32,880
there's this

1341
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,720
pattern in my mind that i hadn't thought

1342
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,640
of as a pattern i just thought of as

1343
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,760
well i hadn't even thought of it it's

1344
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,680
just happening and then as soon as i

1345
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,800
start to see it as a pattern it's

1346
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,240
something i can start to model and then

1347
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,480
you get this kind of emergence of a of a

1348
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,319
higher level

1349
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:48,800
structuring or understanding or grasping

1350
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,280
or modeling expectation over these

1351
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,480
patterns that were previously

1352
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,800
unconscious

1353
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,560
thanks i'm gonna just read a comment

1354
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,800
with uh no response needed from the live

1355
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,560
chat and then go to scott

1356
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,640
so joshua benjamin wrote

1357
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,400
all psychic ability seems to be

1358
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,560
subconsciously driven oneness of the

1359
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,640
active and subconscious mind would be

1360
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,800
magical to say the least people that

1361
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,240
already have their active and

1362
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,240
subconscious mind working as one also

1363
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,880
seem to have identical palmistry between

1364
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,359
their left and right palms

1365
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:23,359
interesting observation scott

1366
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,359
yeah thank you i'm sorry i was delayed

1367
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:27,280
in coming in but i'm always thrilled as

1368
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,280
soon as i drop into the conversation

1369
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,599
it's like being with family so this is

1370
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,680
so wonderful what a great conversation i

1371
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,760
wonder if you could comment a little bit

1372
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,720
on

1373
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,240
the attention versus intention

1374
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,559
it feels like part of what we're talking

1375
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,160
about now let me let me comment on that

1376
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,200
a little bit and it's following up on

1377
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,160
dean's

1378
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,240
um exploration there

1379
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,760
i was thinking i always talk to people

1380
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,920
about the aha moment if you know the if

1381
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,240
you know the um punchline to a joke and

1382
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,839
someone tells you a joke it's just not

1383
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,640
funny because you know the punch line

1384
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,280
and so the aha moment is the same as

1385
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,119
that moment of eureka when you get out

1386
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:04,480
of the bathtub and run around yelling

1387
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,079
eureka but you do you understand

1388
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:07,520
something it's a paradigm shift like

1389
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,440
thomas kuhn in the structure of

1390
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,359
scientific revolutions talks about that

1391
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,119
you shift from not knowing something to

1392
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:14,559
all of a sudden knowing it

1393
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,040
so those i'm an addict for those moments

1394
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,119
i love ignorance as a result so i wonder

1395
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:20,319
if you could talk a little bit about

1396
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:22,000
going from attention

1397
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,520
to intention

1398
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,160
i am coming to the belief from working

1399
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,920
with all you folks

1400
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,720
and others in similar explorations that

1401
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,800
the mind actually doesn't exist at all

1402
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,640
in the brain the mind is always in

1403
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,040
society and in language always

1404
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,520
the brain gets tuned

1405
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,000
into a local mind by exposure by

1406
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,599
perception

1407
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,599
and then that become the attention turns

1408
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:47,839
into intention you adopt like a bauer

1409
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:50,559
bird you adopt nascent models

1410
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,200
from the externality there's no onboard

1411
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,160
feral consciousness in my assertion here

1412
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,920
so you develop it and cultivate it based

1413
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,160
on your exposure to the environment

1414
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,760
as you build it up

1415
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,400
the attentions your teachers out there

1416
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,680
in the world whether they're formal

1417
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,359
teachers or informal

1418
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:09,839
can help you convert attention to

1419
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:11,680
intention because the models get

1420
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,359
developed based on

1421
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:16,400
their their explanatory power of your

1422
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,319
environment right if they they get cast

1423
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:20,960
aside if they're not as helpful in

1424
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,680
closing free energy gaps for instance

1425
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,480
so

1426
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,800
i just wanted to throw those things out

1427
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,440
there and following up with dean to me

1428
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,040
the paradox

1429
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,760
of the frizzle between consciousness and

1430
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,839
unconsciousness is not something that we

1431
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,000
can resolve it's something that we can

1432
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,760
observe and

1433
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,839
maybe manage in some ways with these

1434
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:43,920
models but the paradox is one thing i

1435
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,599
always told my kids is the only time you

1436
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:47,040
see reality is when you're seeing

1437
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,119
paradox and anytime you're seeing the

1438
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:50,640
absence of paradise you are seeing a

1439
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,680
model

1440
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,200
and when people say they want to resolve

1441
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,800
paradox it means they want their model

1442
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,079
to win

1443
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,000
here it feels like as dan was alluding

1444
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,599
to that there are multiple models that

1445
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,680
are in play simultaneously

1446
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,000
and the multiple models maybe can give

1447
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,319
us a sense of the shift from attention

1448
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,640
to intention anyway your comments are

1449
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,160
welcome

1450
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,520
thanks scott

1451
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,440
thank you for that lots of interesting

1452
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,880
points there

1453
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,160
um

1454
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,599
i'll just pick out one of the things you

1455
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:18,880
said there around

1456
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,160
insights and these aha moments

1457
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,000
and from

1458
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,599
and this isn't present here again in

1459
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,200
this work encounter falling into a

1460
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,520
dean's trap here a little bit of um

1461
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,079
running forward with it but

1462
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:33,359
if you

1463
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:34,480
imagine

1464
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,119
here that what what's being afforded by

1465
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:38,720
you know paying attention new ways the

1466
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,200
dynamics and and precisions you know

1467
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,200
within our generative model and how and

1468
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,960
how the all these things are evolving

1469
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,960
you know we're gaining in model kind of

1470
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,400
structure and

1471
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,400
complexity ultimately

1472
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,599
and

1473
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,280
one of the

1474
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,400
bits of work that i find really

1475
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,319
interesting from carl and other

1476
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,319
colleagues is around you know insight

1477
00:50:58,319 --> 00:50:59,359
and they've been talking about it in the

1478
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:01,520
context of psychedelics

1479
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,839
specifically as these moments of

1480
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:05,599
model reduction

1481
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:08,400
um invasion model reduction whereby you

1482
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,079
lose a bit of

1483
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,680
model structure and there's this

1484
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,680
liberating aspect of that and there's

1485
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,760
this sort of knowing aspect of that too

1486
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,119
and it's not that you've sort of learned

1487
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:20,960
something new you've kind of unlearned

1488
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,680
something and in that

1489
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,960
you you

1490
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,200
gain in model fitness as well you know

1491
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,520
there's this kind of um

1492
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,920
improvement of the state of affairs by

1493
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,000
by doing that and so

1494
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,280
you could imagine a scenario whereby

1495
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,960
um in

1496
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,440
playing this game of paying attention to

1497
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,520
how things go and how things are in the

1498
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,000
mind specifically your model structure's

1499
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,079
kind of gaining complexity but you're

1500
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:50,800
also identifying places that can be

1501
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,040
reduced and you get this sort of

1502
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,880
cyclical

1503
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,520
growing of complexity and reduction

1504
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,520
which matches on really

1505
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,880
really nicely and i have to be really

1506
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,040
careful sometimes to not try and like

1507
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,480
recapitulate

1508
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,440
things that i um like from sort of

1509
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,000
practice theory into science and really

1510
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,880
be you know grounded in in in the active

1511
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,440
inference but nevertheless there's you

1512
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,720
know my heart kind of wants to say that

1513
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,040
kind of nicely matches to the cycles of

1514
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,480
practice too these cycles of of insight

1515
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,680
and

1516
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,960
growth that does come in this sort of

1517
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,960
non-non-linear and cyclical way

1518
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,559
thanks lars

1519
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:33,040
blue

1520
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,720
so this isn't really like a question but

1521
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,520
it's more of a comment so scott was kind

1522
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,960
of talking about converting attention or

1523
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,200
intention to attention but i think that

1524
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,040
that's also something that's cyclical so

1525
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,839
you can convert attention to intention

1526
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:49,920
and intention to attention you intend to

1527
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,000
pay attention attention

1528
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,160
gives you an intention um sorry that's

1529
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,280
like way tongue twister but like

1530
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,680
where does imagination come into play

1531
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,359
there right like there's attention

1532
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:04,240
intention but where's the exploration

1533
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,880
the creativity and does active inference

1534
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,760
allow for maybe this component on

1535
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,480
attention intention and imagination

1536
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,280
cool question um i think of imagination

1537
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,040
a lot in terms of uh generative

1538
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,200
practices so like state generation

1539
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,280
practices like loving kindness gratitude

1540
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,079
forgiveness these kinds of things and

1541
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:26,079
for me the way that i think about that

1542
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:29,040
is you are using your imagination to

1543
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,559
generate

1544
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:32,000
um

1545
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,440
the

1546
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,400
goal observation the goal state

1547
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,160
right which then allows you then to set

1548
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,800
a prior over that to aim for so if you

1549
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,359
evoke in your mind the

1550
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:46,079
a you know may you be happy so i'm

1551
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:48,160
imagining a situation where you are

1552
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,040
happy and now that is a a possible

1553
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,520
future state that i can put prior over

1554
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,480
and

1555
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,359
once i've done that then the machinery

1556
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,280
of active inference starts you know

1557
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,160
coming into play to achieve that kind of

1558
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,920
goal and

1559
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,240
that's a very very hand waving very

1560
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,119
loose and again like i can i can sense

1561
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:10,640
that people out there might be cringing

1562
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,240
to this kind of way of talking about

1563
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,800
about these models but

1564
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:15,839
you know an answer to the question

1565
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:17,920
that's kind of how i how i think about

1566
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,040
um

1567
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:23,359
at least that form form of imagination

1568
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,920
that's some point two stuff thinking

1569
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,319
about how our cultural environment

1570
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:31,680
scaffolds our preferences and our telios

1571
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,760
our end directedness

1572
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,280
which is something that came up in

1573
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,599
navigation now it's coming up in

1574
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:39,680
cognitive navigation

1575
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,119
and setting of these higher order

1576
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,000
parameters scott

1577
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,559
i just wonder why is it cringy

1578
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,640
from the math perspective the right

1579
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,119
because i'm a humanities guy and i'm the

1580
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,920
math always freaks me out so i want to

1581
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,839
understand though what is it about the

1582
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:57,760
you're a math person steeped in the math

1583
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,920
what is it about what you just said that

1584
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,160
makes you uncomfortable with the math

1585
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,480
and how might the math be why is it

1586
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,000
stretching the math or how might the

1587
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,839
math be extended

1588
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:10,000
to to accommodate that cringiness

1589
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
problem yeah no thanks scott that's a

1590
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,040
good question

1591
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,079
um the reason i say that is because

1592
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:17,040
these

1593
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,079
models can pretty much model anything

1594
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:23,599
right you can you can adapt them to make

1595
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:25,680
almost any point that you want

1596
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,480
um and so you know if i

1597
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,160
start saying

1598
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,400
oh this is how it is and this is what

1599
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,040
imagination is and does well then i can

1600
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,119
sort of ad hoc um

1601
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:38,799
play with the model until it until it

1602
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:41,119
until it makes that point um and what

1603
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:43,440
i've really tried to do here in this

1604
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,480
paper

1605
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,119
is be very careful with that

1606
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:49,040
and to allow the

1607
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,319
dynamics to emerge intrinsically from

1608
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,720
moves in the mathematics that are

1609
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,480
um

1610
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,599
like

1611
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:01,359
allowed and and and

1612
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:03,520
don't make many assumptions

1613
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,040
because really all we're doing here is

1614
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,119
is having a higher level that is

1615
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:08,799
parameterizing precision on the lower

1616
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,559
level and then we're just running it and

1617
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:13,520
seeing what kind of dynamics emerge and

1618
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,599
interestingly the dynamics that emerge

1619
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:18,079
are aligned with the expectations but if

1620
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:19,599
i go too far the other way which is

1621
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:20,799
really easy to do with this right

1622
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:22,319
because you have especially in a

1623
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:24,240
practice meditation context there's

1624
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,400
really detailed phenomenological models

1625
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,680
of

1626
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,720
all kinds of uh mental dynamics and it'd

1627
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,280
be very easy to say

1628
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,040
you know just gerrymander active

1629
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,280
inference to describe all of that and so

1630
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,319
that's why i'm trying to just be a

1631
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:40,000
little bit careful on how i talk about

1632
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,119
it

1633
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:43,599
one just to follow up the one of the

1634
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:44,559
things

1635
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:45,680
so

1636
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:49,599
this may be uh rationalization but so i

1637
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:52,559
was i'm a lawyer so i was a rhetorician

1638
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:54,720
and so when we have incommensurables in

1639
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,559
the law we use rhetoric to glue them

1640
00:56:56,559 --> 00:56:59,760
together and it's not crazy glue crazy

1641
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,839
glue doesn't fill gaps its rhetoric is

1642
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:03,200
epoxy

1643
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,240
right it

1644
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,559
glues stuff together and fills the gaps

1645
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,000
right crazy glue just sticks stuff

1646
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,119
together

1647
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,440
and so the reason i'm talking about that

1648
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,160
is is it again i asserted before that

1649
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,960
the mind actually exists in language

1650
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,720
that's very weird and loose language i'm

1651
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,040
using there the mind exists in language

1652
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,760
it exists in material culture we're born

1653
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,680
feral

1654
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,240
and we get our brain gets tuned to a

1655
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,599
local mind let's go with that for a

1656
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,599
second as a posit

1657
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:33,680
so you you have nothing on board when

1658
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,520
you're born would is it i guess another

1659
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,599
way of asking the question can the math

1660
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:39,440
construct consciousness from a feral

1661
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,000
mind with no social exposure

1662
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,240
that's my question and i am

1663
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,000
beginning to believe

1664
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,280
that nothing

1665
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,799
yes there's imagination of course

1666
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,880
there's a lot of lateral thinking but

1667
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,720
all the things are borrowings from the

1668
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,640
externality is my assertion now that's

1669
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,240
not the imagination you can mix and

1670
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,000
match them different ways

1671
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
but if you're isolated and have no

1672
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,839
question is i guess will the math

1673
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:04,480
generate a consciousness

1674
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,960
without any external input

1675
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,960
and i think the answer is no

1676
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,599
and so therefore it feels to me like the

1677
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:13,760
brain is a

1678
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,119
mind instead instance

1679
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,119
and the mind actually doesn't it's

1680
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:21,359
paradigmatically weird and different i

1681
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:22,960
don't maybe there are people who say

1682
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,720
this i don't know i just don't know

1683
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,799
enough about the mind studies

1684
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:27,680
but

1685
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,200
it feels like

1686
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,760
we can allow ourselves to

1687
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,359
um

1688
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:35,520
not feel cringy

1689
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,040
about the extension the math now again

1690
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,799
i'm not the math guy i'm the cringy on

1691
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:41,200
the cringy side of this but

1692
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,079
by if we recognize that the source

1693
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:47,280
of the mind stuff is external

1694
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,799
maybe that's okay

1695
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:50,799
and it's processed in the brain anyway i

1696
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:51,920
don't know if that's something he's

1697
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,920
responding to but it's to me this is

1698
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,200
very interesting because this is that

1699
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,720
metaphysics jump

1700
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,720
and is it metaphysical or not i don't

1701
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,000
know

1702
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:00,960
i

1703
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:04,000
i the i mean i i don't i don't uh have

1704
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,359
much resistance to what what you're

1705
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:06,640
saying there i don't think these things

1706
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,720
happen in a vacuum and i think

1707
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:11,200
um you know

1708
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,400
just intuitively uh you know the that

1709
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,079
kind of a cognitive structure would not

1710
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:18,480
emerge without some kind of you know

1711
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,319
societal or back and forth multiple

1712
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:22,160
nodes in the network you know working

1713
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,799
working together on this and

1714
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,799
you know anecdotally a line that always

1715
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:29,280
sticks with me and um

1716
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:32,400
from the buddha of all people is uh you

1717
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,359
know there's two things that are

1718
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:34,880
required for awakening there's wise

1719
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,280
attention and the voice of another

1720
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,640
and it kind of speaks to that need for

1721
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,240
interaction

1722
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,480
now the reason the reason i the reason

1723
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,280
i'm

1724
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,720
what i really meant when i'm saying

1725
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:47,920
cringy is that

1726
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,760
i think there's actually a huge

1727
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,200
advantage

1728
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,000
in just going slowly and methodol like

1729
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,319
and systematically through this because

1730
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:58,720
what it allows us to do is be very very

1731
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,520
precise in what we mean with our words

1732
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,160
because i can talk about attention

1733
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,839
and that might mean several things to

1734
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:08,000
different people but it almost doesn't

1735
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,920
matter what the definition is of it i

1736
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,960
can just point here in and say well

1737
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,280
whatever this is what i mean by this

1738
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,160
word

1739
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,160
and i can keep doing that building up

1740
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,520
the complexity of it and i can start to

1741
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:22,160
have very detailed descriptions and

1742
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,079
articulations of mental dynamics that

1743
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:26,000
don't rely on interpretation of the

1744
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,480
words because they are referring to

1745
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,920
something quite um specific

1746
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,559
thanks um and it is really important to

1747
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:37,119
have that uh perhaps

1748
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:39,359
carl firsten would say a deflationary

1749
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:40,240
view

1750
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,799
so the deflationary view of this figure

1751
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:44,799
12 the generalized deep generative model

1752
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:46,640
of mental action it's like

1753
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,400
i mean big if true

1754
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,480
the deflationary view would be that just

1755
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,079
like a linear model like a linear

1756
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:54,240
regression bayesian modeling can be used

1757
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,240
on any kind of data so just because

1758
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,680
there's a word that you may or may not

1759
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,200
have familiarity in front of it like

1760
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,559
frequented statistics bayesian

1761
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:02,480
statistics it doesn't get around the

1762
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,880
fundamental problems of data modeling

1763
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:05,920
and it actually has a lot of

1764
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,319
similarities with hierarchical gaussian

1765
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:11,119
models of control which are common at

1766
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:13,520
least related to this idea of nesting

1767
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,400
slower levels of policy inference with

1768
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,359
some

1769
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:19,599
again tricks that are really interesting

1770
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:21,440
like free energy calculation all those

1771
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,960
other things that we talk about other

1772
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,839
times but that kind of model never took

1773
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:27,599
on a philosophical or metaphysical

1774
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:30,000
baggage even when it did appear to

1775
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,559
correlate or even have predictive power

1776
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:34,000
for example predicting what somebody

1777
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,119
would buy

1778
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:36,240
and um

1779
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,720
it just it's a choice that we make what

1780
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,440
is our cultural priors what are our

1781
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,720
personal preferences over connecting

1782
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,640
that metaphysical jump that scott

1783
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,640
mentioned maybe some people they um

1784
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:51,200
think it's a six-inch jump and they can

1785
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,799
jump 20 feet and other people they have

1786
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:56,319
a belief that it's a bigger jump so

1787
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:58,079
that's why it's such an interesting area

1788
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:00,640
to talk about because there is some

1789
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:03,440
hyperinflation going on

1790
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,599
and then there's some extreme deflation

1791
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:07,280
and there's everything in between as

1792
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,480
well

1793
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,880
yeah and if i could just uh yeah yeah

1794
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,480
larger than scott

1795
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,720
um the

1796
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:15,599
i

1797
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,839
thank you yeah for for articulating that

1798
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:18,839
so well

1799
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:22,240
because um i know i'm also guilty of

1800
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,520
this in my own mind when i'm thinking

1801
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:24,880
about this privately of just sort of

1802
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,880
running running this forward and losing

1803
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,319
track of

1804
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:32,079
of of what uh these sort of ontological

1805
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:33,520
commitments in

1806
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:37,200
in this whole discussion and i think uh

1807
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,640
maxwell

1808
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,240
one of the co-authors he

1809
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,079
sometimes refers to you know hard for

1810
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:44,400
estonians and soft fristonians and that

1811
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,839
kind of speaks this deflationary and

1812
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:48,079
inflationary inflationary point but for

1813
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:50,319
me in this in this work

1814
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:53,359
um what i'm most excited about isn't so

1815
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:54,720
much a

1816
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,720
an ontological

1817
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,720
um

1818
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,359
proof or

1819
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:02,400
um

1820
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,440
conclusion of hey this is what it is and

1821
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,079
this is what the mind is doing this or

1822
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:10,720
or anything that's strong what i'm more

1823
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,880
excited about when i think is more

1824
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,880
relevant to our times

1825
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,359
is that

1826
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:19,200
even if this is a

1827
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:23,039
a facility or a a kind of

1828
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:26,160
uh loose description or a

1829
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,839
um you know

1830
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:29,359
what am i trying to say approximated

1831
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:31,280
framework of something that's going on

1832
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,200
if it allows us to

1833
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,760
articulate intelligently like how these

1834
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:38,000
mental dynamics are going on

1835
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,920
it really

1836
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,680
helps you know because i teach

1837
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,839
meditation as well and one of the big

1838
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:45,200
obstacles that you come up against is

1839
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,720
like yeah but why should i do this like

1840
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,559
how does it work and what what what

1841
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:50,240
what's the point and if you have

1842
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,240
something like this that

1843
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,880
allows you to articulate

1844
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,760
why and how and the dynamics and what's

1845
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,119
going on

1846
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:00,799
then that breaks down that barrier and

1847
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:02,319
allows for in a conversation that's at

1848
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:04,960
least grounded in something closer to

1849
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:05,920
um

1850
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,839
you know biologically inspired

1851
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:09,920
computational you know neuroscience

1852
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,160
rather than

1853
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:13,200
a

1854
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,280
phenomenological report not that there's

1855
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,880
space for that but for a lot of people

1856
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,160
this is what would get them through the

1857
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,399
door

1858
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,400
thanks lars scott and then anyone else

1859
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,720
with a raised hand so i just wanted to

1860
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:29,039
go back that's this is fascinating and i

1861
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:30,799
wanted to go back just that rule the

1862
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:32,720
idea of rules of general application

1863
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:33,760
like

1864
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,760
is this reducible to

1865
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,839
it is

1866
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:39,039
our elements of this that are

1867
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:40,880
interesting reducible to formulas is

1868
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,039
what i'm where i'm going with this query

1869
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:45,599
now and i wanted and it made me think

1870
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:47,200
about you have this society you have

1871
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,400
different societies with different

1872
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,039
standards different music

1873
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:53,359
scales different recipes of food and

1874
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:54,720
things that people are familiar with

1875
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,960
right they're raised in that context so

1876
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,359
chinese food is and music are familiar

1877
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:01,119
to a chinese person if you're born in a

1878
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:02,720
different culture you don't those are

1879
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,119
unfamiliar to you so i wanted to talk a

1880
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:06,319
little bit about rules of general

1881
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,760
application because in law so i come

1882
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:09,039
from law

1883
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:10,720
and law you know we've got technical

1884
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:13,119
specs now and here we got fristen

1885
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:15,280
analysis and trying to find general

1886
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,280
rules of general application that's fine

1887
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,440
that's good stuff and they and the one

1888
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:20,480
of the things that's interesting about

1889
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,839
rule of general application is how

1890
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:23,039
general they are

1891
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:24,799
so in in law you have this thing called

1892
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:26,720
equity which corrects the rules of

1893
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,000
general application i just want to read

1894
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
you this aristotle quote that guides me

1895
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,880
a lot here aristotle said the source of

1896
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,720
the difficulty is that equity though

1897
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,960
just is not legal justice but a

1898
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,280
rectification of legal justice the

1899
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,440
reason for this is that law is always a

1900
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:44,000
general statement yet there are cases

1901
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,839
which it is not possible to cover in a

1902
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:48,079
general statement hence while the

1903
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:50,400
equitable is just and is superior to one

1904
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,559
sort of justice it is not superior to

1905
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:54,720
absolute justice but only to the error

1906
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,799
due to its absolute statement

1907
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:58,319
this is the essential nature of the

1908
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:00,400
equitable it is a rectification of law

1909
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,839
where law is defective because of its

1910
01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:04,799
generality the reason i'm raising that

1911
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:06,720
here is you know

1912
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,960
we can find general rules they don't

1913
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,920
have to work in every edge case

1914
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,640
right and if we find edge cases that

1915
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:16,079
undermine the general rule it doesn't

1916
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:18,720
mean the general rule is no good

1917
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,160
right it just means we need some

1918
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,559
tweaking at the edge cases or something

1919
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:24,880
right and one of the things that's funny

1920
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,599
in equity the idea is you have to bring

1921
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:30,480
in someone a judge or someone

1922
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,559
who can come in and say what did they

1923
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:34,000
mean when they were coming up with the

1924
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,920
original law not what does the original

1925
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,640
word say but what do they mean to do the

1926
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:41,520
substance of it right and similarly here

1927
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,599
what i guess i'm arguing for

1928
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:48,079
is the social aspects of the mind

1929
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:50,160
probably don't need to be divorced from

1930
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,640
the model entirely

1931
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,720
the hand-waving aspects of the mind the

1932
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,920
metaphysical aspects of the mind because

1933
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,039
they are

1934
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:00,480
they i think

1935
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,000
are always the foundation of the

1936
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,480
possibility of a mind

1937
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,039
right we come into social you you've

1938
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:09,599
come in life feral and then you are and

1939
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:12,000
then you learn that there's a society in

1940
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,359
other people and you have self another

1941
01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:14,799
you learn that

1942
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:16,720
as a child now maybe you would learn it

1943
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,880
out in the wild maybe not

1944
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,799
i guess what i'm saying though is we the

1945
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:22,880
model it feels like

1946
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,400
doesn't ultimately have to be

1947
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,880
mathematically 100 percent rigorous

1948
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,960
because the borrowings in the model that

1949
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:32,160
are made from society intrinsically

1950
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:35,440
have caused leakage into into that model

1951
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,160
being affected by the externality so i

1952
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:41,039
guess both the perception and the

1953
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:43,280
other model contents feel like they're

1954
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,559
unavoidable

1955
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:46,319
anyway just a few

1956
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:48,480
ruminations there and and do with do

1957
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:49,920
with what you should with that with the

1958
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:53,280
cud that i just served up

1959
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,599
i mean i think this what you're speaking

1960
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:57,359
to here is a pretty

1961
01:07:57,359 --> 01:07:58,960
um big topic in the active inference

1962
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,559
community in general and this idea that

1963
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:02,640
you know the map is not the territory

1964
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,319
um and

1965
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:05,599
depending on

1966
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:07,520
who's speaking we kind of get lost in

1967
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:10,400
that a lot of the times like are we

1968
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,960
agents with generative models or

1969
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,240
are agents

1970
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,640
generative models and to what extent is

1971
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,640
this a description and to what extent is

1972
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:19,359
it

1973
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:20,238
um

1974
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:21,920
you know that's

1975
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,120
i'd rather not wait in there to be

1976
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,679
honest no i get it and i like your

1977
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:27,198
statement the math is not the territory

1978
01:08:27,198 --> 01:08:28,719
it's nice because really that's nice

1979
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:30,960
where you think the math is the tool

1980
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,399
to understand

1981
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:33,198
the

1982
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:35,120
journey or whatever but that's a nice i

1983
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,479
like that statement you just made about

1984
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,000
the math is not the territory because it

1985
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
often feels like and that may be

1986
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,600
something that is helps with the

1987
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,600
invitation you know the space can be

1988
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,920
threatening to non-math people

1989
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:47,920
because it does need a rigor i get it

1990
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,238
but there are things that are being said

1991
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:52,640
by the math that need to be conveyed to

1992
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,479
non-math people you know they're

1993
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:55,679
important things when i first dropped

1994
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:58,080
into the space i said oh my god all the

1995
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,839
contracts i ever made are synthetic

1996
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:02,238
markov blankets

1997
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:04,960
they are i'm creating a there there that

1998
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,719
wasn't there it's not an observation of

1999
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:08,880
a biological system that's natural it's

2000
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,319
an artificial

2001
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:13,120
of creation of a thing a place where

2002
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,679
these rules apply for internal and

2003
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:18,000
external operation right it's it's an

2004
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,560
artifice so and we do that a lot in the

2005
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,640
world but so that was my first kind of

2006
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,719
impression but i don't i'm never going

2007
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:26,080
to understand the math enough to have

2008
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,920
the rigor to be able to

2009
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,520
delve into that and understand the

2010
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,279
implications of active inference math

2011
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:33,520
for the law it just won't be available

2012
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:34,399
to me

2013
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:36,560
so if and to the extent

2014
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,880
that without going to metaphysics we're

2015
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:41,040
able to create narratives that are

2016
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,600
honest to the math

2017
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,560
realistic and also available to the

2018
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,479
non-math people that's going to be

2019
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:49,920
something that will

2020
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,080
lead to a lot more

2021
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,920
both understanding and misunderstanding

2022
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,400
i get it but but a lot more

2023
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,400
awareness and adoption

2024
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:01,360
of the models i think which will lead to

2025
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,920
more um i think better systems better

2026
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,600
policy because there's a lot to be

2027
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,760
learned from this and it's the same

2028
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,280
thing as an engineer knowing how to make

2029
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,199
a nuclear power plant work and then

2030
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:12,480
other people down the line knowing how

2031
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,760
to sell power but they don't know how to

2032
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,679
make the new nuclear power plant work

2033
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:17,280
right you need you need all steps of the

2034
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:18,560
supply chain

2035
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,120
of this to be delivered as a social good

2036
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,560
i guess is what i'm saying so that's a

2037
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,320
big i'm putting it all on your shoulders

2038
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,560
you guys yeah but i mean that's the hope

2039
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,840
here i mean that's i think what's at

2040
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:30,880
stake a lot of the time is that you know

2041
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,719
i i think about this stuff in terms of a

2042
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:34,400
practice in a practice content sharing

2043
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:37,440
and communicating on how how best to

2044
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,440
you know improve our mental well-being

2045
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,360
given given what the the insights that

2046
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,120
this might afford and given the the

2047
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,040
structure in terms of communication that

2048
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,199
it might allow it's already impacted the

2049
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:48,400
way that i teach it's already impacted

2050
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,320
the way that i practice personally um

2051
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:51,520
but then there's a whole field of

2052
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,120
computational psychiatry as well which

2053
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,199
is which is very closely related to this

2054
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:57,280
i mean the kinds of well-being i'm

2055
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:58,480
talking about or the kinds of

2056
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,159
dysfunctions that the computational

2057
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:02,080
psychiatry people are talking about so

2058
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,840
there's there's a lot of hope to that

2059
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,040
and it doesn't take somebody to

2060
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,320
understand

2061
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,719
um you know how to do a gradient descent

2062
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:10,480
on free energy to be able to benefit

2063
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:13,639
from that

2064
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,800
definitely typo but this is a slide we

2065
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,280
had from the dot zero

2066
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,239
just like

2067
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:22,719
there's so many directions

2068
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:26,640
that this area verges towards

2069
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,000
and um

2070
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,360
just

2071
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,040
how we even

2072
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,600
make sense of this field where is active

2073
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,440
inference going to connect the the

2074
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,360
pieces just i don't know any of these

2075
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:38,640
elements on the list that was

2076
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,800
interesting to you and give a thought on

2077
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:41,679
um

2078
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:43,040
or anyone else could just raise their

2079
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:45,280
hand

2080
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:49,440
oh the hype the hyper scanning

2081
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:52,000
piece is really fascinating because

2082
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,840
there's a there's a obviously a deep

2083
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,679
tradition of

2084
01:11:57,679 --> 01:11:59,040
you know these kinds of things being

2085
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:01,440
learned in community and in interaction

2086
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,480
with other people um and that

2087
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,880
is not obvious how that how that happens

2088
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,480
and i'm looking forward to

2089
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,080
you know that whole space developing a

2090
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,159
little bit and being able to

2091
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:13,360
model you know what it'd be like to

2092
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:14,719
learn

2093
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:15,760
you know what's the difference between

2094
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:16,719
learning through an app and learning

2095
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:19,360
from a teacher

2096
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:21,520
cool

2097
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:25,440
very interesting so um i see scott's

2098
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:28,000
hand and then anyone else

2099
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,920
so the other place is just in in the

2100
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:32,159
crafts world of markets you know you

2101
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:34,800
have information differentials are

2102
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,400
differentials

2103
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,320
and the markets are driven by

2104
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,920
information differentials i've asserted

2105
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,120
for a number of years that cardo's

2106
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,880
equation and thermodynamics the hot and

2107
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,320
cold differential is necessary for a

2108
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,320
heat engine to function

2109
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,960
the that that is equivalent to the

2110
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,560
differentials in information

2111
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,640
differentials and markets you don't have

2112
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,560
market action if everyone has the same

2113
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,080
information and that's that idea that

2114
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,760
markets generate information price

2115
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,199
information availability things like

2116
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:00,000
that

2117
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,960
so

2118
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,920
the crass part of this and that tends to

2119
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:06,560
make things get swept away in the world

2120
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,400
of craziness when you get things into

2121
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,560
markets because anything goes and you

2122
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,640
know it's just a big mess

2123
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:14,159
having said that

2124
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:16,800
the impact of this kind of analysis will

2125
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,800
be very appealing in markets because it

2126
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,199
does have a scale independent aspect to

2127
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:22,000
it

2128
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,320
and so it allows for insights at

2129
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,000
different levels of different markets

2130
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,880
and meta markets and related supply

2131
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:29,760
chains

2132
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:32,960
that if everyone is doing this analysis

2133
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,960
then it leads to a certain kind of

2134
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:37,120
interoperability

2135
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,960
because you have a

2136
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:39,840
um

2137
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:40,719
risk

2138
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:43,920
and risk evaluation interoperability

2139
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,719
right and so the value in markets if

2140
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:48,560
everyone started doing active inference

2141
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:51,199
style of risk analysis

2142
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:52,719
you'd be able to

2143
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:54,640
make observations about at different

2144
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:56,800
scales because you'd have data coming

2145
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,880
out of every scale that was generated by

2146
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:01,600
models that were similar

2147
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,239
right so that kind of aspiration it's

2148
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:05,840
what i'm looking at with the i'm working

2149
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,679
with banks now etc and i'm not talking

2150
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:09,840
about active inference or carl fristen

2151
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,679
but i'm starting to set that up as best

2152
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:14,960
i can in the early stages of it because

2153
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:16,800
it feels just like a natural thing we

2154
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,719
are biological systems our markets and

2155
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:20,719
our institutions are ultimately doing

2156
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:21,920
reproductive and nutritional

2157
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:25,120
opportunities at large scales

2158
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:27,199
you know and so there's a lot of biology

2159
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:29,199
that's still bound up in what we do as

2160
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:32,080
organisms in our scaled structures

2161
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,040
and so

2162
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,800
it's exciting to watch because this

2163
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,640
thing is going to come out of left field

2164
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,560
and it's like quantum computing everyone

2165
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:39,920
thought there was a thing in the lab for

2166
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:41,040
a lot of years and now people are like

2167
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:42,960
oh geez here we go that's going to be a

2168
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:45,600
big deal in other things like business

2169
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,239
and governments and

2170
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:50,719
and i mean you just imagine legislative

2171
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:53,280
activity informed by a

2172
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,280
active inference style of model where

2173
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,280
you really do probe

2174
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:59,760
and we get feedback right what if we had

2175
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,440
feedback from legislation every year

2176
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:03,280
saying this is good or not good more

2177
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,960
this less of that right i mean that's

2178
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:05,840
the kind of thing there's been

2179
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,520
aspirations that for years

2180
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:10,080
putting lobbying aside that would lead

2181
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,920
to a great efficiency

2182
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:14,080
in things like legislative activity and

2183
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,400
enforcement activity things like that so

2184
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:18,480
i'm very excited that these things are

2185
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:19,760
going to get

2186
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,600
taken in the directions where they

2187
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,199
weren't intended

2188
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:25,120
and i think it behooves the people who

2189
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:28,159
really understand it early on to set up

2190
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:30,400
some nice chunky

2191
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,520
solid

2192
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,840
notions and paradigms so when they're

2193
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,400
adopted they don't drift too far

2194
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,080
from where they should be right because

2195
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:39,600
the things get picked up and taken in

2196
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,360
all sorts of wacky directions out in the

2197
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,880
world

2198
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,320
so it's kind of that's what i'm talking

2199
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,800
about simplifying in a way that still

2200
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,280
does justice to the to the

2201
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:51,600
what's going on there and as a person

2202
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,199
teaching meditation that's exactly the

2203
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:55,600
same kind of mindset you need going into

2204
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,360
these crazy markets right is something

2205
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,520
of common intention because the markets

2206
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:02,000
have different agendas and intention if

2207
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,520
we want the active inference intention

2208
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:04,960
to be carried forward we need to make

2209
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,800
sure that we have robust

2210
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,800
presentation of the model so when it's

2211
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:12,159
picked up that model can withstand the

2212
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:14,000
abuses that happen out there in the

2213
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,640
rhetorical markets anyway again more

2214
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:20,199
just load on your shoulders

2215
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,920
any thoughts there blue or dean

2216
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:28,640
or dave

2217
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,480
i didn't mean to bring things to a

2218
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:33,920
screaming halt sorry i can go in a

2219
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:35,120
different direction

2220
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:36,159
no

2221
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:38,960
all good um

2222
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:42,400
um what's a um figure or a

2223
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,560
word that you might like to go to lars

2224
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,000
or when you're communicating this to

2225
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:46,880
different

2226
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:49,600
audiences like more from the maybe

2227
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,600
non-active infant side what is your

2228
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,679
entry point is it one of the key words

2229
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:55,920
here or one of the figures here or how

2230
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,520
do you enter do you show the action

2231
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,679
perception loop do you just go straight

2232
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:00,560
to the

2233
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:01,440
you know

2234
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:04,080
bayesian graphical model

2235
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:06,560
um yeah good question um i think this

2236
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:09,840
this this card is a a particular one but

2237
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,480
um i think i when i talk about

2238
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:15,199
this paper i kind of do it in in two

2239
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:18,000
steps starting with figure

2240
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,480
um well when we make

2241
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:21,679
when we

2242
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:24,800
look at precision so early on in

2243
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,880
in just talking about attention so yeah

2244
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,400
exactly here

2245
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,360
um

2246
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:30,480
and

2247
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:34,080
just starting here because it's quite

2248
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,920
straightforward as a model of of

2249
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,120
perception

2250
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:39,280
and attention ultimately and you can

2251
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,040
kind of see here

2252
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,880
um intuitively what this precision is

2253
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,560
about and and

2254
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,560
we can yeah let's do this let's kind of

2255
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:47,920
build it up and we'll go straight to it

2256
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,000
we'll go up to figure 12 which is where

2257
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,679
i'm really excited about

2258
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:53,520
and going in the future which is this

2259
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,199
kind of generalization of this this

2260
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:57,360
across and what it might mean and the

2261
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:59,120
game that we have to play here a little

2262
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,480
bit is

2263
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:03,199
a little bit dicey in that in that

2264
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:06,080
we're trying to

2265
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,120
make

2266
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,719
intuitive phenomenological

2267
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:10,800
interpretations of

2268
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,400
maths right

2269
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,280
and

2270
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:14,400
that's

2271
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,480
not not easy and requires a lot of

2272
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:18,960
discussion back and forth but that's why

2273
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,880
we started here with attention because

2274
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:23,199
it's the one place where

2275
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:24,159
it's

2276
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:26,480
less controversial and more widely sort

2277
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,159
of defined and so we're starting with

2278
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:30,640
the tension here just the precision

2279
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:33,440
on you know the likelihood matrix and

2280
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:34,880
you can kind of see

2281
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:37,120
just intuitively i mean maybe this

2282
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,239
depending on who you are listening to

2283
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:40,000
this is like that's already kind of

2284
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,679
obvious yeah um you know higher

2285
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:43,600
precision on the likelihood matrix means

2286
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,159
you know uh is related to attention but

2287
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:47,760
just to kind of motivate that a little

2288
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:50,800
bit more subjectively um

2289
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:51,840
you

2290
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:55,360
can tell that um at the center of your

2291
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,440
vision you know as opposed to the

2292
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,679
periphery you're a bit more confident

2293
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:02,400
about what you're seeing like if you see

2294
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,960
a glass on the table at the periphery of

2295
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:06,560
your vision

2296
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:09,520
you might not be sure if it's a glass or

2297
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:12,080
a mug right but you can still see it and

2298
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,920
then when you look over to it

2299
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:17,679
um then you can be more confident in the

2300
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:19,440
causes of your sensory observations

2301
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:23,159
right or in this case

2302
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:30,000
just lost lars for a second but

2303
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,520
just to sort of

2304
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:34,239
while he's reconnecting

2305
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:36,640
that's one sort of experiential

2306
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,880
urine degenerative model type thought

2307
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:41,840
experiment or really commands for covert

2308
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:45,440
action for attention which is to realize

2309
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:48,480
that the color detection outside of the

2310
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:49,679
center of vision as well as the

2311
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:51,520
resolution is very low

2312
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,040
and that there's a significant blind

2313
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:55,520
spot so there's three features of your

2314
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:56,960
visual field

2315
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:58,880
for healthy vision

2316
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,800
that make it so that the visual field is

2317
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:03,600
not just seen homogeneously

2318
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,000
like a sort of silicone light detector

2319
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,320
light detector device in the camera so

2320
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:10,320
just a starting point for saying okay

2321
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,239
something else is happening

2322
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:14,880
such that attention isn't being paid

2323
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,520
it's being normalized in some way

2324
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:18,639
to

2325
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:21,360
not just increase the resolution outside

2326
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:24,159
of the high resolution detection zone

2327
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:27,199
and colorize it in many cases but also

2328
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:29,600
to normalize the absence and paste over

2329
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,040
the blind spot

2330
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:32,800
so then that can be extended to other

2331
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,960
sensory observations

2332
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:35,760
so

2333
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,199
what do you mean by normalize the

2334
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:38,880
absence and pain over the blind spot

2335
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:41,760
that part like it feels normal

2336
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,040
to

2337
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:45,840
wha was being perceived under just

2338
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,360
again this is the whole interesting

2339
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,800
question about what is perceived as

2340
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,719
normal at what scale

2341
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:52,800
oh it's weird there's a door here

2342
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:55,760
how weird what about the door

2343
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,360
so

2344
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:58,800
i don't want to be so i don't want to be

2345
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,480
normative with the way that i'm talking

2346
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,480
about the mental states but there's

2347
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:04,880
different ways that that uh anomaly can

2348
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:07,360
be detected and there's certain sensory

2349
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:09,199
illusions that are really illusions

2350
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:11,360
because the alternate perception which

2351
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,520
turns out to be factually different than

2352
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:16,480
the actual sensory o

2353
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,719
that is different but that difference

2354
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:20,719
structurally or inaccuracy or around

2355
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:21,840
resolution

2356
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:22,960
is just

2357
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:26,000
seen as part of not salience but not

2358
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,760
salient part of the organism's

2359
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,679
experience phenomenologically

2360
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:32,320
not to say unimportant at a nested level

2361
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,880
of analysis

2362
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:36,719
hey lovers welcome back we're just

2363
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:38,320
talking about um

2364
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:39,920
generative model

2365
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:41,760
vision so

2366
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:44,320
continue on too perfect thanks thank you

2367
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,159
no hopefully it doesn't drop out again

2368
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:48,719
um so that that's kind of motivating the

2369
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:49,679
the

2370
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:50,719
the

2371
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:53,360
phenomenological translation let's say

2372
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:55,679
and then and then the next step is to

2373
01:21:55,679 --> 01:21:58,400
then say well okay we are somehow in

2374
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:01,280
control of that precision and here i

2375
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:04,880
leaned um on existing work by jakob

2376
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:07,199
blimenoski and fristen and others

2377
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:08,239
whereby

2378
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:11,920
that notion of control and mental action

2379
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:13,360
um

2380
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:14,560
then

2381
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:17,040
you can you can talk about that as a

2382
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:19,520
deployment of precision it's some kind

2383
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,400
of a

2384
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:23,040
a precision um

2385
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:24,400
modulation

2386
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,639
is the word i'm looking for and so

2387
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:27,760
then

2388
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,360
then the natural

2389
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:32,159
the kind of next step there is to

2390
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:33,679
you know

2391
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:35,440
make that possible within the active

2392
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:37,199
inference framework in the same way the

2393
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:39,199
other action is also possible and that's

2394
01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:41,840
where the second level comes from

2395
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:44,800
um in figure four i think it is

2396
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:47,280
um because then this is what then allows

2397
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,840
that to be the case and

2398
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:52,480
really all that were all that we've

2399
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:54,560
done here is to say

2400
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:57,360
okay attention is this kind of thing

2401
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:00,400
this is this kind of precision um and we

2402
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:01,840
can motivate that in all kinds of

2403
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:03,840
different ways both sort of

2404
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,320
computationally and intuitively and we

2405
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,000
know we can control it so what would it

2406
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,159
mean to be able to control it well the

2407
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:11,520
same thing that it means to control

2408
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:12,960
anything within this framework and then

2409
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:14,480
here you go this is what kind of makes

2410
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:16,560
that makes that possible

2411
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,639
um and again luckily i'm really standing

2412
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:20,560
on the shoulders of giants here and in

2413
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,080
that you know a lot of this stuff was

2414
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,480
already worked out you know casper

2415
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:25,600
italian

2416
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,280
effective inference already had this in

2417
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:29,360
place they just didn't have a policy

2418
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:32,320
policy set over this higher level yet

2419
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:34,639
um and so this is cool but

2420
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:36,800
uh like i said in the beginning

2421
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,880
uh the the real aim of the

2422
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:41,679
game or what really allows for um

2423
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:43,679
attentional freedom in in the kind of

2424
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:46,840
practice context is not so much

2425
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:48,719
um uh

2426
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:51,760
the attention itself right but it's your

2427
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,520
awareness of where the attention is so

2428
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:54,320
then

2429
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,800
then um the question for me was well how

2430
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,920
do we pay attention to attention but

2431
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:02,159
once we have this this this structure

2432
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:04,880
well then that becomes kind of

2433
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,159
straightforward and not straightforward

2434
01:24:06,159 --> 01:24:07,120
i mean you have to make a little bit of

2435
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,960
a leap but then you say well we pay

2436
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,400
attention to it in the same way that we

2437
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:12,239
pay attention to the sensory states and

2438
01:24:12,239 --> 01:24:14,719
that's where you get the third level

2439
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:16,880
um and where these states now are the

2440
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:18,719
degree to which you are aware of your

2441
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:21,280
attention um and you know if i just ask

2442
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:22,320
you

2443
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,000
you know how where are you of where your

2444
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,239
attention is right now um

2445
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:27,679
when i asked the question probably not

2446
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:29,440
so where just afterwards probably a

2447
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,120
little bit more aware and so there was a

2448
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,679
transition there that that happened in

2449
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:35,520
that higher level state which is then

2450
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:37,280
modulating the precision of the lower

2451
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:39,120
levels now

2452
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:41,760
this kind of uh this kind of a move

2453
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:44,320
computationally mathematically

2454
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,639
is

2455
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:49,520
internally coherent and allowed but it's

2456
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:52,560
also not unique there's no reason why

2457
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:55,120
you can't do the same treatment to

2458
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:58,320
other precisions in the model the other

2459
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,239
ones that we're most familiar with from

2460
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:02,400
the literature are

2461
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:05,520
the precision on g model precision and

2462
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:08,560
the precision on b

2463
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:10,560
which are usually which is usually

2464
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:13,040
related to sort of volatility beliefs

2465
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,320
um

2466
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,400
sort of um

2467
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,560
unexpected uncertainty i think if i'm

2468
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:22,000
saying that right um and um

2469
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,639
just as a side note we made the decision

2470
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:27,760
to kind of change the notation here uh

2471
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,360
just because we're talking about so many

2472
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,280
different precisions in the literature

2473
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:35,120
up until here precision on a

2474
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:36,560
was

2475
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:41,280
zeta i think a precision on b was omega

2476
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:42,639
whereas here now we've just called all

2477
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:45,280
precision as gamma and with a subscript

2478
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:47,120
based on which which parameter they're

2479
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:48,960
referring to

2480
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:50,800
gamma previously was was really just

2481
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,480
referring to

2482
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,320
the precision on g so in case that's

2483
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:55,840
causing any confusion

2484
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,199
um

2485
01:25:57,199 --> 01:25:58,239
so

2486
01:25:58,239 --> 01:26:00,719
the the idea then

2487
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:02,639
uh and what i think is exciting is to

2488
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:04,000
then think about all right well if we do

2489
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,159
the same treatment right what does it

2490
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:09,040
mean to have this higher level state now

2491
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,960
s1 s2

2492
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:13,440
as superscript 2 which parameterizes

2493
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:14,960
other precisions within the model

2494
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:16,080
because that now goes from an

2495
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:18,239
attentional state to something quite

2496
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:20,320
different

2497
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:22,960
so we can talk about these individually

2498
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,239
and

2499
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:26,080
from a

2500
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:28,000
practice perspective this is what this

2501
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,600
is what i'm

2502
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,639
most enthusiastic about because

2503
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:34,639
there's a lot more to meditation

2504
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:36,639
practice for instance and also just sort

2505
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:37,920
of cognitive

2506
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:40,400
mental or catalog of mental action than

2507
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,760
paying attention

2508
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:42,960
you know there's lots of other things

2509
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:46,159
that we're doing so for example

2510
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:47,280
um

2511
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:50,480
the notion of acceptance or

2512
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:51,840
equanimity

2513
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:54,560
um would be the technical term

2514
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,000
where does that live what was it what

2515
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,360
does it mean to be in a state of

2516
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:58,800
equanimity

2517
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,520
right and here we could uh define that

2518
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:04,960
as a as an s as a factor of s2

2519
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:09,040
stay which is modulating the precision

2520
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:12,080
over our preferences

2521
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:13,280
gamma c

2522
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:14,159
right

2523
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:16,320
to kind of give an idea here of how we

2524
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,239
can start talking about this so a state

2525
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:21,280
of acceptance would be you know or state

2526
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:23,280
of sensitivity would be the opposite is

2527
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,679
to what degree are we allowing our

2528
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:28,400
preferences to impact our

2529
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:29,360
um

2530
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:31,520
actions effectively

2531
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:32,880
uh and so

2532
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:35,440
you know in the in the example uh that

2533
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,120
you said in the beginning there dean of

2534
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:38,480
like sitting still you know how

2535
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:40,880
important is that i think yeah that came

2536
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,239
from you then

2537
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:43,760
a big part of that is acceptance right

2538
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:45,600
is being able to be okay with the

2539
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,920
discomfort that's arising from you know

2540
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:50,239
whatever whatever is going on

2541
01:27:50,239 --> 01:27:51,520
and that's also something that we're

2542
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:54,000
explicitly teaching that is a that is a

2543
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
instruct that is an instruction

2544
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,120
um

2545
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:59,199
that is important and a big part of what

2546
01:27:59,199 --> 01:28:01,440
makes it all work and when i say it all

2547
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:02,320
work

2548
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,000
it's leading to

2549
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,520
happiness right like it's leading to

2550
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:06,800
well-being

2551
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:09,840
um and so you can start to

2552
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:11,600
you can start to do that game with these

2553
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:13,520
different different preferences you know

2554
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:14,960
if you outside these different

2555
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:18,400
precisions and see what it would mean to

2556
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:21,440
affect a policy over them and then you

2557
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:23,920
have to do this like i said kind of

2558
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:26,080
um delicate work of translating that

2559
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:28,960
into you know a phenomenological kind of

2560
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:31,520
uh interpretation but i don't think

2561
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:32,960
that's impossible and i think a lot of

2562
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:35,360
it lends itself quite well intuitively

2563
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:37,280
to be able to do that because of this

2564
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:38,560
sort of bayesian

2565
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:41,040
um space that we're in of beliefs and

2566
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:43,040
beliefs of beliefs and different kind of

2567
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:44,159
forms and the way that we talk about

2568
01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:45,920
precision and sorry preferences and

2569
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:47,120
habits

2570
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:47,920
and

2571
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:51,360
the point there for me is that

2572
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:54,320
you can start to figure out

2573
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:57,280
what is causing or what a kind of

2574
01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:00,239
instruction you would need to alleviate

2575
01:29:00,239 --> 01:29:03,280
different kind of um dysfunction or

2576
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:06,000
um unpleasantness so for example

2577
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,560
ryan smith um put out

2578
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:10,800
and colleagues put out a great paper

2579
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,960
recently on gut inference

2580
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:15,360
um and the point there is they're trying

2581
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:16,239
to

2582
01:29:16,239 --> 01:29:18,159
develop a model for

2583
01:29:18,159 --> 01:29:19,280
um

2584
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:21,280
you know the ways in which inferences

2585
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,360
from the gut could go wrong and try to

2586
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:24,480
see if that could be related to

2587
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,159
overeating and one of the one of the

2588
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:28,639
things that's come out there is that

2589
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:30,080
the

2590
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:34,080
one of the ways in which um people's

2591
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:36,000
you know well-being is effective comes

2592
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,280
from this

2593
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:40,000
tendency for priors to get frozen or

2594
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,400
like not be updated very well

2595
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:43,280
and

2596
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:45,920
in in that context it means that you

2597
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:47,280
know people are

2598
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,400
um

2599
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:49,920
effectively

2600
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:51,280
i mean the reason for that is that

2601
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:53,120
you're you're selecting attention away

2602
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:55,199
from uncomfortable sensations of hunger

2603
01:29:55,199 --> 01:29:56,000
right

2604
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,840
so if you are continuously selecting

2605
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:59,040
away because you have a preference

2606
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,600
against hunger sensations then over time

2607
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,040
the priors around hunger and your

2608
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:04,480
behavior and hunger gets frozen because

2609
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:06,000
you're not updating updating those with

2610
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,840
any new observations

2611
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:09,600
so what's the solution there right like

2612
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,520
how can we actually help somebody in

2613
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,600
that situation and well this this gives

2614
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:15,199
us a bit of a hint is that maybe what

2615
01:30:15,199 --> 01:30:17,440
needs to happen there is a training in

2616
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:19,600
mindful acceptance of sensations of

2617
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:22,000
hunger because that's where in this sort

2618
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,840
of precision

2619
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:26,560
dynamic and cocktail of interactions

2620
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,159
things are going wrong and if we can

2621
01:30:28,159 --> 01:30:30,639
kind of translate

2622
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:32,159
practice instructions or internal

2623
01:30:32,159 --> 01:30:35,040
instructions into into this this

2624
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:37,120
framework then it gives it gives uh

2625
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:38,880
avenues for

2626
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:42,320
alleviating different forms of um

2627
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:43,679
different ways in which things can go

2628
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:45,760
wrong here

2629
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:47,440
thanks just one comment thanks just one

2630
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:48,960
comment then scott and then could you

2631
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,480
mute lars

2632
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:51,920
speaker set up for different speakers

2633
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:54,960
set up for you yep

2634
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:56,880
you said about instructions that might

2635
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:58,560
alleviate some non-preferable state and

2636
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:01,040
that really recalls our discussions on

2637
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:03,600
instructionism and interactionism

2638
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:05,440
and how active inference lets us think

2639
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:07,040
about

2640
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:09,040
one extreme with the instructions like

2641
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:11,840
the cues and then on the other extreme

2642
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:13,679
who knows how many ways it goes with

2643
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:16,400
what it looks like to interact and

2644
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:18,560
co-develop

2645
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:20,639
based upon

2646
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:22,000
a total model

2647
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,159
or even parts of a total model

2648
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:25,920
rather than to up

2649
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:28,800
high level x in blood that means you

2650
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:30,400
need to take the x blocker or if it's

2651
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,159
too low you take the supplement like

2652
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:33,920
that could be approached here oh

2653
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:36,080
parameters too high lower it

2654
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:38,480
it's that sort of biomarker driven

2655
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:39,520
approach

2656
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:42,560
that maybe we can move beyond when we

2657
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:44,719
have a rich generative model

2658
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:46,719
and then we can underlie

2659
01:31:46,719 --> 01:31:49,679
go into underlying factors

2660
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:51,120
informed by information rather than just

2661
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:52,960
trying to follow up on mathematical

2662
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:55,040
parameters and um constrain people that

2663
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:56,000
way

2664
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,040
so

2665
01:31:57,040 --> 01:32:00,400
um if you want to say anything or scott

2666
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:03,120
okay scott

2667
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:05,840
so um that last part in the equanimity

2668
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:07,520
brought me back to ecwid the equity

2669
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:09,199
thing again i was reading from this book

2670
01:32:09,199 --> 01:32:11,600
the aristotle thing before and it's it's

2671
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:13,199
interesting because in a way it's a

2672
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:14,560
correction

2673
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,400
to too much

2674
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:19,120
um sensitivity i guess and

2675
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:20,159
you know or the correction of the

2676
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:22,400
general rules and aristotle's words and

2677
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:23,679
it got me thinking

2678
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:24,719
you know

2679
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:26,080
and and this is something we may have

2680
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:27,440
talked about i'm just trying to remember

2681
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:30,480
the phrasing

2682
01:32:30,639 --> 01:32:32,239
it feels like what we're talking about

2683
01:32:32,239 --> 01:32:35,280
there is that the models themselves are

2684
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:37,199
engaging in a peer-to-peer discussion

2685
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:38,639
with each other

2686
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:41,679
to refine each other right so the models

2687
01:32:41,679 --> 01:32:42,480
yeah

2688
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:45,120
it's never one model it's right i always

2689
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:46,400
tell people if i'm trying to explain

2690
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:47,600
active inference i say if you're in the

2691
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:49,679
woods and you don't have a flashlight

2692
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:51,120
and it's dark you're not gonna run full

2693
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:52,560
speed ahead you're gonna stick your hand

2694
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:54,639
out that's the active part and feel if

2695
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:56,080
there's a tree

2696
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:57,199
and if there's a tree you're not going

2697
01:32:57,199 --> 01:32:58,719
to run forward straight into the tree

2698
01:32:58,719 --> 01:33:00,639
you so you now you change your model

2699
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:01,920
there's a tree in front of me that's how

2700
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:03,440
i maybe that's a bad way to explain it

2701
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:05,040
but that's how i explain but this the

2702
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:07,040
thing is it's not just a tree there's

2703
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:09,120
also a model of the rain and there's a

2704
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:10,960
wolf chasing you and there's and you and

2705
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,679
you're hungry there's 17 things going on

2706
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:14,719
so

2707
01:33:14,719 --> 01:33:16,560
what it feels like

2708
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,960
is in intention

2709
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:22,000
we bring our models to bear in a

2710
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:25,280
peer-to-peer discussion internally

2711
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:27,600
and do we do we already use active

2712
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:30,400
inference to model the internal model

2713
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:33,040
discussion among models has that already

2714
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:34,239
been something we've talked about in

2715
01:33:34,239 --> 01:33:36,159
earlier session i don't remember but we

2716
01:33:36,159 --> 01:33:37,920
know we have a zillion different things

2717
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,440
going on that are agenda in our heads

2718
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:41,679
that motivate behavior right and so when

2719
01:33:41,679 --> 01:33:43,679
we're trying to correct behavior or

2720
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:45,440
address behavior or become aware of

2721
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:46,560
behavior

2722
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,960
we bring the other models to bear to let

2723
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:50,159
us do that now again they're all

2724
01:33:50,159 --> 01:33:52,080
borrowed ultimately from the externality

2725
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:54,560
but once they're on board can active

2726
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,920
inference or does active incidence

2727
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:58,159
already has it been brought to bear to

2728
01:33:58,159 --> 01:34:00,560
that internal discussion among the

2729
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:03,040
models that then informs the decision

2730
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:05,040
making thanks

2731
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:08,000
i believe the closest that we've seen

2732
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,440
one example is this nesting which we'll

2733
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:12,719
get back to when we return but it was

2734
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:14,960
mark miller at all with their discussion

2735
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:17,520
of happiness with the drives for like

2736
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:19,600
low thirst you know low overwhelmingness

2737
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:21,679
for one stimuli versus another there's

2738
01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:23,280
like a sort of domain-specific

2739
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:25,280
optimization and then there's this

2740
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,800
cross-domain

2741
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:28,239
optimization that has to do with this

2742
01:34:28,239 --> 01:34:31,120
like eudemonia well-being component

2743
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:34,080
whereas the sort of hedonic drive is the

2744
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:36,400
domain specific that's the department of

2745
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:38,639
thirst department of hunger and then

2746
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:41,440
those are being optimized in potentially

2747
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:43,920
recursed levels as well so that's one

2748
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:46,880
way it's gone was that mapping onto

2749
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:50,159
classical philosophical concepts

2750
01:34:50,159 --> 01:34:51,520
of

2751
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:55,199
well-being success and then um another

2752
01:34:55,199 --> 01:34:57,040
direction has been

2753
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:58,560
also linking it up a little bit more

2754
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:00,800
graphically i think in this type of work

2755
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:03,440
but nice insights scott

2756
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:05,199
just one on that just a response to that

2757
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:06,960
when the imp of the perverse which is

2758
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:09,600
that edgar allan poe notion that people

2759
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:11,440
act against their own self-interest to

2760
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:13,520
show they have power

2761
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:16,000
it's called the imp of the perverse

2762
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,679
and the idea is that people don't take

2763
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:18,960
vaccines because they want to show that

2764
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:21,040
they have efficacy or whatever so the

2765
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:22,719
it's interesting what you just said

2766
01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:25,520
explains that nicely because the state

2767
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:27,360
that they're seeking is a state of

2768
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:28,800
perceived

2769
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,239
efficacy

2770
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:32,080
and it may and it is overwhelming

2771
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,280
perhaps some other things like the

2772
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:34,560
health thing or whatever so that's kind

2773
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:37,280
of an interesting notion we just raised

2774
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:39,520
all our today is just that it we always

2775
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:41,280
got to keep that realism instrumentalism

2776
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:43,360
she said there's 17 things going on well

2777
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:45,040
not if you didn't model them

2778
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:47,040
that's a claim about how it quote is out

2779
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:49,760
there and that's a second order question

2780
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,679
so if it's if it's an allusion to some

2781
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:54,080
causal process inside of some people's

2782
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:54,880
head

2783
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,159
that's different than saying i fit a

2784
01:35:56,159 --> 01:35:58,320
model that has this hidden variable and

2785
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:00,000
that is

2786
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,159
this intersection of

2787
01:36:02,159 --> 01:36:04,639
mathematics and qualitative experience

2788
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:05,440
that

2789
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:07,920
is so tantalizing and so important to

2790
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:09,600
how we think about it and frame it so

2791
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:13,600
it's nice insights though blue

2792
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:16,639
so what scott just said made me think of

2793
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:18,880
um you know scott scott was talking

2794
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:21,119
about how our own models interact with

2795
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:22,719
one another right like the desire for

2796
01:36:22,719 --> 01:36:24,960
thirst or hunger or you know to regulate

2797
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:26,560
temperature or whatever

2798
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:28,960
um but but really like

2799
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:31,920
where can we start to model each other's

2800
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:33,040
models

2801
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:35,360
because i think that that in this like

2802
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:37,199
collective kind of dynamic and that was

2803
01:36:37,199 --> 01:36:38,480
something that i brought up in the dot

2804
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:40,320
zero like this collective phenomenon

2805
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:41,520
like my

2806
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:44,159
model of daniel updates every time i see

2807
01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:46,159
daniel he is as i expect him to be but

2808
01:36:46,159 --> 01:36:48,480
then you know suddenly like if he were

2809
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:50,400
to be you know purple or something then

2810
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:52,480
i would have like the mismatch right so

2811
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,560
our models of each other are constantly

2812
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:55,760
interacting

2813
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:57,600
and and where where can we start to

2814
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:58,560
maybe

2815
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:00,880
look at this or think of this

2816
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:03,760
in what aspect

2817
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:07,199
i love that point

2818
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:08,239
because

2819
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:10,480
what

2820
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:12,639
what break what comes to mind for me is

2821
01:37:12,639 --> 01:37:16,560
is in this context of as you are

2822
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:18,080
i mean to respond to both of your points

2823
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:19,520
really like the

2824
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:21,440
what we're talking about here is a model

2825
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:23,840
of our model right as you move up in the

2826
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:25,840
hierarchy you are modeling your own

2827
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:27,520
model you're getting some beliefs over

2828
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:29,040
how the precision in the lower levels

2829
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:29,840
are

2830
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:32,000
are evolving and so you've got a model

2831
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,199
of your

2832
01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:35,040
your model as you go up but what you're

2833
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:37,119
also learning there is

2834
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:37,840
the

2835
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:41,119
how your mind works and how

2836
01:37:41,119 --> 01:37:42,239
um

2837
01:37:42,239 --> 01:37:44,239
you know different

2838
01:37:44,239 --> 01:37:46,159
states lead to different

2839
01:37:46,159 --> 01:37:48,480
like affect for instance and as you

2840
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:50,080
continue to do that right as you

2841
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,600
continue to learn how your own mind

2842
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:52,880
works and you get more and more

2843
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:56,000
awareness of how things go in your mind

2844
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,480
well then naturally that you

2845
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:00,239
you are also learning about how other

2846
01:38:00,239 --> 01:38:02,960
people's minds work as well

2847
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:03,920
and

2848
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:06,320
there's always this kind of tension

2849
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:07,840
between

2850
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:08,800
um

2851
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,840
sort of compassion in practice and

2852
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,760
awareness in practice or tension there's

2853
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:15,440
this kind of duality between the two and

2854
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:18,000
they kind of seem to come come together

2855
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,840
out of a model like this whereby you're

2856
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:21,760
training in awareness of your own mind

2857
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:24,800
and what you end up discovering is all

2858
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:27,040
how difficult it is actually sometimes

2859
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:29,040
for things to go well and

2860
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:30,639
fundamentally that the one thing that's

2861
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:32,480
driving it all is your own desire to be

2862
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:33,920
happy

2863
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:36,159
as you learn that as that really becomes

2864
01:38:36,159 --> 01:38:38,400
part of your own model then that

2865
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:40,080
naturally projects onto everybody else

2866
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:41,600
and you kind of get this

2867
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:44,320
rebound of oh but then everybody else is

2868
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:45,679
also trying to be happy and it's hard

2869
01:38:45,679 --> 01:38:47,600
for them too and

2870
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:48,960
you get this kind of natural

2871
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,320
compassionate

2872
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:52,239
response then that comes that comes as a

2873
01:38:52,239 --> 01:38:53,520
result

2874
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:55,040
that i think also is related to this

2875
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:56,719
idea that scott was talking about before

2876
01:38:56,719 --> 01:38:57,679
which is that none of these things

2877
01:38:57,679 --> 01:38:59,119
happen in a vacuum like my own

2878
01:38:59,119 --> 01:39:01,760
well-being is very so so

2879
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:04,000
intertwined with your well-being

2880
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,159
and so all these things kind of

2881
01:39:06,159 --> 01:39:07,840
grow then

2882
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:09,440
together

2883
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:13,040
nice it's almost like in in scots forest

2884
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:15,040
one element is there's other people and

2885
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:18,400
maybe non-people entities in the forest

2886
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,560
and then another aspect would be like

2887
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:23,119
you can modify your niche you can you

2888
01:39:23,119 --> 01:39:24,840
can walk different ways you can use

2889
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:27,600
technology and it's sort of that

2890
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:30,159
tension between how sort of slam dunk it

2891
01:39:30,159 --> 01:39:33,040
is for a very constrained case

2892
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:34,400
wanting

2893
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:35,840
and sort of hinting that it could

2894
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:38,320
generalize that more because of the ease

2895
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:39,760
at which it can integrate not just

2896
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:42,080
within a domain like the mountain car or

2897
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:45,040
just thirst but across domains

2898
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:46,400
especially in a way where all the

2899
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:48,480
benefits of the first level relatively

2900
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:50,480
speaking like the computability and the

2901
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:52,400
interpretability of parameters if one

2902
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:54,719
believes that then it exists also at the

2903
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:56,719
second level and higher levels so like

2904
01:39:56,719 --> 01:39:59,119
figure five you have the three layers or

2905
01:39:59,119 --> 01:40:01,360
six but then twelve the generalized

2906
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:03,520
model like you only had two with it i

2907
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:06,080
guess implicit hint that you just do it

2908
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:07,600
again

2909
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:10,719
yeah yeah it's just yeah so pretty cool

2910
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:12,480
dean

2911
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:13,360
d

2912
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:14,880
i mean just to just to speak to that

2913
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:16,239
point i mean um

2914
01:40:16,239 --> 01:40:20,000
you you can and i have um and you can

2915
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,520
start to think about

2916
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:24,320
you know the the third

2917
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:25,600
level

2918
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:27,440
the sort of third level equivalent of

2919
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:29,440
attention was sort of awareness of

2920
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:30,800
mental states

2921
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:32,800
right so now it's like you're not you're

2922
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:34,239
not just aware of where your attention

2923
01:40:34,239 --> 01:40:37,679
is but you're aware of how much you

2924
01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:39,520
you know to what extent do i want here

2925
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:41,040
to what extent am i certain about my

2926
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:42,960
environment to what extent am i happy to

2927
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:45,199
what extent am i um doing things

2928
01:40:45,199 --> 01:40:47,440
automatically to what extent am i being

2929
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:50,400
influenced by my memories and priors

2930
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:52,480
right that to go through the whole

2931
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:54,560
gambit there but then you could do the

2932
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:56,080
same thing with

2933
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:56,800
b

2934
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:59,360
at the third level gamma b that's okay

2935
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:02,000
so what is what is that state telling

2936
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:02,719
you

2937
01:41:02,719 --> 01:41:05,679
and so well to what extent is my mind

2938
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:07,119
volatile

2939
01:41:07,119 --> 01:41:10,000
so how confident am i about the

2940
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,800
transitions of my mental states

2941
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:14,639
right and let's say you take a

2942
01:41:14,639 --> 01:41:16,000
psychedelic or something and all of a

2943
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,119
sudden your mental states are all over

2944
01:41:17,119 --> 01:41:19,280
the place well then maybe that precision

2945
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:20,800
at the third level would drop because

2946
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,080
now you don't have the ability to

2947
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:24,000
predict how your mental dynamics are

2948
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:24,880
moving

2949
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:28,480
or see you know to what extent am i

2950
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:31,040
am i wanting or not wanting particular

2951
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:33,520
mental states um as opposed to sensory

2952
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:34,800
observations

2953
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:36,800
you know like how much how how much

2954
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:39,360
attachment do i have to joy and fear

2955
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:41,760
right now um is what you'd be inferring

2956
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,040
at that level and you can kind of keep

2957
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:46,800
keep going keep going through that

2958
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:47,920
thanks

2959
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:49,760
dean

2960
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:51,440
yeah so

2961
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:52,880
i know we're getting close to the end

2962
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:54,400
here and i just kind of wanted to bring

2963
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:56,239
this up so

2964
01:41:56,239 --> 01:41:58,080
my history just a little bit of context

2965
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:00,159
was that i i was

2966
01:42:00,159 --> 01:42:03,360
a context generating programmer for

2967
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:05,760
uh high school kids and i wanted to take

2968
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:06,880
them

2969
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:09,360
from a place of subliminal to liminal to

2970
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:11,360
understanding what the edges were what

2971
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:12,719
the limits were

2972
01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:16,239
so my my basic job was unnesting

2973
01:42:16,239 --> 01:42:18,639
learners having them transition but

2974
01:42:18,639 --> 01:42:20,639
having them take a model outline along

2975
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:22,080
with them so they weren't

2976
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:24,960
kind of going naked into the forest

2977
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:26,480
so what one of the things that we used

2978
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:28,560
to talk about in this transitioning

2979
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:31,760
across basically the deep generational

2980
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:33,840
transformation was

2981
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:36,480
using a street metaphor

2982
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:39,119
starting with perceiving

2983
01:42:39,119 --> 01:42:41,360
so which is which kind of is unplanned

2984
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:43,360
and moving to thinking about thinking

2985
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:44,320
which is

2986
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:47,600
plan and attend and attend and plan

2987
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:49,360
and then this was the critical piece

2988
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:51,679
realizing the inside the lines

2989
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:53,280
versus the outside the lines and with

2990
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:55,520
the example that we use is that

2991
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:58,159
there's a kind of a crosswalk logic

2992
01:42:58,159 --> 01:43:00,320
calculation problem

2993
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:03,360
so you use logic to push the button that

2994
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:05,119
it gets the flasher going before you

2995
01:43:05,119 --> 01:43:06,800
enter the crosswalk

2996
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:09,280
you stay inside the lines you even

2997
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:12,239
have perfect gating and balance

2998
01:43:12,239 --> 01:43:14,480
so that you can look at your phone while

2999
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:16,560
you're crossing the street through those

3000
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:18,560
lines of immortality

3001
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:20,159
and now you're dead because there was a

3002
01:43:20,159 --> 01:43:22,239
car a driver driver in a car who was

3003
01:43:22,239 --> 01:43:25,040
also looking at their phone and then an

3004
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:27,119
accident occurred so

3005
01:43:27,119 --> 01:43:29,679
the question you had then was did you

3006
01:43:29,679 --> 01:43:32,400
follow the logic did you use the rules

3007
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:34,320
and the answer was yes

3008
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:36,239
and were you aware of the free energy

3009
01:43:36,239 --> 01:43:39,920
gap and the answer was well not anymore

3010
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:41,600
because logic tends to point at the

3011
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:44,000
jaywalker and ask what are they thinking

3012
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,600
i mean come on they're taking the risk

3013
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:46,639
here

3014
01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:48,400
they're prob those jaywalkers are

3015
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:50,800
probably thinking about the opportunity

3016
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:53,360
that there's no cars coming at me right

3017
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:55,760
now or on the street they're not present

3018
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:57,520
so they're thinking about the context

3019
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:59,760
and the directionality

3020
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:01,600
of the transition and they're also

3021
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:03,600
thinking about the rate of travel how

3022
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:06,159
fast can i get across the road and will

3023
01:44:06,159 --> 01:44:07,679
i get a ticket will there be somebody

3024
01:44:07,679 --> 01:44:09,360
who's going to catch me in

3025
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:11,280
and pull me over

3026
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:13,119
all together who's making a decision

3027
01:44:13,119 --> 01:44:15,920
based on more information from which to

3028
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:17,360
update and i think this is the big

3029
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:19,520
question around precision

3030
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:21,920
after all our parallel lines in the

3031
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:24,000
street and in the mathematical

3032
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
operations context

3033
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,600
supposed to represent logic and

3034
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:29,760
precision i think they are

3035
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:32,159
and in this case and based on this slide

3036
01:44:32,159 --> 01:44:33,280
right here this is why i liked you

3037
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:34,480
talking about

3038
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:36,560
math is not the territory

3039
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:38,880
math does allow for the sketching out of

3040
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:41,040
territory and sometimes we can get

3041
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:42,800
inside the lines

3042
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:45,280
and think that we are using the logic

3043
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:46,800
when in fact we're actually going to be

3044
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:48,800
more precise

3045
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:50,480
and actually use

3046
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:52,560
what i would think to be logic based on

3047
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:54,960
more information once we get outside

3048
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:56,960
those lines so when i think when we get

3049
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:58,800
into the point two of this

3050
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:00,000
i think that's going to be a really

3051
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,600
interesting point because steven talked

3052
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:03,199
about it was steve and you were

3053
01:45:03,199 --> 01:45:04,159
wondering

3054
01:45:04,159 --> 01:45:05,520
lars who was the person who's talking

3055
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:07,360
about being really still

3056
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:09,119
that was stephen before he had to take

3057
01:45:09,119 --> 01:45:11,199
off i wanted i'm kind of wanting to

3058
01:45:11,199 --> 01:45:14,239
think about this as being really active

3059
01:45:14,239 --> 01:45:16,719
and being really contemplative and being

3060
01:45:16,719 --> 01:45:18,880
really precise and then be able to sort

3061
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:21,040
of tie that in with the um

3062
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:23,040
the metacognition piece because i think

3063
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:25,280
it's the transition here

3064
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:27,440
that all of us are trying to parallel or

3065
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:29,199
trying to sort of piggyback on your

3066
01:45:29,199 --> 01:45:31,520
paper and i think it's i think it's i

3067
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:33,679
think that's the real value in this

3068
01:45:33,679 --> 01:45:36,000
conversation i also think that we can

3069
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,639
get outside the lines and learn more

3070
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:40,400
than we often do while we're inside the

3071
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:42,719
lines because you know i'm immortal now

3072
01:45:42,719 --> 01:45:44,320
i've got these two white lines

3073
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:45,679
protecting me

3074
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:47,440
and that's not always necessarily the

3075
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:48,719
case

3076
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:51,679
yes yes exactly i mean this what you're

3077
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:52,960
talking about there

3078
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:55,280
for me speaks to this

3079
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:58,000
power of

3080
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,040
um

3081
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:01,920
suspended belief or uncertainty in our

3082
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:02,639
own

3083
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:04,159
maintaining a sense of uncertainty or in

3084
01:46:04,159 --> 01:46:06,480
our own model so that no single belief

3085
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:08,560
can become so rigid and enshrined that

3086
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:12,480
it's resistant to updating in the future

3087
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:15,040
and if you spoke to inesh and mark

3088
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:17,600
miller recently you know there

3089
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:20,080
there is kind of down the same line that

3090
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:22,880
a lot of a lot of dysfunction a lot of

3091
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:25,040
um low states of well-being comes from

3092
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:27,600
that rigidness and that freezing of

3093
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:30,159
of beliefs that then you know leads all

3094
01:46:30,159 --> 01:46:32,960
kinds of afferent behavior um afterwards

3095
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:34,320
because you're trying to fulfill the

3096
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:35,840
expectations of belief that isn't being

3097
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:37,280
updated

3098
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:38,800
the the

3099
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:41,040
what's on offer here is a mechanism to

3100
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:42,400
describe

3101
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:45,600
how you might remedy that solution by

3102
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:48,159
deliberately controlling

3103
01:46:48,159 --> 01:46:51,360
uh or inquiring about the the

3104
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:53,920
metacognitive belief so gamma b in this

3105
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:56,639
case uh over my priors and if i can

3106
01:46:56,639 --> 01:46:58,239
control that state transition well then

3107
01:46:58,239 --> 01:47:01,840
it gives me the opportunity to relearn

3108
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:03,679
that b matrix at the bottom because i've

3109
01:47:03,679 --> 01:47:05,440
injected a little bit of uncertainty and

3110
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:08,320
now i'm more able to sample information

3111
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:10,639
that is counter to what i know

3112
01:47:10,639 --> 01:47:11,600
um

3113
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:14,000
and allows for you know just better

3114
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
optimization ultimately

3115
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,719
yeah take the model along

3116
01:47:18,719 --> 01:47:21,119
thanks dean and

3117
01:47:21,119 --> 01:47:22,719
awesome insight there so just in the

3118
01:47:22,719 --> 01:47:25,760
last couple minutes to dave any textual

3119
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:28,480
questions live chat any final questions

3120
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:30,639
and then scott and then blue if you'd

3121
01:47:30,639 --> 01:47:33,760
like to make a last comment

3122
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,480
so go ahead scott

3123
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:38,400
so that um dean what you were just

3124
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:40,000
saying there goes to that what i was

3125
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
trying to fuss with on that equity point

3126
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
before where it's the rules of general

3127
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,920
application and what i realized while

3128
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:47,920
you were saying the reason the equity is

3129
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:51,840
so fascinating to me is what they did in

3130
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:55,040
law and equity is they said okay the

3131
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:56,960
rules of general application don't

3132
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:59,360
always lead to the right result

3133
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:01,679
and what they've now done is collected

3134
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:04,639
all the remedies for the bad results and

3135
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:07,840
can characterize those into groups

3136
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:09,280
so you may have a rule of general

3137
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:10,719
application and then there's something

3138
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:13,040
out there in equity called unclean hands

3139
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:14,960
which means if i did something wrong if

3140
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:17,360
i'm a burglar i can't sue you if i trip

3141
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:19,199
over your coffee table right that's

3142
01:48:19,199 --> 01:48:21,600
unclean hands right or the doctrine of

3143
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:24,080
um unjust enrichment means if i find

3144
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:26,320
some money and or if i get some extra

3145
01:48:26,320 --> 01:48:27,679
money you pay me too much give me an

3146
01:48:27,679 --> 01:48:30,080
extra 20 bill i say i keep it because

3147
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,600
you you gave it to me but it wasn't

3148
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:33,600
meant to be it's unjust enrichment so

3149
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:35,199
equitably you should give it back where

3150
01:48:35,199 --> 01:48:36,800
i find someone's wallet all this stuff

3151
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:38,800
right so the reason i when you were just

3152
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:41,119
talking made me realize you know

3153
01:48:41,119 --> 01:48:42,560
it may be

3154
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:44,400
that we apply the rules of general

3155
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:45,679
application

3156
01:48:45,679 --> 01:48:48,320
and then we find some exceptions

3157
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:50,560
and then when we start or some ways they

3158
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:52,719
don't apply the right way in active

3159
01:48:52,719 --> 01:48:56,159
inference and maybe we start to cluster

3160
01:48:56,159 --> 01:48:57,040
those

3161
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:59,040
bad results let's call them or

3162
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:00,800
unintended results or something start to

3163
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:03,199
cluster them and characterize those

3164
01:49:03,199 --> 01:49:04,960
like they did in equity so that's what i

3165
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:07,199
was groping for before is the rules of

3166
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:09,440
general application can have great value

3167
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:11,440
and they need those corrections and

3168
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:13,440
those corrections themselves may have

3169
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:15,199
clusterings and groupings that

3170
01:49:15,199 --> 01:49:17,440
themselves can be

3171
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:18,480
managed

3172
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:20,480
thanks great discussion by the way thank

3173
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:23,360
you so much lars is fascinating stuff

3174
01:49:23,360 --> 01:49:27,280
yep thanks scott blue

3175
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:29,280
yeah i'm looking forward to more next

3176
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:31,599
week hopefully if you're available um

3177
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:34,320
and maybe kind of probing the different

3178
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:37,280
types of meditation and i'm not sure how

3179
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:39,040
familiar you are with

3180
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:40,560
different kinds of meditation but i've

3181
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:43,119
done a bunch and highly variable and

3182
01:49:43,119 --> 01:49:44,960
maybe whether or not they all fit this

3183
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:46,639
model or not is something i've been kind

3184
01:49:46,639 --> 01:49:48,320
of thinking about and i'm gonna think a

3185
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:50,080
little bit more about that um over the

3186
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:51,679
next week so thanks for the great

3187
01:49:51,679 --> 01:49:53,360
discussion

3188
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:54,080
cool

3189
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:55,199
thank you

3190
01:49:55,199 --> 01:49:57,679
thanks blue i think it will be good to

3191
01:49:57,679 --> 01:49:58,480
um

3192
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:00,239
see if anybody who's listening in the

3193
01:50:00,239 --> 01:50:03,199
intervening week wants to join or if

3194
01:50:03,199 --> 01:50:04,480
they just want to

3195
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:06,960
watch along next week so they can ask

3196
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:08,080
questions

3197
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:11,199
and uh i think exploring that aspect of

3198
01:50:11,199 --> 01:50:12,400
group

3199
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:15,040
active inference agents by design or out

3200
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:16,080
there in nature that we've been

3201
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:17,920
discussing a lot you know when is it is

3202
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:20,080
it can we model it that way and then

3203
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:22,560
asking well can't we have nested

3204
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:25,599
metacognitive models of groups

3205
01:50:25,599 --> 01:50:27,599
what does that mean is it a different

3206
01:50:27,599 --> 01:50:30,560
philosophical bridge is it two exits on

3207
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:32,320
the same freeway

3208
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:34,400
what is going to be the relationship

3209
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:35,440
there

3210
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:36,639
so

3211
01:50:36,639 --> 01:50:38,880
great times thanks lars and if you have

3212
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:40,400
any final comments otherwise we'll end

3213
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:42,000

3214
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,360

3219
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:54,239
at all if you see what i'm saying so
