00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,519
hello and welcome everyone to the active

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,400
inference lab this is actin flab

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,719
live stream number 28.2

4
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,680
on september 14 2021

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,640
and we're going to be having our dot 2

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,199
follow up discussion on the paper

7
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,279
towards the computational phenomenology

8
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:26,960
of mental action

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,720
modeling meta awareness and attentional

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,560
control with deep parametric active

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,399
inference

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,800
welcome to the active inference lab

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,040
we are a participatory online lab that

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,879
means you can participate that is

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,440
communicating learning and practicing

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,520
applied active inference you can find us

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,559
at the links here on this slide

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,719
this is recorded in an archived live

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,399
stream so please provide us with

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,320
feedback so that we can be improving our

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,600
work

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,440
all backgrounds and perspectives are

23
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,879
welcome here

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,039
we'll be following good etiquette for

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,640
live streams and see who joins in

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,959
at this short link you can find the

27
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,200
calendar of events for 2021 as well as

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,799
all the other kinds of streams that we

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:11,520
do

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,200
related to kind of wild card guest

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,240
streams

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,560
and the more technically oriented model

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,320
streams and math streams

34
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,560
and we have some preliminary decisions

35
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,840
for what we'll read in 29

36
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,000
today though we're here to continue the

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,920
discussion on 28

38
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,920
paper which is the towards a

39
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,000
computational phenomenology of mental

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,759
action paper

41
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,159
and again we'll see who joins and see

42
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,640
where we go i wrote down a few comments

43
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,880
and questions but i know that there's

44
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,479
many ways it can go and of course

45
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,439
everybody who's watching live definitely

46
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,479
um

47
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,280
leave us questions and comments and we

48
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,159
can address them on the stream

49
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:52,880
uh

50
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,200
everyone's participating who's here at

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,040
this time

52
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,880
we can start with just some

53
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,719
introductions and warm-ups since there's

54
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,719
only a few of us we can

55
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,799
say hi and um

56
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,479
reminisce on what brought us to this

57
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,679
paper or even where we'd like to go

58
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,000
for the dot too where are we

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,800
jumping off from or two as we're in that

60
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,800
kind of the middle of the gangplank the

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,360
middle of the diving board so

62
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,599
i'm daniel and i'm a researcher in

63
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,120
california

64
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,760
and i think today i wrote down the

65
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,400
pieces that i wanted to

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,800
if not resolve just at least explore a

67
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,120
little bit and it had to do with

68
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,160
annotating that generalized model of

69
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,200
mental action and seeing if we could

70
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,120
find words in a language or scenarios or

71
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,000
exercises thought experiments

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,120
find some tangible ways to interact with

73
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,080
these different aspects of uncertainty

74
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,599
and then

75
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,599
on a more theoretical note

76
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,080
ask how are those maybe related to

77
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,319
neurological function or certain kinds

78
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,519
of measurements that are made in the

79
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,239
laboratory but just at the experiential

80
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,440
level

81
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,599
are there cases where we actually can

82
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,200
get in touch with some of these

83
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,159
different

84
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,840
qualitatively different kinds of

85
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,480
uncertainty

86
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,840
so

87
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,519
either or stephen just go ahead stephen

88
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,599
avendy

89
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,280
yeah good morning

90
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,519
from toronto um

91
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,360
yeah i'm interested

92
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,440
to sort of pursue what we're talking

93
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,400
about in the last session and

94
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,720
i'm very interested in the fact that

95
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,879
a bit like um to some extent

96
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,879
process-orientated

97
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,400
psychology

98
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,200
by um the min dales which comes out of

99
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,879
some work around information theory in

100
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,239
the 70s this idea of really getting into

101
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,640
the process from within

102
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,879
and the phenomenology so this this this

103
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,799
paper starts to look at

104
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,239
giving

105
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,640
actual models or at least a heuristic as

106
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,280
well for thinking about how we

107
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,360
phenomenologically can be doing stuff

108
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,040
from the inside and for me that's

109
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,879
exciting because

110
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,120
psychology can be kind of limiting

111
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,799
because it's always this external

112
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,080
modeling

113
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,640
of people which then sort of but how can

114
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,320
we get and look at some of the

115
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,238
structures of how we

116
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,040
operate at some level so this this is

117
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,680
cool and i think this is the first

118
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,600
or one of the first papers that really

119
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,759
gets into that phenomenology beyond a

120
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,080
philosophical point of view and starts

121
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,120
to sort of

122
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,680
give a few handles on it and

123
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,520
that's where i'm interested so i'm going

124
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,040
to pass this over if it's okay dean

125
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,040
hey good morning my name is dean i'm in

126
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,400
calgary

127
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,960
and a few years back i read a book by

128
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,280
a philosopher by the name of douglas

129
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,960
hofstetter it's called i'm a strange

130
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,240
loop

131
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,479
and

132
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,960
yeah sort of trying to put some sort of

133
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,840
a

134
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,720
context on when i read that book and

135
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,320
then this paper

136
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,520
um

137
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,440
hofstetter doesn't really get into the

138
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,400
um

139
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,479
the perception of

140
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,160
i'm aware of planning to make a plan

141
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,840
because i can think about my thinking so

142
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,440
what have this planned policy of

143
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,240
attention and then all of the math that

144
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,680
supports that

145
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,000
um

146
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,520
and then he sort of doesn't really get

147
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,479
into

148
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,400
and then what i attend to tells me what

149
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,039
i'm losing focus on which is what this

150
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,600
paper also talks to so again i'm just

151
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,759
trying to i'm trying to put these two

152
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,759
ideas side by each

153
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,520
and without saying

154
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,199
either one of them is more correct i

155
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,520
think they're very complimentary so

156
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,479
yeah that's where i kind of was

157
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,960
looking at this and saying hmm

158
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,720
this is really interesting so yeah

159
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,720
that's where i i'm kind of coming out

160
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,960
this room so

161
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,919
on the hofstetter the strange loop and

162
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,199
the geb some works that i really love as

163
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,759
well as mind's eye with

164
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,880
dennit

165
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,039
yeah it does seem like his focus is on

166
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,120
how symbols

167
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,680
are computed upon which makes sense

168
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,319
given his kind of computational focus

169
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,880
and so we've talked a lot about how

170
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,680
syntax and semantic layers can be

171
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,560
seen within active inference and

172
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,919
that doesn't have phenomenology

173
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,520
in the picture at all

174
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,440
and that's why the sort of question

175
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,639
about how computers interpret syntax and

176
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,120
how that becomes semantics

177
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,759
is orthogonal it's kind of you could

178
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,600
take one take on another

179
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,600
whether computers have experience or not

180
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,720
like you don't need to think that

181
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,400
computers are having an experience or

182
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,360
not to ask how a programming language is

183
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,240
compiled or interpreted so there's sort

184
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,599
of that two by two with how meaning is

185
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,319
made in a computational sense

186
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,520
and then

187
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,520
how our meaning is made and experienced

188
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,759
uh so that's definitely an interesting

189
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,440
piece

190
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,680
um and steven you wrote like from the

191
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,160
inside what do you think differentiated

192
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,199
this

193
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,479
approach

194
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,560
rather than the theoretical or the

195
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,199
philosophical and what does it look like

196
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,720
for an academic

197
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,080
work or for a work of research to

198
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,319
not just be theoretical or philosophical

199
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,680
yeah this is a good question um

200
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,840
well the i suppose

201
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,240
having sort of um

202
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,840
mechanisms and

203
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,599
identifiable relationships between

204
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,000
aspects of experience

205
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,120
i.e

206
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,479
thinking about thinking and

207
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,759
our

208
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,080
sense of

209
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,800
accuracy in our predictions and things

210
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,520
like that gives a way for stuff to

211
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,840
relate to each other otherwise it tends

212
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,039
to be

213
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,639
one

214
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,039
thread of that so be it consciousness be

215
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,720
it um

216
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,000
awareness

217
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,440
be it that one thread then can be mused

218
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,039
about and we could get quite an

219
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,960
interesting philosophical explanation of

220
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,080
what it is

221
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,240
the thing is though that

222
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,960
you can't really process that or try to

223
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,360
emulate the process of that on its own

224
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,240
there needs to be something else that is

225
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,280
somehow

226
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,280
in like you say the body

227
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,039
what's the body you know

228
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,519
some sort of sensory feelings

229
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,760
um some sort of sense of predictions

230
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,640
about something else and

231
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,200
normally that seems to be where things

232
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,120
fall down a bit ends up going off to the

233
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,200
neuroscience world and

234
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,680
again which is great but still ends up

235
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,839
being a kind of a model of the brain

236
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,040
right so

237
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,279
you're in this neurophenomenology world

238
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,200
where it's kind of explaining

239
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,000
phenomenology but through the brain but

240
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
again i can't the brain has got no

241
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,399
feelings inside it you know

242
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,399
so you can't be your brain i think we

243
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,839
think we can because we have all these

244
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,920
pictures of brains as if they are people

245
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,880
but

246
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,120
um so i think

247
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,320
it's interesting questions i don't

248
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,519
really quite thought about it this way

249
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,360
but i think there's something about

250
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,760
having different aspects of our

251
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,240
phenomenological

252
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,480
um being able to

253
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,560
meaningfully relate

254
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,519
um

255
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,200
and not end up being kind of a deep

256
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,760
explanation of one strand i don't know

257
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,800
if that makes sense

258
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,279
it also makes me think about in

259
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,320
hofstetter's girdle usher block geb

260
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,120
one of the main strange attractors

261
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,360
is the turing test so that's the

262
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,160
question about how you can identify on

263
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,320
the other side of the blanket some other

264
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,399
system in another room

265
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,880
how do you know whether it's

266
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,200
a human or whether it's a computer or

267
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,240
whether it's aware or not so

268
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,160
there's been all kinds of thought on

269
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,040
that

270
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,000
and

271
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,360
it's almost like

272
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,240
what happens when you take that

273
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,640
as a fundamental unknowable

274
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,240
how do we respect what's on the other

275
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,760
side of the wall

276
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,320
and maybe even give it an affective

277
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,680
parameter

278
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,440
while recognizing that we have the same

279
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,800
and we're experiencing it but we're

280
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,480
never going to be able to experience

281
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,320
what's on the other side of the wall

282
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,600
we're going to be only able to

283
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,680
experience our interactions with what's

284
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,360
coming across

285
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,959
and i think that's why

286
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,440
hofstetter and dennett worked well

287
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,560
together

288
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,160
because then it with the intentional

289
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,160
stance is kind of like saying

290
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,800
it's simple it doesn't really matter if

291
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,320
you're playing chess it doesn't matter

292
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,079
if you're playing somebody who's human

293
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,399
or a super computer or something it's

294
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,200
about what's on the board and in a way

295
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,640
that's kind of like the way that we're

296
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,640
addressing it's about the sensory input

297
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,240
coming in and how we're modeling the

298
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,480
external states so if it's in the other

299
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,279
room the turing test is

300
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,440
on the outside of our blanket we're

301
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,880
experiencing what's inside and that

302
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,240
could be an illusion or it could be

303
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,480
super real or all that's real depending

304
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,959
on again which philosophy you decide to

305
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,200
lean towards but

306
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,959
the question about how we interpret and

307
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,800
experience our own

308
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,040
parameterization of these models is

309
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,640
really secondary from the implications

310
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,240
of what's on the other side of the veil

311
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,640
steven

312
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,800
yeah that's a really useful um

313
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
lens to bring to play actually and

314
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,399
actually the game brings this back out

315
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,880
maybe so that we're not suddenly focused

316
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,720
only on the individual

317
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,720
isolated from the world

318
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,399
but one thing i think is really

319
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,800
interesting with that is

320
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
with active inference there's this

321
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,399
well n active inference we're going to

322
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,000
go down that route is that you know you

323
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,800
have the

324
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,320
you know with your body right so

325
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,440
ultimately

326
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,000
the active agent can check in

327
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,760
and i think what you're just saying is

328
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,200
one thing that i would know over a

329
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,560
period of time if something was alive is

330
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,680
if they

331
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,320
had to reflect on

332
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,079
some aspect of our discourse okay

333
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,240
and it was something which neither i

334
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,200
could know or they could know

335
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,240
i

336
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,959
but when they checked in with themselves

337
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,639
they came up with an answer which i

338
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,519
could find plausible that makes sense so

339
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,519
there's no way that you you know you

340
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,720
know there's those things that what do

341
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,880
you feel about this well i feel and then

342
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,639
you come up with something he's like we

343
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,560
there's a knowing that you come up with

344
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,680
right but that wasn't in your semantic

345
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,560
lexicon of pre-programmed stuff you were

346
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,480
able to check in somehow

347
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,760
and that's the sort of thing an

348
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,360
artificial machine

349
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,000
can't do unless it can check into some

350
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,079
some way of knowing because

351
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,639
if it wasn't known before how could it

352
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,079
have ever been programmed into the

353
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,519
supercomputer

354
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,000
so that's kind of interesting

355
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,079
it comes up in this paper with a

356
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,360
question about transparency and opacity

357
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,440
so again the kind of what is water

358
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,279
transparent states are the ones that you

359
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,880
see right through so you actually don't

360
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,079
perceive them directly like air and then

361
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,480
the opaque states are the ones kind of

362
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,480
like you know the matte black wall you

363
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,720
can see it really well and so this

364
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,839
question about how a prompt

365
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,399
can almost like a phase transition

366
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,639
move something from being transparent to

367
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,680
opaque like how does your leg feel right

368
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,959
now

369
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,200
and it moves it from being a transparent

370
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,519
state potentially one that attention is

371
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,200
not being paid to

372
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,760
to an opaque state which is something

373
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,240
that attention is being paid to that's

374
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,480
one of the major contributions of this

375
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,279
paper which is to take metzinger's

376
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,440
framework of transparent and opaque

377
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,560
states

378
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,800
as applied to phenomenology

379
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,199
and bring that into the

380
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,360
affective framework

381
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,760
developed by hesp at all for the deep

382
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,560
parametric active inference so it is

383
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,399
like these multiple threads coming

384
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,720
together and then

385
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,639
it's just so appropriate that attention

386
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,600
is kind of the thread that links it and

387
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
precision and awareness are kind of

388
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,360
coming together in new ways

389
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,839

390
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,440
um the two things i wrote down and of

391
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,000
course anyone watching live definitely

392
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,120
ask random questions no off topic

393
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,320
questions

394
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,800
no such thing exist not not forbidding

395
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,880
such questions

396
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,079
um so one thing as kind of addressed

397
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,560
earlier was i thought it'd be fun to

398
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,920
annotate figure 12 a bit and explore

399
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,000
some of these qualitatively different

400
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
forms of uncertainty

401
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,120
and

402
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,839
but maybe a lead-in topic and again

403
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,680
anyone can just

404
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,839
feel differently or ask a question a

405
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,880
leading topic was like

406
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,959
how do we think about uncertainty

407
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,839
greetings fellow jitsu blue jitzer

408
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,000
uncertainty in remote work just

409
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,680
how often when you send a message

410
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,519
you don't get that instantaneous

411
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,279
feedback that you would

412
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,399
in

413
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,880
a video conversation or in an in-person

414
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,880
conversation because the time lag is

415
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,639
very different so it's almost like

416
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,240
you're left hanging

417
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,240
with the uncertainty or you have to come

418
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,199
to a new way of understanding

419
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,240
your uncertainty because you're not

420
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,920
or you're expecting not to hear from

421
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,519
them oh i know that they're on the other

422
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,839
side of the world so i'm expecting not

423
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,560
to hear from them for the next hours

424
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,680
just

425
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,079
i wondered what sorts of these um

426
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,759
personal level

427
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,800
uncertainties applied to the remote case

428
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,279
and then thinking about the remote team

429
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,800
as its own active inference entity

430
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,440
are there uncertainties that exist

431
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,399
for located or remote teams

432
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,279
that

433
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,040
don't necessarily

434
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,880
find themselves simply explained by

435
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,800
personal level affect

436
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,639
are the things that teams are uncertain

437
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,800
about that people are certain about like

438
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,160
a hung jury

439
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,639
or a split election or decision

440
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:15,920
are there things that people are

441
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,680
uncertain about but that groups can be

442
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,030
quite certain

but that's just things that we can

446
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,880
return to in any

447
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,959
time

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,720
just got my package through for my mum

454
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,240
i think blue wants to say something yes

455
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,560
blue

456
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,600
uh yes so just to that point i mean i

457
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,920
think that like that's like the

458
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,240
the kind of like lifeline or ask the

459
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,079
audience like in the you know when you

460
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,559
have uncertainty about a question i mean

461
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,880
an individual can be uncertain but

462
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,959
the um crowd can have some certainty and

463
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,240
wasn't there something about guessing

464
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,319
the weight of a bison or

465
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,240
some story like that like where you know

466
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,400
the the i think it was the median value

467
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,480
was exactly the weight of the bison like

468
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,199
from this entire like divergent crowd um

469
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,199
i'm not sure the exact i don't remember

470
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,640
like the exact story it's just kind of

471
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,160
faint in my memory but i mean i think

472
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,559
that definitely the crowd knows what

473
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,000
the individual can't

474
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,679
maybe there's many oh yeah steven go for

475
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:34,640
it

476
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,320
yeah well that yeah that's an

477
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,799
interesting one that um

478
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,039
blue mentioned and and also i suppose

479
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,720
there's this question well let's say we

480
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,360
take uh you know bayesian statistics you

481
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,080
know if it's a distributed sense of

482
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,600
something

483
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,280
well so when you've got a very large

484
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,120
number there may be this distributed

485
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,840
sense which as if people have got a feel

486
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,880
for it

487
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,799
i mean i suppose it assumes that there's

488
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,960
not complete noise there's the people

489
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,120
have got some kind of idea out of that

490
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,480
group but there's

491
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,200
some knowing but in a team and stuff

492
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,960
there is this question and this may be

493
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,880
really what types of things we're

494
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,280
evaluating is with a team

495
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,400
or a group

496
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,840
because teams tend to have a particular

497
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,960
teleology if we're trying to get a

498
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,000
handle on something intersubjective

499
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,600
i mean a classic case with this would be

500
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,360
saying in a marketing agency or

501
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,520
something like that or with a film

502
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,280
you know you might want to

503
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,120
get a sense of

504
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,640
you might get market research but you

505
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,039
also want the creative team might get a

506
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,280
sense of

507
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,320
what is um you know what's what how's

508
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,640
this going to land you know what's and

509
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,840
that that might be an integrated thing

510
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,600
um and it might be the other creative

511
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,880
director that

512
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,120
is pushing out their one vision because

513
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,720
they're trying to be novel they're

514
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,280
trying to give something that breaks

515
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,799
the group

516
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,200
um expectations

517
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,440
however you also then want to

518
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,080
stay within i mean a classic one would

519
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,120
be like ricky gervais before the um when

520
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,360
he did his uh what was it the it's not

521
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,960
the oscars but he did the other one the

522
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,120
golden golden globes

523
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,240
at some point he had to kind of wait

524
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,720
what he could get away with right

525
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,400
so there would have been a whole load of

526
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,679
people sort of

527
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,360
seeing how that could get tweaked and

528
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,039
nudged so that

529
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,280
it basically fits on that

530
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,160
very near edge and that's uh

531
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,080
you know that that would tie quite well

532
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,640
with the fact that you need to have more

533
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,200
you can't it's not just multi-sensory

534
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,120
integration on one person that's enough

535
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,919
you might need

536
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:42,720
multi-inter-subjective

537
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,559
awareness integration to get a better

538
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,799
sort of integration

539
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,720
right you need to know how others

540
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,799
thinking through other minds or theory

541
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,160
of mind you need to

542
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,919
kind of have an estimate of how others

543
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,520
will

544
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,000
feel about your stimuli from an

545
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,840
affective dimension

546
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,480
and

547
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,679
blue i think

548
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,400
the example with the ox and guessing the

549
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,280
weight it's uh francis skalton sir

550
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,200
francis galton perhaps

551
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,280
and i just looked it up it was a 787

552
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,559
fair goers

553
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,600
who predicted the weight of this animal

554
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,919
and that the average was extremely close

555
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,679
even though of course many individuals

556
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,880
probably

557
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,760
were over or under by vast margins and

558
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,000
it ties us back to the strange loop and

559
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,280
aunt hillary the ant colony in geb

560
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,840
and when does collective decision making

561
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,159
work collective decision making amongst

562
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,559
cortical neurons it seems to work pretty

563
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,120
well that's kind of what evolution has

564
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,320
shaped

565
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,240
why did it work for predicting the

566
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,559
weight of that ox well potentially many

567
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,720
people were familiar with how much

568
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,720
animals weighed

569
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,760
another answer is that it was within an

570
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,120
order of magnitude like you could

571
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,720
probably say well it's probably not 100

572
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,559
pounds and it's probably not 10 000

573
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:03,679
pounds

574
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,720
so when there's bounds to the estimate

575
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,480
rather than it being distributed over

576
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,760
like many orders of magnitude there's

577
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,640
a case for the average being something

578
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,360
that can be taken and that actually has

579
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,240
analogy to a lot of these mean-seeking

580
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,400
distributional techniques that we

581
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,720
utilize like the case where the actual

582
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,360
distribution might be very rough

583
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,760
but we use variational techniques

584
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,320
that can pursue for example the mean

585
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,240
of the distribution and just sit the

586
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,400
weight of our distribution that we

587
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,919
control q

588
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,200
and sit

589
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,600
with only one or a few parameters

590
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,080
right over the bulk of the distribution

591
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,440
rather than getting into the hundred

592
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,960
parameters that might describe the

593
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,120
actual underlying distribution

594
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,320
and so it's like

595
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,080
under what cases

596
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,559
can distributions be well approximated

597
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,360
by their mean and by many independent

598
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,400
estimates

599
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,320
and under what cases might you be

600
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,760
looking just like steven said with a

601
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,360
marketing agent

602
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,520
trying to be creative or novel

603
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,039
under what cases are you actually

604
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,679
looking not to estimate the mean

605
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,880
but rather to propose a counter factual

606
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,679
or to make something that is going to

607
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,799
succeed by virtue of its novelty

608
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,280
stephen

609
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,919
yeah and also it takes you into this

610
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,799
world of the of the rural community i

611
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,159
don't know if it's rural america you

612
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:28,880
know

613
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,360
they will have their wisdom about those

614
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,600
types of things their fair go as they

615
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,360
they probably got quite an insight into

616
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,039
animals you know they

617
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,960
i bet you could get a fairly good idea

618
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,200
of how slippery it would be to try and

619
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,919
grab hold of that baby hog you know in a

620
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,080
way that the city folks wouldn't have a

621
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,080
clue so it's a

622
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,559
this kind of contextual

623
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,840
social like

624
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,640
knowing um it's quite you know that that

625
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,799
that i think that's a good thing to

626
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,720
to bring in as well when we think about

627
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,840
participation you know then this knowing

628
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,679
that can be in different communities

629
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,280
outside of the

630
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,880
the cities which you know and the

631
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,200
advertising agencies and these

632
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,120
dominating kind of

633
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,400
media

634
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,520
sort of

635
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,919
leaders of thought

636
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,320
i think it shows how we need to be able

637
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,760
to bring in

638
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,400
these more disparate ways of

639
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,360
experiencing the world

640
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,600
well when it seemed that there's a mean

641
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,760
or an average like there was the famous

642
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,240
like um like average american survey or

643
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,840
something like the dimensions of the

644
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,600
average person but then like no single

645
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,559
person

646
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,799
was within a tolerable limit of that

647
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,919
average yet there was an approximation

648
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,679
um versus

649
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,760
casting it into the experience like how

650
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,360
will this be received by different

651
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,200
people it includes in the question

652
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,600
the need to think through other minds

653
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,039
and um

654
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,679
that no one was thinking through the

655
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,360
animal when they had to predict the

656
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,440
weight that's that external the third

657
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,320
person psychology and it was estimating

658
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,840
a physical attribute so it's not like

659
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,960
they were trying to do anything

660
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,520
different but now if you asked on a

661
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,200
scale of one to ten

662
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,679
how do we estimate how happy this animal

663
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:16,880
is

664
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,799
the variance around that estimate is

665
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,360
going to be of a very different kind

666
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,200
and potentially an irreducible kind

667
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,559
we're not just looking for a point

668
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,880
estimate to converge on

669
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,400
maybe there's differences in opinion and

670
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,840
that is something that would be revealed

671
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,200
through that question

672
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,400
whereas

673
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,679
if you're wrong about the weight it's

674
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,600
just because maybe you're

675
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,520
not used to it or something like that

676
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,880
steven yeah

677
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,960
yeah that's a good that's a good point

678
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,200
to bring in as well is when looking and

679
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
say also we maybe want to bring in this

680
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,360
bayesian inference as well like if you

681
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,120
could have multiple rounds you know like

682
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,480
when carl fristan does some of the

683
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,799
demonstrations

684
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,480
it would be interesting

685
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,120
a to be able to have some way of looking

686
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,440
at something and using multiple

687
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,159
iterative rounds which they do in

688
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,320
a lot of processes like future search

689
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,840
and um

690
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,039
other kind of

691
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,000
group participatory processes and also

692
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,799
though

693
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,960
to break apart the generative models at

694
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,600
play so you and this is this is the

695
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,919
challenge is with a lot of things is

696
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,159
with normal statistics is you'll get an

697
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,080
answer you'll get a graph if you just

698
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,480
take all the numbers and divide by x

699
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,440
right

700
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,520
and then so someone's now got research

701
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,360
results but the thing is like you say it

702
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,960
makes a difference if you've got three

703
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,400
models two models five models one model

704
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,559
going on of the reality that they're

705
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,039
trying to in theory that that the weight

706
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,559
of the cow there's

707
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,000
probably one model there might be a

708
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,039
couple of different ways of trying to

709
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,039
think about how to go to that model but

710
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,120
you know this is sort of a fairly clear

711
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,640
proposition but

712
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,799
if you do have more than one generative

713
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,640
model or one contextual

714
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,600
engagement that's being used teasing

715
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,520
that out and then having a way to

716
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,840
iteratively

717
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,760
do beijing inference and active

718
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,960
inference

719
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,200
on each of those models so they can be

720
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,840
teased apart would look like it'd be a

721
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,000
useful thing

722
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,919
cool dean

723
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,360
yeah i'm just going to say to steven's

724
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,799
point there's a

725
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,279
book called the end of average by todd

726
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,480
rose

727
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,440
that speaks to those times when

728
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,520
finding the mean doesn't really work and

729
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,720
you do have to kind of pull that

730
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,640
generative model apart

731
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,080
so if you're if you're interested in

732
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,080
that there's there's a great reference

733
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,120
thanks dean

734
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,960
and then um this idea of updating

735
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,760
it's almost like we have a vertical

736
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,240
updating which we're gonna look at when

737
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,159
we look at the deep parametric model

738
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,799
it's an updating within

739
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,520
the agent within the system passing up

740
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,320
and down top top down bottom up but it's

741
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,600
an updating inside of the agent versus

742
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,080
the updating laterally or across the

743
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,960
ensemble of similar agents like imagine

744
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,640
if the people instead of putting their

745
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,880
weight estimate for the for the ox into

746
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,080
a box

747
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,320
they actually talked about it

748
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,919
there's cases where you could imagine

749
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,760
that would actually

750
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,679
make a worse estimate like a really

751
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,080
persuasive person is convinced they have

752
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,080
high precision about their estimate

753
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,279
they're wrong but they have high

754
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,000
precision and then in that case it's

755
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,640
possible for them to shape group

756
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,559
outcomes

757
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,880
like a more stubborn peg

758
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,039
whereas there's other cases where when

759
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,440
maybe um it's less important to be

760
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,360
precise on a point estimate but like to

761
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,200
brainstorm maybe sharing ideas early on

762
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,600
helps increase that temperature and

763
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,520
updates people's models in a way where

764
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,679
just having them in separate lanes and

765
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,360
then coming together to converge at the

766
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,840
end it's it's too late for those ideas

767
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,200
to be meaningfully compared because

768
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,520
they're of such different type whereas

769
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,440
again if everybody is constrained to

770
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,120
we're fitting something about weight

771
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,000
only then maybe it's okay to combine

772
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,080
them later on in the process blue

773
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,279
so i was trying to flip the paper just

774
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,120
now but i think that they've looked at

775
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,640
that actually like when you have really

776
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,480
strong

777
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,640
conviction about your

778
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,320
beliefs or ideas they look at how

779
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,960
information is spread in networks and

780
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,279
really like those people that are

781
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,760
you know very strong in conviction they

782
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,440
like contaminate

783
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,520
their like neighbors in the graph

784
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,840
essentially so it's really neat to kind

785
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,640
of see this like information propagation

786
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,679
and how it really does start with the um

787
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:40,960
the people with the strongest

788
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,440
convictions

789
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,720
it's almost like uh yeah yes people are

790
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,880
spreading information based upon a few

791
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,200
things but up there on the list would be

792
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,240
how precise they are about it

793
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,559
and also how they want to be seen

794
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,640
so both of those are like first and

795
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,039
second level estimates of precision

796
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,919
about oneself metacognition i won't

797
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,760
raise my hand if i'm not totally sure or

798
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,600
you know i'm watching a live stream but

799
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,200
i'm not sure if this is a good question

800
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,919
to ask hint it is but then you don't

801
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,320
know so you don't make the action

802
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,480
versus how will even other people

803
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,080
perceive it

804
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,840
that was probably less important in an

805
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,039
anonymous

806
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,440
guess about weights but as we talk about

807
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,000
issues that are increasingly social

808
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,880
those

809
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,159
become the drivers maybe 90 of people in

810
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,000
a room or in a country feel a certain

811
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,159
way but it still isn't perceived as

812
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,320
something that's okay to share

813
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,799
stephen

814
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,799
yeah this also ties into when

815
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,480
a lot of context that's actually a

816
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,799
mediator chapter was a mediator he had a

817
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,640
really good quote that he actually came

818
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,640
up with it was saying how

819
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,520
um

820
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,679
process both conscious and unconscious

821
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,039
implicit and explicit has a greater

822
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,440
impact on outcomes

823
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,440
than substance

824
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,720
i.e

825
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,000
so if you're going to bring people

826
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,200
together like we're saying and they're

827
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,880
going to try and work together being

828
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,919
able to

829
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,760
the process through which people

830
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,120
interact

831
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,720
can have a bigger impact on the outcome

832
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,320
than the substance partly because of

833
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,000
exactly what blue was saying

834
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,760
and you were saying you know around

835
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,679
whether someone becomes a dominant voice

836
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,279
whether certain information if it all

837
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,720
becomes about the substance it's very

838
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,720
easy to get trapped in this

839
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,520
who's right who's wrong well if in this

840
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,559
instance we're trying to get

841
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,360
a different handle on things

842
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,799
or to try and get a an active influence

843
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,880
we need that process to be given a

844
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,399
chance um

845
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:43,520
so i think that's quite and that's

846
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,960
actually also had a good conversation

847
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,640
yesterday with uh

848
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,200
um gary kirkham actually does a lot of

849
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,760
device theater work through so

850
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,080
interesting processes where they mix

851
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,720
different artists and one thing there is

852
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,120
when they go into the action space of

853
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,039
exploring

854
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,320
they would have the director watching or

855
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,559
they have like a device there to play

856
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:07,919
right watching

857
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,679
and in some ways the people who are in

858
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,240
it they just are totally immersed in it

859
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,679
they can't really reflect on where they

860
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,080
are at that moment it's just in there

861
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,519
and there's all this information and the

862
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,159
people on the outside are watching and

863
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,399
you could say i suppose they're actively

864
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,320
inferring on what might be easier to say

865
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,679
this bayesian

866
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,919
integration and waiting and then

867
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,399
afterwards they will be told what worked

868
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,399
what didn't work and then they could

869
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:33,840
bring that to their conscious awareness

870
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,120
and maybe

871
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,600
bring that in again with some but that

872
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,600
process

873
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,760
in a way needed to be just a living

874
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,519
process and not

875
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,320
too cognitive for the person to give

876
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,000
good quality

877
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,720
fuzzy information

878
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,840
so

879
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,919
uh two things there

880
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,679
the first is what do we say about active

881
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,760
inference it's a process theory

882
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,760
it's a corollary of free energy

883
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,840
principle and it probably draws on many

884
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,399
other domains as well but it's a process

885
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,679
theory it's not um a state theory and in

886
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,240
the alias 2018 interview fristen talks

887
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,000
about process versus state so that's a

888
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,240
lot like this process versus substance

889
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,320
you derived these are

890
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,919
a set of patterns

891
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,320
for how systems update

892
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,880
and so it is about the process of active

893
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,760
inferencing which i hear people using

894
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,600
sometimes which even differentiates it

895
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,919
even more from being just a static

896
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,399
substance theory like it's a static

897
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,279
theory about active entities it's like

898
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,200
kind of but it's actually a dynamic

899
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,320
theory

900
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,799
about static and dynamic entities

901
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,080
because you could have an active

902
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,360
inference agent

903
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,600
that is just a thermometer so its

904
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,720
affordances are nil so can't act but we

905
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,399
can still put it within this bayesian

906
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,640
graph framework it doesn't need to be

907
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,559
far from equilibrium it doesn't need to

908
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,320
be intelligent it doesn't need to be

909
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,480
actively foraging for information we

910
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,200
know the model can go all those places

911
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,799
but it's almost like with the process

912
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,600
theory you can explain active and

913
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,919
passive processes whereas with a

914
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,720
substance theory you're able to explain

915
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,640
static things pretty well but then

916
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,640
there's always this question about using

917
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,279
the static theories to apply to dynamic

918
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,559
systems

919
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:19,519
and then

920
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,200
also to

921
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,480
connect to the first piece of what you

922
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,279
said and to return to maybe some of the

923
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,360
threads in this paper you talked about

924
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,440
how that was a mediator

925
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,720
and so

926
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,640
mediation can look like so many things

927
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,399
from diplomacy

928
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,320
negotiation

929
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,399
maybe even marketing like you raised

930
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,519
earlier but mediator sounds a lot like

931
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,039
meditation

932
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,519
like the mediation is like we're we're

933
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,440
not just going to make a call and then

934
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,480
you're going to live with it it's like

935
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,480
we're going to mediate

936
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,399
now what are we mediating

937
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,399
when we meditate

938
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,559
are we mediating our thoughts and these

939
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,440
kind of mindfulness cues that lars was

940
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,320
providing last week

941
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,679
like putting the distance between

942
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,919
oneself and their thoughts in a way it's

943
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,000
like being a meta mediator or somehow

944
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,199
mediating

945
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,719
lower level

946
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,879
cognitive processes

947
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,800
through the process

948
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,199
not the substance that we call

949
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,638
meditation blue

950
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,119
so maybe like what are we mediating in

951
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,399
meditation that's like a super

952
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,239
interesting question and i wonder if

953
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,760
it's um

954
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,918
you know like the information

955
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:37,119
transmission in the brain or maybe

956
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,000
uh propagation or like the ongoing like

957
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,040
wandering mental wandering maybe so

958
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,000
there's

959
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,760
you know if we're if essentially

960
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,119
meditation

961
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,599
cuts that information transmission right

962
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,760
so so when you just are like letting go

963
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,280
let go of the thought right like the

964
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,280
thought arises just let go so the

965
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,639
thought doesn't keep wandering around

966
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,560
and i wonder if a thought spreads like i

967
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,000
don't know i mean i know my background's

968
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,440
neuroscience but i don't know enough

969
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,480
about

970
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,560
or maybe no one knows enough about the

971
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,160
brain and functionality to know like

972
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,920
does a thought propagate like from one

973
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,839
region of the brain to another region of

974
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,920
the brain like stimulate a new thought

975
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,920
right like and is that how like mental

976
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,280
wandering maybe works i mean i don't

977
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,720
know i mean it's just it's just

978
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,800
hypothetical but but maybe we're cutting

979
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,800
that information transmission process

980
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,480
off when we're mediating through

981
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,040
meditation

982
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,599
stephen

983
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,520
yeah it's interesting i thought blue

984
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,119
about tren it's actually funny because i

985
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,720
was just watching this video on process

986
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,960
orientated psychology and it was talking

987
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,960
about moving between modalities you know

988
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,960
like you know it could be you know i

989
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,960
have a thought

990
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,599
having seen something and then maybe it

991
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,920
processes into how i hear it

992
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,240
and how i see it and how i

993
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,240
color it you know like it could be you

994
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,640
know this it could be interesting how

995
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,760
the different sensory modalities could

996
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,760
um you know could hold a thought for a

997
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,839
period of time and then pass it back

998
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,680
again because synesthesia obviously is

999
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,839
an interesting one on that and i've just

1000
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,240
seen an interesting paper actually that

1001
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,119
um

1002
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,359
talks about how

1003
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,320
um

1004
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,280
the vowels i-e-a-o-u

1005
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,200
they mapped it out for colors and they

1006
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,440
find that there's like a color map for

1007
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,280
how people see it and that maps across

1008
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,640
swedish and english i think it was

1009
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,240
swedish in english

1010
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,040
so

1011
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,200
that's interesting as well that there

1012
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,320
could be

1013
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,079
you know these subconscious correlates

1014
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,400
thanks steven blue

1015
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,760
yeah so i mean i really don't know that

1016
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,760
we know enough about a thought and like

1017
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,680
this reminds me of um our guest stream

1018
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,359
with shanna dobson like

1019
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,599
what is the fundamental unit of a

1020
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:46,079
thought right and and so i know in

1021
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,839
a biological sense like the fundamental

1022
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,440
unit of a thought really kind of has to

1023
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,520
be the action potential but

1024
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,680
like is it one action potential is it

1025
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,079
like some critical number of action

1026
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,839
potentials that instantiates the

1027
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,240
thoughts so i don't know um and

1028
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,599
definitely like there is that that

1029
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,560
propagation or like a spreading some

1030
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,800
contagion maybe to like other brain

1031
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,480
regions in synesthesia i think that

1032
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,880
that's been pretty well established like

1033
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,119
that there's like some crossed wires and

1034
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,520
so like you get auditory perception for

1035
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,520
example in the visual cortex and so i

1036
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,599
know that there's that relationship so

1037
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,440
that kind of does like lend itself to

1038
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,599
this idea of like the thought

1039
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,920
propagating through different um areas

1040
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,599
of the brain that but that's in in a

1041
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,839
very incorrect sense i just wonder even

1042
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,599
in normal people does a thought like

1043
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:32,880
what is a thought how many action

1044
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,680
potentials make up a thought and then

1045
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,839
does that can that move around like

1046
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,000
within a region or to different regions

1047
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,440
is that actually what's happening i mean

1048
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,040
i don't know that we can quantify that

1049
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,640
at all but it's just it's interesting to

1050
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,800
think about

1051
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,800
not to always come back to aunt hillary

1052
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,760
the ant colony in geb but that's the

1053
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,320
analogy that hofsteder makes it says if

1054
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,480
ensembles of neurons are transiently

1055
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,160
activated and even for the same word

1056
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,920
it's a different ensemble of neurons

1057
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,839
which is increasingly what molecular

1058
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,640
neuroscience is showing to be the case

1059
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,560
and similarly with the ant colony it's

1060
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,640
like the task group is assembling and

1061
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,200
disassembling and reorganizing the idea

1062
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,560
of a thought is still that noun centric

1063
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,520
approach

1064
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,599
which would lend us to want to find a

1065
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,000
static representation versus like a

1066
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,880
thinking unit or something that reminds

1067
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,040
us that it's a process that thinking is

1068
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,400
a process

1069
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,280
um

1070
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,240
so one comment and then a nice question

1071
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,440
in the chat

1072
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,240
about the mediator and the meditation so

1073
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,480
let's go to figure five which is

1074
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,839
again one of the

1075
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:40,880
main contributions of the paper

1076
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,400
so it's this three

1077
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,359
level

1078
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,680
nested structure

1079
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,800
and

1080
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,280
the outputs of one level

1081
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,480
influence

1082
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,040
a lower or an interior nested model so

1083
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,119
on the bottom in blue

1084
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,520
is the perceptive states like what am i

1085
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,119
perceiving is it

1086
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,440
light or dark

1087
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,599
the second level is the attentional

1088
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,400
layer so contrast this with for example

1089
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,599
lstm

1090
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,400
or other types of attention based neural

1091
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,440
network

1092
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,680
architectures which are not based upon

1093
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,359
first principles

1094
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:16,640
uh per se

1095
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,520
and then what this paper adds in

1096
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,400
is

1097
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,599
not just the affective components

1098
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,200
but actually this

1099
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,079
precision of how aware am i of where my

1100
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,880
attention is so then thinking about the

1101
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,680
mediation and meditation i thought well

1102
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,839
one mediation that might be happening in

1103
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,200
active inference

1104
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,240
is the mediation between epistemic and

1105
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,880
pragmatic goals so that's kind of like a

1106
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,720
seesaw and there's some sort of

1107
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,800
negotiation happening

1108
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,680
with free energy minimization that is

1109
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,440
balancing it's mediating these two goals

1110
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,079
when the two goals are perfectly aligned

1111
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,480
great then it's like we agree

1112
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,880
but when they don't perfectly align when

1113
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,960
the pragmatical just wants to run up the

1114
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,960
mountain and then the epistemic goal

1115
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,480
wants to ask

1116
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,240
should we look around and see if there's

1117
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,880
another way that might be better in the

1118
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,680
long run yeah can we go around exactly

1119
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,359
dean solenoid yep the solenoid will flow

1120
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:18,319
and so

1121
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,480
there's sometimes a tension there and so

1122
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,560
that's one type of mediation

1123
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,440
but then

1124
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,599
using the mediator more like the the

1125
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,000
higher level diplomat here

1126
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,400
it's almost like the green layer

1127
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,760
is serving as a mediator of attention

1128
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,440
by

1129
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,319
calling awareness to it and this is

1130
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,680
awareness of awareness that's why it's

1131
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,319
metacognition

1132
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,240
but it's mediating

1133
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,160
the dynamics of the second layer which

1134
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,319
end up cascading to influence the

1135
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,160
perceptive layer as well

1136
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,280
but

1137
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,000
in a sense it is mediating

1138
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,079
the activity of the second layer and

1139
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,160
certainly this is the level that in the

1140
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,440
paper they're saying is where meditation

1141
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,400
rests that's why when we just had active

1142
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,480
inference plus attention we didn't have

1143
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,240
papers on meditation

1144
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,920
but now that we have active inference

1145
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,079
plus metacognition awareness of

1146
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,280
attention

1147
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,520
we bring in this whole experiential

1148
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,880
dimension

1149
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,119
with meditation stephen

1150
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,160
one question i might have here

1151
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,480
um

1152
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,240
at that bottom and say what am i

1153
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,720
perceiving so that's kind of fair enough

1154
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,640
there's that kind of

1155
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,680
what's

1156
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,680
you know i was just thinking about

1157
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,720
and then what am i trying to do

1158
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,079
now there's an interest rather than what

1159
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,000
am i trying to perceive

1160
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,680
which is kind of interesting how they

1161
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,319
went for that because

1162
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:47,440
i mean i'm just thinking about there

1163
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,280
could be that time for instance i'm

1164
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,520
perceiving someone's i know saying i'm

1165
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,960
perceiving someone's got a bit of food

1166
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,720
in their teeth right

1167
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,560
and what i'm trying to do is listen to

1168
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,400
what they're saying

1169
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,720
but i'm seeing that bit of food it's

1170
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,560
kind of hard now

1171
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,720
so then what am i paying attention to

1172
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,079
but what am i trying to do is an

1173
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,760
interesting one because in some ways

1174
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,839
you could say what am i trying to do

1175
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:15,359
i think implicitly saying what am i

1176
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,119
trying to do with my sense oral

1177
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,520
apparatus but it's a bit longer

1178
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,520
um rather than what am i trying to do

1179
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,520
which which could be a higher policy

1180
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,040
level

1181
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,960
thing yep

1182
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,359
great question i think one possible

1183
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:32,000
answer and this relates to potentially

1184
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,599
the slightly different way that active

1185
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,079
inference partitions

1186
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,319
problems than other domains is

1187
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:39,760
your preference

1188
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,680
would be that the other person doesn't

1189
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,520
have your preference at the first level

1190
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,839
would be to see no food in the teeth so

1191
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,680
there's two states in that preference

1192
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,560
vector um in the in the c vector which

1193
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,880
isn't going to be shown here but the

1194
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,119
preference would be to not see the food

1195
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,040
and then the policy

1196
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,280
of the first perceptive layer is ocular

1197
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,400
motor

1198
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,119
the policy is what can be controlled at

1199
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,640
that first level

1200
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,319
so you could avert your eyes as a policy

1201
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:11,680
that's one way

1202
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,240
of not getting the visual stimuli

1203
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,599
however

1204
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,599
you can still hold it in your memory

1205
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,240
that it is likely to be that case so

1206
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,480
that's an example of like a hidden state

1207
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,240
which is the state of the food all

1208
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,920
you're going to get is photons

1209
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,520
corresponding to whether there might be

1210
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,440
food there or not and then you're doing

1211
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,200
hidden state inference now even though

1212
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,760
it's a visual so it's like why is it a

1213
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,920
hidden state if it's visual because it's

1214
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,960
actually your onboard state estimate

1215
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,200
of something that's out there

1216
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,240
you're

1217
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,480
seeing it through visual mechanisms but

1218
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,000
at the first level

1219
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,560
the policy is for how you can move your

1220
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,440
eyes

1221
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,720
not

1222
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,560
some other higher level policy yes

1223
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,839
stephen

1224
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,920
yeah that's that's quite a good uh way

1225
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,359
of thinking about it and i think it also

1226
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:58,800
shows

1227
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,319
like how it

1228
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,400
is probably more easily tractable when

1229
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,319
you say you have the visual you have

1230
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,160
something fairly clearly

1231
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,520
on the visual

1232
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,880
um or a particular sensory

1233
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,839
modality um then you could see how the

1234
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:17,040
attention shifts now obviously in in our

1235
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,599
in much of our life but maybe not so

1236
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:21,680
much in meditation because we we are

1237
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,200
able to attune to

1238
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,960
certain sensory

1239
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,560
uh roots

1240
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,119
more clearly but in daily life

1241
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,119
it's all mashed together so much that it

1242
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:32,640
probably is part of the reason why it

1243
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,200
becomes imperceivable because

1244
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,359
you know your body might be

1245
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:39,680
in the mode of

1246
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,920
the bigger goal are you getting to work

1247
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,200
on time

1248
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,280
um and then your visual thing in that

1249
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,800
real time is trying to listen to the

1250
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,119
conversation with the ticket collector

1251
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,560
who's got a bit of two food in their

1252
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,200
mouth in their tooth or whatever so you

1253
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,200
and it would all become hard to make

1254
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,200
this tractable you know because this

1255
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,359
this isn't necessarily set up to think

1256
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:00,560
about multi

1257
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,880
um sensory integration not that it can't

1258
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,200
but that would start to distort this

1259
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,040
it's probably easier to think about this

1260
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,599
where is a fairly clear

1261
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,920
modality at play

1262
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,599
another thing to know is we don't

1263
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,680
necessarily talk about goals in the

1264
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,599
active inference ontology we have

1265
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:18,880
preferences

1266
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,880
which are over sensory outcomes and

1267
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,599
policies which are action capacities

1268
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,319
action sequences that we're choosing so

1269
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:27,920
goals are

1270
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,359
they're a word and people know what

1271
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,839
we're talking about but in this model

1272
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:34,079
there is no goal for anything they're

1273
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,400
just preferences and policies so i want

1274
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,040
to

1275
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,960
read this question

1276
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,640
which is going to be interleaved with a

1277
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,720
definition and then it will be an

1278
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,160
interesting question

1279
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,400
so liberty wrote

1280
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,000
still reading through the paper aren't

1281
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:48,960
we all

1282
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,960
which seems deeply complementary to

1283
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,000
metzinger's account of m autonomy so i

1284
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
just want to read a definition of m

1285
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,760
autonomy since it wasn't a term i was

1286
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,280
very familiar with and this is um a

1287
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,920
a paragraph written by christoph delega

1288
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,520
who is also in the active inference

1289
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,119
community so kind of

1290
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:09,200
thanks for going out in front helping us

1291
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,520
be clear about our definitions and so

1292
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,319
what christopher wrote was

1293
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:17,280
in his recent article metzinger 2015

1294
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,480
argues for a new construal of mental or

1295
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,160
m autonomy

1296
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,400
that's the m as a functional property

1297
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,160
which consists in the deployment of a

1298
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,480
special kind of model one which

1299
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,319
represents the self as an epistemic

1300
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:31,280
agent

1301
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,920
this epistemic self model is and then

1302
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,920
here's the quote from metzinger

1303
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,240
a global model of the cognitive system

1304
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,520
as an entity that actively constructs

1305
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,440
sustains and controls knowledge

1306
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,160
relations to the world and itself

1307
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,520
metzinger 2015 page 272

1308
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,119
so

1309
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,839
good call liberty definitely we're

1310
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:55,520
hearing words like epistemic and

1311
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,839
self-modeling and active states that

1312
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:59,359
seem to bring us close to active

1313
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,839
inference and so their question was

1314
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:04,560
how do processes such as intentional

1315
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,000
inhibition

1316
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,359
inform

1317
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:10,000
a formal account of cognitive control in

1318
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,640
your opinion

1319
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,000
so we can look at five while this is up

1320
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,559
and people are thinking or

1321
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:22,400
just let me know which slide to go to so

1322
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,960
steven first or blue you want to go

1323
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,200
just reread the question one more time

1324
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,040
how do processes such as intentional

1325
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,760
inhibition inform a formal account of

1326
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,359
cognitive control in your opinion

1327
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,599
so stephen and then anyone else who

1328
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:40,240
wants to go for it

1329
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,640
um so intentional inhibition

1330
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,400
um or unintentional

1331
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,400
uh

1332
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,920
uninhibited

1333
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,160
behavior or inhibited behavior i suppose

1334
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,880
you could have it in different ways um

1335
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,680
i think what for me what's interesting

1336
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,319
with this when you start getting into

1337
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:03,280
um

1338
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,960
how we relate and how we fit into our

1339
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,440
social

1340
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,559
landscape so to speak with that type of

1341
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,800
thing

1342
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,839
is

1343
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:18,960
when we because inhibition tends to be

1344
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,240
something you're thinking about in a

1345
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,559
social context within reason

1346
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,319
it's like that thing about dances if

1347
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,160
you're on your own

1348
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,200
um

1349
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,960
i feel that is a really good case for

1350
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,400
where there'll be an intern locking

1351
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,400
model such as the type of work used in

1352
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,520
mental space psychology to mediate

1353
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,640
um this metzinger

1354
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,000
um

1355
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,280
uh

1356
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,559
knowledge

1357
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:45,920
structure

1358
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,119
because that then gives you a kind of

1359
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,520
an embodied inactive

1360
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,359
framework

1361
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:56,319
which the brain can actually

1362
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,400
use as a kind of meta model in

1363
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,640
peripersonal space

1364
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,880
um so i think that this is a quite a

1365
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,760
good

1366
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,559
point here is at what point

1367
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,920
um

1368
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,880
do we need to have a mediating

1369
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,040
embodied um

1370
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,520
sort of

1371
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,520
metaphor or structuring to help some of

1372
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,119
this

1373
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,839
pass out into the complex domains of a

1374
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:26,559
social setting

1375
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:28,839
thanks steven

1376
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:31,440
dean yeah i just think it's interesting

1377
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,119
that if you

1378
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:34,720
if you think about inhibition and you

1379
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,200
think what the effects of that are

1380
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,520
you can actually control the situation

1381
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,079
if you don't talk because we all hate a

1382
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:45,040
void or a vacuum and so by not

1383
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,319
expressing

1384
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,160
sometimes you you pull other people's

1385
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,480
expression into

1386
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,880
more than you maybe even anticipate and

1387
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,079
so i

1388
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:55,839
actually

1389
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,440
have found

1390
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,040
people who are

1391
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,720
less extroverted a little bit more

1392
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,440
introverted tend to have a lot more

1393
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,240
power in these kind of co-variational

1394
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,680
situations that maybe they believe they

1395
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,359
possess

1396
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:12,960
i know the people that are extroverted

1397
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,160
think that they're controlling the

1398
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,559
conversation but

1399
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:19,440
just stare blankly back at somebody and

1400
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,760
really pay attention and listen

1401
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,680
and you'll be amazed at how much control

1402
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,400
you actually possess in that in that

1403
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,040
relationship

1404
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:32,319
i have a thought on that but blue first

1405
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,319
go ahead mine's unrelated it just

1406
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:37,440
reminded me of the sort of street hustle

1407
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,160
dynamic which is on one hand that person

1408
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,760
must be

1409
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,839
superficially extroverted i mean they're

1410
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,520
coming up and speaking to a stranger if

1411
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,880
it's about a chess game or they're

1412
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,480
selling something or they want you to go

1413
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,720
to that club in las vegas

1414
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,359
that is a very extraverted social

1415
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:54,559
activity

1416
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:57,440
but the art and the science of that

1417
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,839
straight game is actually about what

1418
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:02,480
dean just wrote or said i guess like the

1419
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,800
introversion that brings

1420
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,599
the other person and elicits them

1421
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:09,040
to feel like they should put out their

1422
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,599
personal information into a void but if

1423
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:13,440
someone's just like chat chat chat chat

1424
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,400
chat

1425
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,079
there's no space for them to become

1426
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:18,240
vulnerable to feel like they're part of

1427
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,000
the conversation and ultimately to

1428
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,359
reveal personal information so it it

1429
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:25,359
shows that um

1430
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:26,720
of course we're using the introvert and

1431
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,720
extrovert little loosely people say oh

1432
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,720
it means they draw their rejuvenating

1433
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,160
energy from being alone or in public

1434
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,000
like there's different definitions but

1435
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,079
it just shows that actually it's not

1436
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:37,440
just about

1437
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,960
saying something or being the first to

1438
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:39,839
speak

1439
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:43,040
that can also be a superficial mode of

1440
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,359
control and that there's a deeper mode

1441
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:46,559
of control

1442
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,240
that actually has to do with picking and

1443
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,400
choosing your words as well as when to

1444
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,920
use them

1445
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,640
blue anything on that

1446
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,800
so unrelated but just going back to

1447
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,319
inhibition stephen do you want do you

1448
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:00,240
have something directly related

1449
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,760
um well one little thing just just a as

1450
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,520
a comment is one thing i remember

1451
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:11,040
when they had the the press inquiry in

1452
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,520
london about the levinston inquiry and

1453
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,839
rupert maxwell had to give evidence

1454
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:18,480
about his newspaper empire one thing

1455
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,839
that was really noticeable and they were

1456
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,359
saying this because he was like you know

1457
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:22,800
he's a very obvious he's a high level

1458
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,400
executive etc he always took his time

1459
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,240
like when he was asked a question it was

1460
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,559
almost like he was always used to having

1461
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:31,760
the time

1462
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,760
to think through his answer

1463
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,280
say what he needs to do and be able to

1464
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,520
reply his own leisure

1465
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,280
in a way that other people might not and

1466
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,079
that that also speaks to that power of

1467
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:43,839
when someone who's presumably quite

1468
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:47,119
dominant and be able to be forceful also

1469
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:49,760
can they know they can hold the space

1470
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,440
and there's probably some element of

1471
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,760
knowing how much power you have to be

1472
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,359
able to get away with that and no one

1473
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:56,960
else steps in so that's quite

1474
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,599
interesting anyway thanks

1475
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:01,760
blue then dean

1476
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,839
go ahead dean you've got some retort so

1477
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:05,440
i'm gonna go back to inhibition when you

1478
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,760
guys are done yeah yeah no i i i think

1479
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,960
it's just really interesting because

1480
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,359
i've read some stuff about

1481
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:13,520
if you're an fbi interrogator one of the

1482
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,240
tactics that's actually trained into fbi

1483
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,160
interrogators is to be

1484
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,359
intentionally inhibited

1485
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,880
interesting so there's

1486
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,400
intentional in the social intentionality

1487
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,480
and then i think

1488
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,520
could be

1489
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,160
otherwise but it seems like metzinger's

1490
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,359
account and and liberty's question

1491
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:39,920
is about the intentional inhibition

1492
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,559
within the agent as a mechanism of

1493
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,640
cognitive control but it brings us right

1494
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,559
back to this idea of the vertical

1495
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:47,680
nesting

1496
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,760
and then in that situation intentional

1497
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,800
control

1498
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,160
is kind of cascading from the top

1499
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,480
but then also there's intentionality

1500
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,720
laterally like i

1501
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,200
am intending to control somebody else's

1502
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,800
cognitive state

1503
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,720
and so that's actually one reason why

1504
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,040
it's important to have a model that's

1505
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,599
kind of like legos in two dimensions

1506
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:11,680
because these active inference models

1507
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,839
they plug in really well

1508
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:15,119
nesting

1509
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:16,480
internally

1510
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,720
so we can talk about top-down cognitive

1511
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,040
control and maybe have intentional

1512
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,920
inhibition as a phenomena within a

1513
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,800
broader science of mental action which

1514
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,720
we can get to in 12

1515
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,079
but also

1516
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:32,240
we can just as fluidly use some of the

1517
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,880
same variables and some of the same code

1518
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,960
some of the same formalisms for the

1519
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,960
kinds of intentional control that

1520
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,040
happened laterally so it's like when

1521
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,880
somebody is taking a deliberate pause or

1522
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,400
somebody asks a really hard question and

1523
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,880
then they go

1524
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,040
they take their time with the response

1525
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,960
that's an intentional cognitive control

1526
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,640
which has traditionally been the realm

1527
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,160
of the sort of psychology perhaps but

1528
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,559
then that can be understood to be

1529
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,079
deployed

1530
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,720
in a cultural context by which it's

1531
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,400
being used to intentionally control

1532
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,720
others states and so we can have a bunch

1533
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,559
of different agents each consisting of

1534
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:09,760
nested

1535
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,359
models like this

1536
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,480
and we can

1537
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,480
stack them up vertically as well as have

1538
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,480
interactions laterally because

1539
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,480
intentionality is deployed in both of

1540
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,400
those directions stephen

1541
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,079
yeah and following on to what you're

1542
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:26,880
saying this this then starts to

1543
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,520
there's a big gap in

1544
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,359
basically between psychology and

1545
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:33,280
sociology

1546
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,040
which is this idea or i suppose you

1547
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,040
could in many cases teams is one area

1548
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,040
where it gets looked at you know is

1549
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,720
you know it's great you can take an

1550
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,000
average and you can take your

1551
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,520
statistical averages you get your

1552
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,040
sociology

1553
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,119
within in many cases and you get your

1554
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:48,880
individual

1555
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,160
but um

1556
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,240
part of the reason that we end up there

1557
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,040
is

1558
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,559
not because they're the most useful

1559
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,640
places to be is because you can measure

1560
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,480
them you can get units of analysis which

1561
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,440
you can

1562
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,880
do stuff with

1563
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,359
and the inter-subjective stuff around

1564
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:06,400
four or five people is is a huge

1565
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,000
challenge right because

1566
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,160
you can't ignore the complexities of the

1567
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,920
individual yet you've got the

1568
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,480
complexities of the group

1569
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,680
and

1570
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,319
so that speaks to to that you know that

1571
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:20,640
ability to now start to get in and say

1572
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,839
okay well

1573
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:23,760
let's say we can tease out some

1574
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,160
generative models or

1575
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,920
not even generative models i don't think

1576
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,040
but to be able to tease things out a way

1577
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,359
which maybe can make meaning in group

1578
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:35,119
context and this participatory sense

1579
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:38,319
making that's that's really what is is

1580
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:40,640
moving things forward i think

1581
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,640
it almost makes me think of

1582
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,799
someone who can facilitate a group and

1583
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:47,119
it's like i know you intended to just

1584
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:49,040
share what you're excited about but

1585
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,280
you're unintentionally exerting

1586
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,240
cognitive control on other people

1587
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,119
by

1588
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:57,440
bringing up this topic or by speaking in

1589
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,440
this way so it helps us look at that

1590
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,839
vertical intentionality and the lateral

1591
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:04,799
social intentionality together

1592
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:06,480
maybe even

1593
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,079
not just with the same model but on a

1594
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:09,760
common footing

1595
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,440
of precision

1596
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,799
precision within the individual and

1597
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:15,359
precision of the team so it's like these

1598
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:16,720
are the real

1599
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,200
nuts and bolts of where integrative

1600
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,440
models matter if we had a totally

1601
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,520
disjoint model for what was happening

1602
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,839
inside of a head and then

1603
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:27,200
across

1604
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,880
bodies and brains

1605
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,960
we wouldn't have um

1606
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,040
the market to sort of flip back and

1607
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,880
forth between those currencies per se we

1608
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,640
would need another third level connector

1609
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,799
theory so it's like if you have one

1610
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:41,280
theory in theory b you need to invent

1611
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,599
theory c in the middle but if you have

1612
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:46,160
just one integrative theory then

1613
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,760
it's just a question of how it all works

1614
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,839
together dean

1615
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:51,920
yeah just one last quick comment i think

1616
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,400
it's really interesting that uh

1617
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,240
that an inhibition

1618
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,880
can be seen as a as a as a tactical

1619
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,559
stance and a reveal on those markov

1620
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:04,559
blanket hidden states

1621
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:05,760
i mean that's

1622
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,920
i'm not sure it's a cipher because you

1623
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,200
don't actually know what the other

1624
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,119
person if they're going to sort of be

1625
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:12,880
drawn into something that they otherwise

1626
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,799
wouldn't but i just think it's really

1627
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:16,319
interesting that

1628
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:17,359
we

1629
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:18,640
we assume

1630
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,079
that we have to keep the conversation

1631
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,520
going

1632
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,440
and we don't assume that maybe one of

1633
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,640
the ways to

1634
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:28,400
to do that is to not say very much

1635
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,960
and to give one neurological comment on

1636
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,799
that

1637
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:35,440
perhaps back in the day people thought

1638
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:38,000
with the higher orders of the brain the

1639
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,680
higher thinking processes being the

1640
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,599
generative and the creative processes

1641
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:43,359
since those are the human specific ones

1642
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:45,040
and were generative and creative and so

1643
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,359
on but when you look down to the synapse

1644
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:48,319
level

1645
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:51,200
the frontal cortexes are actually

1646
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,440
using inhibitory control

1647
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,200
so it's this model where it's like we

1648
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,880
can actually

1649
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,520
be creative and we can be generative

1650
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,920
through the appropriate

1651
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,480
inhibition we don't need to have this

1652
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,359
passive midbrain that gets exalted into

1653
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:10,480
activity by a really smart forebrain

1654
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,160
rather we can actually have the

1655
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,799
endogenous wisdom and activity that

1656
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:16,160
never seizes

1657
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,400
with targeted inhibition

1658
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,760
coming from

1659
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,520
some other parts of the brain

1660
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,480
i'm sure

1661
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,000
that was a simplification blue so i know

1662
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,240
you could say more on that

1663
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,400
no so that totally like leads into

1664
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,680
exactly what i was wanting to say

1665
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,079
earlier about inhibition and cognitive

1666
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:35,280
control so like if we were in this

1667
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,720
overly

1668
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,640
neurologically like neuron to neuron

1669
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,960
excited state i mean that's a seizure

1670
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,640
right so when you're you've got over

1671
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,720
excitation in the brain it's it's not

1672
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:48,720
always good but but so i mean to what

1673
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,520
intent like to what extent does

1674
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,760
intentional inhibition right this is

1675
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:54,880
going back to the question that's what

1676
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,799
they said intentionally

1677
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:59,040
so when you have intentional inhibition

1678
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,640
i wonder and this goes back to what i

1679
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,400
was saying about meditation like

1680
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,200
shutting off the fundamental unit of a

1681
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,440
thought so i wonder if intentional

1682
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,839
inhibition when you refrain from

1683
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:12,240
blurting something out or when when you

1684
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,559
practice restraint or or you know

1685
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:15,839
refrain from letting your thoughts

1686
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:19,119
wander so when you inhibit yourself this

1687
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:21,359
intentional inhibition i don't know but

1688
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:23,119
it's curious to think about does this

1689
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,359
correspond to you know there's activity

1690
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:27,040
in the brain excitatory makes more

1691
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,440
action potentials happen and inhibitory

1692
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,920
makes fewer action potentials happen so

1693
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,599
when i do this kind of intentional

1694
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:34,720
inhibition

1695
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,799
does that inhibit my neurons in a

1696
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,200
corresponding way i'm curious i mean i

1697
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,680
would guess because it it just you know

1698
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,599
i mean at least in the meditative sense

1699
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:45,440
i would think inhibition of an action

1700
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,680
potential propagating forward

1701
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,839
so it's a curious thing to to wonder

1702
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:50,799
about

1703
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:52,160
to what extent does intentional

1704
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,880
inhibition exert cognitive control at

1705
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,100
the molecular level

1706
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,520
[Music]

1707
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,880
thanks blue steven

1708
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,839
yeah that's

1709
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:05,920
actually got me thinking now on sunny

1710
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,359
that's quite

1711
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:10,359
um

1712
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,400
that

1713
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,079
that question about the higher level

1714
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:16,400
lower level i think and this this is a

1715
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,480
really interesting piece oh actually and

1716
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,720
it ties back to what i was thinking of

1717
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,720
asking as well about figure 5 where you

1718
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,960
put subliminal

1719
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,119
processes and maybe conscious processes

1720
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:29,200
i think that's an interesting

1721
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,280
point on figure 5 that you've there

1722
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,799
because maybe it's the middle bit that's

1723
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,960
more conscious at certain times

1724
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,440
and the top bit is actually never quite

1725
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,000
aware of you're only able to effectively

1726
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,280
feel

1727
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,960
and the you know so there might be that

1728
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,640
it's actually the middle layer there on

1729
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,040
figure five that's conscious

1730
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,440
um and i i like what that's actually

1731
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:50,960
really interesting if it's inhibitory

1732
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,880
because

1733
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,720
there's an interesting model i i've been

1734
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,799
trying to work with called dilts logical

1735
01:01:56,799 --> 01:01:58,799
levels um

1736
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:01,119
um and you've got the kind of the

1737
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:03,599
identity level which i'm if i map this

1738
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:06,640
onto the the identity level or the face

1739
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:07,520
um

1740
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:11,039
could be seen as what broadcasts um

1741
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:12,799
where we are

1742
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:13,920
and

1743
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,160
some of that we're conscious of

1744
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:19,280
and some of that we're not you know so

1745
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,039
and then we've got where our awareness

1746
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:22,240
is in the moment and then we talked

1747
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,520
about this kind of

1748
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,319
lower level which you can only you're

1749
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:28,400
sort of aware of but it's again it's

1750
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,440
slightly outside of that crystal clear

1751
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,559
um question so i wonder one figure five

1752
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:35,839
and maybe this is a question for daniel

1753
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:36,880
because it might be put that i don't

1754
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,799
know if you put those on there

1755
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:39,760
you know where you put we've got

1756
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,640
subliminal and awareness and

1757
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,960
um how is this interface mediated and

1758
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,319
i'm kind of wondering what i'm paying

1759
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:48,880
attention to maybe what is actually

1760
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,280
awareness in

1761
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,520
a

1762
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:56,960
like sort of i could tell you sense and

1763
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,119
the top one is an awareness in a kind of

1764
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:00,000
a

1765
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,880
fail almost like a metaphor it feels

1766
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,359
like this to try and

1767
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:07,680
have that meta awareness but you can

1768
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:11,440
never quite get a handle on it you know

1769
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,760
great point and

1770
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:17,920
totally open to anyone's insights or the

1771
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,680
authors or otherwise

1772
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:22,400
but this first level is again about

1773
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,319
sensory perception

1774
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:25,280
so

1775
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:28,559
it is possible that the second level

1776
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:31,200
is the reportable opaque state that's

1777
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:34,079
one of the innovations of this paper

1778
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:36,559
and there would have to be another level

1779
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:38,880
to make this state at the very top

1780
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,000
reportable so it might be the case that

1781
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,359
this green

1782
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,119
topmost layer

1783
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:48,319
is the felt awareness of

1784
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:50,240
where one's attention is

1785
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,319
as well as their preferences for where

1786
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:54,400
their attention should be which might be

1787
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,880
scaffolded by meditation saying

1788
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:00,160
it's awesome to focus on this mandala or

1789
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:02,640
it's awesome to focus on compassion so

1790
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:05,280
these are shaping preferences

1791
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,599
over policies

1792
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:10,000
for how aware one should be it's great

1793
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,280
to be paying attention and then the what

1794
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,280
is one paying attention to is where

1795
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:18,240
those policies are uh influencing yeah

1796
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:19,920
where the attention is being paid but

1797
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,680
when somebody says like you know there

1798
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:25,200
was a car crash and i couldn't look away

1799
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,359
it's almost like well the first layer is

1800
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:29,280
that they were perceiving

1801
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,880
cars on the road

1802
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,160
the attention

1803
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,880
they're reporting is that

1804
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:37,839
they were paying attention to that

1805
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:40,240
but then there's this implicit third

1806
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,240
state that they were aware of where

1807
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:43,599
their attention was

1808
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:44,880
otherwise they wouldn't have been able

1809
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:48,079
to report i couldn't have looked away

1810
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:50,319
so they were extremely aware of where

1811
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:53,119
their awareness was

1812
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:56,000
that's what metacognition brings in

1813
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,160
that simply attention doesn't

1814
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,599
and

1815
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:01,920
again another argument for first

1816
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,240
principles theories that work really

1817
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,720
well in this sort of composable way

1818
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,559
because there are

1819
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:10,640
neural network models with so-called

1820
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,480
attention but where would you put

1821
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,480
metacognition in there might be a

1822
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,400
variety of ways to do that and maybe

1823
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,839
some would be practical and some

1824
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:19,920
wouldn't and maybe some would be

1825
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,520
implementable with the tools you already

1826
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:24,319
have maybe others wouldn't but here when

1827
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:26,160
we can just look at the skeleton of the

1828
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:27,039
model

1829
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,079
we can

1830
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:29,839
come to some pretty interesting places

1831
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:33,200
just by working with what's composable

1832
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,240
rather than just sort of trying to make

1833
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:37,680
it um

1834
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,400
fit well first

1835
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,319
and then make it composable in

1836
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:44,160
understandable seconds

1837
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,359
we're beginning with composability and

1838
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,480
comprehensibility and then the question

1839
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,480
about how it will fit empirical data

1840
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,119
well it's an empirical question

1841
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:55,599
stephen

1842
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,200
yeah this is interesting you can bring

1843
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,640
in empirical data you've got that

1844
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,799
advantage of potentially

1845
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:03,280
say the subliminal layer it may not be

1846
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,039
self-reports it could be that you could

1847
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:06,720
use other

1848
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:09,039
measures you know brain scanning and

1849
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:10,880
other things to give a sense of when you

1850
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,200
know what is coming in there

1851
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,960
and of course as they mentioned because

1852
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,319
attention

1853
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:18,160
and again this is where we get caught in

1854
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:19,839
our own need to make sure the literature

1855
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:22,400
can hold together you know attention as

1856
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,559
as was mentioned by lars is kind of

1857
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:27,760
relatively uncontroversial right but uh

1858
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,280
of course you get we we know from

1859
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:32,720
phenomena you know you you sort of can't

1860
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,720
help at some level get into the idea of

1861
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,880
consciousness right because

1862
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,400
conscious awareness

1863
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,680
of attention is that kind of interesting

1864
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:43,599
thing so when it goes to what am i

1865
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:45,440
paying attention to and what am i

1866
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:46,960
conscious of and then you get into

1867
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,960
phenomenological phenomenological

1868
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,680
consciousness or access consciousness

1869
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,520
coming into play

1870
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:56,400
um and it gets a bit fuzzier

1871
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,400
so um but i think

1872
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,960
at some level you you you you're gonna

1873
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,119
start to hit those

1874
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:04,240
um

1875
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,000
in between those two you're sort of

1876
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,160
hitting that kind of fuzziness of

1877
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:09,839
where that sort of goes and then the

1878
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:12,079
next level up again

1879
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:13,440
um

1880
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,039
probably is

1881
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:17,280
more maybe it's actually more clear from

1882
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,160
the next level up when you go from

1883
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,720
uh attention to meta awareness of

1884
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:25,760
attention but i think the the bit this

1885
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,039
might be a

1886
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:29,119
whole shift in ontology even could be

1887
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:31,119
that shift from

1888
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:32,160
how you're

1889
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:34,000
perceiving or

1890
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,680
and how that translates into an

1891
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,680
attentional state

1892
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:40,160
yep so in to kind of bring it to

1893
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,720
multi-level or multi-level and

1894
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,799
multi-sensory integration

1895
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:47,680
the perception can be of two different

1896
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:50,400
kinds like what gets passed to the agent

1897
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,640
at each time point might be a visual

1898
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:53,680
measurement

1899
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:56,400
and a temperature or proprioception and

1900
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,280
then

1901
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,720
the policy

1902
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,880
what am i paying attention to

1903
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:03,039
could be reflected by paying attention

1904
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:05,839
to for example visual input as opposed

1905
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:08,319
to some other type of input

1906
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:11,680
and then one could be aware or not

1907
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,039
of whether they're paying attention to

1908
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:15,119
the smell or to the sound or to the

1909
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:16,399
light

1910
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:17,279
so

1911
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:19,359
how these models get integrated with

1912
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:21,279
then

1913
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:24,479
non-first personal measurements that's

1914
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:26,158
kind of what we explored in this future

1915
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:28,880
phenomenology slide with like okay where

1916
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,120
do we bring in

1917
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,560
empirical

1918
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,560
measurements

1919
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:36,719
and we kind of align them on the same

1920
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:39,920
time series and we can bring in

1921
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,920
any kind of measurements we don't even

1922
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,040
need to

1923
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,278
um

1924
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:47,920
limit ourself anything that's measured

1925
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,399
through time of any uncertainty over

1926
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:52,719
that measurement we can kind of cobble

1927
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:55,439
it together into this model

1928
01:08:55,439 --> 01:08:57,040
what are we doing it for

1929
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,359
what do we want to know with those

1930
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:01,359
measurements

1931
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:03,198
probably a lot of things that we could

1932
01:09:03,198 --> 01:09:05,279
address there

1933
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:06,799
maybe for the

1934
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:09,600
45 minutes let's at least go to 12

1935
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:10,880
figure 12

1936
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:11,920
yeah and

1937
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,080
talk a little bit about

1938
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,960
just annotating or exploring

1939
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,238
this

1940
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:19,198
figure

1941
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:20,880
so in five

1942
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:23,439
again main contribution of the paper one

1943
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:24,479
of them

1944
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:27,198
was the explicit three-level model with

1945
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:28,799
um

1946
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:30,238
what is being perceived what is

1947
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:32,158
attention being paid to and how aware is

1948
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:33,600
one of that

1949
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,880
here we're dropping back to two layers

1950
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,520
with the understanding that we could add

1951
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,359
another level like a green layer on top

1952
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:43,439
of the orange one that then connects

1953
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:46,080
back down to the orange one

1954
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,080
but look at some of these new parameters

1955
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,600
that are introduced

1956
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,198
in this paper

1957
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:54,800
um namely all of these gamma subscripts

1958
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:58,880
so gamma are the uncertainty variables

1959
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:01,760
now there's a gamma with a subscript

1960
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,520
modulating

1961
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:05,280
a lot of the

1962
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,880
other parameters

1963
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,040
that previously have been presented just

1964
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,360
as kind of standing alone so like for

1965
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:12,320
example

1966
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,480
in um

1967
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,960
figure five you

1968
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,199
just have like preferences in the second

1969
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:21,199
level the preferences just exist and the

1970
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:23,679
affordances e they just exist

1971
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:26,000
now in 12 we're thinking about what does

1972
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,239
it look like to have an uncertainty or a

1973
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:29,280
precision

1974
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:30,800
being the

1975
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,400
inverses of each other

1976
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,320
over

1977
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,679
d

1978
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:37,120
the prior

1979
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:38,080
c

1980
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,600
the preferences

1981
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:40,480
g

1982
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,480
the free energy minimization

1983
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:43,280
e

1984
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,679
the affordances

1985
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:47,679
pi is the policy

1986
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:50,480
and then we have an uncertainty over b

1987
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,880
which is the matrix that defines the

1988
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:55,679
transition between hidden states

1989
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:57,520
so like given that i'm inferring it to

1990
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,440
be raining outside what is the

1991
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,679
transition probabilities of it staying

1992
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:03,760
rainy versus becoming

1993
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:04,960
not raining

1994
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,199
and then we also have a which is the

1995
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:10,560
matrix mapping between hidden states and

1996
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:13,120
observed states what's the relationship

1997
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,199
between the observation of photons and

1998
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:18,159
whether it's sunny or not is it a simple

1999
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:20,080
matrix just a clean mapping you can just

2000
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:24,239
sort of simply have a hundred percent um

2001
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:26,960
of the time map it or

2002
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,320
is it the case that you're very

2003
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,560
uncertain about how hidden states are

2004
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:33,600
connected to observable outcomes

2005
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,600
so those are just just to sort of recap

2006
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:38,480
what these parameters in a model mean

2007
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:42,560
but maybe if anybody wants to like

2008
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,320
highlight one of these

2009
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,719
precision variables

2010
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:49,760
just what's one that they're drawn to or

2011
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,600
they're curious about or

2012
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,440
what's one that might have applications

2013
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:56,320
in different systems

2014
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:00,480
daniel i i would speak to it but i

2015
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:03,120
in order for me to sort of explain it in

2016
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:04,400
a way that i think would make sense

2017
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:05,520
might mean i

2018
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,040
would have to speak for a while and

2019
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:08,800
hijack this would people be comfortable

2020
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:11,440
with me talking for a couple of minutes

2021
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:12,800
please

2022
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:15,120
okay

2023
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,560
so

2024
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,159
i kind of look at this from the

2025
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:20,320
perspective of when in doubt zoom zoom

2026
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:22,560
in zoom out in order to compute

2027
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,280
something and this is a computational

2028
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,120
paper um

2029
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,880
i kind of take a whole cloth or a whole

2030
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,800
markup blanket approach

2031
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,600
of precise or precision as the paper

2032
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,440
kind of does a good job of laying out as

2033
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,360
precise

2034
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,840
ie figure 12.

2035
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,600
so on the topic of meta awareness

2036
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,440
meaning and collective decision making

2037
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:44,960
between the greatest and the smallest

2038
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,560
distances that we can be aware of we

2039
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,040
have information geography

2040
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,560
if you're searching for meaning and edge

2041
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,400
precision things like contrast and

2042
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,840
proportion

2043
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:56,640
as a fitting process i often think of

2044
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,640
like the 16th century maps of north

2045
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,640
america when the explorers

2046
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:03,280
first hit the coastlines

2047
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,199
and then there's information geometry

2048
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:06,719
when you're putting a dimensional space

2049
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:09,120
together so that's fixing the topology

2050
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,679
as a precise representation

2051
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:15,040
of difference over distances

2052
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:18,800
i've already shared in the 21 or 28 one

2053
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,560
thought i've got this generative model i

2054
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,480
call it the unholy triad which is in

2055
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,600
essence a computational phenomenon

2056
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,480
phenomenology

2057
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,400
context generator

2058
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,239
that translates uh prediction error

2059
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:33,679
reduction meaning we try to give people

2060
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:36,719
a sense of prediction manage management

2061
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:39,120
expertise

2062
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,040
i want them to be able to turn that that

2063
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:44,080
ability to predict into a contribution

2064
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:45,440
for me it was trying to create a

2065
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,120
professional contribution for high

2066
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:48,880
school kids

2067
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:50,800
so what does that mean it means getting

2068
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:53,199
to the geo the geometric and the

2069
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:56,000
geographic essences of a situation

2070
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,679
that you've never been in before so it's

2071
01:13:57,679 --> 01:14:00,560
a pretty big markov blanket inactively

2072
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:02,080
it means generalized and transfer

2073
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:05,199
regardless of that degree of novelty

2074
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:06,480
it means understanding learner

2075
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:09,280
availability to phenomena as much as

2076
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:11,199
collecting data on learner attention

2077
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:12,640
which is what this paper is kind of

2078
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:15,040
focused in on it's not about studying

2079
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,400
the swallow and regurgitating

2080
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:17,679
information

2081
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:19,679
as a content cycle

2082
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:21,440
which is a standardized form of learning

2083
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:23,679
measure which is also an irony because i

2084
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:26,000
had to take these models here and give

2085
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,400
them just 16 to 18 year olds by using

2086
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,560
things like when in doubt zoom in zoom

2087
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,719
out because they i could present them

2088
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:34,719
with this but this would be

2089
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:36,000
sanskrit to them they wouldn't

2090
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:36,970
understand it at all

2091
01:14:36,970 --> 01:14:38,080
[Music]

2092
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:41,120
so then what is a precise proposition

2093
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:43,199
as create a professional contribution in

2094
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:46,480
that to be materialized or propositional

2095
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,560
sense and in the paper

2096
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,640
i think i talked about this in 281 there

2097
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,320
was a passage in the paper that talked

2098
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,280
about

2099
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,280
and i'll just read it out it says in

2100
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,440
computational terms the central place of

2101
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:58,800
confidence

2102
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,560
and reliability and effective

2103
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,640
self-regulation speaks

2104
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,880
to the key role of precision

2105
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,560
and then they say that's the inverse

2106
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,800
variance of implicit beliefs

2107
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,640
and then they talk about

2108
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,440
as an example probabilistic or

2109
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,560
posterior-basing beliefs

2110
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,800
that describe a probability distribution

2111
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,719
over some latent quantity

2112
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:20,000
and i talked

2113
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,600
last week about

2114
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,679
going across the street

2115
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:26,800
so there's a calculable risk in that

2116
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,480
and then back to the paper it says these

2117
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:30,239
beliefs are subpersonal meaning that

2118
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:32,640
they're unplanned however the argument

2119
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,080
pursued in this work is that basic

2120
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:36,560
beliefs about beijing beliefs can

2121
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,960
in certain situations

2122
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:41,040
become propositional and and the way

2123
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:42,320
that those things are estimated

2124
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,560
optimized or controlled that's referring

2125
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,880
to hesps casper's work

2126
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,800
precisions in a nutshell quantify our

2127
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,880
confidence and our beliefs say how

2128
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,320
confident we are about what we know

2129
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,840
about states

2130
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,600
of the world about their relation to our

2131
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,440
sensory observations or about how these

2132
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:59,280
states change over time by analogy of a

2133
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,600
physical action a mental or covert

2134
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:02,960
action consists in deploying and

2135
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,880
adjusting these quantities

2136
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,400
without there necessarily being an

2137
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,320
explicit behavioral counterpart to these

2138
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:10,320
covert actions

2139
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:11,840
so for me

2140
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:14,080
if we're computing a transformation of

2141
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:16,080
unplannable to metacognitive from

2142
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:17,360
perception of

2143
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,280
i'm aware of planning to make a plan

2144
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:21,520
because i can think about my thinking so

2145
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:24,719
what of this policy of attention

2146
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:26,960
then what i attend to tells me what when

2147
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,480
i'm losing focus

2148
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,960
that's what the paper said and i agree

2149
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:31,760
check

2150
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:35,520
that's one way of measuring that and

2151
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,520
in the crosswalk case study you have two

2152
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:39,600
propositions both are precise in terms

2153
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:40,960
of their

2154
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:44,000
their dissem disambiguated paths

2155
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,920
and both are examples of a nesting study

2156
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,080
in this case crossing a nest or a

2157
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:49,520
roadway

2158
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:51,199
and then what happens regardless of the

2159
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:53,120
awareness level inside or outside of the

2160
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:55,360
physical and the hypothetical lines this

2161
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,120
is what i would be asking people that

2162
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,360
were going to go into these novel

2163
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:02,880
situations if we don't select right away

2164
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,440
if we keep things open

2165
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:07,440
if we keep probability distributed

2166
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:09,840
across a propositional horizon of

2167
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,560
potential street crossings is precision

2168
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,199
lost as an openness

2169
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:16,960
as a district as a distribution

2170
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:19,040
collection versus a focal point

2171
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:21,520
attenuation which is i think what this

2172
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,440
paper was examining

2173
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,040
perhaps a way of probing this might be

2174
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,800
to say that the concept of scale is

2175
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,320
fluid

2176
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,320
that it's the potential for scale change

2177
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:32,480
that scale itself overtakes or retreats

2178
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,640
from as a directional inflation

2179
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,320
or deflation

2180
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:37,840
and sometimes we talk about that as a

2181
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:40,960
directional gradient to center descent

2182
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,960
in this sense scale either obliterates

2183
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,199
or gap increases which scott talked

2184
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:47,679
about having an epoxy

2185
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:49,440
and i agree with that

2186
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,120
that what we consider to be inside or

2187
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:52,960
outside the lines is not static due to

2188
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,040
our relationship our betweenness to the

2189
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,199
focal point of interest

2190
01:17:57,199 --> 01:17:58,480
this is somewhat

2191
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,000
this is a somewhat conventional

2192
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,480
explanation of scalable behavior but i

2193
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:04,719
think there's a second part to this we

2194
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:06,159
have to

2195
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:08,480
keep with that first and that second

2196
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,000
sense

2197
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,880
which together with the first part

2198
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:15,440
generates another type of between

2199
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,080
which is a matter of the geography in as

2200
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:19,840
in edge precision

2201
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:22,640
and geometry out as in of difference

2202
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,000
over

2203
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,040
at once at this exact same time

2204
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:30,000
that supports the very notion of and has

2205
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,520
scale scaling down or scaling up

2206
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:35,199
so that's that up and down part we were

2207
01:18:35,199 --> 01:18:37,120
talking about earlier today in my

2208
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,640
experience is very much the addition of

2209
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,400
this second sense

2210
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:43,120
as a parallel probing that works there's

2211
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:44,800
no violations

2212
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,960
of the bringing in the statistical and

2213
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,960
the physical mechanics together

2214
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,360
that active inference parameterizes as

2215
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:54,560
an hov or high occupancy vehicle

2216
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,800
lane as a metaphor more

2217
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,480
than intersectional

2218
01:18:58,480 --> 01:18:59,840
intersectional is pretty much

2219
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,360
interventionist

2220
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,120
and it's kind of an instructionalist

2221
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,280
only reinforcing

2222
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:06,960
view or perspective

2223
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:10,080
in the in the hov lane metaphor

2224
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:11,440
you are in

2225
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:13,920
as self-organizing

2226
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,000
your non-interventionist because you're

2227
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,239
a constructor you're an interactor of

2228
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:20,400
line live stream lines

2229
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:23,920
and i use the example of a 28 0 or a 28

2230
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:25,360
one in the way that we set the live

2231
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:26,560
streams up

2232
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:28,800
if you're outside the hov lines you may

2233
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,560
be you're re-watching

2234
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:32,400
something that you were a participant in

2235
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,280
or

2236
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,840
perhaps you're using the 0.2 part of

2237
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:36,719
this

2238
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:39,679
as a way of sort of detaching yourself

2239
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:42,560
and being able to appreciate scale

2240
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,800
so math is not the territory but the

2241
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,120
math is both the diamond shape on and

2242
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,239
above

2243
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:51,920
the parameterized state space that road

2244
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,000
that we now say is high occupancy

2245
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,199
vehicle it shows the signals

2246
01:19:57,199 --> 01:19:58,640
meaning the geometrics and the

2247
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,960
restricted fit the geographics

2248
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:03,040
that is two plus in the car mathematical

2249
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:05,040
quantity enables

2250
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,600
again you have opaque passengers

2251
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,600
and transparent traffic congestion

2252
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,199
reduction check

2253
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:13,840
that's what this paper talked about

2254
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,440
but i think we also have to consider

2255
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:17,440
that the contrast meaning that the text

2256
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:19,360
in the background are different colors

2257
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,280
and the proportion meaning the depth of

2258
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,760
field is adjustable

2259
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,840
is necessary to dial in the resolution

2260
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,159
and the resonation daniel you spoke

2261
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:30,639
about resolution and resonation mostly

2262
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:32,719
about the resolution and the point one

2263
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:34,480
and so i wanted to really come back to

2264
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,400
that a bit

2265
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,960
this is collected phenomena this is not

2266
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:41,920
i am attending or i realize that i'm not

2267
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,159
attending but i think it's a big part of

2268
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:46,960
this attenuation versus collective

2269
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:49,360
thought piece that we're trying to

2270
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:52,480
get some sense of order and relationship

2271
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,760
around

2272
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,320
if we want context generation the in

2273
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:59,760
plus the out equaling context to play a

2274
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,840
former role formal role

2275
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:04,000
in what we decide or define sorry as

2276
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
precision it's something to think about

2277
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,639
when looking at logic as a formalism

2278
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:11,360
the accessing of data collection sets

2279
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,360
which we've talked about again quite a

2280
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:14,880
bit today

2281
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:16,880
uh talks about the definition of a

2282
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:19,040
precise bigger picture as a distributed

2283
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,159
collection

2284
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:22,320
and then like i said in my work that was

2285
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:23,600
coming up with a professional

2286
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,120
contribution

2287
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,679
it also speaks to where there are

2288
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:30,639
relationships

2289
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:32,000
through lines

2290
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,239
like like a real physical line and those

2291
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:36,400
blankets that we keep talking about as a

2292
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:37,760
process

2293
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,440
and that also talks about what scott

2294
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,920
talked about in the la in the 21.1 is

2295
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,600
borrowing from the model has both a

2296
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,960
quantity and a quality determination

2297
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:49,920
i think it at the end of the day it says

2298
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:52,320
instead of just looking at how and why

2299
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,639
we have to look at the when

2300
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:56,560
we're inside and outside the lines the

2301
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:57,440
who

2302
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:00,320
our relationship to all of the uh

2303
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,400
traffic that can be crossing the road

2304
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:03,760
and the which

2305
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:04,639
which

2306
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:06,320
do we look at do we look at the figure

2307
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,960
12 or do we zoom out and add a third

2308
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,880
layer i don't think it really matters as

2309
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:14,239
long as we're prepared to look at both

2310
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:16,800
so that is that is in to me the essence

2311
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,800
of what a free energy principle as

2312
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,159
unplannable

2313
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:20,880
to

2314
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:23,520
cognitive metacognitive

2315
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:24,800
world

2316
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,960
looks like and i don't know that it's

2317
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:29,120
easy for people to sort of put all of

2318
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,719
that into a nutshell but like i said

2319
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:32,960
it's kind of a whole cloth

2320
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:35,199
whole markov blanket thing and as you

2321
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:37,760
mentioned daniel in the last

2322
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:40,080
in the last live stream it's it's we

2323
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,840
want the first principles to be able to

2324
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:43,840
generalize and scale up

2325
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,280
but i think the only way that that

2326
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:48,800
happens if we is if we don't see it

2327
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,960
as either always inflating or always

2328
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:53,840
deflating but we see both the geometry

2329
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,760
and the geography sort of working hand

2330
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,520
in glove with that i think that's how we

2331
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:00,560
derive a fit here

2332
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,080
nice dean

2333
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:04,480
thank you

2334
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,960
very interesting um

2335
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,040
i guess steven or blue or anyone else

2336
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,639
feel free to ask a question but just a

2337
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:12,960
few notes on that

2338
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:16,719
so one is it's a subtle design choice

2339
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:20,560
but notice that the green wraps around

2340
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,239
the whole box

2341
01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:23,840
and then the orange wraps around the

2342
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:24,719
blue

2343
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:27,280
so it's not just like three legos

2344
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:29,600
placed one on top of another it actually

2345
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,159
is a zooming in and out and so that

2346
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:35,120
moves us towards bucky fuller's dream of

2347
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:37,600
you know i went in stairs and outstairs

2348
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,360
rather than upstairs and downstairs

2349
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:40,480
because

2350
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:42,239
it's not up and down for everyone just

2351
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:44,480
say it's in and out because you're on a

2352
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:46,400
closed surface so

2353
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,880
that was about zooming in and out and

2354
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:50,880
it's not that we're even necessarily

2355
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:53,520
moving again we talk about top down and

2356
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,199
bottom up and that's vertically how it's

2357
01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:58,159
arranged here but perhaps

2358
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:02,480
um inward out and outward in will make a

2359
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:04,800
lot more sense when we start to think

2360
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:08,159
about what these models are really doing

2361
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:10,960
and um you brought up the idea of using

2362
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:13,360
the dot two and so that was interesting

2363
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:15,520
to think about resources and artifacts

2364
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,600
that might be considered epistemic i

2365
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,520
mean it's research we're talking about

2366
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:22,560
papers but how do we use

2367
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,880
resources rather than just learn from

2368
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:27,840
them so seeing them as action artifacts

2369
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:31,440
rather than just epistemic artifacts

2370
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,600
and then also just this idea that

2371
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:34,639
where

2372
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:36,400
will we have precision can we have

2373
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,400
precision in our policies

2374
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:40,639
how do we

2375
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:43,600
instruct a high schooler or younger

2376
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,280
their world that they're going to be

2377
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:46,960
having a career in and that's what it

2378
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,239
sounded like you were working towards

2379
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:50,239
was some sort of you know helping them

2380
01:24:50,239 --> 01:24:51,600
get on a trajectory where they could

2381
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,679
have support and everything

2382
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:55,600
it's going to be changing a lot

2383
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,040
so

2384
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,880
it's like i'm sorry i can't give you

2385
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:01,199
precision on

2386
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:03,520
whether crypto will be important in 15

2387
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,120
years or something like that it's like

2388
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:06,880
we could write a million papers on that

2389
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,719
and just not know the answer today

2390
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:10,960
what can we have precision on

2391
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:12,960
and then this really pushes the question

2392
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,560
um

2393
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:17,280
where can we exchange our uncertainty

2394
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,760
and where what what should we focus on

2395
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:21,920
so that we can have focus on if not our

2396
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,760
own policy like i'm gonna go on a walk

2397
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,639
every day but our own attention

2398
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:30,239
and that kind of covert mental action um

2399
01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:32,400
to bring it back to intentionality might

2400
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:33,280
be

2401
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:35,040
what we will always remain sovereign

2402
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,960
over is our attention

2403
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,960
stephen

2404
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:45,199
yeah i think

2405
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:48,000
the

2406
01:25:48,159 --> 01:25:50,639
the this this nestedness is important

2407
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:52,320
and i think of course time is part of

2408
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:53,840
that as well because these lower levels

2409
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:56,320
happen quicker

2410
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,239
and i wonder dean what your thoughts are

2411
01:25:58,239 --> 01:26:00,159
on this um

2412
01:26:00,159 --> 01:26:01,360
in terms of

2413
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:03,960
when we look at these different

2414
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:06,800
variables that can now come into play on

2415
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,800
figure 12.

2416
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,800
i mean they're kind of okay you're going

2417
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,400
to start to have

2418
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:15,440
variational potential to vary

2419
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:17,840
how you set because in theory that every

2420
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,560
one of these values is is there

2421
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:23,040
implicitly just can can't be varied

2422
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:25,760
right it's like there's there's there's

2423
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,600
some sort of precision somehow in the

2424
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,440
system but theoretically now okay you

2425
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:30,960
can

2426
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,960
access or change the precision on your

2427
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,560
prize and your generative model on your

2428
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:36,480
expected free energy

2429
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:38,480
as well as on your transition matrix

2430
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:40,639
that gets you the sensory states and of

2431
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:42,080
course then this question is okay now

2432
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:45,600
it's showing this in one

2433
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,120
level

2434
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:49,679
all these arrows come together somehow

2435
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:51,920
it's like that mystery well how does

2436
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:54,719
that happen right like is it a case that

2437
01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:55,840
they're all

2438
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:57,920
firing out with like okay well this is

2439
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:59,440
what it would be like if

2440
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:00,480
um

2441
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:01,360
you know

2442
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:03,840
my updating of states was to have a

2443
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,360
different precision this is what it

2444
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:06,880
would be like if my generative model was

2445
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,719
to have a different precision this is

2446
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:12,639
and is there almost like a a whole array

2447
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:14,320
like imagine going in and out of the

2448
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:17,760
screen here of temporal depths or

2449
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:18,639
even

2450
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:22,320
different sort of combinations of these

2451
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:23,520
uh

2452
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:26,000
you know precision estimates and maybe

2453
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,280
the top level has to basically choose

2454
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,960
and and maybe at some point the lower

2455
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:32,560
levels if they don't get chosen very

2456
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:35,440
often they die down you know i.e like

2457
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:36,159
the

2458
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:38,000
seven legged unicorns running across the

2459
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,560
street isn't selected very often so it's

2460
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,400
like left to one side

2461
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:45,199
um but maybe with creative people they

2462
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:46,960
tend to like keep all those things

2463
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:48,800
firing which may not be healthy if you

2464
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,320
go too far with that

2465
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:52,880
um so i'm because there is there is a

2466
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:54,960
question there isn't there is how

2467
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:57,199
as we start to bring in these other

2468
01:27:57,199 --> 01:28:00,320
ideas is okay so what what what's that

2469
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:03,520
what's that ability to to bring up

2470
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:06,480
a precision estimate on an a matrix

2471
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:09,199
for looking at observations into states

2472
01:28:09,199 --> 01:28:11,600
and to integrate these with these others

2473
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:12,719
you know and

2474
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:15,120
is that is that just

2475
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:16,880
you know integration you know are we

2476
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:19,679
just gonna start to have kinds of

2477
01:28:19,679 --> 01:28:21,920
things like you're saying if you if you

2478
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:24,960
have a particular change in in how much

2479
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:26,960
the priors are changed

2480
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,639
um

2481
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:31,600
and along with the model you know then

2482
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:33,199
what does that do

2483
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:35,280
yeah i actually have some some thoughts

2484
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,760
on that stephen it's interesting because

2485
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:40,080
i think all of these figures and every

2486
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:41,600
paper has their figures because they

2487
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,679
show their model i think that that model

2488
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:45,679
is kind of a reflection

2489
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:47,120
and i think the other thing that tends

2490
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:50,560
to happen is if you if you do reflect on

2491
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:53,440
so what what was i trying to perceive

2492
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:55,840
in terms of sort of a metacognitive

2493
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:57,760
here's now i'm now i'm thinking about a

2494
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:58,880
process

2495
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,719
i don't think we do that in isolation i

2496
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:02,480
think the environment kind of acts as a

2497
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,800
scrutinizer as well like you guys are

2498
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:07,280
scrutinizing what i'm saying right now

2499
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:08,639
and i'm hoping that i'm not saying

2500
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:10,800
something that's so completely obscure

2501
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:13,760
that it it sort of continues to build on

2502
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:16,000
what we're all sharing in terms of what

2503
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,920
we're taking away from this so i think

2504
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:19,520
there's an updating of updating and

2505
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:20,800
that's when

2506
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:22,080
when um

2507
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:24,400
lars was talking about that in the 28

2508
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:27,120
one i was kind of nodding because yeah

2509
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:28,239
that's

2510
01:29:28,239 --> 01:29:29,840
i think that's a that's a vital

2511
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:31,520
component it's not

2512
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,360
sort of written out explicitly in this

2513
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:35,360
model here but i think

2514
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:37,040
we should assume

2515
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:38,719
that when we're zooming in and zooming

2516
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:39,760
out

2517
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,920
we are reflecting

2518
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:43,360
so we're taking something and we're

2519
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:45,360
stretching that time frame

2520
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:46,719
and then the thing i think the second

2521
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:48,880
thing that we can't sort of leave out if

2522
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:52,000
we're context generalizing is that

2523
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,239
context that environment is acting as a

2524
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:56,960
scrutinizer it's giving us feedback all

2525
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:58,159
the time

2526
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:00,800
so that we don't get stuck

2527
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:03,120
in one place that time actually and

2528
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:05,120
change actually does

2529
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:06,560
becomes something that we're not just a

2530
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,159
we're aware of but we're actually

2531
01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:10,239
utilizing

2532
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:13,199
so that rate of change pieces i think

2533
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:15,199
we don't necessarily impose it i think

2534
01:30:15,199 --> 01:30:17,840
it gets imposed on us or maybe i'm wrong

2535
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:18,800
but

2536
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:21,120
yeah i haven't seen any evidence to the

2537
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:23,440
contrary yet

2538
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:25,280
um actually that's that's a good point

2539
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:27,280
if i just jumped in those is

2540
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:30,000
yeah i mean a lot of this stuff

2541
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,600
could i mean it actually starts to

2542
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,679
support the inactive approaches in a way

2543
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:34,800
i suppose

2544
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:37,520
you actually start to see now that

2545
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:39,520
you're back into the realm of well how

2546
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:40,480
could you

2547
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:42,159
start to blend all of that it almost

2548
01:30:42,159 --> 01:30:44,880
needs to be maybe hardwired into

2549
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:46,639
an active kind of

2550
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:50,320
dynamical biological

2551
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:51,920
thing

2552
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:55,360
the technical term um so

2553
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:57,280
because

2554
01:30:57,280 --> 01:31:00,080
it's not necessarily tractable

2555
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:02,480
purely however there may be parts of it

2556
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:05,440
which need to be more cognitively

2557
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:08,000
uh and can only happen at a sort of a

2558
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,560
more structured cognitive

2559
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:12,560
level you know so

2560
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,560
there's this question about what what

2561
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,480
can be inferred

2562
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:18,719
through acting in the world in different

2563
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:20,560
ways and like you say the

2564
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:23,120
you will find out when you bang into the

2565
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:25,600
wall or when you or you just find out as

2566
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:28,000
you drink a cup you know you feel that

2567
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,520
you're feeling

2568
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,199
you know hamilton's least action

2569
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:32,800
obviously becomes one of the options

2570
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:34,320
there is that would come in with a free

2571
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:35,440
energy okay

2572
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:38,080
what seems to be the

2573
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:40,800
type of configuration of precision

2574
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:42,960
estimates that kind of gives the overall

2575
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:44,960
least action

2576
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:46,320
um

2577
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:47,840
if that's if that information is

2578
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,040
available

2579
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:50,880
and so now you have a

2580
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:53,199
way to integrate those

2581
01:31:53,199 --> 01:31:56,480
um in one context which may provide the

2582
01:31:56,480 --> 01:32:00,719
general structure which is good enough

2583
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:02,800
to to to work with them in other

2584
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:05,360
contexts you know maybe that there's

2585
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:06,639
some sort of

2586
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:07,920
plausible

2587
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:10,080
so it sort of moves beyond neuro

2588
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:11,679
phenomenology

2589
01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:13,280
and moves a bit beyond the body and

2590
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:15,840
you're now in you are in the mind body

2591
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:18,159
environment dynamic you know

2592
01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:19,840
yeah i think the really interesting part

2593
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:20,639
is

2594
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:22,639
when in doubt implies

2595
01:32:22,639 --> 01:32:24,639
you're you're you're stuck

2596
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:27,280
you're not maybe taking action

2597
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:30,080
so zoom in zoom out like don't just do

2598
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,000
one or the other

2599
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,920
be prepared

2600
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:36,639
uh and actively but also from an active

2601
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:38,840
inference perspective to

2602
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:43,360
infer the geometry and the geography

2603
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:46,639
that and i mean make that explicit

2604
01:32:46,639 --> 01:32:48,159
make that make that a part of your

2605
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:52,320
strategy your tactics it's actually

2606
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,239
it's more inhibited than most people

2607
01:32:54,239 --> 01:32:55,520
think

2608
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:58,080
but in terms of in terms of what you're

2609
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:00,320
going to do is you're not going to get

2610
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:02,159
stuck on

2611
01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:03,679
level one

2612
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:06,239
or level three you're going to actually

2613
01:33:06,239 --> 01:33:09,280
be able to go across levels that's why

2614
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:11,199
there's an envelopment in a lot of these

2615
01:33:11,199 --> 01:33:13,520
representations you're already in the

2616
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:15,520
nest you're already deciding whether or

2617
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:17,440
not you're going to cross the street now

2618
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:19,199
what you're asking is is it more

2619
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:21,520
beneficial from a thinking perspective

2620
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:23,920
to that insider outside the lines i'm

2621
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:25,840
not i'm not passing judgment on which is

2622
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,840
better but what i am saying is don't

2623
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:30,880
restrict yourself to one or the other

2624
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:33,840
zoom in zoom out

2625
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:38,000
the opacity of the second layer

2626
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,400
only arises because there is a higher

2627
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:41,520
and a lower

2628
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:42,639
level

2629
01:33:42,639 --> 01:33:43,679
right

2630
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:46,639
so it it's sort of like

2631
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:48,880
maybe the series kind of blurs off and

2632
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:51,920
so we have one type of awareness at our

2633
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:54,000
experienced tear

2634
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,880
and then it rests upon the shoulders

2635
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:59,360
of the first and the third level the

2636
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:00,880
green and the blue here

2637
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:03,120
and then maybe those spiral off in

2638
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:04,880
reality or maybe they don't

2639
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:07,280
we're modeling it this way

2640
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:08,960
and then it's the feedback with reality

2641
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:11,440
that we'll update our models based upon

2642
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:13,919
stephen

2643
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:16,159
yeah

2644
01:34:16,159 --> 01:34:17,520
and

2645
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:19,440
this this because we've got levels at

2646
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:21,520
play and i know you you mentioned there

2647
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:23,520
about zoom in zoom out i mean zoom's

2648
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:26,239
quite an ocular kind of

2649
01:34:26,239 --> 01:34:29,280
so i suppose we've got

2650
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:31,920
there's a there's a kind of a question

2651
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:34,159
in terms of how we language some of this

2652
01:34:34,159 --> 01:34:35,199
because

2653
01:34:35,199 --> 01:34:37,840
we we want to look at different temporal

2654
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:38,960
we've got different levels of

2655
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:41,679
abstraction as we see when we then look

2656
01:34:41,679 --> 01:34:43,920
at things as they map across to our

2657
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:46,960
other knowledge epistemic systems we've

2658
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:48,320
got different we know that the

2659
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:49,760
hierarchies

2660
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:52,000
have different speeds i mean in a way

2661
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,199
they don't

2662
01:34:53,199 --> 01:34:55,119
nature in theory doesn't care about the

2663
01:34:55,119 --> 01:34:57,040
levels in sense but it might care about

2664
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:57,840
the

2665
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:00,639
the the speed at which the processing

2666
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:02,159
happens and if it has to go quicker at

2667
01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:05,199
the lower levels it has no choice around

2668
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:06,080
that

2669
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:08,239
and that but then we've also got this

2670
01:35:08,239 --> 01:35:10,560
question of zooming out scale-ups you

2671
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:12,320
know scale

2672
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:15,600
scale happening some of which is is is

2673
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:17,600
you can't avoid and we've got cells

2674
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:20,800
inside our body a set of scale that's

2675
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,400
and then we've got organs and then we've

2676
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:23,520
got

2677
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:25,840
i'm wondering

2678
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:27,199
yeah what

2679
01:35:27,199 --> 01:35:30,320
when we say sky zoom in

2680
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:34,080
um is that an intentional

2681
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:36,960
no okay i'll pause it no again no i just

2682
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:38,480
that's a great question because as i

2683
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:40,480
said i don't have any pushback on

2684
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:42,159
anything the authors wrote in this paper

2685
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:44,000
i think it's a great paper

2686
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,199
and i'm i'm i'm suggesting we hold up

2687
01:35:47,199 --> 01:35:48,320
attention

2688
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:50,239
and availability because that's what

2689
01:35:50,239 --> 01:35:52,480
zoom in zoom out is it's leaving

2690
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:56,639
yourself available to what could be

2691
01:35:56,639 --> 01:35:58,719
considered

2692
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:01,199
in included in a definition of what

2693
01:36:01,199 --> 01:36:02,960
attention is

2694
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:04,639
i'm just i'm saying

2695
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:06,480
include both

2696
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:08,320
that's what the zoom in zoom out does it

2697
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:10,800
says what am i what am i available to

2698
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:13,280
am i avail am i making self available to

2699
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:16,080
outside the lines metaphorically

2700
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:17,199
physically

2701
01:36:17,199 --> 01:36:19,840
as well as inside the lines is that part

2702
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:24,159
of my reasoning in terms of of not

2703
01:36:24,159 --> 01:36:26,320
necessarily be being afraid of bumping

2704
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:28,239
into things

2705
01:36:28,239 --> 01:36:29,840
that's a good point i mean one other

2706
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:31,360
thing that i think is interesting when i

2707
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:32,400
think from

2708
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:34,320
science to

2709
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:36,080
visual art with art

2710
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:37,600
is in science you tend to think of

2711
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:39,679
zooming in and out say with a microscope

2712
01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:41,280
right because you can go in and you see

2713
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:42,159
more

2714
01:36:42,159 --> 01:36:45,760
now in art you tend to crop

2715
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:48,080
so you have the same roughly the same

2716
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:49,600
image maybe you go a little bit more

2717
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:52,560
detail but you're just cropping in

2718
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:54,000
now cropping

2719
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,320
in terms of how we trying to think

2720
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:58,239
informationally is quite different right

2721
01:36:58,239 --> 01:37:00,080
because it's what you're taking away to

2722
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:01,440
leave focus

2723
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,440
we're zooming in because we get more

2724
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:05,679
detail on something small

2725
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:07,520
we maybe don't focus on all the things

2726
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:10,320
that and well you could zoom in and you

2727
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:11,360
you just

2728
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:13,520
expand the you know

2729
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:15,840
the frame gets bigger right

2730
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:17,840
normally if it kind of that's the

2731
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,520
question are you zooming in

2732
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:21,679
on an object that's like a penny and it

2733
01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:24,000
gets to a certain size until it fills

2734
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,639
your frame of awareness because once you

2735
01:37:26,639 --> 01:37:29,119
go beyond that you can't help but crop

2736
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:31,280
because you can't fit everything in and

2737
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:32,560
you then

2738
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:35,040
gain more detail on something that you

2739
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:35,920
can't

2740
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:37,760
take in other detail

2741
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:40,320
so there's there's um i mean even that's

2742
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:42,000
a scale-dependent thing right it's

2743
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,800
dependent on the organism right so

2744
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:48,719
for a mouse to zoom in and zoom out um

2745
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:51,840
well also can to some extent without

2746
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:54,800
using a tool or an instrument can we

2747
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:56,719
zoom

2748
01:37:56,719 --> 01:37:58,000
like

2749
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,520
it's interesting because we

2750
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:00,239
if

2751
01:38:00,239 --> 01:38:03,600
can i zoom with my eyes

2752
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,520
in a way i can

2753
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:09,040
focus and i can go and i can

2754
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:10,239
take my

2755
01:38:10,239 --> 01:38:12,880
most accurate i suppose in some ways i

2756
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:15,280
can zoom by having the area of my eye

2757
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:16,880
that has the most

2758
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:18,000
um

2759
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,719
cells being given attention to a

2760
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:22,800
particular part of the

2761
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:25,760
i i can take my attentional

2762
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:27,119
um

2763
01:38:27,119 --> 01:38:29,679
fidelity to bear

2764
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:31,679
but some of the things also like i say

2765
01:38:31,679 --> 01:38:34,639
we we we kind of imagine ourselves as if

2766
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:36,400
we've got a binoculars or some other

2767
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:39,760
tool in our hands right and we um

2768
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:42,080
because we sort of it's such an embodied

2769
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:44,000
thing to do

2770
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,719
but actually that's not necessarily

2771
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:48,400
that's not necessarily what we could do

2772
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:50,719
without that tool if that makes sense so

2773
01:38:50,719 --> 01:38:52,719
there's a there's a there's a question

2774
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:54,320
there around

2775
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:56,639
um

2776
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:57,920
yeah

2777
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,040
where

2778
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:03,280
where do and maybe we were able to use

2779
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:04,800
maybe that's the thing that's kind of

2780
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:07,679
unique about humans is that ability to

2781
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:09,679
pick up a microscope and look through it

2782
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:10,639
and

2783
01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:14,239
extend through the tool usage you know

2784
01:39:14,239 --> 01:39:15,199
and

2785
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:17,040
that's not necessarily available to

2786
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:19,760
other animals

2787
01:39:20,239 --> 01:39:22,639
i think i think that

2788
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:24,880
the paper speaks to

2789
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:27,920
uh i can i can attend or not attend and

2790
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:29,679
i'll know that i'm attending when i'm

2791
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:31,360
not attending

2792
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:32,880
so that's

2793
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:35,520
that's that's the sort of inflationary

2794
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:37,520
deflationary

2795
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:40,000
part of it and i'm not saying drop that

2796
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,679
i think that that's important but i

2797
01:39:41,679 --> 01:39:44,880
think if it's only held up as as that

2798
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:46,960
you're missing the other two vertices of

2799
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:49,840
the triad the other two vertices being

2800
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:52,639
can i also on the on the open end of the

2801
01:39:52,639 --> 01:39:55,440
triangle relative to that first part

2802
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:56,880
which is the

2803
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:59,840
mir am i not attending am i inflating or

2804
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:02,080
deflating am i going up or down

2805
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:04,159
is the geometry and the geography and i

2806
01:40:04,159 --> 01:40:05,920
think if you put all i know this sounds

2807
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:08,639
very abstract but after after you put it

2808
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:10,000
into practice

2809
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,119
after you

2810
01:40:11,119 --> 01:40:13,119
have your checklist that your or your

2811
01:40:13,119 --> 01:40:15,520
model that you carry in with saying have

2812
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:18,080
i have i addressed all three sides of

2813
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:19,520
this

2814
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:21,440
you tend to generate a context much

2815
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:23,520
sooner your mark off blanket

2816
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:26,239
becomes more transparent more tunneling

2817
01:40:26,239 --> 01:40:29,199
effect into these novel situations

2818
01:40:29,199 --> 01:40:30,159
then

2819
01:40:30,159 --> 01:40:32,239
i'm waiting around for somebody to point

2820
01:40:32,239 --> 01:40:33,040
to

2821
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:35,840
what i need to attend to next which is

2822
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:37,760
more the of the instructionalist model

2823
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:39,199
again

2824
01:40:39,199 --> 01:40:40,159
right

2825
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:43,440
so i mean if you want to give a person

2826
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:45,280
the ability to

2827
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:47,119
make sense sooner

2828
01:40:47,119 --> 01:40:49,520
all i'm suggesting is is that have three

2829
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:51,440
vertices

2830
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:54,000
right have three corners to this

2831
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,480
to dimensionalize the space and and

2832
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:59,440
again if you put it into practice

2833
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:02,480
it's it's it's pretty easy to transfer

2834
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:04,560
from the abstract into actual

2835
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:06,719
physical things that you do

2836
01:41:06,719 --> 01:41:09,280
i mean you you can you can decide what

2837
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:11,280
the focal point is and what the horizon

2838
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:13,679
is you can decide what the difference is

2839
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:15,520
and you can decide what the

2840
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:17,280
what the proportions and the contrast

2841
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:20,400
are and if somebody says to you

2842
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,719
i'm not getting this you can also

2843
01:41:22,719 --> 01:41:25,600
explain to them what you're not seeing

2844
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:27,040
which is really really helpful to the

2845
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:28,960
person who's trying to be the be the

2846
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:32,320
guide of the wayfinder

2847
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:33,600
thanks dean

2848
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:35,920
blue

2849
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,159
yeah i wanted to kind of talk about

2850
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:40,960
zooming in and zooming out and um using

2851
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:43,600
a microscope or not and so something

2852
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:45,600
like that i have found in the course of

2853
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,960
my life is

2854
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:49,840
the capacity for mental zooming in and

2855
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:53,280
zooming out um especially with regard to

2856
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:57,199
um consideration for others so like i

2857
01:41:57,199 --> 01:41:59,440
started life as a kid like everything

2858
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:01,280
was provided for me and then like as a

2859
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:02,639
teenager i was like the most

2860
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:05,679
self-absorbed creature alive right and

2861
01:42:05,679 --> 01:42:08,320
so like as i've gotten older like my so

2862
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:10,480
i was so focused on just me right just

2863
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:12,560
me me me me i'm the center of my world

2864
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:14,560
but then like you know you really start

2865
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:17,119
to expand that um

2866
01:42:17,119 --> 01:42:18,400
you know to consider more and more

2867
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:20,719
people and the planet and like all of

2868
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:22,960
the consequences of your actions as i

2869
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:24,719
you know developed and you know probably

2870
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:27,520
really set in at like 25 right with full

2871
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:28,800
frontal lobe development and the

2872
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:31,040
understanding of consequences and you

2873
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:32,320
know this kind of ripple effects the

2874
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:34,480
butterfly effect of our of our actions

2875
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:36,800
and so forth but also in meditation to

2876
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,560
kind of bring it back in and tie back to

2877
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:39,600
the paper

2878
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:41,440
um you know you hold you do this

2879
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:43,600
meditation i mean i've done meditations

2880
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:45,600
where you're you know doing for example

2881
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:48,159
loving kindness and you know you focus

2882
01:42:48,159 --> 01:42:49,760
on loving kindness and it's kindness for

2883
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:51,280
yourself and your inner circle and then

2884
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:52,960
you expand it to include you know the

2885
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:54,560
people in the room and your extended

2886
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:55,920
family and you know everyone that's

2887
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:58,080
suffering the same ailments as you and

2888
01:42:58,080 --> 01:42:59,920
so forth so you kind of expand your

2889
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:02,480
awareness this mental zooming out

2890
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:05,199
um through through meditation and um yes

2891
01:43:05,199 --> 01:43:07,360
so i just wanted to kind of say like we

2892
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:09,040
don't always need a microscope but but

2893
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:10,400
it is mental

2894
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:13,040
and it may also be something that's

2895
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:15,840
uniquely human

2896
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:18,400
can i can i just respond to that blue i

2897
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:20,080
think you're absolutely right and the

2898
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:23,199
funny thing is is that

2899
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:25,600
again when he when you take it off the

2900
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:26,639
page

2901
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:28,719
it's what you're describing what i'm

2902
01:43:28,719 --> 01:43:30,480
describing although i'm probably doing a

2903
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:32,719
terrible job of it is identity and

2904
01:43:32,719 --> 01:43:34,639
feelings

2905
01:43:34,639 --> 01:43:37,199
when you actually use this this

2906
01:43:37,199 --> 01:43:38,719
its approach of being able to hold up

2907
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:41,040
three things at once it's your identity

2908
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:43,280
and your feelings that you're really

2909
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:46,800
becoming metacognitive of

2910
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:52,400
or so is it metacognitive or or is it

2911
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:53,600
dissolving

2912
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:56,080
the identity right and so that's like

2913
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:58,320
the question of mike levin you know

2914
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:00,560
expanding the cognitive boundary of the

2915
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:01,440
self

2916
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:02,320
so

2917
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:04,080
in his paper i'm not sure if you read

2918
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:05,440
the computational boundary of the self

2919
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:07,199
or not um but but you know he talked

2920
01:44:07,199 --> 01:44:09,440
about this the computational boundary

2921
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:12,000
and and you know not just of a person

2922
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,800
but also like a cell and an organ and a

2923
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:18,159
tissue and and so but also a human and

2924
01:44:18,159 --> 01:44:20,080
and when you've dissolved this

2925
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:22,239
computational boundary of the self

2926
01:44:22,239 --> 01:44:24,000
you've expanded it you've dissolved i

2927
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,920
mean this is eventually the end goal of

2928
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:27,679
meditation is this dissolution of

2929
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:30,560
identity this ceasing of grasping to the

2930
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:32,719
self i mean in many traditions right

2931
01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:34,639
this is the letting go of self-grasping

2932
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:36,800
and letting go of the idea of the self

2933
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:38,800
and so you have this very

2934
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:40,159
expansive

2935
01:44:40,159 --> 01:44:41,840
consideration of the self and so it's

2936
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:44,239
encompassing all um

2937
01:44:44,239 --> 01:44:46,960
beings in that in that boundary yeah and

2938
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:48,480
and that's interesting because that's

2939
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:51,840
exactly what we used to talk about is

2940
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:53,440
what does it mean to go from being a

2941
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:54,719
student to being a professional

2942
01:44:54,719 --> 01:44:56,880
contributor well all i know is it's not

2943
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:58,960
an extension of being a student

2944
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:01,040
i have no idea what it means in your

2945
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:03,360
particular situation right so it is a

2946
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:04,560
dissolving

2947
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:06,719
if if nothing else it's a forming and a

2948
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:08,639
dissolving at the same time that's why i

2949
01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:10,320
said

2950
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:12,639
you still you still have me because i

2951
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:14,320
it was your influence that got me

2952
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:15,760
watching soul

2953
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:17,119
and that's exactly what they were

2954
01:45:17,119 --> 01:45:21,119
talking about and so again it's not a

2955
01:45:21,119 --> 01:45:25,199
it it is it is effemorable ephemeral and

2956
01:45:25,199 --> 01:45:28,400
we can reflect on it and we can have the

2957
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:30,639
environment scrutinize on it and that

2958
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:33,040
doesn't destroy everything that's

2959
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:36,400
actually building things up

2960
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:40,080
thanks dean stephen

2961
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:42,320
and this this what you're just

2962
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:44,639
mentioning there in terms of

2963
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:47,280
dissolving the self

2964
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:49,679
and meditation

2965
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:51,920
and precision

2966
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:54,960
estimates um i think this this could

2967
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:56,960
speak to this idea you know we talk

2968
01:45:56,960 --> 01:45:59,119
about the five there's six plus or minus

2969
01:45:59,119 --> 01:46:00,639
one in terms of how many ideas you can

2970
01:46:00,639 --> 01:46:02,639
hold in your head and we have this idea

2971
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:04,320
you know with higher thinking it's pure

2972
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:05,679
or we have certain

2973
01:46:05,679 --> 01:46:07,440
things that we hold in our minds and i

2974
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:08,400
can

2975
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:10,880
imagine that it's like

2976
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:13,520
with meditation the idea

2977
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:15,600
if it's done well because it can you

2978
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:17,199
know you could end up going into some

2979
01:46:17,199 --> 01:46:20,159
places where you just don't

2980
01:46:20,159 --> 01:46:22,639
it's not productive but in a productive

2981
01:46:22,639 --> 01:46:25,440
sense it's like you are able to adjust

2982
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:28,480
and integrate you can imagine

2983
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:31,760
y d y b y c y e

2984
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:34,080
y g y a

2985
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:36,239
and

2986
01:46:36,239 --> 01:46:39,360
b o it's not that you so you're still

2987
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:41,840
accepting that you can go with different

2988
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:44,639
precision estimates but you don't get

2989
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:47,520
this kind of attachment

2990
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:49,119
or

2991
01:46:49,119 --> 01:46:52,400
to making certain precision estimates as

2992
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:55,199
as kind of rarefied things which we

2993
01:46:55,199 --> 01:46:57,280
often do you know like so we kind of

2994
01:46:57,280 --> 01:46:58,960
feel like it should be like something or

2995
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:02,560
we feel uncomfortable or we get drawn to

2996
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:05,280
our kind of um

2997
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:06,320
you know

2998
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:08,560
our desires or the things that we get

2999
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:10,400
kind of obsessive with or things that we

3000
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:12,400
are avoiding so that could be

3001
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:14,159
interesting and the other thing that

3002
01:47:14,159 --> 01:47:16,560
then can tie to that because i like to

3003
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:18,560
mix as well as meditation which this

3004
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:20,320
talks about which is kind of yeah you've

3005
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:22,719
got meditation you've got action in the

3006
01:47:22,719 --> 01:47:23,760
world

3007
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:25,360
where we can like you say with the

3008
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:27,360
environment walking around and then

3009
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:29,040
we've got ritual

3010
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:31,600
and ritual tends to be more in the um

3011
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:34,400
indigenous approaches but there

3012
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:36,320
you're not necessarily trying to

3013
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:38,800
dissolve anything it's already

3014
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:40,560
it's almost like you're trying to

3015
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:41,920
disrupt it

3016
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:43,760
it's not like you've got a nice

3017
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:44,800
pure

3018
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:47,679
drop that you're hoping to like

3019
01:47:47,679 --> 01:47:50,239
evaporate and allow to become a mist

3020
01:47:50,239 --> 01:47:52,400
that we're not rarefying anymore it's a

3021
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:55,520
bit like you know you you see that you

3022
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:57,280
you're going to put on a big mask and a

3023
01:47:57,280 --> 01:47:58,719
costume and you're going to dance around

3024
01:47:58,719 --> 01:48:02,639
the fire and until you start to

3025
01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:04,639
go into another state

3026
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:08,080
now that could access another

3027
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:11,040
set of

3028
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:12,480
informational

3029
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:14,080
inferences

3030
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:16,560
um and that that may be doing some other

3031
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:19,199
things you know that maybe things which

3032
01:48:19,199 --> 01:48:21,760
are more useful when we're in a communal

3033
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:23,040
integration

3034
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:25,199
and social integration or social sense

3035
01:48:25,199 --> 01:48:26,400
making

3036
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:29,440
um so it could be like we're trying to

3037
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:32,320
regulate as a group and then meditation

3038
01:48:32,320 --> 01:48:34,000
is helping us regulate as individuals

3039
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
and it's neither one's better than the

3040
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,159
other but they have different

3041
01:48:38,159 --> 01:48:40,080
you know niche

3042
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:43,280
properties for us

3043
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:48,239
or well interesting

3044
01:48:48,239 --> 01:48:49,360
discussion

3045
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:51,280
maybe we can each give a closing thought

3046
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:55,119
and then i have a short quote to close

3047
01:48:55,920 --> 01:49:00,639
based upon something dean said but

3048
01:49:00,639 --> 01:49:02,080
it's um

3049
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:04,239
it's a really interesting paper i think

3050
01:49:04,239 --> 01:49:05,520
we all

3051
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:07,920
enjoyed reading it it really does point

3052
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:09,360
the way

3053
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:11,520
towards uh

3054
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:14,159
what does a generalized computational

3055
01:49:14,159 --> 01:49:15,599
phenomenology

3056
01:49:15,599 --> 01:49:17,119
or at the very least without getting

3057
01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:19,520
experience into the mix just what is a

3058
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:22,639
computational framing of mental action

3059
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:24,960
is that a paradox in and of itself is it

3060
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:28,719
impossible is mental action just like um

3061
01:49:28,719 --> 01:49:30,239
a no-go

3062
01:49:30,239 --> 01:49:32,400
or is mental action going to be

3063
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:33,760
understood

3064
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:35,760
to be

3065
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:37,360
everything of the iceberg that isn't the

3066
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:40,239
tip of the iceberg

3067
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:43,040
blue so

3068
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:45,920
just a final thought um you know i i met

3069
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:48,639
a this metacognitive aspect and you know

3070
01:49:48,639 --> 01:49:51,119
that the idea of identity dissolution

3071
01:49:51,119 --> 01:49:54,000
and i do think it was mentioned um in

3072
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,480
this paper but just briefly like what

3073
01:49:56,480 --> 01:49:58,480
about under the influence of psychedelic

3074
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:00,239
drugs where we know we have this

3075
01:50:00,239 --> 01:50:02,480
identity dissolution this ego

3076
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:04,320
dissolution this expansion of the

3077
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:07,199
cognitive boundary so so when you have

3078
01:50:07,199 --> 01:50:08,960
psychedelics how

3079
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:10,719
is the metacognitive

3080
01:50:10,719 --> 01:50:12,000
hierarchy

3081
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,719
influenced disrupted is it obliterated

3082
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:17,840
is it enhanced so i'd be interested to

3083
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:20,480
see if the authors go down that road in

3084
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:23,199
the future or to see someone you know

3085
01:50:23,199 --> 01:50:25,440
take it to that level exploring the

3086
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:28,320
metacognition of

3087
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:29,280
people under the influence of

3088
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:32,159
hallucinogenics

3089
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:34,719
thanks blue dean

3090
01:50:34,719 --> 01:50:37,520
i think back in the 20 zeros we were

3091
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:40,000
wondering about whether or not this

3092
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:43,040
this paper and the stuff that it points

3093
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:45,599
to could be used for nefarious purposes

3094
01:50:45,599 --> 01:50:46,639
and i

3095
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:48,719
think i commented back then that

3096
01:50:48,719 --> 01:50:50,400
i used to work with a lot of people who

3097
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:52,960
are spending a lot of time with focus

3098
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:55,520
and attention on task

3099
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:56,960
and i just like

3100
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:59,280
to sort of keep that where that is

3101
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:01,280
because i know that's a thing and i'd

3102
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:03,199
like to just sort of hold it up with the

3103
01:51:03,199 --> 01:51:06,320
background of what we're available to

3104
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:08,639
that availability piece because i think

3105
01:51:08,639 --> 01:51:10,719
that's the more powerful thing

3106
01:51:10,719 --> 01:51:12,880
and i'm not sure that that's necessarily

3107
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:15,199
threatening but i think if we can have

3108
01:51:15,199 --> 01:51:17,520
conversations with people about

3109
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:19,280
how active inference

3110
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:22,800
acts as an availability enhancer

3111
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:24,719
they might be more attracted to this and

3112
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:26,719
not necessarily see it as something that

3113
01:51:26,719 --> 01:51:28,719
people could use for

3114
01:51:28,719 --> 01:51:30,639
for nasty purposes i mean there's going

3115
01:51:30,639 --> 01:51:32,400
to be people out there going to do their

3116
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:33,679
nasty thing

3117
01:51:33,679 --> 01:51:36,639
but i think there's actually a really um

3118
01:51:36,639 --> 01:51:39,440
a really empathetic and sincere

3119
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:41,599
aspect to this that

3120
01:51:41,599 --> 01:51:43,679
isn't just exploitable but is really

3121
01:51:43,679 --> 01:51:46,800
explorable and is really kind of cool

3122
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:48,719
we'll have a quantitative framework for

3123
01:51:48,719 --> 01:51:50,639
saying that we would prefer if they

3124
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:52,560
didn't even though we expect them to

3125
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:54,719
behave the way that they're expecting

3126
01:51:54,719 --> 01:51:55,840
but um

3127
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:58,000
we'll have an interaction sequence that

3128
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
might change the way that that works

3129
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,560
steven

3130
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:04,000
yeah a couple of points well one it

3131
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,280
might be interesting to see what adam

3132
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:07,360
saffron makes of some of this with the

3133
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:09,760
psychedelics as he's just started a

3134
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:13,040
postdoc now at uh in psychedelics at uh

3135
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:15,360
john hopkins so that'd be uh

3136
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:17,199
that'd be interesting

3137
01:52:17,199 --> 01:52:18,560
and then i suppose the other thing that

3138
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:20,719
i've noticed is as with some of the

3139
01:52:20,719 --> 01:52:22,400
nefarious actions and i think you're

3140
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:24,880
right but i think also

3141
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:27,360
what i've noticed is some of the kind of

3142
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:31,199
intuitive nefarious actions of

3143
01:52:31,199 --> 01:52:33,360
politicians who are particularly adept

3144
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:35,598
at

3145
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:39,280
getting people on their side

3146
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:41,040
it may actually be that some of that

3147
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:43,119
they're doing through kind of like some

3148
01:52:43,119 --> 01:52:45,920
sort of roundabout intuitive artistic

3149
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:48,159
route this might help us reverse

3150
01:52:48,159 --> 01:52:50,800
engineer how they're doing it so there

3151
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:53,920
might also be some benefits to

3152
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:55,840
to understanding what is it they're

3153
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:57,679
doing even if they don't quite know how

3154
01:52:57,679 --> 01:53:00,639
to describe it

3155
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:02,080
dean

3156
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:02,960
just one

3157
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:04,639
i think you're absolutely right stephen

3158
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:05,520
i think

3159
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:07,280
if we if we

3160
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:09,119
are able to make this available to more

3161
01:53:09,119 --> 01:53:11,599
people their detectors are

3162
01:53:11,599 --> 01:53:15,679
going to get really really improved

3163
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:19,520
so the closing quote to hopefully bring

3164
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:20,960
some of these threads together we talked

3165
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:22,880
a lot about you know distributed versus

3166
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:25,760
centralized sense making and what is the

3167
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:27,840
role of scrutiny and the scrutinizer

3168
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:30,800
like dean brought up and of course geb

3169
