00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,340
hello and welcome everyone this is

2
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,280
active inference guest stream 28.1 it's

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,520
October 14 2022.

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,800
today we are going to be hearing and

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,439
discussing reconceiving rationality by

6
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,560
Giovanni Rolla so Giovanni thank you so

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,539
much for joining very much looking

8
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,340
forward to this presentation and

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,840
discussion so off to you thank you

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,899
thank you then it was a pleasure to to

11
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:38,160
receive your invitation a couple of

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,500
months ago and I am delighted to be here

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,320
to have this opportunity to discuss my

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,879
work

15
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,100
um I'll spare your request

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,640
um our suggestion I am uh presenting

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,460
this paper I wrote a couple of years ago

18
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,800
and uh as we were talking the backstage

19
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,559
I have I I've changed my mind a few

20
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,940
times and I'm going to make this clear

21
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,980
during the presentation since I

22
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,440
published that paper but it is a

23
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,240
pleasure nonetheless to have the chance

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,420
to present this video here and uh to

25
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,340
share it with the world so I'm very

26
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,119
happy

27
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,340
uh so we'll be talking about

28
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,619
reconceiving rationality and this is the

29
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:21,860
this is the the

30
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,000
itinerary I was thinking about

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,280
presenting to you so first I'll be

32
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,259
talking about rationality and

33
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,020
contentless cognition then I'll present

34
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,939
my view which I called radically

35
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:36,420
inactive rationality and safety words

36
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,640
about agency and proficient interaction

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,880
and reasoning and rationality they are

38
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,340
close with a couple of objections the

39
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,780
first one being that

40
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,720
whatever I'm present in here is a true

41
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,479
liberal in a way excessively liberal it

42
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,060
encompasses too much and the second

43
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,159
objection which I think is the one that

44
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,280
may interest to you the most is whether

45
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,340
it is effect compatible with predictive

46
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,259
process in our predictive coding which

47
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,459
is of course in the facility in the it's

48
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,000
near the the two of cars in central to

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,239
do to active influence

50
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,099
so

51
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:18,680
here's the

52
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,599
here's the sorry

53
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,420
the my initial thoughts on the matter is

54
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,840
that traditionally the very

55
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,400
uh Orthodox have view on rationality

56
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,400
uh assumes to the most of my knowledge

57
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,560
it's as an assumption really that

58
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,920
rationality must in their reasoning

59
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,440
that for instance I believe B in an

60
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,780
action a are rational if and only if

61
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,120
there is the reasoning that underwrites

62
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,019
the Bure so and of course it's just not

63
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:54,000
any reasoning the reasoning question

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,400
must acquired with certain certain

65
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,480
formal benchmarks such as uh classical

66
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,700
logic or probability reasoning or

67
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,519
heuristics so believing and acting

68
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,560
rationally according to this traditional

69
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,580
film

70
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,840
require meeting certain formal standards

71
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,940
and this as I said it seems to me to be

72
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,319
largely an assumption about what it

73
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,420
means to be rational about defining

74
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,440
rationality in terms of reasoning

75
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:29,220
so if rationality requires reasoning

76
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,620
and if reasoning involves the evaluation

77
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,019
of beliefs against certain formal

78
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:36,900
benchmarks then rationality implies

79
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,940
content for cognition

80
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,420
where content I take it to be minimally

81
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,700
having accuracy conditions being capable

82
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,739
of being

83
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:50,480
right or wrong or in or in on a more

84
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,120
weightier notion being true or false so

85
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,680
the idea here is that rationality

86
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,620
necessarily involves content it involves

87
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,000
beliefs reasoning and the comparison or

88
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,659
sorry

89
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,879
to update right now

90
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,459
one software update I'm sorry there was

91
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,540
a a pop-up in my window over here so

92
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,440
um

93
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,959
that would be I think the the standard

94
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,060
view on rationality

95
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,500
and

96
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,139
if it is so that rationality necessarily

97
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,080
involves content it it is a good fit

98
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,360
with classical cognitivism or

99
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,220
cognitivism in general

100
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,820
which is the view that combination

101
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,259
necessarily involves representational

102
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,800
content at the very least for some

103
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,479
cognitivist of course it might involve

104
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,620
also

105
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,340
um

106
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,280
a conceptual content but at the very

107
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,759
least representational content which has

108
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,979
accuracy conditions

109
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:56,520
but this classical view is not so good

110
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,699
it does not provide a so good fit with

111
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,800
radically inactive and embodied

112
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,940
cognition

113
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,639
which I am here uh thinking not

114
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,160
specifically on radical and activism by

115
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,580
Goodwin Maine in the recent books but I

116
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,160
think it also challenges other views

117
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,680
that are not presented as radically and

118
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,560
active but of course they share some

119
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,199
core tenants with radical and activism

120
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,080
we could call them uh radically embodied

121
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,139
views of cognitions such as

122
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,320
um with the views presented by Ezekiel

123
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,960
Powell or Berman

124
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,820
sensory model life you also have

125
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,840
Gallagher's variety of inactivism in his

126
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,000
2017 book and also the I mean the view

127
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,800
by by Tony kimero in his 2009 book on

128
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,720
ecological psychology and dynamical

129
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,699
systems they all share common tenants

130
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,220
and here I am I know this is very

131
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,160
controversial but I'm treating those

132
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,680
views as radically embodied views of

133
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,780
cognition and but I'm specifically

134
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,940
focused on radical and active views of

135
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,960
cookination

136
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,780
they all say that not the recognition is

137
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,479
representational contentful which is in

138
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,080
a way to say that we can think of basic

139
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,780
contentless forms of cognition

140
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,539
or a contentless level basic level of

141
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:22,680
recognition

142
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,600
which emerges through the active

143
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,720
exploration of one's environment and

144
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,960
Beyond radical and activism by what we

145
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,979
mean

146
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:35,340
this could be this idea could be cashed

147
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,039
out in terms of mastering sensory motor

148
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:40,380
engagements a matter of know-how

149
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,319
the knowing how to engage with your

150
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,120
surroundings instead of knowing that

151
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,900
stuff are so and so around you so this

152
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,300
is very clearly what the Paulo and

153
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,520
colleagues and uh kimero for instance do

154
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,280
in their books uh radical and activism

155
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,759
has a certain tendency to skew sensory

156
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,280
model engagements sensory model schemes

157
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,419
Etc

158
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:05,280
and uh

159
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,979
but recent developments have I think

160
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:12,120
Incorporated that so the the this is the

161
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,979
use of the the gist of this idea right

162
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:19,500
so if we combine radical embodied views

163
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,099
of rumination or radical and activism

164
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:25,860
and the classical fuel on rationality

165
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,800
what we have is something that angle has

166
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,780
described as follows

167
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,880
an activism is the view that cognition

168
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,039
is grounded in a prayer rational

169
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,620
understanding of the world that is based

170
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,419
on sensory motor acquisition of real

171
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:41,240
life situation

172
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:47,039
and he explains these uh this idea of

173
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,340
pre-rational understanding

174
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,880
by

175
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,940
um

176
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,340
by by the the ideas of melopentin

177
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,160
Heidegger according to whom the relation

178
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,560
to the world can be only one rooting in

179
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,900
practice inactives in acting and

180
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,360
practicing intern is mediated through

181
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,539
the body so what seems to be implicit

182
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:12,080
here is that unlike acting and practice

183
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,380
rationality is not actually

184
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:19,500
it is something that is not at a very

185
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,840
basic level of combination so this is

186
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,199
what happened when we we

187
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:27,259
make room for a basic level of cognition

188
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:32,179
rooted in active and in practice and

189
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:35,099
divorce it from upper levels of

190
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,320
combination that they are usually the

191
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,299
locus the lucky classic of rationality

192
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,799
so

193
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,440
the idea in summation is that

194
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,420
contentious cognition or basic cognition

195
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,880
that which emerges through sensory motor

196
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,519
engagements is not rational

197
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,500
so sensory modern engagements however

198
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,899
virtues in prolific they can be cannot

199
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:00,360
be evaluated from the standpoint of

200
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,240
rationality only content for cognition

201
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,220
high level combination can be rational

202
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,140
definition that it is expressed for

203
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,740
instance in beliefs and recently

204
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,380
and well this is something that I

205
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,080
haven't touched upon on the paper but it

206
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,540
was my implicit motivation to deal with

207
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,040
this subject

208
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,200
as someone that comes from philosophy of

209
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,440
the mind is the idea of the myth of the

210
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,720
given at least a version of it

211
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,560
it seemed to me at the time and uh I was

212
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,480
correctly persuaded by a reviewer not to

213
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,440
touch on the subject it was very

214
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,519
convoluted in my initial presentation

215
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,660
but it seems to me that if we divide

216
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,839
base recognition from a rational thought

217
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,980
and action and we do not Point towards

218
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,820
the

219
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,160
well there is no I mean intersection

220
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,740
between these two levels it seems that

221
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,040
radical and activism and uh similar

222
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,740
views would be committed to the myth of

223
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,279
the given unpopularized by Sellers and

224
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:08,360
moderations by McDowell as a problem for

225
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,040
imperious fields of my mind

226
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,790
so it seems that this is I think a

227
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,339
[Music]

228
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:19,380
a philosophically interesting problem

229
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,200
but it's not something that is uh on the

230
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,519
Forefront of the paper it was my

231
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,620
implicit motivation here that to explain

232
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,459
how can we combine the contentless or

233
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:31,980
basic level of cognition through sensory

234
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,320
modern engagements with rationality if

235
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,040
you cannot it seems that uh there is a

236
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,899
given of some sort that is being uh

237
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:45,240
not completely explained in our picture

238
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,640
of the mind so this is something I

239
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,120
wanted to I still want to try to explore

240
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,000
this this intuition more clearly but I

241
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,200
haven't

242
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,940
touched upon this

243
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,660
um

244
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,640
but I I think there's something in the

245
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,100
direction of what why what I will show

246
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,940
today is I think it's a way to tweeze

247
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,120
this this accusation of being committed

248
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,339
to the myth of the given

249
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:14,279
so how can we reconceive rationality I

250
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:17,160
mean I think in order to avoid that

251
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,200
issue and avoid the idea that we have

252
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,660
two levels completely separated from

253
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,380
each other where one The Higher One is

254
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,860
the locus classical rationality and what

255
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,459
else is beneath it it's not rational I

256
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,019
think the idea is to rejected

257
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:37,500
rationality it must be defined or it

258
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,760
entails necessarily reasoning

259
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,500
does not need to be still conceived but

260
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,740
then the challenge becomes to offer a

261
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,839
positive

262
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,000
proposal of what rationality is if not

263
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,120
reasoning and here is Susan Hurley in a

264
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,040
paper that my knowledge is the only one

265
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,240
that it's

266
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,220
upon this subject and I think she was

267
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,839
also concerned about the myth of the

268
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:04,440
given by the way at the time and he is a

269
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,720
long quote from here phenomide me

270
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,240
reading it is that rationality might

271
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,459
emerge from a complex system of the

272
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,320
centralized hierarchy relations of

273
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,779
inhibition facilitation and coordination

274
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:18,540
among different horizontal layers Each

275
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,579
of which is dynamic and environmentally

276
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:23,519
situated rationality reconceived in

277
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,220
horizontal or modular terms uh I don't

278
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,820
know if she has to use this this

279
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,519
terminology but anyway that's how she

280
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,100
chose to express it is sustainably

281
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,320
related to the environment it does not

282
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,540
depend only on internal procedures that

283
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,880
mediate between input and output such as

284
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,399
content either for the organism as a

285
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,959
whole or for a vertically bounded

286
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,779
Central cognitive module rather it

287
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:50,880
depends on complex relationships between

288
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,220
dedicated World involving layers that

289
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,279
monitor and respond to specific aspects

290
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,779
of the natural and social environment

291
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:00,120
and of the neural network and reduce

292
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,700
their feedback from their responses this

293
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,279
to my knowledge is the earliest case of

294
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,480
someone working on the inactive approach

295
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,060
in a way

296
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,839
is obviously more

297
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:17,459
usually associated with the work of

298
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:20,160
avano which is also an activist but

299
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,260
in a different approach from radical and

300
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,180
activism and here is the the earliest

301
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,060
and to my knowledge before I wrote that

302
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,160
paper is that the clearest

303
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,399
uh proposal of rationality reconceived

304
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,860
in the native terms but it's not it's

305
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,139
not something that uh gained traction

306
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:39,660
after her publication to my knowledge

307
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,899
actually I haven't seen much since then

308
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:47,579
and to summarize the idea is that we

309
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,380
have to change the explanatory Focus

310
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,500
which is rationality is not exclusively

311
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,380
thought of as a Content involving

312
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,380
capacity in this proposal it is situated

313
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,839
or World involved in increased worlds

314
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,959
and is it is radically embodied it

315
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,680
depends on bodily morphology and action

316
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,800
and how the the organism is situated and

317
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,660
acts in that environment the idea will

318
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,139
be minimally dead so this is what I call

319
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:20,060
radically inactive rationality

320
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,860
is uh in a very

321
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,079
loose definition so far is that an Asian

322
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,700
acts rationally in so far as human

323
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,100
maintains a proficient interaction with

324
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,019
her environment coordinating her

325
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:36,200
cognitive abilities according to

326
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,579
environmental conditions of constraints

327
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:41,100
and solid stations and of course this

328
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,139
sometimes requires adapting to

329
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:45,980
unforeseen circumstances the the the

330
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,480
core intuition is this

331
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,000
and it's interesting to compare this

332
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,100
idea of radical and active rationality

333
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,480
with another of Susan Hurley's ideas in

334
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,100
a text from 2003 she's she says

335
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,079
reasons uh for acting that she argues

336
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,639
that reasons for acting may be context

337
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:08,339
bound where she's arguing against uh

338
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:10,980
Gareth Evans generality constraint

339
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,980
and this is the defense of the idea of

340
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,880
islands of practical rationality

341
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,459
so she is still treating rationality as

342
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:22,440
essentially something that relates to

343
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,660
reasoning here but this kind of

344
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,480
reasoning is bounded by practical

345
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,600
context so this is a very Progressive

346
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,579
view if compared with the traditional

347
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:34,260
view I I talked about at the beginning

348
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,380
but still more conservative than what I

349
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:41,120
am trying to develop here

350
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:46,260
so another thing that I think must be uh

351
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,600
in there the Forefront of this proposal

352
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,600
is that rationality implies agency and

353
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,420
autonomy because something or only

354
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,820
something that an organism does can be

355
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,399
said to be rational right

356
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:04,320
so to use these uh the ideas from the

357
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,399
autonomous and activist camp and from

358
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,740
the theory of how to players is

359
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,079
autonomous systems such as a Roomba

360
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:15,779
cannot be rational because it's not an

361
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:19,320
agent it is not the author of its own

362
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,440
behavior it is designed by external

363
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,440
agents to work in a certain way so it's

364
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,139
not strictly speaking a nation so that

365
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:30,360
is where I would draw the line of where

366
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,120
well you cannot it makes no sense to

367
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,160
ascribe rationality to a Roomba for

368
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,000
instance

369
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,959
and

370
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,220
for this I

371
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,160
I use the the Notions of autonomy and

372
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,160
adaptivity the DiPaolo and others you

373
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,440
have also the the recent book image the

374
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,360
four sensory model life and that famous

375
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,540
paper from the bowl from 2005 where he

376
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,940
talks about the adaptivity

377
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,060
to to set his very general constraints

378
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,459
on what it means to be Russian

379
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:06,599
so autonomous systems are thereby

380
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,240
conceived as precarious networks a

381
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,579
precarious network of processes because

382
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,679
organization and physical boundaries are

383
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,500
produced by the system itself the system

384
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,559
is continually maintaining its own uh

385
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,959
viability conditions which is

386
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,419
uh known as sense making where the

387
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,959
system explored uh environmental

388
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,700
environmental conditions that are

389
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,780
favorable to its uh self-maintenance and

390
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,120
avoids the ones that are detrimental to

391
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,960
it

392
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,080
so this is how I understand to be the

393
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,860
the very in general that they

394
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,380
emotional constraint on a rational being

395
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,039
that it must be an autonomous system

396
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,080
and the interesting thing here is that

397
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,980
the concept of adaptivity that Paulo but

398
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,500
forth is that the capacity of an

399
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,360
organism to improve its condition of

400
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,580
self-production through internal

401
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,440
structural changes

402
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,660
so it involves the monitoring and

403
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,700
regulation of internal changes in order

404
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,039
to select the best available course of

405
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,740
action it is I think it's another

406
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,520
interesting concept to think in of to to

407
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,820
including this idea of a radically

408
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,919
inactive notion of rationality one that

409
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:25,020
is not necessarily committed to

410
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,299
reasoning and content

411
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:29,820
so agency is realized through the

412
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,740
exercise of situated abilities that

413
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,780
promote changes within the organism in

414
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,100
accordance with environmental

415
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,440
constraints and substations

416
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,660
which means that how well an organism

417
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,760
adapts in order to deal proficiently

418
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,179
with its environment is a measure of or

419
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:48,059
an indication of its rationality the

420
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:50,340
more rational an organism is the more

421
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,080
suited it is to deal with its

422
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,880
environment and we have foreseen

423
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,380
circumstances

424
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,919
and in doing so the organism enhances

425
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:02,220
The Continuous exchanges between itself

426
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,480
and the environment

427
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,419
which is crucial for its survival and it

428
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:08,059
is very

429
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:10,080
naturalized way of thinking of

430
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,100
rationality is mostly capacity to to

431
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,340
enhance changes for survival

432
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,020
this is the

433
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,120
the overall idea here

434
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,780
so as I said before what about reasoning

435
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,160
I want to

436
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,280
I don't want to commit rationality

437
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,039
necessarily with reasoning and this is

438
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:34,620
what radically inactive rationality is

439
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,559
all about but I don't want to exclude

440
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:40,440
reasoning as a former rational

441
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,320
combination so what I'm saying is that

442
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,120
it's not defined by reasoning but it's

443
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,360
not uh it does not exclude reasoning

444
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,020
reasoning I think would be thought of as

445
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,740
a special or specific mode of rational

446
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,980
agency one that is exclusive to our

447
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,140
knowledge to human beings

448
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,539
but it's not the defining feature of

449
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:05,039
rationality

450
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,419
so for this I uh in order to to explain

451
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:13,260
this idea I recall how Hutu and Saturn

452
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:17,580
in between the paper in the most recent

453
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,820
book by utani they explain the emergence

454
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,799
of high recognition the idea is that

455
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,200
being able to engage in content for

456
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,299
cognition ultimately depends on being

457
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,780
social culturally embedded

458
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,400
where content full cognition emerged

459
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,740
from social cultural interaction so as

460
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,960
an individual takes part in Social

461
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,580
cultural practices

462
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,400
they accept more ancient cognitive

463
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,539
abilities to deal with symbols and by

464
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:47,820
doing so they

465
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,240
um in a long process of enculturation of

466
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:51,900
course

467
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:56,120
they become able to engage with uh

468
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,620
symbolic coordination which is not

469
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,539
internal representation specific because

470
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:03,480
it is publicly available it's not mental

471
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,220
representations in the traditional sense

472
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,559
but it has the features of symbolic

473
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:10,500
cognition without the the commitment to

474
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,360
internal representation or mental

475
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,220
representations

476
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,740
so acting rationally in its most General

477
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,860
sense is the idea that the proficient

478
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,740
behavior of an organism is in uh is is

479
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,720
the proficient behavior of an organism

480
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,880
in its environment it depends on the

481
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,220
coordination of embodied abilities

482
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,039
whereas reasoning if everything goes

483
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,620
well of course is understood as content

484
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,260
for rationality for my specific mode of

485
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,659
rationality reasoning is the proficient

486
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:41,700
behavior of an organism in a social

487
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,679
cultural environment

488
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,679
which is a more specific aspect of our

489
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:49,020
environment of course and it depends on

490
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,419
the coordination of such a culturally

491
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:53,940
based or content involving abilities

492
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,740
which are more recent in the the human

493
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,240
phylogenetic scale

494
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,440
so well this is the the biggest of the

495
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,080
idea this is the the I think

496
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,380
uh the the propositive part and here are

497
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:14,039
the objections I wanted to talk about

498
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:17,159
first one being that it's a very liberal

499
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:18,919
view it's very

500
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:24,000
uh it it is well it encompasses too much

501
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,640
one would say because if rational action

502
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,200
boils down to the coordination of

503
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,140
cognitive abilities then rationality is

504
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,539
something gradual for an organism could

505
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:35,280
be more or less proficient in its

506
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,620
environmental interactions

507
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,799
and the the rejection goes according to

508
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,600
radically inactive rationality many

509
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,360
organisms achieve and maintain an

510
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,159
Adaptive behavior in the niche with

511
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:50,520
different levels of success to which I

512
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,580
am uh well someone could sing rational

513
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,280
and active radical and active

514
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,740
rationalities to Liberal and this is one

515
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,780
objection that I I've heard in person

516
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,179
and I I kept it so hard because I think

517
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:05,100
it's very it's a very good way of

518
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,500
putting it evens nails are rational on

519
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,440
this View and that to which I must say

520
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,039
that I am willing to to buy the wallet

521
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,840
uh well yes it's more liberal than

522
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,400
traditional views of course it is

523
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,039
intended to be so but I don't think that

524
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:23,640
this per se problem what I think is the

525
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,000
the the positive part here is that it

526
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,520
preserves a difference of degree

527
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,620
humans are way more rational than other

528
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,559
animals simply because we are able to

529
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,280
perform a wide variety of actions in a

530
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,799
wide variety of dynamic circumstances

531
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,380
that are Way Beyond any other animals

532
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,059
that we are aware of

533
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:47,820
so to come back to the example of this

534
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,640
nail this nail can perform a few complex

535
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,340
actions can move from one point to

536
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,860
another it can search for food and

537
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,100
shelter and so on so forth but they have

538
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,620
a critical limited set of abilities if

539
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,720
you surround this nail with the South

540
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,320
for instance it is doomed to to die by

541
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,840
the retortation and humans on the other

542
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,280
hand they are much more adaptive and

543
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,140
able to deal dynamically with many

544
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:17,940
unforeseen circumstances so uh

545
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,460
in my response to that objection is that

546
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,679
yes

547
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,840
uh well it is very liberal but that's

548
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,820
not the problem the problem would be if

549
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,640
that it is if it had the room for a

550
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,919
difference of degree between how animals

551
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,620
deal with their environments

552
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,780
so and and this is the other object

553
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,000
objection which I think it may be though

554
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,580
the one that interests you the most then

555
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,940
you know is the 12 predictive processing

556
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,760
seems to imply inferences and content

557
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,220
all the way

558
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:53,580
uh but at first I must uh warn you and

559
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,780
the viewers that

560
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,900
at the time I wrote this uh this paper

561
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,179
was much more optimistic about this

562
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:03,179
possibility of combining an activism and

563
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:04,799
predictive coding or predictive

564
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,220
processing and uh I think there are

565
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,140
important points here but there is this

566
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:14,820
recent paper by Olu and Evan Thompson

567
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:18,360
and Randy beer where they uh they

568
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,179
provide a critical assessment of uh the

569
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:24,360
the the the attempts to combine mainly

570
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,158
the free energy principle and

571
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:28,820
um

572
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,740
inactive and

573
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:35,039
autobiographic theories so I am now

574
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,140
mostly convinced by the arguments but I

575
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,539
think there are some interesting points

576
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:42,299
of comparison here nonetheless

577
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:45,480
so predictive process in our predictive

578
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,880
code and uh at the time I was writing

579
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,940
and still to this day is all the rage in

580
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,679
the cognitive Sciences I guess you can

581
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:55,440
say that it sounded sweets become the

582
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,720
one of the main paradigms out there so

583
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,779
it is interesting to see if it provides

584
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:04,700
a good fit with what I'm talking about

585
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,200
and in these viewers you know

586
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,120
competition is understood as a process

587
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,159
of error minimization that occurs in

588
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:14,400
bidirectional narrow hierarchies

589
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,860
so

590
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,840
you have the generation of internal

591
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,000
models for the activity of lower layers

592
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,980
that anticipates the distal causes of

593
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,860
sinisterial stimuli which is a top-down

594
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,440
process and the minimization of

595
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,299
discrepancy between prediction and

596
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:33,480
current stimulus signal by

597
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,419
um the occupation of priors which is a

598
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:38,100
bottom of process

599
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,919
so here's of course active inference

600
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:42,960
which is understood by for instance in

601
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,059
an informal you know formal terms by

602
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:48,419
Clark that an organism moves its sensors

603
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:50,700
in ways that amount to actively seek in

604
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,980
our generation generating the sensory

605
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,559
consequences that they are rather their

606
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:57,480
brains expect

607
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,760
this is one way of understanding active

608
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,419
influencing very formal terms but I

609
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:05,460
think it gets the job done

610
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,700
so is the brain inferring the expected

611
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,299
source of received stimuli if it is

612
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:15,120
it seems that there is a there's an

613
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,100
issue with what I'm talking about

614
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,159
so the him voting reading of predictive

615
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,640
processing which is which uses the

616
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,640
product bias and inference right says

617
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,860
for instance that the process of

618
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,419
perceptionistas is separable from

619
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:33,360
rational broader biasing process of

620
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,580
prolification and context top-down

621
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,100
effects I felt that every intermediate

622
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,440
level of processing this has caught my

623
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,200
attention the way that Clark is also

624
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,760
talking about rationality all the way

625
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,159
but it's an inferential sort of

626
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:49,279
rationality

627
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:53,880
and pervasive influencer reasoning seems

628
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,340
to imply impervasive content

629
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,679
and then predictive processing seems to

630
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,799
be incompatible with radically inactive

631
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:04,500
rationality

632
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,500
well but there is uh at the time there

633
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,080
was and I think we can still argue in

634
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,020
several of the there's no

635
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,799
non-hemorrhoids and reading of

636
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,900
predictive processing

637
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,900
which uses for instance a one first step

638
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,120
would be to use a deflationary sense of

639
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,000
prediction that understanding cameo in a

640
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,960
short paper from 2013 but fourth where

641
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,059
the values of two or more variables

642
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:34,020
covari or are value reliably so the

643
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:37,260
value of 1 allows the Observer to infer

644
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,240
the value of another and here the

645
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,220
inference is happening happening at the

646
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,919
level of the observation not at one far

647
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,080
variable is inferring the value of

648
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,860
another so the idea would be I think

649
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,260
that content is in the eye of the

650
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,720
beholder the person who interprets how

651
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,400
the selection of censorial we put

652
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,860
approximates internal predictions here

653
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,260
understood in the inflationary sense can

654
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,659
describe it in inferential and biasing

655
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:11,120
terms so this is how I see for instance

656
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:16,039
the the idea about 4 000 by Bruno

657
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:20,279
paper which if I'm not mistaken

658
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,500
title is something like the brain is not

659
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,380
a scientist and the argument is in this

660
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,299
general direction

661
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:30,679
that we are projecting how

662
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:34,440
scientists construe brain activity as a

663
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,720
feature of the brain itself as if it

664
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,960
were predicting and inferring this more

665
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,140
uh robust or weightier sense

666
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,320
so what I'm trying to say here is that

667
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,700
active inference then I use double and

668
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,220
say double forgot the name of this in

669
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,559
English sorry

670
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:59,640
um it's not uh the literal sense of

671
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,559
inference here according to radically

672
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:03,240
inactive

673
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,419
uh rationality is that unarmed for the

674
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:09,120
efficiency of co-oriented behavior the

675
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,640
agent has to act in certain ways in

676
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,220
order for his his or her States come to

677
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,860
fruition more efficiently less costly

678
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,080
this does not imply the more contentious

679
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,299
claim that the generative models

680
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:23,760
themselves display and perform

681
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,860
predictive inferences this is a very

682
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,919
deflationary reading into predictive

683
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:32,059
processing to to provide this

684
00:30:32,059 --> 00:30:35,340
combination with radical and active

685
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,840
rationality

686
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:42,419
and here's a kickoff in a paper from

687
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:43,640
2018

688
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,260
by model it doesn't follow that an

689
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,700
organism has an internal

690
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,220
representational model of its niche in

691
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,260
that it is this model that those are the

692
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,840
cognitive work if you like instead an

693
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,080
organism is a model that is the causal

694
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,299
and statistical regularities reflect in

695
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:02,520
some environmental reflecting some

696
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,159
phenotype that is a model

697
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:07,620
and well

698
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,679
this relates to something that recently

699
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:14,940
uh my colleague notifica and I have been

700
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,179
talking about the idea of how organisms

701
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:20,520
bring forth a world according to an

702
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,980
activism which is idea that the organism

703
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,779
and environment are historically

704
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:28,740
historically called determined so

705
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,799
at the flow genetical scale this could

706
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:34,140
be explained through the idea of Niche

707
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,360
construction the idea that once an

708
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,059
organism is active in its environment it

709
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:41,940
promotes changes that if they are stable

710
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,640
enough they can be inherited by its

711
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,500
Offspring and these changes provide new

712
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,539
evolutionary press pressure pressures

713
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:54,779
that are that lead its evolutionary path

714
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:57,779
a similar idea has also been explored by

715
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:00,240
other description this time relating

716
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,820
Niche Construction

717
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:06,080
and the ecological psychology

718
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,620
so my my response to that objection is

719
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,779
that to act rationally means to achieve

720
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:14,760
a proficient engagement with the

721
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,340
environment through in a way prediction

722
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,220
and their minimization I'm willing to

723
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:22,740
accept that characterization but

724
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,559
rational and broader biasian processes

725
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:28,500
need not imply content for cognition if

726
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,399
we

727
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:32,159
if we understand that in the Flash no

728
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,320
sense prediction and their minimization

729
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,200
involve the selection of input and the

730
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,120
coordination of an interabilities in

731
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,760
World involvement manners which is well

732
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,860
exactly the main claim of radical and

733
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:47,340
active personality so I think to that

734
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,059
extent that predictive processing is not

735
00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:53,159
uh an enemies would be rather than a lie

736
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:56,059
of this idea instead of uh

737
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:58,679
arrival but of course there are other

738
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:01,559
issues of compatibility that I have I

739
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:05,640
haven't touched upon here but that uh is

740
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,220
all I have thought of for today thank

741
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,399
you

742
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,740
awesome thank you very much

743
00:33:15,899 --> 00:33:18,739
all right

744
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,059
cool very interesting

745
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:25,799
for those who are watching live please

746
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:28,559
feel free to write any questions I will

747
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,840
gather my notes and let's begin the

748
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,580
discussion

749
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,200
okay

750
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,960
well first just thanks again for the

751
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,220
talk

752
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,880
how about a little context on how you

753
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,360
came to be asking these questions in

754
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,880
your current position and how your

755
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,220
interests in this area developed because

756
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,200
there's so many interesting ideas and I

757
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,240
just wanted to learn more about how you

758
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,299
came to this Framing and sharpened your

759
00:33:57,299 --> 00:33:59,220
point

760
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,960
okay thank you that's that's a good

761
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,059
question because it's not often that you

762
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:05,659
can explore this background

763
00:34:05,659 --> 00:34:10,500
it matters so uh I was at the time I

764
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,139
think I was writing my PhD dissertation

765
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:18,000
it was maybe 2007 or something and uh I

766
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,219
was arguing for the idea that

767
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:23,219
rationality must be something that is

768
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:25,739
ultimately World involved in there is a

769
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:29,580
tendency to think of well even among as

770
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:33,599
I told as I showed you among uh in in

771
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,480
embodied periods with people of certain

772
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,639
it needs to be essentially World

773
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,379
involving such as acting and practice

774
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:41,879
and so forth

775
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:44,460
and perception of course but rationality

776
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,580
remains something like naturalizable

777
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:50,599
notion something that cannot be

778
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:54,960
brought down to the level of the the it

779
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,800
could not be scaled down in a way

780
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,540
like perception that could be explained

781
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:04,020
by a certain Dynamic engagement and so

782
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,240
on so forth

783
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,880
so at the time I was thinking that well

784
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,920
maybe this is

785
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,440
a knee issue because

786
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,720
on other

787
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:19,140
other contexts it is taken to imply that

788
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,839
whatever perception is if it is not

789
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,240
articulated in a way to provide a

790
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,760
certain fit with professional

791
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,700
combination then perception is a given

792
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,500
and this is the myth of the given

793
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,200
Dimension at the beginning and I thought

794
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,420
that well maybe this is something of

795
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,000
there is something of a myth of the

796
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,859
given working here on an active

797
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:43,680
cognition but this is not I think it's

798
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,560
not fatal because we couldn't principle

799
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,740
argue that instead of

800
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,960
uh construing the step perception and

801
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,900
other basic forms of combinations

802
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,300
involving Concepts and the like maybe we

803
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,859
could argue

804
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:01,079
from the other direction try to scale

805
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:04,859
down rationality in more not naturalized

806
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:06,839
level of

807
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:09,799
uh

808
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,700
so that was the motivation and it was

809
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,339
very it was a long review process and I

810
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:20,940
believe that my first the first version

811
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:25,680
of the paper the the viewer was very I

812
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,400
think they were correct entirely I I

813
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,320
endorsed the suggestion after all but he

814
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,880
was very uh

815
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,760
they were very adamant on taking that

816
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,980
part and I think it was for the better

817
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:41,520
because it it is another literature it

818
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,599
is another uh a lot of references that

819
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,260
are not usually in conversation with an

820
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,599
activism and body recognition and it was

821
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,700
very difficult just to put the matter in

822
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,339
the same terms to advance my arguments

823
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,900
so it's something that I scratched out

824
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,880
and I haven't thought too much about

825
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,099
that system but I think it's something I

826
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:05,700
would like to come back to and maybe uh

827
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,000
even probably someone has done so in the

828
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,839
in this last few years I'm not aware I

829
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:14,400
can remember but

830
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,220
this relation between an activism the

831
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,440
myth of the gift and it seemed to be it

832
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,200
seems to be very

833
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,619
obvious so it is I think something that

834
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:29,280
we could we should I mean uh be able to

835
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,260
explore but there's not something that

836
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,880
was in the the Forefront of the paper

837
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,200
but

838
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,940
but I had this idea to talk about

839
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:39,480
rationality in the flashing every sense

840
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,000
and at the same time I was reading a lot

841
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
about uh

842
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,900
called him from a philosophical

843
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,599
perspective of course I'm not as I said

844
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,420
very well versed in the technicalities

845
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,820
and the formalities of the the approach

846
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,520
but I was interested in the the

847
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,320
philosophical consequences there and I

848
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,540
thought well maybe there's something to

849
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,720
compare here because as Clark's

850
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,280
quotation show

851
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,619
you can talk about rationality all the

852
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,680
way and uh that's something I wanted to

853
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:15,780
to develop but not in a cognitivist view

854
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,780
but not radically embodied film so

855
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:22,640
that's the the the background

856
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,700
awesome thank you could you maybe

857
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:29,700
describe just what is the myth of the

858
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,579
given what was the context that that

859
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:36,660
myth arose in and where do we go after

860
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,700
bringing up the myth of the given

861
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,619
because I I saw it as a concept that you

862
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:43,800
wove in so what was it about

863
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,020
okay so the middle of the giving it that

864
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:49,740
well there are several possible Givens

865
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,720
depending on your flavor of philosophy

866
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,599
of mine but most classically in previous

867
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:57,180
fields of the Mind take the the the

868
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:00,720
content of perception to be given prayer

869
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,940
rationally in a way that we have certain

870
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,880
inputs that are uh just received by the

871
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,060
mind and the mind interprets it so

872
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:12,480
sellers different sellers is famous for

873
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,920
uh

874
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,940
having described his uh this problem as

875
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,099
a problem for not only increases fuels

876
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:21,900
of the mind but also for rationalists

877
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,900
but on the on the other side rational is

878
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:28,440
usually taken uh rational intuition as a

879
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,079
given which is to say that there is some

880
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:34,200
some level of cognition that is uh

881
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,440
unarticulate that it's given or as some

882
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,140
people talk about being bred given

883
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:43,339
but in a way there is this level of

884
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:46,020
cognition that is given and the mind has

885
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,900
to interpret it but if it is given in

886
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,880
this way it has no point of contact no

887
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,359
uh intersection between whatever

888
00:39:56,359 --> 00:40:00,720
whatever mind does and and this basic

889
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:06,060
level of uh domination so my idea is to

890
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,000
avoid the the charge of being committed

891
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,400
to the myth of the given but again this

892
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,859
is not something that is explicit in the

893
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:16,560
the nativist literature but it's

894
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,560
something that seems to be possible to

895
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,900
to develop in a

896
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:26,700
I mean uh in this sort of comparison but

897
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,520
it's not it's not from the

898
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,140
not clearly there but

899
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,540
one way of solving them for the Givens

900
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,180
to say that perceptual content is

901
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,359
already conceptual in nature which is

902
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:44,760
for instance how Joe McDowell does in

903
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,220
mind the more of that you know a

904
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:50,640
perception uh the the joke is comes with

905
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,720
subtitles you and interpret the world as

906
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,119
as you do but uh

907
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,000
I think that one way or another way is

908
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,180
to demystify you know a rationality and

909
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,940
the upper layers of combination try and

910
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:11,339
try to think of them uh uh in less

911
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:15,720
uh content for analysis

912
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,660
without committing them so it's strictly

913
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:21,320
speaking with a level of content that is

914
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,460
divorced from basic levels of

915
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,099
combination that's one way I think of

916
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:29,220
doing so and rationality seems to be the

917
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:34,740
one key concept to do this because

918
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:38,359
it's all usually assumed to be something

919
00:41:38,359 --> 00:41:40,680
exclusively human and something that is

920
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,920
related to reasoning and well if it is

921
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,160
so then rationality cannot inform action

922
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,119
and if of course if the action is

923
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:53,280
contentless in nature so if rationality

924
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,060
is a sense essentially contentful and

925
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:00,480
reaction is essentially uncontained for

926
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,599
contentless then you can you do not have

927
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:04,760
this

928
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:09,300
uh that's done this uh intersection

929
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,060
between two domains and this is

930
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,280
something I wanted to avoid but as I

931
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,339
told you it became so hard to express

932
00:42:17,339 --> 00:42:19,920
this views in in

933
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,380
sufficiently clear and general way is

934
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,140
that by recommendation of our reviewer I

935
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,119
scratch that out and I

936
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,599
I still think about it but nothing I

937
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:33,480
haven't developed a proper

938
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,020
line of argumentation that deals with it

939
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,599
more clearly than I can do as I just did

940
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,339
in very general terms

941
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:48,420
cool well some words that you associated

942
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:52,859
with rationality were adaptivity

943
00:42:52,859 --> 00:42:56,400
and also proficiency so what do you see

944
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,640
as the relationship of rationality and

945
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,000
Fitness

946
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:06,240
as a biological function right yes yeah

947
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,060
okay I um

948
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:12,839
I think it is it is an intrinsic

949
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:15,599
relation really I think it is

950
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,480
uh probably the most

951
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,640
[Music]

952
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,960
um

953
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,260
obvious consequence of rational action

954
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:29,280
at a special scale and when we talk

955
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,500
about whether rationality is a feature

956
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:36,260
of uh certain species or instead of

957
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:39,420
individuals I think Fitness is one of

958
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,579
the

959
00:43:40,579 --> 00:43:43,500
the key Concepts here to to think this

960
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,960
as the the outcome of this

961
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,680
uh rational action

962
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:52,020
so although I do not say that I do not

963
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,540
put it in those matters in the paper I

964
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,280
think it is possible to think it that

965
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,500
way you know don't see it as a

966
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,740
as an objection to think think of

967
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,500
rationality but again it's very liberal

968
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,140
and I'm willing to to accept this

969
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,000
consequence as well every living

970
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,540
organism in a way if it if it hasn't

971
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:15,740
gone Instinct yet so it is in a way

972
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,900
fitted to its environment so I'm willing

973
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,760
to see that it may involve a minimal

974
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,980
level of rationality of dealing with uh

975
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:25,500
the enemy changing environment

976
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:30,960
but well and it's the price of having a

977
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,920
very

978
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,260
uh

979
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:36,240
liberal Progressive notion of

980
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,280
rationalities this is a consequence of

981
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,760
it I believe

982
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,400
so you've said that Fitness is is a

983
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,300
consequence of rational Behavior are

984
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,780
there other consequences or how do we

985
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:54,480
recognize rationality from the outside

986
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,060
other than just saying well the ant

987
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:00,000
colony is thriving so to the extent that

988
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,060
it is rational it is adaptive an

989
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,640
exhibiting agency and all of that

990
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,160
um is this such a deflationary

991
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:11,220
rationality concept that all extant

992
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:15,119
things humans and otherwise are merely

993
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,400
described by it or are there some

994
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,380
outcomes that we can use to disentangle

995
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:22,740
like for example a rational or

996
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:25,740
irrational behavior from merely the

997
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:28,380
consequences reflected by survival and

998
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,880
Fitness

999
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:34,319
right well I I had to to think very

1000
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,780
carefully about this because I don't

1001
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:39,000
want to trivialize this concept in a way

1002
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,359
that well everything is IPS of fact or

1003
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:43,980
rational by the matter of fact that it's

1004
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,800
living it is acting relationship but I

1005
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,339
think that uh in particular cases one

1006
00:45:50,339 --> 00:45:54,540
could uh identify the nation that I am

1007
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:57,180
equal to the individuals

1008
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:00,060
um self-sustainment in that Niche so so

1009
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,619
at the individual level in particular

1010
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:03,960
okay this is one conclusive certain

1011
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,400
actions that could classifiers

1012
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,380
irrational to the extent that they uh

1013
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:11,060
are detrimental to to with survival but

1014
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,859
uh at the species level it's more

1015
00:46:13,859 --> 00:46:16,619
difficult to argue in that way because

1016
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:19,619
to identify this kind of behavior or

1017
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:24,000
consequence but I think that in order

1018
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,640
to not to trivialize the idea of

1019
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,099
rational and say well everything that is

1020
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:33,240
living is a factorized you'd have to to

1021
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,579
identify this sort of particular acts

1022
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:38,640
that are detrimented to

1023
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,520
to one survival

1024
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,579
so in the case of the the ant colony I

1025
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:47,240
don't know maybe

1026
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,400
welcoming invasers would be a

1027
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,579
would be the sort of behavior that would

1028
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:56,960
be prejudicial to with

1029
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,220
survival as such

1030
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,900
I don't know I don't know if this is uh

1031
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,640
it's one impossible way of thinking

1032
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,260
about this I had to think more clearly

1033
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:05,040
but

1034
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,900
my carefully

1035
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:11,700
oh very interesting and you brought in

1036
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,740
in that answer and in the presentation

1037
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,420
like multiple

1038
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:19,200
nested time scales just like Eco Evo

1039
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,960
Devo does from a more biological

1040
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,599
perspective looking at how Niche

1041
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:27,240
construction Bridges the gap between

1042
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,420
slower phylogenetic processes and more

1043
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:33,599
rapid developmental processes

1044
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:36,060
um so how does this

1045
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:41,040
embedded and multi-scale consideration

1046
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,700
relate to the the content

1047
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,880
concept like is content going to be

1048
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:54,319
localized in one body or is the content

1049
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:57,900
distributed across entities or is the

1050
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:01,140
rationality distributed across entities

1051
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:04,079
how would we even identify the locus

1052
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,359
of rationality and that also kind of

1053
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:09,140
invokes the um horizontal and modular

1054
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:11,520
conception from the quote that you

1055
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,960
provided so how do we identify salient

1056
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,720
spatial temporal scales and systems of

1057
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,899
Interest

1058
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,900
oh ah I don't know I don't know if I can

1059
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:28,560
answer uh this fully but it seems to me

1060
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:32,760
that at the level of uh if we're talking

1061
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,000
about content for instance content as a

1062
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,339
accuracy conditions for symbolic

1063
00:48:38,339 --> 00:48:40,980
thoughts I think fortunately we have to

1064
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:43,200
say that it's it's not localized in a

1065
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,780
single individual it's publicly shared

1066
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:48,300
so you can say that

1067
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:48,960
um

1068
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,599
one consequence of this is that it's

1069
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,720
possible to think of different uh

1070
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,480
patterns of reasoning that have

1071
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,920
being information

1072
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,500
sites at different times Etc and you can

1073
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,359
see that well they developed different

1074
00:49:06,359 --> 00:49:09,119
level different uh rules for Content

1075
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:09,859
information

1076
00:49:09,859 --> 00:49:13,020
and I think this is

1077
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:16,680
plausible to say that content is

1078
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:20,480
is localized that the the

1079
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,579
uh how can you say it's share the amount

1080
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:27,800
you know the specifics of

1081
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:32,339
just for rationality I think

1082
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:33,990
one could

1083
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:35,180
[Music]

1084
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:38,220
identify in particular behaviors

1085
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:42,980
if it if it fits these uh

1086
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:47,280
this kind of description of uh spin

1087
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,319
proficient proficient interaction and

1088
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,720
adaptive interaction between an organism

1089
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:56,040
and its environment its Niche so

1090
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,520
probably we could

1091
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:03,060
we could give different answers here as

1092
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:05,520
a rationality and content I I am willing

1093
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,480
to say that

1094
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,400
content for organization is not

1095
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,680
something that happens in the head

1096
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,500
something that is out there in a way

1097
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:16,200
share the amount of others and this is

1098
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,359
something that the philosophy of mine

1099
00:50:18,359 --> 00:50:21,839
has at least since the 60s the

1100
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:23,520
philosophers of mine have been argued

1101
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,940
for the idea that content is externally

1102
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,099
individuated

1103
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:34,640
and uh I'm I think this is it is one of

1104
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,440
the video by for instance Hillary Putnam

1105
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,440
and Tyler Burge and others that the

1106
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:43,680
mental content is individuated at the

1107
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,859
community level or societal level but

1108
00:50:46,859 --> 00:50:48,540
along there on the other hand they think

1109
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:50,940
rationality could be in principle

1110
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:53,819
individuated in particular behaviors but

1111
00:50:53,819 --> 00:50:56,040
it would depend on the individual's

1112
00:50:56,040 --> 00:51:00,119
goals and the the niche it inhabits and

1113
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:02,839
so on so forth

1114
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,640
there are of course actual variables

1115
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,460
here that might be important too

1116
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:10,819
to identify

1117
00:51:10,819 --> 00:51:14,400
Behavior as rational or not

1118
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,359
okay

1119
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:16,559
thanks

1120
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:19,260
um well one phrase that really stuck

1121
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:23,339
with me was like know how not know that

1122
00:51:23,339 --> 00:51:27,000
perhaps uh a basal point in your work

1123
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,819
and a focus on that action so I just

1124
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:31,200
wanted to

1125
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:35,280
hear about how action and practice as

1126
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,040
you wove them here today how are those

1127
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,200
terms addressed

1128
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:44,040
and how are things different today with

1129
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:47,040
the treatment of action and practice and

1130
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,880
know-how not know that than say in the

1131
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,460
helmholtzee in days or even in ancient

1132
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:57,119
or in World Knowledge traditions

1133
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:00,420
So Okay cool so the idea I think would

1134
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:02,520
be that

1135
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,900
um

1136
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:08,400
there is a tendency from uh it is a

1137
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,700
tendency from a very modern philosophy

1138
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:14,700
but it has been very influential in the

1139
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:17,160
first wave of cognitive science to think

1140
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,720
of perception as

1141
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,140
a capacity to categorize the environment

1142
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:27,200
and to offer a discrete description of

1143
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,599
environmental aspects so for instance

1144
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:33,720
perceiving that uh the the the the

1145
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:38,460
that I know the the cup is to my left is

1146
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:41,520
a matter of knowing that there is a

1147
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,280
thing with searches such properties to

1148
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:47,339
my left and this is a kind of uh know

1149
00:52:47,339 --> 00:52:49,619
that a kind of propositional attitude

1150
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:51,859
towards the world so

1151
00:52:51,859 --> 00:52:54,680
uh I think the the

1152
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,540
interesting thing about an activism and

1153
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:00,839
ecological psychology as well and to the

1154
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:02,880
extent that they recall the American

1155
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,900
pragmatism from the the beginning of the

1156
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,900
century is to think of

1157
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:11,819
perception as a matter of not

1158
00:53:11,819 --> 00:53:14,099
categorizing these great properties in

1159
00:53:14,099 --> 00:53:16,980
the world but as uh disclosing

1160
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:19,260
possibilities for acting

1161
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:22,859
and this is something that if we were to

1162
00:53:22,859 --> 00:53:27,599
explain that in terms of uh in epidemic

1163
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:30,000
terms such as knowledge we wouldn't put

1164
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,460
it as a matter of knowing that the the

1165
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:35,700
curve is to my left but knowing how to

1166
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:38,579
grab the cup and do whatever I want to

1167
00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:40,319
do with it if I want to drink a cup of

1168
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,720
coffee or if I want to use it as a

1169
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,880
paperweight it will have different

1170
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,640
silent properties and this is something

1171
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,079
that

1172
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:53,460
although it has been I think

1173
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:56,280
very I think an activism and ecological

1174
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,900
psychology and other embodied views of

1175
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,660
cognition have been largely successfully

1176
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:03,720
in shifting this discussion to this

1177
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:07,020
point I think in the uh in more

1178
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,180
traditional cognitive Sciences you still

1179
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:10,980
have the idea that well

1180
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:15,000
organism organisms perceived by by

1181
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,480
describing the way the environment

1182
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:20,300
this is something that I think

1183
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:23,760
uh more traditional readings of

1184
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,460
predictive processing make uh be clear

1185
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:32,220
as in uh the idea that you're inferring

1186
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:35,400
about the the source of stimuli and not

1187
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:40,319
in uh and not and this is not I mean

1188
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,599
this is more easily amenable to the idea

1189
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:44,819
that the the brain or the cognitive

1190
00:54:44,819 --> 00:54:46,579
system knows that

1191
00:54:46,579 --> 00:54:49,740
the the world is so and so

1192
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:52,200
the environment is so and so instead of

1193
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,440
saying that the agenda system knows how

1194
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,780
to engage with the world and I believe

1195
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:58,980
the

1196
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:03,059
the the point that

1197
00:55:03,059 --> 00:55:05,700
an activists and uh ecological

1198
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:08,000
psychologists are trying to make is to

1199
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,020
and also working on the the predictive

1200
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:16,680
coding and the free energy principle

1201
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:20,700
Etc is to show that these Notions these

1202
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,980
Frameworks could be a minimal idea that

1203
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:26,040
the kubernetes system is knowing how to

1204
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,559
engage it knows how to engage in

1205
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,180
environment in a way it doesn't need to

1206
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:33,059
be read inboard summary

1207
00:55:33,059 --> 00:55:35,819
that the the Kindle system is inferring

1208
00:55:35,819 --> 00:55:39,300
that the world is so so I think this is

1209
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,119
one way of explaining but also uh

1210
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:46,380
philosophically if you have a large at

1211
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,059
the beginning of the the last few

1212
00:55:48,059 --> 00:55:51,599
decades uh a gigantic discussion about

1213
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:54,420
whether no Cloud could be reduced to

1214
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:57,720
know that and then again you have a

1215
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:01,339
background of this and other

1216
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,819
as an independent notion from you know

1217
00:56:05,819 --> 00:56:08,240
that and whether you could

1218
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:12,440
reduce one to the other and so forth so

1219
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:16,200
I think it doesn't stop there you cannot

1220
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,760
uh even though I can make a a claim for

1221
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,020
perceptional some other knowing how

1222
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:24,720
they're still the the background issue

1223
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,880
of whether know-how could be treated as

1224
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,020
and all that

1225
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:31,140
anyway this is something that I am also

1226
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:34,799
working on recently

1227
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,880
there's a lot to say there it's it's

1228
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,880
such an interesting idea especially with

1229
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:44,280
linguistic communication it's a little

1230
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,859
bit like the finger and the moon and

1231
00:56:46,859 --> 00:56:49,559
talking about the moon but the finger is

1232
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:52,079
only where it is and we're not talking

1233
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,059
about the pointer we're talking about

1234
00:56:54,059 --> 00:56:55,980
the reference

1235
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:59,700
and so to use

1236
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:03,619
a sociocognitive form of communication

1237
00:57:03,619 --> 00:57:07,079
in in cultured language

1238
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:12,900
or in written academic discourse to peer

1239
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:16,619
through that or to reimagine that and

1240
00:57:16,619 --> 00:57:19,500
see even what seems to be like the

1241
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,020
Pinnacle of know that

1242
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:27,079
and still see it as know how

1243
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:29,640
I guess the question there is

1244
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,280
how do we read papers

1245
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:36,300
yes of course yes I think it is uh it is

1246
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:37,859
a

1247
00:57:37,859 --> 00:57:40,859
uh it's yeah the values it seems to be

1248
00:57:40,859 --> 00:57:43,619
able to be a very big problem because if

1249
00:57:43,619 --> 00:57:46,260
we try to to treat these negative

1250
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:48,420
capacities as you mentioned as a matter

1251
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:49,619
of know-how

1252
00:57:49,619 --> 00:57:53,700
it seems that we still miss something

1253
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:57,420
about communication for instance and on

1254
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:59,339
the other hand I think and this is my

1255
00:57:59,339 --> 00:58:02,819
intuition but I think that we could in

1256
00:58:02,819 --> 00:58:05,460
principle talk about

1257
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:08,460
how

1258
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,180
understanding what you just said and

1259
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:15,180
trying to respond to it is a matter of

1260
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:18,359
knowing how to behave linguistically

1261
00:58:18,359 --> 00:58:23,220
but I think that even this movement

1262
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:26,400
to treat high levels of cognitionists

1263
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,980
which made it a matter of know-how it

1264
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:30,780
still leaves something out

1265
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:34,920
I am at I mean personally I am

1266
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:38,099
and pleased with it I think at some

1267
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:40,740
level we've got to say that well that is

1268
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:43,140
another kind of approach that is needed

1269
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:46,619
here to explain how we communicate for

1270
00:58:46,619 --> 00:58:47,819
instance in

1271
00:58:47,819 --> 00:58:50,400
very adequate not to say that it does

1272
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,579
not involve and now but it's not just

1273
00:58:53,579 --> 00:58:58,380
that I think that at least more than

1274
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:01,339
practical knowledge is needed

1275
00:59:01,339 --> 00:59:04,440
but maybe the key here is to think of

1276
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,960
practical knowledge just basic and

1277
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,260
necessary for other sorts of other other

1278
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:12,420
kinds of knowledge that they are needed

1279
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:16,020
to engage in this sort of Exchange

1280
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:19,319
maybe maybe the maybe this is one layer

1281
00:59:19,319 --> 00:59:20,940
I'm sure that

1282
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:22,700
well

1283
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:25,859
uh more has to be

1284
00:59:25,859 --> 00:59:28,160
said about this to given a more

1285
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:31,799
informative answer but this is a at

1286
00:59:31,799 --> 00:59:34,319
least my current position is that

1287
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:36,720
no how provides the basis of our

1288
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,119
engagement with the world and with

1289
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:42,540
others but at some juncture we have to

1290
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:45,599
to be able to develop other kinds of

1291
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:48,440
understanding to explain a very explain

1292
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:52,020
the complex sorts of uh exchanges we

1293
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:54,660
have in our daily lives

1294
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:57,960
such as reading papers as you said

1295
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:01,680
I I agree I think

1296
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:06,859
framing know that as the basis and then

1297
01:00:06,859 --> 01:00:10,799
recovering know how is a challenge and

1298
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:13,079
it's also a challenge to begin with the

1299
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:15,319
basal cognitive processes as being

1300
01:00:15,319 --> 01:00:20,160
enacted no house and to reassemble those

1301
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:23,040
know-how pieces into know that again

1302
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,740
it's not necessarily even a simple

1303
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:28,680
challenge but would we rather confront

1304
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:32,960
the challenge of assembling symbolic

1305
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:36,780
propositional declarative verbal

1306
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:40,319
Etc cognitive processes from a more

1307
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,480
liminal

1308
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,700
ecological cognitive approach

1309
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:49,140
or try to recover the ecological from

1310
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:52,200
the turing machine in a sense so it

1311
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:53,819
seems like

1312
01:00:53,819 --> 01:00:54,960
um

1313
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:57,660
you're speaking in support of grounding

1314
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:01,319
in ecological plausible basal cognitive

1315
01:01:01,319 --> 01:01:03,299
processes and then working towards

1316
01:01:03,299 --> 01:01:07,079
assembling the skyscraper

1317
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:09,480
yes yes yeah totally yeah I think it's

1318
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:10,940
well

1319
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:13,040
both uh

1320
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:17,520
those both approaches are difficult to

1321
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,020
to

1322
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:22,319
to assemble as you said to to to provide

1323
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:24,599
this uh sort of explanation either

1324
01:01:24,599 --> 01:01:27,839
bottom left or top down but I am more

1325
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:30,420
favorable of course to the the web

1326
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:33,299
approach I think it also for another

1327
01:01:33,299 --> 01:01:37,440
reason it it seems to the point of

1328
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,319
departure seems to be

1329
01:01:39,319 --> 01:01:42,299
a biological description of how we

1330
01:01:42,299 --> 01:01:44,640
interact with the world and the other

1331
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,319
way around it seems to be much more

1332
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:50,099
difficult to explain uh how we come up

1333
01:01:50,099 --> 01:01:52,920
with this uh biological questions such

1334
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:55,559
as our body morphology and such it seems

1335
01:01:55,559 --> 01:01:58,260
that we have to first account for that

1336
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:02,579
and then you we get to the the other

1337
01:02:02,579 --> 01:02:05,220
questions which are also hard to to

1338
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:08,819
answer but at the very least I I think

1339
01:02:08,819 --> 01:02:10,200
it's a

1340
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:13,619
the bottom up approach is more uh

1341
01:02:13,619 --> 01:02:15,960
integrative in a way is that the chances

1342
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:19,079
are it seems to be more

1343
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:21,900
uh in our favor in the sense

1344
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:24,180
and and the way you just kind of framed

1345
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:26,220
it made me think that if you were to

1346
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:29,579
program a computer from scratch

1347
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:32,220
it could be an abstract or a virtual

1348
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:34,559
computer so it doesn't even need to have

1349
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:36,720
a specific embodiment

1350
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:40,140
and in that situation one might be

1351
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:43,380
concerned with assembling

1352
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:47,099
know that assert that and assembling

1353
01:02:47,099 --> 01:02:48,799
these declarative

1354
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:52,859
statements and logic processes into

1355
01:02:52,859 --> 01:02:57,359
something that is more dynamical or in

1356
01:02:57,359 --> 01:02:59,880
interacting with the environment however

1357
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:02,339
that process of like full stack

1358
01:03:02,339 --> 01:03:03,900
engineering

1359
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:06,839
with logic and silicone at the base

1360
01:03:06,839 --> 01:03:11,040
is quite different from how we got here

1361
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,980
and so it might but it's it's

1362
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:15,660
complimentary

1363
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:18,119
um well you gave a little visibility

1364
01:03:18,119 --> 01:03:22,020
into uh I guess the before during and

1365
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:25,200
after of peer review so I was just

1366
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:28,319
curious what

1367
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:32,160
changed during and after the paper like

1368
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,200
over the last months or years or however

1369
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,599
long it was how did you evolve on this

1370
01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:39,900
and then what do you see as relevant

1371
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,780
next steps whether they're for you or

1372
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:44,640
just general to be done are we looking

1373
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:47,339
for a brain measurement are we looking

1374
01:03:47,339 --> 01:03:50,099
for a video camera in a forest are we

1375
01:03:50,099 --> 01:03:53,700
looking for a conceptual Advance what is

1376
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,339
going to move forward past your

1377
01:03:56,339 --> 01:03:58,040
developments

1378
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:01,680
that's that's a great question I think

1379
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:02,640
um

1380
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:06,540
I I'm not completely satisfied with the

1381
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:11,040
way I I'll use foreign level I don't

1382
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,319
know if this any of these would be

1383
01:04:13,319 --> 01:04:16,740
carried out in uh I honestly don't know

1384
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:19,079
if you could in principal carried out in

1385
01:04:19,079 --> 01:04:21,680
other empirical terms but

1386
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:26,099
uh I'm not saying that uh well

1387
01:04:26,099 --> 01:04:28,440
one is I would write it a bit

1388
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:31,260
differently today not that it's uh not

1389
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:32,880
that I disagree with the paper

1390
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:36,660
originally but I think I

1391
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:39,059
there's something some points that I

1392
01:04:39,059 --> 01:04:41,880
would like to reframe but they do not

1393
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:44,520
authorize uh either I think he had a new

1394
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,040
paper

1395
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:49,020
but maybe in the future but this is

1396
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:50,839
something that

1397
01:04:50,839 --> 01:04:52,920
the questions such as the myth have

1398
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,839
given which is still the philosophical

1399
01:04:54,839 --> 01:04:55,740
question

1400
01:04:55,740 --> 01:05:00,000
and conceptual one they still uh bother

1401
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,760
me but I have yet to

1402
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:05,819
to find the opportunity to develop these

1403
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:09,359
ideas more carefully and the the general

1404
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:12,660
view I put forth there I think I I think

1405
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:14,339
it still stands

1406
01:05:14,339 --> 01:05:16,319
uh but

1407
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:17,099
um

1408
01:05:17,099 --> 01:05:22,319
I would like I I still I'm waiting for

1409
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:24,780
this chance to elaborate it further and

1410
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:26,760
see how far I can get but I don't know

1411
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:29,280
yet I must admit I don't know what are

1412
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,680
the the future developments of this idea

1413
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:35,420
but um I've been working on several

1414
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:37,220
isolated

1415
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:40,140
issues on this approach

1416
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:42,359
for the last few years I've worked with

1417
01:05:42,359 --> 01:05:45,480
the notion of information and scientific

1418
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,760
understanding and information for

1419
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,799
ecological and an activists of

1420
01:05:49,799 --> 01:05:52,400
combination and recently I am working

1421
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:56,640
more recently with a few colleges on

1422
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,740
virtual reality and perception

1423
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:01,859
recognition so uh

1424
01:06:01,859 --> 01:06:05,940
this is how I like to to conduct my

1425
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:09,680
research to find interesting

1426
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:13,440
uh questions and see how how can I deal

1427
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,540
with them but not necessarily find

1428
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:16,700
myself

1429
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:20,099
uh tied to one

1430
01:06:20,099 --> 01:06:22,980
one line of reasoning that way so this

1431
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:24,480
is what happened at the time I was

1432
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,520
working with rationality if I thought it

1433
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:29,760
was a very cool subject and uh I still

1434
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,220
think it is but I haven't had the time

1435
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:34,619
to come back and reframe what I wanted

1436
01:06:34,619 --> 01:06:40,380
to but uh maybe maybe sometime in the

1437
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:43,680
near future I don't know but more the

1438
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,660
most recent thing I've been working on

1439
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:46,980
does not involved in cellular

1440
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:49,500
rationality but I think some products

1441
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:52,440
could be wrong which is that of a

1442
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,119
virtual reality and

1443
01:06:54,119 --> 01:06:57,180
how does uh visual reality actually

1444
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:59,520
compares to combination because

1445
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,460
well there's obviously something missing

1446
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:05,940
from a perseverance and a visual

1447
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:08,160
environment right

1448
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:12,119
um there is of course if I someone for

1449
01:07:12,119 --> 01:07:14,520
instance if if I'm on a visual

1450
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:17,339
environment where I am under a kind of

1451
01:07:17,339 --> 01:07:20,819
threat I may feel something analogous to

1452
01:07:20,819 --> 01:07:23,220
fear but I'm not really fearing for my

1453
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:24,119
life

1454
01:07:24,119 --> 01:07:27,059
and imagine that the person on the

1455
01:07:27,059 --> 01:07:29,760
virtual reality so is it rational to to

1456
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,260
run away from

1457
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:34,200
the the threat the virtual threat and so

1458
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:37,440
on so forth this is this the the this is

1459
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,900
what I'm working on and uh maybe it's it

1460
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:43,140
provides a point of return to this

1461
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:45,780
the idea of radical and active

1462
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:49,740
rationality and in fact uh the paper

1463
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:52,740
just got accepted so as I was telling

1464
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:55,140
you before I was so busy these last few

1465
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:57,599
days because we were correcting proofs

1466
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:01,880
my colleagues and I never figurative

1467
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:06,200
uh and I I was

1468
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:09,119
with a tight schedule too

1469
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:11,280
to submit the corrected version of the

1470
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,900
paper in the last few weeks and then I

1471
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:14,880
got the proofs and

1472
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,500
oh

1473
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:20,100
uh well maybe uh in the future I can

1474
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:22,020
come back to the issue of rationality

1475
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:24,420
I'd like to but I don't know if I I

1476
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:26,460
don't know I I really can't foresee the

1477
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:29,160
developments of that but uh in general I

1478
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:31,738
still agree with my original idea but

1479
01:08:31,738 --> 01:08:36,060
I'll frame it differently a little bit

1480
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:39,479
so the VR point I'm sure that there's a

1481
01:08:39,479 --> 01:08:43,859
lot more to say there but it reminded me

1482
01:08:43,859 --> 01:08:47,640
of just the title virtual reality it's a

1483
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:50,100
virtualization and so in the same way

1484
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:51,420
that

1485
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:53,939
cognitive action planning

1486
01:08:53,939 --> 01:08:56,880
allows us to entertain

1487
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:00,120
policies that our body doesn't take

1488
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:02,040
if only to evaluate them and choose

1489
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:04,620
against them but we can go on a flight

1490
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:08,100
of fancy have a Whimsical policy

1491
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,600
selection process

1492
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,759
of counterfactuals

1493
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:13,080
mentally

1494
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:15,660
but then our morphology is kind of like

1495
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:17,339
our Lifeline you know if you actually

1496
01:09:17,339 --> 01:09:19,859
fall off a ledge then it's going to hurt

1497
01:09:19,859 --> 01:09:23,819
and then in virtual reality

1498
01:09:23,819 --> 01:09:26,460
you're embodied

1499
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:29,819
perceptual experience is quite literally

1500
01:09:29,819 --> 01:09:32,399
a virtualization of

1501
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:36,060
survival critical situations so you

1502
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:37,979
might see yourself as being on a ledge

1503
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:40,560
but you're on a flat floor

1504
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,080
and then in that situation

1505
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:45,660
if you're kind of

1506
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:48,000
um a cognitive Observer outside of the

1507
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,520
video game you might say well it's

1508
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,439
rational for me just to fall off to see

1509
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:53,580
what happens

1510
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:55,620
so that's like but then there's a layer

1511
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:58,920
of rationality within the space yes like

1512
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:02,400
what's a good move in the game

1513
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,920
um and so it's kind of blurring the line

1514
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:05,630
between

1515
01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:07,260
[Music]

1516
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:11,280
it's it's blurring the criticality of

1517
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:15,000
the body and um

1518
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,380
I'm sure you've thought about this much

1519
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:18,120
more so how does this play into our

1520
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:19,620
virtual reality

1521
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:21,120
um with the ways we think about and use

1522
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:23,340
and design these systems

1523
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:25,739
well this is the the the the the the

1524
01:10:25,739 --> 01:10:28,440
questions that motivated us to write a

1525
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:31,860
paper and uh NADA give them and I was

1526
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:34,620
that in the technical literature you see

1527
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:37,020
that a lot of researchers working with

1528
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:39,719
the uh treat uh visual perception as

1529
01:10:39,719 --> 01:10:43,860
illustri a kind of Illusion but we were

1530
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:45,960
a bit bothered by that because on the

1531
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:48,239
other hand it only works in VR because

1532
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:52,320
we we embodied the devices devices they

1533
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,900
work for us you have the controllers you

1534
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:57,560
have the the headset

1535
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:02,460
and uh it seems so weird to say that the

1536
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:05,040
user the the user is under a kind of

1537
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,659
Illusion

1538
01:11:06,659 --> 01:11:10,020
and on the other hand it seems that it's

1539
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:12,600
not actually cognition because as you

1540
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:15,920
said there is no there is no biological

1541
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:20,219
uh relevance to those uh cognitive

1542
01:11:20,219 --> 01:11:23,100
States so to speak for instance if I see

1543
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:26,580
an apple in VR it's it does not afford

1544
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:29,640
nourishing but it makes sense within the

1545
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:33,300
game right but the different uh well

1546
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:36,540
well I've received an apple in a in an

1547
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:38,880
actual environment it is it affords

1548
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:41,460
nourishment it is something I can eat

1549
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:45,120
but not in VR I can pretend to so we

1550
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:48,600
coined this uh concept of allusion to

1551
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:49,739
its plane

1552
01:11:49,739 --> 01:11:52,800
uh it is as if we were

1553
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,280
facing an actual animal but it involves

1554
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:58,679
also this volition of play this idea

1555
01:11:58,679 --> 01:12:00,980
that we are not

1556
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:04,199
being misled because we put on the

1557
01:12:04,199 --> 01:12:07,380
equipment we know we are in the game and

1558
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:09,540
this I think is a hot subject right now

1559
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:12,780
because there's metaphors and I am very

1560
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:15,020
skeptical of whatever

1561
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:19,199
that can people are very optimistic but

1562
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:21,659
about the possibilities of the metaverse

1563
01:12:21,659 --> 01:12:23,880
and some authors really think that we

1564
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,440
could be in a simulation in this

1565
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:28,980
strictly speaking but I mean the best

1566
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:31,260
technology the current technology shows

1567
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:34,380
us is that it's very limited and you can

1568
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:36,659
pretend to be in a certain environment

1569
01:12:36,659 --> 01:12:39,900
and so forth and this I think may offer

1570
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:43,800
a new new ways of thinking of

1571
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:45,719
thinking about rationality in this

1572
01:12:45,719 --> 01:12:48,120
visual environment in ways that maybe

1573
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,920
Russians do something that environment

1574
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,900
has said to jump off the ledge and see

1575
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:55,699
what happens and on the other hand

1576
01:12:55,699 --> 01:12:58,739
behavioral aspects of doing so sometimes

1577
01:12:58,739 --> 01:13:01,260
people actually feel fear and people

1578
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:04,199
face the street for phobias with virtual

1579
01:13:04,199 --> 01:13:05,280
realities

1580
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:06,600
and

1581
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:09,060
um it's it's a lot of there's a lot of

1582
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:12,199
interesting questions there that

1583
01:13:12,199 --> 01:13:15,900
maybe I mean for future research we can

1584
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:18,780
yeah back to it it made me think about

1585
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:21,900
how the Apple in real life it could be

1586
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:23,820
calories for you but also it could be

1587
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:26,699
calories for a fly it could be thrown

1588
01:13:26,699 --> 01:13:28,679
you could use it as a hammer you could

1589
01:13:28,679 --> 01:13:30,300
paint it right so

1590
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:33,659
ecology and the generative process as

1591
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:36,600
we'd say an active inference kind of

1592
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:39,780
is always going Beyond

1593
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:42,719
whatever affordances were programmed in

1594
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:46,560
for a given object and then also

1595
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:49,739
um the current discourse on VR focuses

1596
01:13:49,739 --> 01:13:52,140
heavily on headsets

1597
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:54,300
just speaking totally anecdotally not

1598
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:56,640
not my expert area

1599
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,040
um it seems a little bit interesting

1600
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:00,780
it's like as if the mobile phone

1601
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:03,120
discussion was only focused on

1602
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:06,120
rectangles of a certain size

1603
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:10,080
what makes this not virtual reality it's

1604
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,940
like looking through a window and

1605
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:14,880
there's another fellow to speak with so

1606
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,440
it's not attached to my head it doesn't

1607
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:19,140
have some of the motion tracking

1608
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:22,380
um capacities that some technologies

1609
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:25,860
have but it is

1610
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:28,140
a niche modification in Perry personal

1611
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:29,100
space

1612
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:31,380
and we can push

1613
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:35,040
signals and affordances to each other

1614
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:40,199
so having a VR framing or really just a

1615
01:14:40,199 --> 01:14:43,560
framing of rationality and perception

1616
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:45,840
cognition action Cycles

1617
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,219
that

1618
01:14:47,219 --> 01:14:51,120
aren't just constrained to one specific

1619
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:54,900
realization or Hardware type and can run

1620
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:58,080
the gamut from Total offline

1621
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,179
person in a field

1622
01:15:00,179 --> 01:15:03,420
to somebody who's very

1623
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:05,699
in The Matrix

1624
01:15:05,699 --> 01:15:07,679
seems pretty relevant otherwise new

1625
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:09,900
technologies even little variants and

1626
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:12,360
software updates will continue to just

1627
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:16,159
infinitely surprise and confuse

1628
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,739
yeah I think it's a it's a it's hard to

1629
01:15:19,739 --> 01:15:22,580
define the the boundaries

1630
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:26,820
I mean we are here uh in an exchange

1631
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:29,760
which I think it could increase but be

1632
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,620
classified as a form of virtual reality

1633
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:33,540
of course I'm seeing you ruin your C

1634
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:34,820
mind but

1635
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:39,480
uh I mean most I think works out they

1636
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:42,840
nowadays they they find it a doc by

1637
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:45,300
saying that well must have a headset and

1638
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:48,179
sometimes a controller but but other

1639
01:15:48,179 --> 01:15:50,040
than that sounds virtual reality but

1640
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:52,739
yeah it's hard to Define anything uh

1641
01:15:52,739 --> 01:15:55,320
it's not it's not a dump and

1642
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:56,880
straightforward that's one of the things

1643
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:01,020
because on uh talking commercially of

1644
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:03,420
course virtual reality means headsets

1645
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:07,140
and and other paraphernalia but but a

1646
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:09,480
phone just talking on the phone or a

1647
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:12,600
telegraph in that time it would have

1648
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:15,360
been on that interface with that sensory

1649
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:18,239
modality and with those affordances it

1650
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:20,880
is the virtualization

1651
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:23,400
yeah that we have access to of just a

1652
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,800
different chapter today

1653
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:28,020
yeah I think so yes part of our paper

1654
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:31,560
was to argue that in a way embodying

1655
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:34,140
technological devices is obviously in

1656
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:37,080
the need not that's not new it is the

1657
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:38,640
mark of Being Human

1658
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,560
it's embodying technological devices

1659
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:44,580
what made us what we are since the

1660
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:48,320
beginning using analytic technology and

1661
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:51,360
the fact that we can embody it so

1662
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:54,420
proficiently a device even if it is

1663
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:59,159
programmed to for instance uh in within

1664
01:16:59,159 --> 01:17:01,679
virtual reality to have something a

1665
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:05,040
creature you control us richer with new

1666
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,620
morphology another morphology for

1667
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:09,840
instance even if that's the case it only

1668
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,060
happens so proficiently because we are

1669
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:14,100
able to embody the device some

1670
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:16,800
experiments have shown that you can map

1671
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:20,640
for instance a Twist of your wrist to a

1672
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,159
third arm

1673
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:25,679
uh that individual reality goes from was

1674
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:28,739
that from your chest and people can

1675
01:17:28,739 --> 01:17:31,320
learn to control this third arm that

1676
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:33,179
doesn't map into our actual morphology

1677
01:17:33,179 --> 01:17:37,500
but it can be made so by a Twist of the

1678
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:38,640
wrist so

1679
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,380
this is something we will discussed in

1680
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:42,840
our paper that well you can

1681
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:45,420
you can only do that because you embody

1682
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:48,300
the device you can see it's an illusion

1683
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:50,940
it's actually well

1684
01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:54,000
part of what me is being human is to

1685
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,540
embroidery technological devices so

1686
01:17:56,540 --> 01:18:01,140
I would go that way I mean I know it

1687
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:02,820
blurs the distinction between virtual

1688
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:05,699
and non-virtual buds I think that's one

1689
01:18:05,699 --> 01:18:08,820
way of dealing with this

1690
01:18:08,820 --> 01:18:11,100
cool is there anything else you want to

1691
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:14,760
talk about ask or just kind of Prelude

1692
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:17,640
ah well I I'd like to thank you for the

1693
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:19,800
opportunity to discuss this paper it was

1694
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,199
very nice for me I I really enjoyed it

1695
01:18:22,199 --> 01:18:25,440
and this is uh very nice and uh

1696
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,659
comfortable environment to discuss these

1697
01:18:27,659 --> 01:18:30,380
issues and think thank you once again

1698
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:34,080
thank you yeah awesome discussion and

1699
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,239
important topics and we'll be happy to

1700
01:18:36,239 --> 01:18:38,699
talk to you again anytime

1701
01:18:38,699 --> 01:18:43,339
okay thank you farewell thank you
