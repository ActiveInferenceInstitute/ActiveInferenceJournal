00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,840
hello and welcome to the active

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,920
inference lab it's actin flab live

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,480
stream number 28.0

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,880
on september 6 2021

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,920
we're going to be talking about the

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,439
paper towards a computational

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,760
phenomenology of mental action modeling

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,519
meta awareness and attentional control

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,439
with deep parametric active inference

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,760
welcome to the active inference lab we

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,679
are a participatory online lab that is

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,600
communicating learning and practicing

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,680
applied active inference you can find us

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,520
at the links on this page

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,360
this is a recorded and archived live

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,800
stream so please provide us with

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,320
feedback so that we can improve on our

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,280
work

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,800
all backgrounds and perspectives are

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,280
welcome here and we'll be following good

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,280
video etiquette for live streams

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,760
thanks a ton blue and steven and dean

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,800
nice

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,120
fun to have a zero crew

25
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,519
together

26
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,680
here you'll see a slightly updated

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,039
version of the upcoming streams calendar

28
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,799
which you can get at from this short

29
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,240
link here

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,479
uh september 7th and 14th we're going to

31
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,720
be discussing this paper

32
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,640
we're going to be discussing in this one

33
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,560
and then we don't have a paper for 29

34
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,320
and then we have some papers set with

35
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,759
authors for

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,360
all of october

37
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,720
also check out the tabs to see other

38
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,400
series other than the tuesday paper

39
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,840
centric walkthroughs and of course

40
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,439
anyone's welcome to

41
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,320
co-organize an event or to be the guest

42
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,920
for one of these

43
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,840
types of streams

44
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,880
all right so today in 28.0 we're going

45
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,560
to be just learning and discussing this

46
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,799
paper that was already mentioned

47
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,159
by sandvik smith hesp mataut fristen

48
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,240
lutz and ramstead

49
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,159
out only a few weeks ago which is kind

50
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,680
of cool to see

51
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,119
and there's going to be a time to talk

52
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,200
about it's a super interesting

53
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,200
paper and if you want to participate in

54
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,560
28.1 or two you should get in touch

55
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,960
otherwise if it's after that time then

56
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,880
check out those videos and maybe find

57
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,560
another one to participate in

58
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,040
but i'm just looking forward to

59
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,758
hearing what you all were excited about

60
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,160
by way of introduction just

61
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,440
want to hear from everybody and what was

62
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,680
exciting to them about this paper or

63
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,800
made them want to join for the dot zero

64
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,480
um if i go first uh daniel yeah thanks

65
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,360
um

66
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,680
i'm really excited to or interested to

67
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,519
see them moving

68
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,040
beyond a computational approach to neuro

69
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,680
phenomenology which i've seen before

70
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,000
and into this broader idea of

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
what they're calling computational

72
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,120
phenomenology which

73
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,239
wears a bolder claim and has more

74
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,480
relevance potentially to other

75
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,040
applications which i'm interested in

76
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,800
and applied active inference context so

77
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,319
you know we'll see how

78
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,560
that bold claim can be uh

79
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,120
applied

80
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,879
nice

81
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,040
okay

82
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,040
so for me i thought it was like ultra

83
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,480
meta

84
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,640
um the paper really got into the

85
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,280
hierarchical um levels of organization

86
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,120
which i'm always excited to see and talk

87
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,120
about

88
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,080
uh for me

89
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,080
it was the fact that i am doing some

90
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,319
writing right now and i

91
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,360
am interested in the idea that there is

92
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,879
a way of

93
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,799
putting this into some sort of a

94
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,040
geometric relationship as well as the

95
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,959
computational relationship

96
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,319
cool

97
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,360
okay uh

98
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,560
the paper is let me just re-frame it is

99
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,480
towards computational phenomenology of

100
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,640
mental action modeling meta awareness

101
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,159
and attentional control with deep

102
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,400
parametric active inference

103
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,920
in neuroscience of consciousness

104
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,040
published um about two weeks ago 27th of

105
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,120
august

106
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,920
does someone want to read the three aims

107
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,399
of the paper

108
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,439
sure i'll go ahead

109
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,319
the three aims are to explicitly model

110
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,080
meta awareness

111
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,080
to account for the computational

112
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,238
consequences of meta awareness on

113
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,279
cognitive control and lastly to provide

114
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,839
a computational account of mental covert

115
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,160
action

116
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,199
okay

117
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,560
and then maybe the second part

118
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,600
sure

119
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,520
formally speaking the crucial thing to

120
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,600
note about these cognitive processes is

121
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,400
that they are about other such processes

122
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,840
the deployment and control of

123
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,759
attentional states and processes for

124
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,080
instance are quintessentially a higher

125
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,919
level ability

126
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,240
such states and processes monitor and

127
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,880
monitor and modulate other typically

128
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,680
lower level perceptual states third

129
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,919
order higher level processes in turn

130
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,240
oversee these attentional processes we

131
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,919
can be aware of our attention being

132
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,759
grabbed and make a deliberate decision

133
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,919
to focus our attention elsewhere it

134
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,440
would seem then that effective

135
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,680
self-regulation of attention depends on

136
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,840
the ability to access evaluate and

137
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,759
control the quality of these attentional

138
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,000
processes themselves in the same way

139
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,160
that attentional processes are necessary

140
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,039
to consciously access assess and control

141
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,240
lower level perceptual states

142
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,680
interesting areas

143
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,120
it's just interesting to see that the

144
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,840
kind of framework that helps a robot

145
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,520
navigate

146
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,039
now it's being used in a little bit of a

147
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,639
different way like nesting within

148
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,080
ourself and coming closer to our

149
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,280
experience

150
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,360
and other things which often are said to

151
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,639
be unable to be directly observed

152
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,240
so it's quite a cool topic

153
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,199
uh dean or stephen any thoughts or do

154
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,320
either of you want to read the first

155
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,160
abstract

156
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,759
i got a quick thought before we get to

157
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,680
the abstract um

158
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,240
in the introduction of the paper

159
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,160
the i just wanted to read this really

160
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,000
quickly it's in the paper but

161
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,759
computational terms the central place of

162
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,759
confidence and reliability and effective

163
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,199
self-regulation

164
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,000
speaks to the key role of precision

165
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,560
or inverse variants of implicit beliefs

166
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,319
and then they talk about probabilistic

167
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,840
and posterior-based beliefs that

168
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,400
describe a probability distribution

169
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,960
over some latent quality

170
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,160
but this was the thing that i found

171
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,600
really interesting bayesian beliefs

172
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,600
about bayesian beliefs can in certain

173
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,800
situations become propositional

174
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,400
and the way that they are estimated

175
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
optimized and controlled

176
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,720
precisions in a nutshell

177
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,560
quantify our confidence and our beliefs

178
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,960
say how confident we are about what we

179
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,680
know

180
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,639
about states of the world about their

181
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,639
relationship to our observations or

182
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,240
about how these states change over time

183
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,199
being able to place numbers around that

184
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,199
as soon as i read that and

185
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,319
and saw it in relationship to

186
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,240
a proposition i found that really

187
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,080
interesting and one it was really

188
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,400
curious to see now so how is that thread

189
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,720
gonna play out

190
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,080
now it wasn't that wasn't part of the

191
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,759
three things that were in in the

192
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,680
previous slide but i think it was really

193
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,039
important and

194
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,960
something that was

195
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,720
it has to be a name or a claim of the

196
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,960
paper because it's pretty fascinating

197
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,280
good call it's almost like a background

198
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,560
assumption whether uh post hoc justified

199
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,960
by empirical appeal or not that

200
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,280
precision is what matters which is kind

201
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,880
of the other side of the coin from

202
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,199
uncertainty like high precision means

203
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,280
low uncertainty and vice versa and

204
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,280
sometimes they're framed as so i think

205
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,360
totally agree that is a claim of paper

206
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,120
okay

207
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,720
stephen want to go for abstract one

208
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,560
[Music]

209
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,039
okay meta awareness refers to the

210
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,560
capacity

211
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,280
to explicitly notice the current content

212
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,800
of consciousness

213
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,560
and has been identified as a key

214
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,199
component for the successful control of

215
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,800
cognitive states

216
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,639
such as the deliberative direction of

217
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,720
attention

218
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,840
this paper proposes a formal model of

219
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,120
meta awareness and attentional control

220
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,520
using hierarchical active inference

221
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,039
to do so

222
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,360
we cast mental action

223
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,400
as policy selection over higher level

224
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,960
cognitive states

225
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,080
and at a further hierarchical level

226
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,200
to model meta awareness states

227
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,958
that modulate

228
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,958
the expected confidence or precision

229
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,160
in the mapping between observations and

230
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,279
hidden cognitive states

231
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,640
nice

232
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,880
yeah there's a lot of

233
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,720
terms some of which we're gonna go into

234
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,839
in the keyword section but pretty

235
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,440
distilled down

236
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,279
description of their contribution and

237
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,360
we're gonna unpack it more

238
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,560
okay

239
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,920
abstract two

240
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,080
uh we simulate the example of mind

241
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,240
wandering and its regulation during a

242
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,320
task involving sustained

243
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,839
selective attention on a perceptual

244
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:14,880
object

245
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,279
this provides a computational case study

246
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,519
for an inferential architecture that is

247
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,440
apt to enable the emergence of these

248
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,800
central components of human

249
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,240
phenomenology

250
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,560
namely the ability to access and control

251
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,320
cognitive states

252
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,000
we propose that this approach can be

253
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,080
generalized to other cognitive states

254
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,480
and hence this paper provides the first

255
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,160
steps towards the development of a

256
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,320
computational phenomenology of mental

257
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,640
action and more broadly of our ability

258
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,959
to monitor and control our own cognitive

259
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,720
states

260
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,399
future steps of this work will focus on

261
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,320
fitting the model with qualitative

262
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,399
behavioral and neural data

263
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,240
okay

264
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,360
cool topics any thoughts or we can move

265
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,399
on

266
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,640
first first steps that's the emphasis

267
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,839
here just first steps

268
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,160
yep i'm pretty excited to get to this um

269
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,480
the generalized model of mental action

270
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,000
because it's like

271
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,040
um

272
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,680
almost like the new tool enables asking

273
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,920
about phenomena that we already know and

274
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,640
then it reveals a whole new state space

275
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,360
of

276
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,519
kind of then the model feeding back to

277
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,279
the kinds of regimes of attention that

278
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,360
we design for ourself or niche

279
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,800
modifications or information inputs

280
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,079
okay

281
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,279
roadmap

282
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,360
so this paper

283
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,040
has an interesting

284
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,839
layout it is just an introduction

285
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,920
that brings up the non-active inference

286
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,000
sections related to

287
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,760
the scientific study of mental action

288
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,440
and about how it's been computationally

289
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,600
modeled outside of active inference

290
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,320
then there's a methodology paper

291
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,399
that first has more of a model building

292
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,360
uh

293
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,560
narrative

294
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,279
and then the empirical results from a

295
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,560
simulation

296
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,519
that has a few different layers of

297
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:01,770
um

298
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:02,959
[Music]

299
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,600
detail layered on it it's not just one

300
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,360
single model there's a few

301
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,600
little variants that help

302
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,120
get out which parts the model are

303
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,680
contributing which behavior and why

304
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,240
then they have a more general discussion

305
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,040
and

306
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,200
give some directions for future research

307
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,720
and that's where some of these big

308
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,440
claims about computational phenomenology

309
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,320
go

310
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,720
and then there's a conclusion so

311
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,839
any thoughts on the roadmap

312
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,519
yeah i was gonna i think that this gives

313
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,000
a good sense of

314
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,519
the way that they're trying to enter

315
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,640
into this space looking at the

316
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,399
opacity and transparency of

317
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,880
phenomenology and uh

318
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,240
trying to

319
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,920
sort of bring back

320
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,480
that neuro phenomenology

321
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,480
into this wider phenomenology

322
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,720
uh so by by sort of looking at the

323
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,160
experience now

324
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,920
the question that sort of sort of comes

325
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,079
up with this is

326
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,920
because obviously a lot of the work here

327
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,000
with um

328
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,720
ramstead and others has been around

329
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,120
in body cognition and stuff like that so

330
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,680
they're sort of going into this idea of

331
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,360
trying to set it up so that they can

332
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,480
target

333
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,399
phenomenology while still keeping it

334
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,200
around mental states and cognition so

335
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,600
there's an interest in

336
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,480
uh i don't know ontological dance

337
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,920
they're trying to find a way through

338
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,880
here which i think is kind of

339
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,360
interesting

340
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,360
any other comments on the roadmap

341
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,880
okay

342
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,120
so the keywords were free energy

343
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,560
principle active inference

344
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,160
neurophenomenology metacognition

345
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,480
opacity transparency

346
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,120
focused attention mind wandering and

347
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,480
mindfulness

348
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,200
so perhaps blue with fvp

349
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,079
sure this slide i pulled out of the live

350
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,480
stream 15.0

351
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,720
so the free energy principle is based on

352
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,360
three aspects the observation of self

353
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,760
organization which brings us to the

354
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,600
second aspect which is that living

355
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,320
organisms can be described as stochastic

356
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,519
dynamical systems possessing attractors

357
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,639
and then lastly the states in which the

358
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:18,160
self-organizing system is at a point in

359
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,839
time can be identified by the

360
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,160
interactive role they play within the

361
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,600
multi-level self-organization scheme

362
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,560
and then this is related to

363
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,920
in the slide from 14.0 multi-scale

364
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,839
systems

365
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,920
ensembles info thermodynamics and

366
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,560
variational bayesian inference

367
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,240
which i thought was applicable here as

368
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,079
we're going through this hierarchical

369
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,360
awareness meta awareness

370
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,240
cool it yeah stephen and then i'll have

371
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,399
to die yeah well yeah i think this is

372
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,440
good

373
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,839
good to characterize this and also

374
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,920
i know that um

375
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,000
maxwell mentioned how that

376
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,079
multi-level graph he's kind of gone back

377
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,959
on it a bit but it does show that whole

378
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,040
question is a really good diagram to

379
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,360
show both that there is this multi-level

380
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,480
nested

381
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,480
sort of multi-scale thing going on and

382
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,320
also it's kind of a contested it's a

383
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,880
contested kind of evolving part of the

384
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,199
whole field because it's uh people are

385
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,639
sort of putting out things and then

386
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,399
they're maybe backtracking a little bit

387
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,639
and so i think um

388
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,320
yeah i think it's quite a good thing to

389
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,560
bring up

390
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,279
definitely uh not a settled area that's

391
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,199
why it's so fun to just have these

392
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,880
discussions on the topic because even

393
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,639
the paper is not

394
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,480
the end result it was first steps

395
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,360
and

396
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,120
we're going to see

397
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,519
in this discussion the multi-scale

398
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,959
system is almost like

399
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,360
psychologically nested or mentally

400
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,320
nested

401
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,720
within one agent whereas previously

402
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,760
we've been talking a lot about

403
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,480
multi-scale systems in the context of

404
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,920
you know a bunch of ants making the

405
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,519
colony a bunch of communicating

406
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,680
individuals making the community so it's

407
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,279
like that's like

408
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,959
multi-scale systems out and getting

409
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,760
spatially bigger and this is

410
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,639
kind of getting more ephemeral but also

411
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,959
having this very interesting influence

412
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,479
on the lower level models

413
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,279
so for active inference the key word we

414
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,519
can look at what the authors wrote

415
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,800
because

416
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,160
it's always cool to see just how did

417
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,519
they define this

418
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,880
how did they frame what active inference

419
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,480
inferences for this paper

420
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,880
and they wrote that at the root of these

421
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,519
advances is a biologically plausible

422
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,360
neurocognitive and behavioral modeling

423
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,440
framework called active inference

424
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,120
active inference provides us with a

425
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,320
bayesian mechanics that is the mechanics

426
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,480
of knowledge driven action and active

427
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,839
prep perception

428
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,680
which explains from first principles how

429
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,600
autonomous agents can thrive within

430
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,160
their ever-changing environments

431
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,680
active inference descends from and is

432
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,120
closely related to bayesian brain theory

433
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,880
and predictive coding

434
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,639
and then this green one i thought was

435
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,440
very interesting in how they said it was

436
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,279
active inference cast perception

437
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,839
learning and action as essentially being

438
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,920
in the same game that of gathering

439
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,759
evidence for the model that underwrites

440
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,079
the existence of the agent

441
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,560
so just on the diagram that we've seen

442
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,759
with the

443
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,600
four different kinds of nodes with the

444
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,160
blanket states of in and out going in

445
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,399
the internal and external states like

446
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,320
to say that the three that constitute

447
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,800
the organism let's say are all in the

448
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,079
same game

449
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,800
just bring sort of a unity of action and

450
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,160
inference

451
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,920
to

452
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,759
how we think about the very least other

453
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,519
systems that already have this structure

454
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,519
like input output systems

455
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,759
which some people speculate describe

456
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,160
all classes of systems or computational

457
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,639
systems so it's just like the way that

458
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,600
they

459
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,360
made that clear of active inference

460
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,040
without tying it to a specific model

461
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,120
implementation i thought was very well

462
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,920
said stephen

463
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,320
and also this does give a flexibility as

464
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,880
knowledge evolves

465
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,919
because as mark soames has been talking

466
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,640
about the the way attention may be

467
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,160
moved around more at the base of the

468
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,119
brain in it using more kind of

469
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,520
attentional biological

470
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,919
you know inactive questions that

471
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,000
wouldn't necessarily be a problem for

472
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,799
this because this this modeling

473
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,839
isn't completely tied to some sort of

474
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,720
frontal cortex model of thought it's

475
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,360
kind of it's broader so i think that's

476
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,440
that's quite interesting and to see how

477
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,320
they're

478
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,160
called using the term behavioral

479
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,960
modeling they framework and they sort of

480
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,320
yeah the way they positioned it because

481
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,440
they haven't gone the whole way and

482
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,799
talked about

483
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,120
biological and gone down the full

484
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,280
multi-scale biology route they've kept

485
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,799
it kind of in the brain but they've

486
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,760
brought in that behavioral element

487
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,840
which i think neurophenomenology maybe

488
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,160
doesn't do as much

489
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,080
good segway

490
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,360
blue want to describe this one

491
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,160
sure so neurophenomenology in the words

492
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,720
of the authors

493
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,919
neurophenomenology has been described as

494
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,160
the search for generative passages

495
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,919
between the neurobiological

496
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,400
phenomenological and mathematical levels

497
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,320
of description going beyond the

498
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,240
description of mirror isomorphisms

499
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,480
between these levels toward mutual

500
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,679
epistemological and methodological

501
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:24,640
methodological accountability and

502
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,440
cross-fertilization

503
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,320
neurophenomenology aims to bridge the

504
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,480
gap between these kinds of data via the

505
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,880
formal metaphysically neutral levels of

506
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,880
the description provided by mathematics

507
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,360
and computational work and i pulled this

508
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,039
cartoon out of this paper because i

509
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,559
thought it was kind of a neat um

510
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,160
perspective and visual under

511
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,080
phenomenology so it talks about the

512
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,559
biological structures as like

513
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,000
pre-determining the world of the

514
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,720
organism and then neurophenomenology as

515
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,640
a proxies between the first person

516
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,840
account of the the organism has and the

517
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,799
neural descriptions of these structures

518
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,880
so that that was a kind of the point of

519
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,240
this

520
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,760
nice find

521
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,080
very interesting figure looks kind of

522
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,919
like a sci-fi

523
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:08,840
human

524
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,559
novel but it's kind of cool

525
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,039
okay um

526
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,799
to talk about one specific kind of

527
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:20,160
neurophenomenology like a first person

528
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,400
experience that is desired to be modeled

529
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,160
potentially even in a computational

530
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,760
direction

531
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,080
here they're focusing on this

532
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,640
metacognition aspect

533
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,480
so just the yellow parts they wrote

534
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,120
redefine meta awareness in this context

535
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,840
as the ability to

536
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,440
explicitly notice the current content of

537
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,160
a conscious episode for our purposes as

538
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,640
discussed in the text we define states

539
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,280
of meta awareness as those third order

540
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,200
which we'll get to states of the system

541
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,320
that are about and enable the opacity of

542
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,120
second order attentional states

543
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,799
metacognitive states thus function

544
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,960
analogously to attentional states which

545
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,799
enable the opacity of first order

546
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,240
perceptual states

547
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,559
so it's going to be a three layer

548
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,039
nesting doll the role that the second

549
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,640
model plays over the first is going to

550
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,320
be analogous to the role that the third

551
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,240
model plays over the second but that

552
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,440
doesn't mean its dynamics are going to

553
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,600
play out in the exact same way

554
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,159
and then this last part

555
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,960
was very interesting like mental action

556
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,880
refers to goal-directed internal

557
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,200
behavior without necessarily having a

558
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,039
direct consequence on the external

559
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,679
environment e.g as though muscular

560
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:30,559
action

561
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,640
a paradomatic example of mental action

562
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,880
is covert attention

563
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,679
so

564
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,200
what an interesting

565
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,440
topic you know the whole think of x or

566
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,600
don't think of x i won't play any

567
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,600
language games on the live stream but

568
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,000
many of those exist and they have to do

569
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,559
with inducing mental action so that's

570
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,480
just so interesting that that's what

571
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,080
this framework is going to be exploring

572
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,440
okay

573
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,840
stephen go for it

574
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,080
yeah and without you know putting too

575
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,080
much pressure on the paper to go further

576
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,200
but is it that question of

577
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,000
skill performance and the phenomenology

578
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,640
of being in the flow or being in

579
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,640
a state of sense making

580
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,960
it'd be interesting how that

581
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,280
neurobiological phenomenology

582
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,520
phenomenological passages

583
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,240
um can extend out into some of that kind

584
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,240
of work um

585
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,640
which is obviously highly complex but uh

586
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,200
them you know this might give us clues

587
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,640
so that's good

588
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,120
yep cool and then oh this is just i

589
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,520
found this link uh trailblazing ants

590
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,360
show hints of metacognition when seeking

591
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,559
food

592
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,159
and um

593
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,240
recent research has shown that bees when

594
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,000
faced with a difficult task simply opt

595
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,840
out of doing it a behavior that may be

596
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,080
interpreted as a form of metacognition

597
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,080
at least computationally

598
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,159
now it seems that ants might be capable

599
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,400
of a similar mental fee despite

600
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,240
their tiny simple brain

601
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,960
so

602
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,679
it's like what computational attributes

603
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,159
are we going to assign to oh but that's

604
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,280
just how bark is or that's just how ants

605
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,080
are versus this variable is the one that

606
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,480
we're experiencing because of this

607
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,480
so that's just kind of a topic that's

608
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,760
going to come up

609
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,600
probably multiple times okay

610
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,919
how about transparency and opacity what

611
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,159
does it mean in someone's words or

612
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,280
reading

613
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,280
here

614
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,919
all right can i bring out a little

615
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,280
different angle to it i mean i

616
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,400
understand that

617
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,240
how the contrast of transparency and

618
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,799
opacity works but

619
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,240
when i was bringing when i was trying to

620
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,919
figure this out to help somebody who was

621
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,159
walking into a situation

622
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,720
oriented to a lot of the data around

623
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,559
them that they would otherwise be

624
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,159
overwhelmed with one of the things we

625
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,400
talked about was the difference between

626
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,400
liminality and just getting a

627
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,480
generalized sense of the orientation

628
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,520
space

629
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,600
and then limitality sort of filling in

630
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,600
the details and getting and

631
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,919
understanding where the edges are so

632
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,360
that you don't bump into them and hurt

633
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,320
yourself

634
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,159
and so i get the

635
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,720
transparency and opacity piece and how

636
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,720
it's explained in the paper but for a

637
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,000
person who's trying to move from the

638
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,559
generalized to the more specific

639
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,919
um

640
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,080
i think

641
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,960
i think it's it's it's the opacity piece

642
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,880
speaks clearly to the difference between

643
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,799
that and what something that's clear

644
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,120
but i also think that the details get

645
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,799
filled in when you can have

646
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,480
an understanding what the limits are and

647
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,600
not just

648
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,760
limitly understand that it's now in your

649
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,000
in your field of awareness which is how

650
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,159
they're describing this which is your

651
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,440
where's your focus where's your

652
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,840
attention

653
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,440
angstine i put this goldfish meme

654
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,520
it's the story about the goldfish and

655
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,760
what is water and the elder one is aware

656
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,760
of water and then the younger ones are

657
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,080
unaware of the water that they swim in

658
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,279
cough cough

659
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,240
and then

660
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,679
it's kind of like the two mental

661
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,559
extremes like water is opaque you can

662
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,640
think of the water being like cloudy to

663
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,120
this fish maybe it has a different

664
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,440
vision so then it can see that there's a

665
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,039
drop-off in vision it infers that it's

666
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,120
in opaque water so water is something

667
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,039
that it can ask about the conditions of

668
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,000
whereas

669
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
the small fish in this example

670
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,679
it's clear it's like transparent so

671
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,679
they're seeing through it ergo it's

672
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,120
transparent to them

673
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,200
so they're imperceptible so the green

674
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,120
ones are accessible to the system you're

675
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,120
aware of it it's like water that has an

676
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,159
opaque

677
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,240
tint and then the transparent means like

678
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,159
you just can't differentiate it

679
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,400
experientially

680
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,640
and that's a philosophical framework by

681
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,200
i think metzinger which has

682
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,640
probably been influential

683
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,320
right

684
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,720
yeah highly influential i think uh

685
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,039
increasingly so um

686
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,039
i think i think that

687
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,480
i think this could be pushed a bit

688
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,080
further because i think it's okay to

689
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,919
state this as a

690
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,440
almost a philosophical piece but

691
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,799
um

692
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,400
bringing in stuff like mental space

693
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,320
psychology which hasn't really been

694
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,799
incorporated in this area but

695
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:07,760
you know

696
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,520
these subconscious um

697
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,480
sort of opaque or transparent

698
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,039
awarenesses

699
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,200
are

700
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,360
part of our could be part of a deeper

701
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,720
way of knowing if we assume that

702
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,200
thinking is through our senses

703
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,679
if sense if actually the process of the

704
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,360
brain is not all in the box but it's

705
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,760
recapitulating stuff through

706
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,679
the sensory

707
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,080
world around us even in the subconscious

708
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,360
that would

709
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,120
tie in quite well with this but also

710
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,279
give a bit more of a computational

711
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,840
grounding

712
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,840
the other thing too daniel if you'd have

713
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,960
written the words opaque and transparent

714
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,559
in a white colored

715
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,480
in a white colored font with that white

716
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,960
background they'd still be

717
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,440
opaque but we wouldn't see them on the

718
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,679
back on the white background and so

719
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,919
that's again where

720
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,760
nice good call in order to be able to

721
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,799
bring the idea forward it isn't just a

722
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,039
comparison of transparency to something

723
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,360
that actually has a a sense of

724
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,799
tangibility

725
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,440
um there's this other p part of it that

726
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,559
we

727
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,240
will pick it up because there is a

728
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,039
contrast there is some differentiation

729
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,039
and doesn't always just have to be the

730
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,760
something's clear and something has

731
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,000
depth

732
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,080
thank you steven

733
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,840
yeah that's a really good point and

734
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,760
actually that can extend as well to the

735
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,600
size of the space you're in so if you

736
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,440
start to imagine

737
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,279
the relationships or these kind of

738
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,279
subconscious

739
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,159
senses of how close or far certain ideas

740
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,559
are that changes depending on the size

741
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,400
of the actual room you're in and i

742
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,320
imagine the different colors of the room

743
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,919
the light in the room as well might

744
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,200
affect

745
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,559
i've only thought about this before it

746
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,080
might affect the transparent states as

747
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,120
well because there may be some sort of

748
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,440
calibration going on you know so it

749
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,039
might be quite profound to be in a blue

750
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,799
room in terms of what your transparent

751
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,000
states

752
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,400
end up recapitulating so that's

753
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,640
interesting we'll come back to i think

754
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,360
uh niche modification and design of

755
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,159
regime of attention

756
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,720
who made this slide or what did it mean

757
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,320
to anyone

758
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,640
so this was mine um

759
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,799
the focused action i thought was like an

760
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,480
interesting keyword the authors didn't

761
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,760
use it once

762
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,919
if you search the paper and then as a

763
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,320
google search you search for focused

764
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,919
action and you get all kinds of life

765
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,880
coaching which is like whoa okay i don't

766
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,159
think that that's maybe the the

767
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,960
intention here so um this is just the

768
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,360
typical active inference loop where you

769
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,480
have internal states perception external

770
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,799
states and action that are all connected

771
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,520
and and partitioned by a markup blanket

772
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,320
so in the i'm extrapolating based on

773
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,120
what i think that the authors mean

774
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,000
here

775
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,600
low precision

776
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,480
is unfocused and and it's low precision

777
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,960
also in terms of perception because like

778
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,039
perception is also when you like

779
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,480
register you just saw something they

780
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,240
talked about the oddball and like you

781
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,760
know you're seeing an image seeing an

782
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,960
image seeing an image and then all of a

783
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,559
sudden the image is different and it's

784
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,919
like oh i wasn't even paying attention

785
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,240
to what i was seeing at all so it's that

786
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,320
perception can also have this kind of

787
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,440
unfocused quality so so i related this

788
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,000
to like a low precision kind of

789
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,480
perception or action as unfocused and

790
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,000
where it's high precision where you're

791
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
focused on what you should be focused on

792
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,720
that's that's focused

793
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,279
thanks just one note on that is under

794
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,279
the reward paradigm

795
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,840
plus minus valence avoid approach sort

796
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,399
of forward and backward linear mindset

797
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,799
we can say oh well not just do we

798
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,279
diagnose happiness or sadness or on a

799
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,600
linear scale but it's a goal

800
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,279
and so just what are the aspects of our

801
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,520
experience or of just the outcomes of

802
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,120
systems that can be said to be related

803
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,640
to focus and

804
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,679
attention and action so how about just

805
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,520
mind wandering since it's related topic

806
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,679
sure this is um

807
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:10,399
so

808
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,520
here

809
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,360
these are different papers and so my

810
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,679
pondering has been explored in several

811
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,919
different contexts but specifically like

812
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:23,039
the figure on the left is um by wanda

813
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,559
hassenkamp

814
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,960
and she studies uh she's at the mind

815
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,440
life institute and so studies directly

816
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,600
meditation and the effects on the brain

817
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,919
and here it just kind of shows the

818
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,720
different um brain regions that that are

819
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,080
activated during meditation or or also

820
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,440
it's like where you have awareness and

821
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,360
then your your mind is wandering you

822
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,279
become aware that your mind is wondering

823
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,840
and then you shift your mindset back to

824
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,679
like oh i better be paying attention to

825
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,520
my meditation for example focusing on my

826
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,600
breath or whatever and then you have a

827
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,039
state of focus again um and this kind of

828
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,399
contrasting

829
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,120
neural model of mind wandering this is a

830
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,880
2016 paper

831
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,279
and here they they discuss this in a

832
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,120
very different way so when i think about

833
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,640
mind wandering it's easy to think about

834
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,640
in the context of um meditation but here

835
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,080
they describe like okay if you're

836
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,960
focused on a task that's on task

837
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,279
and then mind wandering is

838
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,320
actually

839
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,520
pursuit of internal goals which i

840
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,039
thought was interesting like you're

841
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,799
still focused but you're focused on your

842
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,320
shopping list or whatever like internal

843
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,159
thing that you want to focus on even

844
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,679
though you're like

845
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,000
this is like mind wandering and then

846
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,559
they call this off focus

847
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,799
is epistemic exploration or this is like

848
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,720
the exploratory like where your mind

849
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,279
what i think of as mind wandering they

850
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,039
they call this off focus and so i

851
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,000
thought that that was kind of a

852
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,520
different paradigm and not something

853
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,279
that i'm used to hearing like where

854
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,399
you're just where you catch yourself

855
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,320
like why was i thinking about red

856
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,640
balloons and and you know frogs with

857
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,080
three legs like where you just find

858
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,360
yourself in this

859
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,880
intellectual state like what am i

860
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,000
thinking about or why was i even

861
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,679
thinking that whereas mind wandering is

862
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,840
like you really are thinking about like

863
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,440
some something else that's like you

864
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,440
should be thinking about but not it's

865
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,120
not exploratory which i thought was kind

866
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,960
of interesting

867
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,640
well the things i'd say about that on

868
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,720
the bottom right first it doesn't look

869
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,799
like there's a transition from the

870
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,720
bottom left to the bottom right so it

871
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,880
could just be that the dynamics the

872
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,640
tractor dynamics of this dynamical

873
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,720
system are such that when you just down

874
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,480
project these massive data sets of

875
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,720
neural imaging you get certain

876
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,960
transition dynamics which is totally the

877
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,720
case like you're sleepy before you fall

878
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,559
asleep and then you know different

879
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:37,519
people

880
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,120
accelerate or have different dynamics

881
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,000
but there is kind of a trajectory

882
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,640
so that was one point was these could be

883
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,919
very nuanced states and then the space

884
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,600
and the transitions that exist or don't

885
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,440
can be important and the second thing is

886
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,080
that the y-axis has to do with some

887
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,360
neural activity some neural marker where

888
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,360
it's low in the bottom two and high in

889
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,519
the middle one but then the x-axis is

890
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,000
behavioral results so the idea would be

891
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,080
that there might be some correlation

892
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,600
between like wow it was like they did 30

893
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,200
seconds of really good

894
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,360
task and then there was 15 seconds where

895
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,279
they totally didn't do the task

896
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,360
or was variable and then if you found a

897
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,519
neural change that was like immediately

898
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,279
preceding that or after it or during it

899
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,840
that's the kind of cross data set

900
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,799
connections that this research is

901
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,720
getting towards but instead of just

902
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,640
putting this into the broad framework of

903
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,679
dynamical systems and statistics

904
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,440
now we have a process theory like active

905
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,960
inference to explore some of the

906
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,880
dynamics that give rise to those

907
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,640
patterns so blue and then d

908
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,080
so interestingly there is a

909
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,799
correspondence um so there it does map

910
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,559
what was found and i had to like read

911
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,399
into the paper to kind of find this out

912
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,480
but the mind wandering in the left image

913
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,559
does map actually to the mind wandering

914
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,159
in the image on the right or or the

915
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,720
brain regions are are super similar so i

916
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,240
mean i i read to just make sure that

917
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,840
there was some cohesion there and there

918
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,919
is so so it's like interesting to me to

919
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,080
think about this off task like what

920
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,320
what is like off task versus mind

921
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,640
wandering and and what like for me if

922
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,760
you're meditating and you're not like

923
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,840
focused on the the thing like you're off

924
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,440
task but it's i don't know super

925
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,960
interesting i just wanted to clarify

926
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,159
that one point though that there's there

927
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,000
is a cohesion there

928
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,919
thanks blue dean

929
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,440
yeah i used to have to work with people

930
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,559
who were at a real

931
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,240
i gotta i gotta be polite because i'm

932
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,399
being recorded they had they had a real

933
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,430
joy out of out of um

934
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,679
[Music]

935
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,080
looking at time on task this was

936
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,640
something that was a something that they

937
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,720
found really really important and so

938
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,320
if you were

939
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,399
task designing you were supposed to be

940
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,760
able to create

941
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,120
something in your

942
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,640
in your design

943
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,399
scheme that would keep people focused

944
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,240
all the time and in the meantime there's

945
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,360
a whole bunch of

946
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,960
interesting papers that have come out in

947
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,519
terms of creativity and tangential

948
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,799
thinking and mind wandering as an actual

949
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,480
gift for

950
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,080
taking what's

951
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,159
in the task and making it your own like

952
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,639
if you're mind wandering you're not it's

953
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,719
not a disconnected thought that you're

954
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,719
having and unless you're really being

955
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,960
distracted by

956
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,359
the video game or the music or whatever

957
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,760
it's it's usually something tangential

958
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,599
to the task at hand and it's it's

959
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,199
essentially an embodying exercise so

960
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,918
to i i think this is good stuff just

961
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,079
because i think lots of times mind

962
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,079
wandering if you're if you're focused on

963
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,239
how many minutes was a person focused or

964
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,679
concentrated is seen as a a negative

965
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,520
when it from creative stance it's a

966
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,480
really important thing to do

967
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,159
thank you dean and then stephen

968
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,280
yeah i think it's it's useful to see

969
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,119
a transition

970
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,000
some sort of transition state between

971
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,800
the

972
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,960
regime of attention where you're on task

973
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,400
and a regime of attention where your

974
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,839
mind wondering

975
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:04,240
so i think that that opens up

976
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,359
um

977
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,200
questions of how things

978
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,240
you know liminal spaces between states

979
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,119
and

980
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,760
um the need to like if you're always

981
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,960
coming back on task yeah it would and

982
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,760
the you're not getting beyond that

983
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,480
state of losing focus

984
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,440
um

985
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,640
and

986
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,160
that that could be a problem i mean it

987
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,680
can be a problem if the mind wandering

988
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,280
doesn't get back on task as well i

989
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,240
suppose but uh so i think that's um

990
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,680
that would that would make a lot of

991
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,200
sense i think

992
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,240
nice

993
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,680
how about um mindfulness so

994
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,440
just the yellow part and then blue or

995
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,640
anyone can give a thought on what they

996
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,839
added um or

997
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,240
mindfulness

998
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,440
for the purpose of this work they're

999
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,440
going to focus on regulatory cognitive

1000
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,680
control strategies in which an agent

1001
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,680
seeks to control their mental states by

1002
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,599
becoming aware of the state as a

1003
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,000
cognitive process

1004
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,160
as opposed to regulation strategies

1005
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,760
where one remains engrossed in the

1006
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,000
contents of the state

1007
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,839
this style of regulation is central in

1008
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,160
mindfulness related intervention where

1009
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,680
patients learn to change their relation

1010
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,599
to thoughts and emotions rather than

1011
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:14,960
change the thoughts and emotions

1012
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,000
themselves

1013
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,680
so this is pretty interesting so

1014
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,200
becoming aware of the state as a

1015
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,119
cognitive process is like

1016
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,599
this is a thought i'm having a thought

1017
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,400
there's many many praxis many knowledge

1018
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,480
traditions built around this which you

1019
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,280
can

1020
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,200
mention or have people with experience

1021
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,400
talk about

1022
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,480
and the alternative is like when you

1023
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,359
feel

1024
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,960
x

1025
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,520
feel the x and be the x

1026
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,160
that's sort of the opposite q

1027
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,800
so we're thinking like mental action

1028
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,440
cues for action like cues for a sport

1029
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,440
dean's favorite topic

1030
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,359
and then there's cues for mental action

1031
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:52,640
that are verbal

1032
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,880
or have other

1033
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,040
modes of being delivered and what are

1034
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,960
the cues for mental action

1035
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,480
that leads to

1036
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,000
different regimes of attention like

1037
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,079
steven said and then how are the

1038
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,000
measurements that we're going to make

1039
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,440
from different modalities going to

1040
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,960
inform that study and the kind of

1041
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,320
modeling that integrates across them

1042
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,359
which we'll get to as well stephen

1043
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,200
yeah this is a useful

1044
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,640
piece here

1045
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,560
it's good to distinguish between i mean

1046
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,400
often with children for instance there's

1047
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,480
now more emphasis on mindfulness

1048
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,560
there's that big push to just get them

1049
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,240
busy you know make them do sports make

1050
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,599
them do this make them do the other so

1051
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:28,960
they're so busy with something they

1052
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,960
can't think about anything else but

1053
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,320
actually saying to them okay you're

1054
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,440
going to be in a space where you could

1055
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,280
think of other things and you're going

1056
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,040
to work on

1057
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,320
how to not focus on other things

1058
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,040
has some benefits i think there's some

1059
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,640
slight downsides of that if someone's

1060
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,960
got trauma because then it opens up the

1061
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,960
space for those things to be coming into

1062
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,680
play so i suppose i think this is really

1063
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,839
helpful to to see where they're going

1064
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,000
and it'll be interesting to know

1065
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,839
um how this plays out because there's

1066
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,200
always a danger if someone tries to

1067
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,040
scale this type of work because it's

1068
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,920
also easier to use the insights from

1069
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,280
this type of work

1070
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,280
to try and capture someone's attention

1071
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,040
at scale or capture many people's

1072
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,119
attention by using some of the levers

1073
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,200
here as much as it is for the person on

1074
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,160
the inside to be able to resist

1075
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,480
all the distractions and the

1076
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,320
the flashes of light that they keep

1077
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,800
getting exposed to in their daily life

1078
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,839
thanks steven blue

1079
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,280
yeah kind of i want to just follow what

1080
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,280
uh steven said so

1081
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,320
um i don't know that

1082
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,720
the children or or

1083
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,200
even like us adults being constantly

1084
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,040
exposed to flashing blue light like the

1085
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,800
smartphone like instant dopamine

1086
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,680
addiction you know fulfillment thing

1087
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,560
is necessarily the opposite of

1088
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,000
um

1089
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,880
mindfulness i i think that that that

1090
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,920
feeling

1091
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,119
is maybe the elimination of boredom

1092
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,000
which you can have mindfulness with

1093
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,760
boredom or mindfulness while doing

1094
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,160
nothing and mindfulness while not doing

1095
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,200
nothing so you can you can have actually

1096
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,280
not sitting in mindfulness meditation

1097
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,800
but but retain

1098
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,640
through this is called like you know

1099
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,560
meditation practice the meditation off

1100
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,400
the mat right so like there's there's

1101
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,560
the conscious placement of the mind

1102
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,320
during the meditation session but then

1103
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,240
when it's over you carry that into your

1104
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,880
daily life by constantly like asking

1105
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,720
yourself like where is your mind which

1106
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,480
is like this that's the image i put in

1107
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,160
about the old pixie song where is my

1108
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,119
mind so so there is the ability to carry

1109
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,440
mindfulness even if you're very busy you

1110
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,839
can still practice mindfulness in your

1111
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,240
daily life without taking time to sit on

1112
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,240
the cushion so i think we are starving

1113
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,960
our children of boredom which maybe

1114
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,680
is i i'm more focused on or more worried

1115
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,079
about a lack of creativity because i

1116
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,920
think that that boredom process where

1117
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,520
your mind is really wandering to red

1118
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,440
balloons and frogs with three legs like

1119
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,160
that is where um the creative the

1120
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,960
creative nature tends to bubble up

1121
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,960
awesome and i won't mention the person's

1122
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,119
name but i hope that they've emailed us

1123
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,720
um they have emailed us so i hope they

1124
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,160
talk more about it but they've related

1125
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,640
these aspects of active inference to the

1126
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,160
yoga of action karma yoga and and um

1127
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,680
basically like

1128
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,079
the way that action exists in the world

1129
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:19,520
so i hope

1130
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,920
stop what my knowledge area is so look

1131
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,400
forward to learning about that though so

1132
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,839
before we jump into the paper this has

1133
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,599
been a nice long background because

1134
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:28,880
there's a lot to say and it's pretty

1135
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,480
interesting look at this fun april first

1136
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,160
april fool's day

1137
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,680
with steven and blue and i

1138
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,480
but

1139
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,440
um

1140
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,240
they write in this paper that the key

1141
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,760
technical innovation presented in the

1142
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,599
paper is an extension of the active

1143
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,119
inference framework derived from the

1144
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,920
work of hesp at all 2021

1145
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,000
which was the paper that we discussed in

1146
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,920
live stream number 19.

1147
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,640
so

1148
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,040
if you want kind of the kernel of what

1149
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,800
this discussion is about

1150
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,119
then check out number 19.0 and 0.1.2

1151
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,800
and we were talking then about affect

1152
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,280
and about the way that that

1153
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,480
made deep

1154
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,280
agents so listen there to learn more and

1155
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,800
now we're going to be doing a few of the

1156
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,400
similar things seeing some similar

1157
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,200
figures so it's a good background listen

1158
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,680
okay figure one

1159
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,040
does anyone want to

1160
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,960
give a first description it says in the

1161
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,440
in the caption a probabilistic graphical

1162
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,680
model showing a basic generative model

1163
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,640
for moment to moment perception

1164
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,920
okay so the observation o

1165
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,680
is going to be used across different

1166
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,839
layers but here is the model of

1167
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:46,079
perception so we can debate whether it's

1168
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,160
realism or not later but this is kind of

1169
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,240
like the retina or the sensor of the

1170
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,200
camera oh it's like did a photon hit it

1171
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,800
or not this is an observable that you

1172
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,119
measure with a sensor

1173
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,160
s at each level is going to be a hidden

1174
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,480
state so called because it's not

1175
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,760
directly observed but it's inferred

1176
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,560
from observations through

1177
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,640
a which is a mapping so like this could

1178
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,160
be day and night and this could be

1179
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,640
photon hitting versus no photon hitting

1180
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,720
and then you can imagine the mapping

1181
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,599
there

1182
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,359
but we'll see how they nest and get more

1183
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:20,720
complex than that

1184
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,079
and then d is the initiator it's a prior

1185
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,920
overhidden stage which turns out to be

1186
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,240
important because as you compute the

1187
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,000
likelihood of different hidden states

1188
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,280
being the case

1189
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,599
um moment to moment or through time you

1190
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,280
need to start with an idea of

1191
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,200
essentially how likely certain states

1192
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,200
are and how closely they map to

1193
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,640
observations

1194
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,160
that's the kernel

1195
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,079
of the bayesian modeling that we're

1196
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,560
going to elaborate a lot

1197
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,359
like multiple successive times but this

1198
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,319
is the underlying system that can be

1199
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,760
thought of like photons hitting the

1200
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,000
receptor and a mapping to underlying

1201
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,960
states

1202
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,800
as influenced at least initially by a

1203
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,839
prior

1204
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,480
okay any comments on one or we can go to

1205
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,000
the next generalization and two

1206
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,079
okay so two

1207
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,119
is

1208
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,280
a bayes graph showing a basic generative

1209
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,440
model of perception with precision so it

1210
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,800
has the same

1211
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,119
terms and you know d s a o as above d s

1212
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,160
a o

1213
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,280
but now there's a new node and

1214
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,400
each

1215
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,440
shape

1216
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,960
just at a first pass

1217
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,760
represents some value that can be taken

1218
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,680
by a variable

1219
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,680
and then an edge that connects two

1220
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,720
states

1221
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,640
is like a relationship between them and

1222
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,760
there's different kinds of nodes there's

1223
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,200
different kinds of edges

1224
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,560
slightly in how they influence each

1225
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,640
other but they just mean that they

1226
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,920
influence each other and that's

1227
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,440
important because the edges actually in

1228
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,280
the grand scheme are very sparse

1229
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,520
it's not an all by all model so this

1230
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,839
model is extremely more tractable to

1231
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,920
compute than like an all by all matrix

1232
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,760
of just estimating the coefficients of

1233
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,760
how related terms are so it's a very

1234
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,280
constrained model space but it still

1235
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,200
describes a lot of system and the second

1236
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,480
figure adds in this gamma sub a

1237
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,920
which is the precision which is one over

1238
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,240
um the uncertainty so just as we had

1239
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,520
talked about those being two sides of

1240
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,440
the coin earlier

1241
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,440
this is like uh uncertainty slash

1242
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,119
precision depending on which way you

1243
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:20,319
want to think about it on high

1244
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:22,640
uncertainty you're really unsure that's

1245
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,040
low precision and vice versa but it

1246
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,839
still maps on to the sensory outcome

1247
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,520
in both these cases

1248
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,480
after the sensory outcome occurs

1249
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,280
then

1250
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,480
there's uh an update the prior

1251
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,240
becomes the posterior

1252
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,000
after getting a precision weighted

1253
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,400
updating and that's just how bayesian

1254
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,520
updating

1255
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,560
works so this is a bayesian scheme for

1256
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,640
updating that initially doesn't include

1257
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,760
a precision

1258
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,520
on the a and now it does include a

1259
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,240
precision on the a

1260
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,599
any thoughts on two before three

1261
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,680
yeah i think it's interesting it's good

1262
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,520
to know that the

1263
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,200
the expected precision is is is tied to

1264
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,040
the likelihood mapping it doesn't try

1265
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,760
and tie itself directly to this

1266
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,280
state it's

1267
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,440
it's it's in the way that the state is

1268
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,400
being

1269
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,880
so that that's that helps to really

1270
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,960
notice that and make that clear because

1271
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,000
that

1272
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,680
gives the logic a little bit more of

1273
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,440
clarity i think that's often a bit

1274
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,480
that's not

1275
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,960
teased out as often as it has been here

1276
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,520
that's quite useful awesome cool and

1277
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,200
what else is interesting so good

1278
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,680
observation that the uncertainty is

1279
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,079
connected only to the mapping

1280
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:38,000
so it's not uncertainty about the state

1281
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,359
it's about the mapping in this

1282
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,200
formulation

1283
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,440
now we're going to see a similar move

1284
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,000
and two things happen in figure three to

1285
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,720
bring that previous model into this

1286
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,960
uh kind of twice generalized space of

1287
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,160
generative models of action and

1288
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,319
perception the first thing is that now

1289
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,800
there's observations through time versus

1290
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,800
at a moment with just one observation so

1291
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,400
subscript one two three

1292
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,640
through time three time steps

1293
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,480
then here's that d s a o stack

1294
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,920
and then b

1295
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,400
is the transition matrix between states

1296
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,240
through time

1297
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,079
so we talked about that on other streams

1298
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:15,040
before

1299
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,560
and then again a similar move just like

1300
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,359
you pointed out stephen how the the

1301
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,599
uncertainty or like the intervention in

1302
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,599
this case the policy pi

1303
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:26,240
it's actually modulating the transition

1304
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,280
mappings

1305
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,359
rather than the states themselves

1306
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:30,160
so

1307
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,079
i'm sure that has very interesting

1308
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,000
computational properties that i don't

1309
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,240
know the details of but i think that's

1310
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,599
some components that make it amenable

1311
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,480
perhaps to message passing or to the

1312
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,800
variational inference methods but that's

1313
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,160
definitely a

1314
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,920
interesting observation that you made

1315
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,520
it's true it happens again here in a

1316
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,520
totally different way and then pi the

1317
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,680
policy selection

1318
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,599
is influenced by

1319
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,200
preferences which play into the

1320
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,520
calculation as expected free energy

1321
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,000
as well as this baseline prior e

1322
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,160
so we've seen this one before

1323
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,280
and this is how policies are selected

1324
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,079
over

1325
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:10,800
um for the next time step

1326
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,000
based upon

1327
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,640
the um expectations

1328
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,680
of

1329
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,520
hidden states and observations through

1330
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,400
time

1331
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,359
in relationship to priors e how they're

1332
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:24,079
um apt to perform before starting this

1333
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:25,599
sequence of events

1334
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:27,119
and then the way that they calculate

1335
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,680
their preferences over observation

1336
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,440
states which also relates to how you

1337
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,880
said the body

1338
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,920
centric

1339
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,400
inference

1340
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:39,599
yeah this this might be a question

1341
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,520
daniel for them but

1342
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,400
it says preferences over outcomes

1343
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,079
and it goes into the expected free

1344
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,240
energy is that almost like

1345
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,079
different ways you could

1346
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:51,599
weight

1347
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,079
the way the expected free energy terms

1348
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:54,880
are

1349
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,119
presented you know over maybe hamilton's

1350
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:59,440
least action versus

1351
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,200
resolving

1352
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,040
you know is it would be doing something

1353
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,880
like that i'm not i'm not sure we can

1354
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,960
answer that but yeah that makes sense

1355
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,680
it's a preference for sensory states

1356
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,000
and then we saw in the model stream one

1357
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,760
with ryan smith like if you wanted to

1358
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,280
have a very weak preference in the

1359
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,000
matrix it would be like 1 versus 1.1 i'm

1360
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,280
just making those numbers up but the

1361
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,119
point is like they're relatively close

1362
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:23,200
it's like a 60 40 election

1363
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,400
so that the preference is very weak

1364
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,920
and then you could also set it up to 100

1365
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,839
versus one but then if you think about

1366
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:31,359
that like when you're just totally

1367
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:33,440
thirsty and you're willing to engage in

1368
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,839
all kinds of actions that's how you

1369
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,559
could

1370
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,400
computationally

1371
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,880
put in direction as well as magnitude of

1372
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,359
preferences over outcome

1373
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:44,240
some people

1374
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,119
described you know maybe some

1375
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,480
individuals have a broad sensory

1376
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,480
tolerance others have a narrow sensory

1377
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,119
tolerance or preference

1378
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:52,880
so that's so you you've got you so it's

1379
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,040
almost like you can you can narrow you

1380
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,839
can either open up or narrow down

1381
00:48:57,839 --> 00:48:59,680
the the amounts of options that are

1382
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,240
going to be available by saying

1383
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,720
the gap yeah and then in the absence of

1384
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,920
preference if you don't have a

1385
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,920
preference for pheromone it's just going

1386
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,480
to be a diffusion walk

1387
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,079
so that's how preference plays into the

1388
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,160
decision making but also other pieces do

1389
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,040
too

1390
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,920
okay so then here

1391
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,040
here's where we introduce this second

1392
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,400
nested layer

1393
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,800
with the deep generative model of mental

1394
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,160
action

1395
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,400
so here the same d

1396
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,599
s a

1397
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:32,960
o

1398
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,040
is recapitulated from the orange but

1399
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,640
then the o is split into two nodes

1400
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,200
one is an estimate of the state but also

1401
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,520
it's passing or connecting to

1402
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,720
the precision the uncertainty

1403
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,839
so

1404
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:49,280
the features that were being discussed

1405
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,079
like up until figure three

1406
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:53,520
as being just

1407
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,880
part of how

1408
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,319
the um inference was performed are now

1409
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:00,400
still doing the same exact rule they're

1410
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,319
just being emitted

1411
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:06,480
by the state through the a s sub 1 of 2

1412
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,319
like the second level in parentheses

1413
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:11,040
through the a matrix at the second level

1414
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,800
and then that's resulting in these two

1415
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,839
outputs

1416
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:15,920
so this could be like a nested layer

1417
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,079
of thinking um or a nested layer of

1418
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:19,839
concurrent programming or a nested layer

1419
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:23,200
of formality dean

1420
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,119
i'm not i'm going to get the author to

1421
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:28,480
make sure that i'm getting this right

1422
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,000
but

1423
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
before something i remember from what

1424
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,880
kepper talked to with his effective

1425
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:35,760
piece

1426
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,359
and then there's a figure 5 which we'll

1427
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:39,440
get to but to me

1428
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,680
the figures one two and three aspect of

1429
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,240
this are the unplannable parts of it the

1430
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,599
figure four

1431
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:47,760
that asks the question why am i

1432
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,240
or yes why am i trying to pay attention

1433
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,800
to it's kind of the transition space and

1434
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,960
then the figure five is where we could

1435
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,280
actually do some planning because we're

1436
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,079
saying to ourselves now pay attention

1437
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:02,400
because we're we're putting idea that

1438
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,680
second order we're paying ideas to ideas

1439
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,880
piece so

1440
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,839
i think up up and up until this point up

1441
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:11,599
up until figure

1442
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:14,000
four it was unplannable what we're

1443
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,319
modeling at figure four we start to

1444
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,480
transition and then in figure five we

1445
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,599
can actually

1446
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:21,359
incorporate a plan if

1447
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,440
if we so choose if that's part of our

1448
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,880
policy

1449
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,480
nice point these are really helpful

1450
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,319
labels like pie at the first level what

1451
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:29,839
am i trying to do

1452
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:32,960
so um in the case of the light hitting

1453
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,200
the receptor and then is it day or night

1454
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,720
when we introduce policy that would be

1455
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,480
like should i swivel the cart you know

1456
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,319
move my sunflower head left or right

1457
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,079
move my camera left or right under the

1458
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,400
preference for light now if you didn't

1459
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,160
have preference it wouldn't matter right

1460
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,359
if you don't know where you're going it

1461
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:49,359
doesn't matter where you go but if you

1462
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:50,480
have a preference vector that gets

1463
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,160
increasingly stringent you're going to

1464
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,520
pursue

1465
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,000
those policies that will lead to getting

1466
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,280
the observations that are in line with

1467
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,920
your preference now here

1468
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,520
the second level

1469
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,359
is so this is again what am i perceiving

1470
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:04,800
what am i trying to do that's the motor

1471
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,800
cart with a visual receptor and then

1472
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,839
here

1473
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:09,839
the hidden state

1474
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:11,680
again it's just the same exact placement

1475
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,359
analogously the first layer is what am i

1476
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:14,880
paying attention to

1477
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,640
and the policy is a policy over

1478
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,280
attentions so that's what makes this

1479
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,400
model

1480
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,200
uh

1481
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,359
nesting outside of the smaller

1482
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:25,920
perceptual level model so blue did you

1483
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,280
want to say something or no

1484
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:31,400
okay then stephen go for it

1485
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,599
so

1486
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:37,200
it's treating the precision

1487
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,119
and it's somehow merging that with the

1488
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:41,119
states

1489
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:43,760
um to and pushing that through another

1490
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,040
matrix

1491
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,040
and probably doing that i know brian

1492
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,440
smith talks about a cycle of six in

1493
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,760
terms of when they model they go through

1494
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,760
six you know it will iterate through six

1495
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,480
and then the next level will just sample

1496
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,359
the sixth the sixth the sixth you know

1497
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:01,760
the sixth data point so to speak in the

1498
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,559
in the in the faster data going below

1499
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:08,480
um but i'm i'm not sure how

1500
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,440
how does that work with the

1501
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,640
two being combined and

1502
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,000
there's that the two are combined

1503
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,920
basically to give you

1504
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,960
the higher o2 is that right

1505
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,240
um

1506
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,200
so

1507
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,119
i don't know about the six specifically

1508
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,520
but here you can see like at the first

1509
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,599
time point of the slower model this is

1510
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:30,960
like the hour hand

1511
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,200
there's like the estimation or inference

1512
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,599
over states one two and three

1513
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:36,960
and everything about them like what's

1514
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,800
the hidden state and the mapping and the

1515
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,480
observation which you can then

1516
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,720
conditionalize the inference on a subset

1517
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,680
of those variables but that's what the

1518
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,960
whole model is

1519
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:45,839
and then

1520
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:48,079
then it's like you're estimating at

1521
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:49,599
time one

1522
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:52,079
about time one two and three and then at

1523
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:53,839
time two you're also estimating over

1524
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:56,480
that trajectory but the slower hand is

1525
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,160
like the hour hand

1526
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,599
okay continue

1527
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:01,200
so because i think this is where five is

1528
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,160
where you're getting that d and it's

1529
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,559
totally the contribution of the paper so

1530
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:06,000
they summarize as saying that they make

1531
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,440
three and this is go the 19 hespetal for

1532
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,440
a lot of this structure

1533
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:12,960
they summarize that they make three

1534
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,800
novel contributions to parametrically

1535
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,400
deep active inference models of

1536
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,760
cognitive control

1537
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,280
the first contribution is to

1538
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,040
stipulatively

1539
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,960
define the tensional and meta-awareness

1540
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,280
states as the mechanism of opacity

1541
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,920
control at different hierarchical levels

1542
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,680
the second is to provide a formal

1543
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,440
definition of attentional and meta

1544
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,599
awareness control via an account of

1545
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:35,760
higher level policy selection

1546
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,599
the third is to formally demonstrate the

1547
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:39,280
relationship between meta awareness

1548
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,920
states and the capacity for deliberate

1549
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,920
attentional control

1550
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,359
we're going to look at the model in

1551
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:46,559
figure 5

1552
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:47,680
and that's still going to be like sort

1553
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,960
of the abstract skeleton of the model

1554
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,480
and then there's going to be a

1555
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,520
simulation results so that was kind of

1556
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,760
all the background actually to

1557
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,240
their primary contribution

1558
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,960
now in figure five we see

1559
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,280
this explicitly three layer

1560
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,040
model

1561
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,359
and this is the primary contribution is

1562
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:11,040
this model

1563
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,400
topology

1564
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,799
and architecture

1565
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:17,440
and then the interpretation

1566
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,599
of the higher order states

1567
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:20,960
in terms of

1568
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,200
the opacity transparency and then

1569
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,480
eventually a more generalized

1570
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,640
perspective on mental action

1571
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,760
and

1572
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,400
bring this all together with a model

1573
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,920
that does basically the same trick

1574
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,920
around the second layer as happened

1575
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,240
around the first layer so these

1576
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,760
layer one and layer two are the exact

1577
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,599
same from figure four

1578
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,480
and now there's this third green layer

1579
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,000
where the states

1580
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,319
are asking the unobservable question how

1581
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:49,359
aware of my how aware am i of where my

1582
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:51,760
attention is

1583
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,160
and then the policy question is am i

1584
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,680
trying to maintain awareness of my

1585
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,000
attentional state or

1586
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,599
something like that we can get at what

1587
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:02,160
exact wording these parameters map onto

1588
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,440
but

1589
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,680
totally interesting

1590
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,680
paper and structure of the model in

1591
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,359
question so any

1592
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:10,880
thoughts or what was exciting to people

1593
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,559
about figure five stephen and then

1594
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:14,960
anyone else

1595
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,119
yeah it's interesting it's exciting to

1596
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:19,760
see it's got some similarities to the

1597
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,559
valence um the deeply felt effect

1598
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:25,040
valence has been a higher level

1599
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,720
um

1600
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:27,839
sort of

1601
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:29,280
calibration

1602
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,599
i suppose in a way

1603
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:33,839
they might try and find a way to put

1604
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:35,839
those two together you know

1605
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,520
um

1606
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,280
when you say you're i'm aware of where

1607
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,520
my attention is um

1608
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,200
well what kind of awareness is that

1609
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,880
awareness is a

1610
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,720
feeling

1611
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,359
it feels good or is it something else so

1612
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:50,799
um yeah

1613
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:52,880
nice

1614
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,280
dean or blue otherwise we can

1615
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,880
i just want to say a couple quick things

1616
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,720
so i i

1617
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,160
the way that they laid the paper out

1618
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,160
this made a really good case for why

1619
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,160
they were focusing on the transparency

1620
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:08,000
and the opacity opacity piece

1621
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,760
and then and they don't make any claims

1622
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,720
around whether or not a person who's

1623
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,040
looking at a white page with white text

1624
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,040
written on on it can actually see that

1625
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,440
white text or whether or not the the

1626
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,520
size of the font is so large

1627
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,839
that you're only seeing one pixel in the

1628
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:25,040
letter a

1629
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,040
on that page so you can't even see the a

1630
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,280
but i think both of those things matter

1631
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,880
when we're talking about attention as

1632
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,960
well how can you pay attention to

1633
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,079
something where you can't see the

1634
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:36,240
contrast or how can you pay attention to

1635
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,319
something where the proportions are so

1636
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:40,400
out of whack that they just don't make

1637
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,400
any sense to you now i know they're not

1638
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,319
talking about that here but it would

1639
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:45,920
seem to me that that would also be a

1640
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,240
part of where this computational piece

1641
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,079
would be really really helpful because

1642
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,079
to a learner

1643
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:53,839
sometimes it's easy to see the tunnel

1644
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:55,760
within the mountain sometimes it's

1645
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,119
really really hard to be able to pick

1646
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:58,960
something up off the page when it's

1647
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,040
either way out of proportion or there

1648
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,440
isn't any contrast so i just wanted to

1649
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,440
kind of i want to i want to give the

1650
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,760
authors credit and i think i i hope i

1651
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,200
think i know where they're going next

1652
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,720
thanks yeah

1653
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,400
cool

1654
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,400
let's go into a little one

1655
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,839
cul-de-sac of the formalities that is

1656
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:22,000
kind of interesting and then we can also

1657
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,839
ask the authors to explain a little bit

1658
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:25,119
more to us

1659
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:27,760
but just to get at how does this

1660
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:28,559
s

1661
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:31,040
state sub t so through time across time

1662
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,520
points at the second level so that's

1663
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:34,480
going to be

1664
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,839
what we're focused on is how this

1665
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:40,720
is kind of at the intersection of

1666
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,319
perhaps you could even say the bottom up

1667
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:44,319
in the top down signaling or at the very

1668
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:46,799
least it's at sort of a um you know

1669
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:48,559
mid-level street

1670
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:51,520
in the scale of streets of variables

1671
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,599
from local neighborhoods like down here

1672
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:55,200
in the bottom cluster

1673
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,359
to sort of regional hubs

1674
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:59,440
to this broader

1675
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,559
connection

1676
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:02,799
that is happening at an even slower or

1677
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:05,200
deeper timescaler way we're kind of

1678
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,440
looking at this middle piece

1679
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,359
as a as perhaps an example of again how

1680
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:12,880
factors from bottom up and top down

1681
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,400
interact and then

1682
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,000
it's kind of like legos maybe it can be

1683
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,280
generalized from there and you can say

1684
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,440
okay let's nest this within that or

1685
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,559
see what happens if you connect over

1686
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:23,280
here but they write

1687
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,119
mathematically the attentional and meta

1688
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:27,280
awareness state inference is calculated

1689
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,480
based upon three sources of evidence

1690
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,480
red prior beliefs

1691
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,400
so this is the b and the s at layer two

1692
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,040
so those are um like

1693
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,240
what is previously influencing

1694
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,880
that layer specifically so that's what

1695
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,720
happened before at that layer

1696
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,559
direct perceptual evidence eg the

1697
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:50,319
metacognitive observation of one's

1698
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:51,760
attentional state

1699
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,520
blue

1700
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,520
and then orange

1701
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,040
ascending evidence based on the

1702
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,520
precision beliefs of the level below so

1703
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,520
maybe that's where

1704
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,440
if you know you just opened your eyes in

1705
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,880
the morning and it was too bright and

1706
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,720
you don't have the resolution now you

1707
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,480
can't make the good mapping between

1708
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,240
fine-grained details

1709
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,839
because your resolution from a sensory

1710
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:13,280
perspective like the precision is

1711
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,440
adapted for a different regime of

1712
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,760
environmental regularities so there's

1713
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,839
perhaps many ways to model this

1714
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:20,640
so

1715
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:21,520
there

1716
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,799
then they say something that was kind of

1717
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:25,040
interesting for the ascending messages

1718
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,599
from the continuous expected precision

1719
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:29,839
to the discrete states

1720
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:31,839
we'll use bayesian bayesian model

1721
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:33,520
reduction

1722
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,920
for the derivation see first in 2018 to

1723
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,760
evaluate the marginal likelihood under

1724
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,359
the priors associated with each higher

1725
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:40,720
level state

1726
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,599
this

1727
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,200
gives in the case of the attentional

1728
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,880
evidence for example and then the

1729
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,559
equation that has these components that

1730
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,079
were here so it sounds probably

1731
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:49,680
extremely technical

1732
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,280
but it's a pretty interesting topic that

1733
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,520
we'll look at just in another slide

1734
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,960
because it is really important to

1735
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,880
understand how this bottom-up continuous

1736
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:57,839
info

1737
01:00:57,839 --> 01:00:59,440
becomes translated to discretely

1738
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,040
different states

1739
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,480
and then

1740
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:05,119
this is just to note that

1741
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:06,720
this is like the general structure of

1742
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,079
the model which you could imagine is

1743
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:10,079
also computer variables but then they

1744
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:12,480
preset two mental states associated with

1745
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,280
just specific parameters that they chose

1746
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,160
so

1747
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,880
especially the simulation is just like a

1748
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,680
parameter combination it's not all the

1749
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,920
possible dimensions one can explore so

1750
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,000
that was just to know so here's oh yeah

1751
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,760
steven go for it before we go to model

1752
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:28,799
reduction

1753
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:31,119
i think this is helpful to

1754
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:32,799
to think about

1755
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,839
um

1756
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:35,760
that how that top level has that impact

1757
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:36,960
you can imagine you know you wake up

1758
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,880
sometimes say you're at home and you

1759
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,280
wake up it's just and slowly you just

1760
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,000
you see the room you expect to see okay

1761
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,119
and there's the other times when you

1762
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:46,720
wake up and you've gone away and there's

1763
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,720
and there's that jolt because the prior

1764
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,440
expectations were still locked into like

1765
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,359
you're dreaming about waking up at home

1766
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:55,039
or you're sort of but you're not home

1767
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:56,640
right and there's that so it's almost

1768
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,520
like

1769
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,039
you're fulfilling your expectations

1770
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:00,799
these these higher level

1771
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:02,720
could just start to

1772
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,280
percolate out as you enter into certain

1773
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:08,319
states or into certain rooms um so

1774
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:10,160
i think that's quite a nice way of

1775
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,240
thinking top up top down bottom up and

1776
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,880
that being about perception as well

1777
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,400
cool nice point

1778
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,319
deep priors narrative priors how did i

1779
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:20,799
get here with sensory priors

1780
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:23,599
um at the moment to moment so here's the

1781
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:26,480
paper with fristen parr and zeidman from

1782
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,720
2018-19

1783
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,720
bayesian model reduction

1784
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:31,920
so

1785
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,559
the yellow parts are highlighted but

1786
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:36,960
just one green part and then kind of

1787
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,400
take away here is

1788
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,200
um

1789
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,440
we consider structure learning and

1790
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,000
hierarchical or empirical bays

1791
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,680
that can be regarded as a metaphor for

1792
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,920
neurobiological processes like abductive

1793
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,039
reasoning

1794
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:50,960
so i know that that's what we're kind of

1795
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,280
excited about and the paper that we

1796
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,680
brought up of majeed benny but that's

1797
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,359
super interesting like just to kind of

1798
01:02:57,359 --> 01:02:59,520
skip to the last sentence how are they

1799
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,039
going to be using model comparison of

1800
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:02,559
bayesian models

1801
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:04,880
to explore abductive reasoning

1802
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:05,839
and

1803
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:07,359
one takeaway but

1804
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:08,880
really would be great to have people who

1805
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,640
know more about this topic

1806
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,559
have a little bit more insight would be

1807
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:13,839
like we can

1808
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:15,839
compare bayesian models that only vary

1809
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:17,280
in their priors

1810
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,119
it's really easy to compare the similar

1811
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:20,799
structures of models

1812
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:22,559
that just vary in like whether they

1813
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:23,839
think it's going to be a gaussian

1814
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:26,000
centered at five or centered at seven

1815
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
there's a lot of tools that help you

1816
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,680
very rapidly compare that but if you

1817
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,920
have two totally disparate model two

1818
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,200
programming languages they're predicting

1819
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,720
different things it's really hard to

1820
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:37,039
compare them so the frequentist

1821
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:39,599
comparisons can be very intractable as

1822
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:41,520
well as sampling and simulation based

1823
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,760
ones that are just like brute force or

1824
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,599
they can have stringent requirements

1825
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:47,440
like the hierarchical likelihood ratio

1826
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:48,319
test

1827
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:50,960
is only applicable to certain subsets of

1828
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,720
frequentist modeling

1829
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,799
so structure learning is hard

1830
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:56,400
what is the structure of causation

1831
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,599
what's the structure of the data the

1832
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:58,880
shape of the data deemed like you

1833
01:03:58,880 --> 01:03:59,920
brought up

1834
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:02,640
so how can we frame this question and

1835
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,480
challenge about learning about structure

1836
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:05,520
of data

1837
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:08,160
in terms of model comparison or updating

1838
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:11,039
of priors amongst models that have

1839
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:12,880
similar structures but just different

1840
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,720
quantitative variables

1841
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,559
and so bayesian model reduction is a way

1842
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:18,160
that you can do this kind of structured

1843
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,119
learning

1844
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:21,599
and one loose analogy

1845
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:24,559
is the lasso regression which tries to

1846
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:27,760
restrict to a very small set of few

1847
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,240
strong factors in a data set that might

1848
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,839
have like many weakly interacting

1849
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:33,520
factors it kind of truncates the

1850
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,960
distribution just as like give me the

1851
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,960
most relevant ones and if it's just

1852
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,880
massively interacting

1853
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:39,760
then

1854
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,280
you know so be it

1855
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,760
and that kind of a regression is gonna

1856
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,160
have a similar use which is to converge

1857
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:48,720
upon a smaller number of things that are

1858
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,400
really informative

1859
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,640
while keeping the model also similar

1860
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,240
which should be reminiscent of like the

1861
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,720
bayesian information criteria aic as

1862
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:57,839
well

1863
01:04:57,839 --> 01:05:00,559
and then here's in that paper

1864
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:03,119
and it relates to what we read earlier

1865
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:04,640
how do you go from like quantitative

1866
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:06,880
continuous estimates in this case coming

1867
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,119
from perceptual updating of like that

1868
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:12,000
retina sensor how do we how do we plug

1869
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,160
in from the continuous

1870
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,400
and map to categorical discrete

1871
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,240
selection of models

1872
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,480
so mapping from continuous to continuous

1873
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,319
you can just do like a dilation or some

1874
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:24,400
other function mapping but it gets a

1875
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,599
little bit different when you want to

1876
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:27,520
map between these worlds of continuous

1877
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,200
and discrete

1878
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,520
and it turns out that the way it works

1879
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:35,039
is that inferences performed within and

1880
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:37,839
among a family of models bayesian models

1881
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:39,599
that are using parameters like

1882
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:41,119
quantitative difference in parameters to

1883
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,400
describe

1884
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,880
structural connections between variables

1885
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,640
so here's like let's just say that black

1886
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,520
is zero and y is one then here's like

1887
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,440
all the combinations of linear models

1888
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,039
that were used to generate

1889
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:54,720
the different models so this is the

1890
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,599
exhaustive frequentist approach

1891
01:05:57,599 --> 01:05:58,880
and then

1892
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,039
here what's happening is the bayesian

1893
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:04,319
model is estimating the relevance of

1894
01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:07,359
each of up to 20 parameters

1895
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:08,240
and then

1896
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,839
estimating like a credible interval

1897
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:12,000
which is 90 percent in this case 90 of

1898
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,520
the time it's within this interval we

1899
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,680
think or that's where it's likely to be

1900
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,680
under some value of stringency that's

1901
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:18,640
the red

1902
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:19,599
blur

1903
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:21,520
and then you prune the ones that are

1904
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,440
like not significantly different from

1905
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,119
zero so it doesn't mean that they're not

1906
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:26,400
zero or they're not playing a role or

1907
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,160
the proteins don't touch but it means

1908
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,920
that you can actually structurally

1909
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,280
simplify

1910
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,440
the relationship between variables

1911
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,520
so that's moving from continuous

1912
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:36,640
evidence

1913
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,160
about models

1914
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,240
of a discrete family

1915
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,480
to a reduced model that could

1916
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:45,599
potentially be extremely parsimonious

1917
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:47,440
so that's just the bayesian model

1918
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,359
reduction but that's like i guess a sub

1919
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:52,960
component of this paper so

1920
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:54,480
wanting to know more about how it comes

1921
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:55,920
into play or if there's an analogous

1922
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,280
process on the

1923
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,119
generative way down

1924
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:00,960
okay any thoughts on that or just that

1925
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,799
was one little

1926
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:04,319
section well i was just thinking i mean

1927
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,920
i'm not sure if i've

1928
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,160
got this potentially right but

1929
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:10,640
i can see this brings in the idea of how

1930
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:13,280
action can be used to

1931
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:16,559
think like in creative abductive work

1932
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:18,480
you you know you can start to

1933
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,400
actually create entropy or create

1934
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,880
confusion to create some possible

1935
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:26,079
outcomes and that the art of

1936
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,839
the creative process

1937
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:31,359
isn't necessarily the creation of random

1938
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:34,000
novel ideas it's been able to prune back

1939
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,440
i think it comes a bit back to the idea

1940
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,480
of that task related

1941
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:41,280
off-focus mind wandering you know

1942
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,880
the ability to then go backwards and

1943
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:45,680
forwards and that might tie in with this

1944
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:49,359
ability here to do this

1945
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:51,280
i'm i'm not sure but it sounds like this

1946
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:53,119
would tie into that somehow

1947
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:55,119
cool we'll ask the authors

1948
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:57,280
okay nice onto the simulations also

1949
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,319
people can just leave when they need to

1950
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:02,240
this section is going to provide the

1951
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,000
simulation results that show how the

1952
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,559
model described in the previous section

1953
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:08,839
engenders opacity transparency

1954
01:08:08,839 --> 01:08:10,640
phenomenology so

1955
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,319
outputs of the model that recapitulate

1956
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:13,520
some of the dynamics that have been

1957
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:15,039
described

1958
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:16,719
in other experiments

1959
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:18,719
and then they're gonna use that agent

1960
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:22,399
with a three layer generative model

1961
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:25,040
okay so first was just um

1962
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:25,839
the

1963
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:28,319
uh well any okay any thoughts on like

1964
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:29,520
what the simulation is or just to

1965
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,279
contextualize it before we talk more

1966
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:33,520
about it

1967
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:34,399
okay

1968
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:37,520
the code is available it's a collab book

1969
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,479
it's pretty cool it it uh makes a lot of

1970
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:41,759
the

1971
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:44,000
graphs so nice work for the authors

1972
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,319
maybe we can walk through it or ask

1973
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:49,279
about certain parts but cool that it's a

1974
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:50,960
interactive notebook

1975
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,479
okay

1976
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:53,759
anyone want to

1977
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:56,560
describe seven

1978
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:59,279
sure i will

1979
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:02,158
so here it says um just the yellow part

1980
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:04,158
says in the first half of the trial the

1981
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:06,000
agent is in the focus state which

1982
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,799
confers a higher precision i.e the agent

1983
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:10,719
is generally more confident about how

1984
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:13,198
their observations map onto states in

1985
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:14,479
the second half of the trial the

1986
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:17,279
precision drops as the agent moves into

1987
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:19,839
the distracted state as a result their

1988
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:21,839
beliefs about latent states are updated

1989
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:24,000
more slowly so this is kind of like i

1990
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,520
wasn't really paying attention did i

1991
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,198
just see a car flash in front of me i

1992
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:28,640
don't really know because i wasn't

1993
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,560
really paying attention um whereas if

1994
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:31,839
you're focused on the screen and

1995
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:34,158
watching the car you see every flash and

1996
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:36,640
you know exactly when it flashed

1997
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:37,520
nice

1998
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,600
way to put it blue

1999
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,319
so the blue is what um happened it's

2000
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:44,960
like a tone like a lower piece even like

2001
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,719
a lower tone versus a higher tone that

2002
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:49,040
happens some frequency of the time

2003
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:50,640
and then um

2004
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,479
it is just

2005
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:54,960
this is a agent that's artificially held

2006
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,040
with a total focus state for the lighter

2007
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:59,360
half and then it just switches instantly

2008
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,840
and we're exploring how this s at the

2009
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:05,520
first level so to go back to figure five

2010
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:07,760
that's the perception

2011
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,760
is s at the first level

2012
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,120
and then that

2013
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,719
is an estimate that's changing through

2014
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:14,480
time and so

2015
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,480
um when it's focused it's like higher

2016
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,880
highs and sharper and lower lows

2017
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,320
and then distracted states just more

2018
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,400
like wait what

2019
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,880
stuff's more just spread out and it

2020
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,880
maybe has a different recovery or

2021
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:29,600
similar speed but lower to rise

2022
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,280
so that's how they say that

2023
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:35,120
that's how they make their claims about

2024
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,199
the way that the attentional state

2025
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:39,760
influences a1

2026
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,600
by making the likelihood mapping more or

2027
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,360
less informative because if it's

2028
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,280
uninformative the likelihood mapping

2029
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:46,159
then

2030
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:48,159
why does the sensory input matter go

2031
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:49,840
with your gut

2032
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,760
but if it's very precise you want to go

2033
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,840
with what your lying guys are telling

2034
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:54,960
you

2035
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,080
and that is reflecting in figure eight

2036
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,280
this um

2037
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,280
phenomenological cycle so these can be

2038
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,760
discrete just via that mechanism of like

2039
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,320
the continuous to discrete estimation

2040
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:07,760
and they write that this is

2041
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,760
the diagram of the phenomenological

2042
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:11,760
cycle that occurs during sustained

2043
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,199
attention tasks

2044
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:15,840
the process cycles through being focused

2045
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,320
becoming distracted becoming aware of

2046
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,960
this distraction and then refocusing so

2047
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,719
it's cool because it's like it looks

2048
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:25,520
like internal external states in a way

2049
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:26,880
and action and sense states like it's

2050
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,719
it's a four it's an

2051
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:30,880
ooda loop or there's so many other

2052
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,960
four-fold models

2053
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,640
but what are we actually looking at here

2054
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:36,159
we're looking at the dynamics of that

2055
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:38,640
attractor state as it wanders

2056
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:39,679
so

2057
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:40,960
i feel like since both of you thought

2058
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,360
about attention or awareness maybe what

2059
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:44,960
did this like look like or what does

2060
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:47,520
this mean to you

2061
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:50,080
do you think that we we attend through

2062
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:52,159
steps all the time i know that for the

2063
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:54,239
simulation they want to be able to see

2064
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:55,440
that in order to be able to do the

2065
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,120
calculations but do you think people do

2066
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,280
that

2067
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:02,400
so i think that the shift from focus to

2068
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:05,360
distracted is maybe not discrete like

2069
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,760
that might be like us like a more of a

2070
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,920
continuous um

2071
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,760
transition but definitely like as soon

2072
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,440
as i'm aware that i'm distracted like

2073
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,120
the attention gets redirected like that

2074
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,040
is a the awareness of distraction is a

2075
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:19,920
discrete like bam oh um and then the

2076
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,159
redirection of attention is is also like

2077
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:24,239
i can replace it and then i'm focused

2078
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:25,040
again

2079
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,199
but then the transition so it's just

2080
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:28,800
this top left corner where it's a little

2081
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,640
fuzzy for me

2082
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:32,480
i i really agree with that blue like

2083
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,080
awareness of distraction to redirection

2084
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,199
of attention that's like you know the

2085
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:37,040
eye of mordor it just goes somewhere

2086
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,159
else okay

2087
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:39,679
but then the distracted to the awareness

2088
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:41,760
of distraction is actually that same but

2089
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,719
it's the eye the cognitive metacognitive

2090
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:48,159
eye of mordor turning its eye on a lower

2091
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:50,400
level estimate so i agree that actually

2092
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:53,520
this from from from noon to six

2093
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:54,480
it looks

2094
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:56,800
it's pretty interesting how it maps but

2095
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:57,760
then

2096
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,360
do we think about focus and distraction

2097
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:01,520
as part of a continuum of a single

2098
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:02,560
variable

2099
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,480
or is this like a yeah is there can you

2100
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,520
wobble

2101
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,440
or is there like more dimensions to just

2102
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:10,080
being super strongly obsessively doing

2103
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,199
something

2104
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:12,640
how far do you pull back what if you

2105
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:14,159
have to you know put down the first pen

2106
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:15,840
to pick up a different pen

2107
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,679
you're pulling back from the goal but

2108
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:19,840
you're moving towards it so that's the

2109
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:22,080
kind of deep policy questions that are

2110
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,239
so cool that we're raising blue

2111
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:26,880
well so it's cool because um here it's

2112
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:29,199
this gamma function right like so the

2113
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:31,840
gamma is the precision and so just by

2114
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,520
changing the gamma and like you can

2115
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,280
change the gamma incrementally however

2116
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:37,920
you want to change the gamma like 0.01

2117
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:41,199
0.1 0.001 and then by changing that

2118
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:43,520
gamma you can really get that shift like

2119
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,960
computationally from focus to distracted

2120
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,960
by by just by changing that precision

2121
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,320
metric

2122
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,640
yep and i mean that's kind of imagine

2123
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:54,560
the little headband when people are

2124
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:57,199
paying attention and what do you do

2125
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:59,520
so here i copied the

2126
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:02,640
left side of i think five

2127
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,480
and then just laid it next to here so

2128
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:05,760
these are the questions that again each

2129
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,600
layer is asking

2130
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,520
the blue layer is like the perception

2131
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:10,800
layer

2132
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,280
and related to the policy that's going

2133
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,520
to get those perceptions in line with

2134
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:17,040
preferences

2135
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,880
so moving the cart back and forth to be

2136
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:21,120
in the right amount of light then hidden

2137
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:23,360
mental states are about paying attention

2138
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:24,400
and then

2139
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:27,360
what influences the precision

2140
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,920
and emits a precision variable and an

2141
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,040
observable

2142
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:34,480
at a higher level just like a sub

2143
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:37,840
one at the second level here's like a3

2144
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,600
and here's now the slow

2145
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,440
one but it's happening actually at every

2146
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:42,960
time point

2147
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,719
so again you could probably elaborate

2148
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:46,239
this in various ways and ask like how

2149
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:48,000
many time steps of action are calculated

2150
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:48,800
per

2151
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,480
attentional state

2152
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:51,760
how many attentional states are

2153
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:54,400
calculated per metacognitive state

2154
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:58,000
are they all in the flow

2155
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,280
it's so

2156
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:01,199
interesting

2157
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:04,480
so here then they also put down the

2158
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:06,320
specific matrices i assume the ones that

2159
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,159
we'll see in this

2160
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:10,239
colab notebook these are just like the

2161
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:12,159
parameters that are going to illustrate

2162
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:13,600
some of the dynamics that are going to

2163
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,000
be interesting for the fields

2164
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,920
but again these are parameters that

2165
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,440
could be learned or updated or could

2166
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:20,480
reflect

2167
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:23,199
not just a two by two option

2168
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:24,480
all right

2169
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,080
so maybe even

2170
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,840
copying this guy out again here figure

2171
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,280
10

2172
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,040
um

2173
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:32,880
yes okay

2174
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,560
so here are the three

2175
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,239
layers of the model

2176
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:38,719
and so the bottom layer is playing the

2177
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:41,120
oddball paradigm so it's like listening

2178
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,960
to like regular tones and then once in

2179
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,360
every x percent there's a differential

2180
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:47,360
tone but also that could be like

2181
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,360
which one of these security events is

2182
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,440
anomalous or which one of these trades

2183
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:54,000
would be effective amidst the prior that

2184
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,679
90 are probably not

2185
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:57,120
so

2186
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,400
it starts off

2187
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,880
focused and the sense all systems are

2188
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,400
normal on the sensory side and it gets

2189
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:05,199
distracted it returns to being focused

2190
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:06,640
this is the true state at each level is

2191
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:07,679
the dot

2192
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:09,199
so the bottom layer is like the percept

2193
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:10,640
of the sound this is the attention this

2194
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,960
is the meta awareness

2195
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,960
and then this you see at the change

2196
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:17,679
point from being distracted to focus

2197
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:19,760
there's a switch point in the third

2198
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,040
level

2199
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:22,560
so then everything's normal the sensory

2200
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,880
level and then it's distracted

2201
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:28,000
and then the the oddball happens

2202
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
at 21 or something

2203
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,280
and then that like flips it it says

2204
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:36,239
flips it back into attention

2205
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:38,640
and then that continues and it stays

2206
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:39,840
in that

2207
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,280
state

2208
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,040
until an event happens and so this is

2209
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:45,040
just simulating out the dynamics but the

2210
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,960
idea with this kind of a graph

2211
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,679
is that we can scan along

2212
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:52,640
and look at how changes in one level

2213
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,640
either are influencing each other

2214
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:57,520
statistically causally within our model

2215
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:58,800
not necessarily about the real world but

2216
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,159
just literally causally because we

2217
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:02,480
specified it in our model and then do

2218
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,560
parameter fitting and be like whoa we

2219
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,320
can explain 95 percent of the variance

2220
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,320
in this behavioral data set

2221
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,560
even though we didn't observe

2222
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:13,120
the red or the orange

2223
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:14,800
we observed this

2224
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,960
or their task variability but then we

2225
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,400
have enough data points from enough

2226
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,080
individuals and from time series of this

2227
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,360
individual

2228
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,760
and then sat start to add in some other

2229
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:25,440
measurements and there's a lot of data

2230
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,120
to do inference on these higher order

2231
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,400
states about

2232
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,839
any comments on 10

2233
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:33,920
okay

2234
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:36,159
i'm just thinking so sorry i'm just

2235
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:38,239
thinking about um

2236
01:17:38,239 --> 01:17:41,760
how this is going to be used like

2237
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,840
by companies to keep you

2238
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:44,880
working

2239
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,280
like i just can't help but like think

2240
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,920
about about thinking about that like are

2241
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,040
you paying attention are you not paying

2242
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,719
attention can we give you an oddball to

2243
01:17:52,719 --> 01:17:54,159
make you pay attention like you're

2244
01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:55,840
sitting at work and all of a sudden

2245
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,280
like oh i wasn't even paying

2246
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:58,400
attention so

2247
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,400
um yeah like that i think about that and

2248
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,960
it's kind of scary and it's kind of um

2249
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:05,040
i don't know it's real

2250
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:07,120
i think blue if people actually tried to

2251
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,719
do that i think they would be more

2252
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:10,960
misinformed than they would be informed

2253
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,120
as i said for

2254
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,800
half a dozen years i

2255
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:17,440
worked with people who whose goal was

2256
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:19,600
to pull apart and sort of

2257
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,120
get a better understanding of this time

2258
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,520
on task piece and they're no closer

2259
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:25,520
today to understanding it

2260
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:25,850
then

2261
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:27,120
[Music]

2262
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:29,520
they were a decade ago and they spent a

2263
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,760
lot of time on it because i don't know

2264
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:34,080
that this literally maps into an

2265
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,560
appreciation or understanding of what on

2266
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:39,520
task versus off task is there's tangents

2267
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:40,960
to tasking

2268
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:43,199
and i don't think that this really gives

2269
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:45,040
us a sense of what that is i think the

2270
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,600
blue layer does speak to the unplannable

2271
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,120
i think that the middle layer does speak

2272
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:51,600
to transition and i think the top green

2273
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,000
red does speak to planable but if people

2274
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,480
if somebody in an organization

2275
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:57,600
thinks that they're going to have a

2276
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:58,960
better sense of how they're going to

2277
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:01,520
determine whether a person was on task

2278
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:02,480
or not

2279
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,560
i say good luck with that

2280
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,719
so i actually have a colleague that's

2281
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:09,280
developing a way to to determine if a

2282
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,920
person's in the flow state or not which

2283
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:14,000
is a very different very interesting

2284
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,560
like with physiological so attentional

2285
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:17,600
is different like are you paying

2286
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:20,239
attention versus are you are you in flow

2287
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:21,520
and it's it's really interesting and

2288
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:23,679
they've got some some decent results so

2289
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:26,239
far yeah well they can they can count

2290
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:27,679
the numbers

2291
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:30,640
sacadays or cicadas and i've looked at

2292
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:33,600
the whole visual memory thing and all of

2293
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,159
that literature and it's still not it's

2294
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:37,600
still they're still not getting any

2295
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:40,239
closer to understanding when a person is

2296
01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:42,800
on or off task because they want to

2297
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,640
break it down to that kind of a binary i

2298
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,960
say let them continue to

2299
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:50,239
let them to continue to do that because

2300
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:52,480
i i i'm not sure if it's

2301
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:53,760
nefarious

2302
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:55,120
but i think it has the potential to

2303
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,040
become that so i'd like them to go and

2304
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:58,159
spend all their time on it because

2305
01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:00,000
they're not going to figure it out

2306
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,920
keep them distracted

2307
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:03,040
oh dean

2308
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:04,880
laying down breadcrumbs

2309
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:06,000
i love it

2310
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,080
carry on

2311
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:12,320
figure nine is gonna be that same

2312
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:13,920
cycle of four that we were talking about

2313
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,360
on eight

2314
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,679
and now in addition

2315
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:20,880
to just the sort of qualitative label

2316
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:23,199
we're going to map that onto

2317
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:24,480
the uh

2318
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,960
structure of the model that we were just

2319
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:28,239
discussing

2320
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:29,760
so here like the redirection of

2321
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:30,880
attention

2322
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:32,800
is being framed as

2323
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:36,480
a policy to pi at the second level

2324
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:37,440
so

2325
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:39,520
um

2326
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,840
where's the action

2327
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,600
pi at the second level is this orange

2328
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,480
one here on a figure five so that is

2329
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,800
influencing what one is paying attention

2330
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,320
to through time

2331
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,000
and then that is being mapped to here

2332
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,320
and similarly you can read through and

2333
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,320
just work through the combinatorics here

2334
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,880
of what these map to from a dynamical

2335
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,719
systems perspective

2336
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:02,880
like while it's in a parameter

2337
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:05,120
neighborhood or regime or attractor

2338
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:06,320
state

2339
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:09,280
or manifold that's in one area in a

2340
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,760
distracted state described by a wide

2341
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:14,320
range of continuous parameters that map

2342
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,159
onto the categorical distinction of the

2343
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:18,239
true state being distracted but the

2344
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:20,960
perception being that one is focused so

2345
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,880
just work through what these

2346
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:25,760
distinctions are is pretty interesting

2347
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,199
i

2348
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:28,800
yeah anything to add on that it's kind

2349
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,560
of cool

2350
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,400
okay

2351
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:35,440
um 11 is gonna be another

2352
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:38,400
kind of just like in seven they had the

2353
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,400
attention at the second layer

2354
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:41,760
at one parameter level and then they

2355
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:44,000
just like turn down the dimmer

2356
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
in figure

2357
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:46,960
11

2358
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:49,040
they're gonna have a high meta awareness

2359
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:50,639
and then turn down the dimmer to the low

2360
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:53,199
meta awareness at the s3 so

2361
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:54,960
recapitulating the way that they added

2362
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,679
this third layer to hespedale 2021

2363
01:21:57,679 --> 01:22:00,320
they're recapitulating figure 7 in how

2364
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,239
they vary the parameters changing

2365
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:03,280
through time

2366
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:04,639
but now you can see the dynamics are

2367
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:06,400
totally different

2368
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,239
like the spiking between focus and

2369
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:09,360
distraction

2370
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,360
is actually happening faster

2371
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,280
during the period of fixed high meta

2372
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:15,199
awareness

2373
01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:16,800
whereas during the period of low meta

2374
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,080
awareness actually it's like there's

2375
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,520
longer intervals it's like well what

2376
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,560
just happened

2377
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:23,120
i was having low meta awareness the time

2378
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:25,280
just flew by or maybe there's another

2379
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:27,600
interpretation but it's just

2380
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,440
um a nice

2381
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:31,600
plot that gets at

2382
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,199
how just

2383
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:35,280
a parameter combination can give us

2384
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:37,440
insight into the structure of the model

2385
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,600
so we kind of have the graphical doorway

2386
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,199
the programming doorway and then this is

2387
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:43,679
like the outcome oriented

2388
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:46,239
data science way because this is just

2389
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:47,679
input in a model it's just in a machine

2390
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:49,840
learning notebook it doesn't really even

2391
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,360
explicitly invoke the graphical

2392
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:52,639
structure that we just have been talking

2393
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:54,560
about the whole time but it is that

2394
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:57,840
embodied in a simulation

2395
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:01,120
all right dean

2396
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:03,280
nah i gotta talk to the author tomorrow

2397
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:04,639
because so

2398
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:06,159
it brings up the thing about is it

2399
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:07,840
tomorrow

2400
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:11,440
yeah i'm going to bring up what i what i

2401
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:13,040
used to talk about as the crosswalk

2402
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,400
analogy i'm just going to leave it at

2403
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,239
that

2404
01:23:16,239 --> 01:23:18,320
i can see you being a great crosswalk

2405
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:21,199
guard

2406
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:23,520
you wait

2407
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,480
so

2408
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:27,600
figure 12 this is kind of the last

2409
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,679
figure i thought this was an awesome

2410
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:31,520
figure and one i i know that we'll

2411
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,120
return to many times

2412
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:35,199
a base graph of a deep generative model

2413
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:37,920
of mental action generalized over all

2414
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:39,679
precision parameters

2415
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:42,560
so now that attentional state

2416
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,480
the likelihood mapping

2417
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:46,000
is going from potentially binary state

2418
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
like we saw here focused or not i mean

2419
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,440
uh yeah

2420
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:51,920
um the likelihood mapping kind of like

2421
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:53,920
the dark side of the moon album cover

2422
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,120
can emit

2423
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:57,280
like five simultaneous

2424
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:59,440
outputs it can output a tuple or a

2425
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:01,679
vector from a computational perspective

2426
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:04,239
perspective and it can output

2427
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:05,679
what we talked about

2428
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:06,560
here

2429
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:07,920
but it can also

2430
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:10,000
emit an uncertainty

2431
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,840
and potentially even other things

2432
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:14,320
connecting to multiple

2433
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,560
of these lower level parameters

2434
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,159
so now there can be an uncertainty over

2435
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:19,520
the priors whereas in the previous

2436
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,520
simulations d just stood alone and there

2437
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:23,600
wasn't uncertainty around it so it's

2438
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,080
just sort of taking the next step and

2439
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:28,880
just being like okay if we um went from

2440
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,880
estimating the valence

2441
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:32,960
with the actual like plus or minus are

2442
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:34,159
things going better or worse than

2443
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:35,199
expected

2444
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:36,960
and we just said okay what's the sister

2445
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,199
of valence reward the sister is the

2446
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:41,280
uncertainty and the precision and their

2447
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:43,840
relationship so now this paper that's

2448
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:45,679
why it builds on hesp 2021 because it

2449
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:47,040
fills in the other complement there

2450
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,639
which is the precision modulation by

2451
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:50,400
higher level states rather than the

2452
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:51,920
valence modulation by higher level

2453
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,080
states how well are things going

2454
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:56,320
and then that insight to generalize into

2455
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:58,400
the variation

2456
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:00,239
from a top-down level

2457
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:01,679
has

2458
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:03,600
strong precedent in bayesian modeling

2459
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:04,639
where it's related to like the

2460
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:06,400
parametric empirical base and

2461
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:07,840
hierarchical base

2462
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:08,719
so

2463
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:10,639
big

2464
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:12,080
a lot of philosophical questions about

2465
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:14,080
what a parameter means

2466
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,600
challenges in implementing it but this

2467
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:17,679
is a relatively

2468
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:19,040
generalizing

2469
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:22,880
step in the publications

2470
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:26,880
um oh yeah exactly that

2471
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:28,480
it's the same higher level affect of

2472
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:30,000
states applied to likelihood precision

2473
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
rather than model precision

2474
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,080
and then um

2475
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,440
note that this evidence is only

2476
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:37,199
available when higher level likelihood

2477
01:25:37,199 --> 01:25:38,239
precisions

2478
01:25:38,239 --> 01:25:40,800
is non-zero i.e when the state is opaque

2479
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,719
to some degree as a result the

2480
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:44,719
transparency opacity distinction can be

2481
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:46,239
directly related to the evidence

2482
01:25:46,239 --> 01:25:48,639
calculation

2483
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:51,600
so what does that mean or

2484
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,040
just interesting like we don't notice

2485
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:54,239
something and then we do so it's kind of

2486
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:56,320
like it's transparent and then it

2487
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,880
becomes opaque and then we observe it in

2488
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:01,280
this model it puts us over threshold of

2489
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:02,719
observation

2490
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:04,480
that takes us off task as defined by

2491
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:05,840
policy

2492
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:07,679
okay on to the implications and bigger

2493
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:09,920
questions so blue go for it

2494
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,639
well so just to your last point like i

2495
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:14,480
wonder if um

2496
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:17,120
you know have you ever felt so focused

2497
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:18,719
you're distracted

2498
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:20,880
like like that's that's a common thing

2499
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:23,199
for me um and maybe it's focused on the

2500
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:25,440
wrong task but but it's also like you're

2501
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:27,199
focused to the exclusion of of

2502
01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:29,840
everything else so i just wonder how

2503
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:33,199
that goes into this transparency opacity

2504
01:26:33,199 --> 01:26:34,560
like

2505
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:37,520
gradient maybe so so anyway and then um

2506
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:40,080
yeah on to uh implications and bigger

2507
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:41,120
questions

2508
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:43,600
so i i think about oh sorry go ahead did

2509
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:46,400
you have something some response dean

2510
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,400
oh oh

2511
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:51,520
go for blue uh so yeah so uh

2512
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:53,440
implications and bigger questions so

2513
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,960
here i like when

2514
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:56,960
so i obviously got one during this

2515
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:58,880
discussion about being so focused that

2516
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,800
you're that you're not paying attention

2517
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,000
um

2518
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,719
but also uh if we're we're talking about

2519
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:07,040
adding hierarchical levels

2520
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:09,120
so i wonder about here beyond meta

2521
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:11,440
awareness um i wonder about collective

2522
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,760
consciousness like so is there you know

2523
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,280
when you realize that you're part of a

2524
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:17,199
collective and then when the collective

2525
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:19,199
develops some kind of meta consciousness

2526
01:27:19,199 --> 01:27:21,440
like so so it makes me think about about

2527
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:22,880
that and about maybe how to model

2528
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,880
something like that maybe an ants for

2529
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,320
example because there's there's the

2530
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,000
individual level and then there's

2531
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,719
definitely like the society structural

2532
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:32,159
level the consciousness of the colony

2533
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:33,199
maybe

2534
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:35,440
i mean also uh you know simulation

2535
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:36,719
theory like

2536
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:37,840
so so

2537
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,920
at what level like becoming aware that

2538
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,920
we're in a simulation like like where

2539
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:44,000
does that fit into the hierarchical

2540
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,199
nesting of this deep um you know meta

2541
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:49,599
awareness

2542
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:52,960
funny stuff wouldn't have thought that

2543
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:54,719
that's where we would get you know but

2544
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:57,440
that's kind of what it has come to

2545
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,719
any thoughts on that team before we go

2546
01:27:58,719 --> 01:28:02,159
to the next slide no i think it ties in

2547
01:28:02,159 --> 01:28:04,800
nicely with the what are we metacognet

2548
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,960
metacognitizeober

2549
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,560
yep and i'll i'm going to bring up the

2550
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:10,639
crossblock tomorrow yep

2551
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:13,360
so this future of phenomenology

2552
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:14,800
phenomenology just whatever we want to

2553
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,480
call it um

2554
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:18,400
here's just a few angles on what is

2555
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:19,840
slash has

2556
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,360
and will happened

2557
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:23,679
there's multimodal brain measurements

2558
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:26,000
ospm where art they sting

2559
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,800
but just it lays out in 2007 and earlier

2560
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:30,560
but in that textbook and in the online

2561
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:31,760
documentation

2562
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:34,320
kind of generalized frameworks for

2563
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:36,560
harmonizing across different modalities

2564
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:38,800
of neuroimaging behavioral imaging

2565
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:41,199
hidden state modeling so a lot of the

2566
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:42,480
seeds are in

2567
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,400
spm

2568
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,080
what we can talk about integrating now

2569
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,639
other than in a laboratory setting like

2570
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:50,560
eeg and fmri

2571
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:51,760
at the same time together but

2572
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,920
increasingly you know even at home

2573
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:56,320
physiological sensors

2574
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,400
wearables cameras and environmental

2575
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:00,159
sensors

2576
01:29:00,159 --> 01:29:02,080
the capacity for models that involve

2577
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:04,320
multiple humans and finding the

2578
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:07,120
synchronies and attunements amongst them

2579
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:08,639
under environmental

2580
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:10,320
changes and this is like the work of

2581
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:12,719
hyper scanning and guillaume de ma and

2582
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:14,159
other a lot of other people in that

2583
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:15,600
field

2584
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,040
thinking about cyber physical systems

2585
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:18,480
like what if the state is inside the

2586
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:20,719
head purportedly of a human

2587
01:29:20,719 --> 01:29:22,320
is that different than if this state is

2588
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,480
purportedly inside of a software which

2589
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,320
ones get to be affect which ones get to

2590
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:28,400
be what standing

2591
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,000
and then also it

2592
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,679
helps us and always is important maybe

2593
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:33,679
you'll go here with uh who and why and

2594
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:34,480
how

2595
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:35,520
dean but

2596
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:38,000
really just all these axes that

2597
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,880
phenomenology has been addressed from

2598
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,880
developmental multicultural

2599
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:44,560
neurodiversity a lot of historical

2600
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:45,760
perspectives

2601
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:48,800
that also is continuing to weave

2602
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,280
together and not being

2603
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:52,880
said to be obsolete

2604
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:56,960
or simplified by a computational model

2605
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:00,560
yeah if you want to know more

2606
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:02,560
phenomenology go and reach sean

2607
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:05,040
gallagher

2608
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,040
nice don't know about that but it sounds

2609
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:08,639
cool then

2610
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:09,760
yeah

2611
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:13,920
anything there or lost okay then

2612
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:15,280
here was just one paper that kind of

2613
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:16,880
came out just on a closing note like how

2614
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:19,920
it connects out maybe to other areas

2615
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,360
this was

2616
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:24,000
looking at behaviors across

2617
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,760
a bunch of different fruit fly species

2618
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:27,440
drosophila

2619
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:28,880
and then

2620
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:31,679
here's the big figure or one of them

2621
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:34,639
kind of mapping just like you might map

2622
01:30:34,639 --> 01:30:38,400
genes being correlated or might map

2623
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:40,159
neural activations to be correlated

2624
01:30:40,159 --> 01:30:42,480
across different regions of the brain

2625
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:45,040
those same matrix methods

2626
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:47,280
tensor methods fundamentally covariance

2627
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:48,480
estimation

2628
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:51,040
can be used to study different kinds of

2629
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:52,800
relationships so earlier we saw like the

2630
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,880
neural activity in the behavior here the

2631
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:57,040
heat map is like behavior to behavior

2632
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,400
they're looking for pure behavioral

2633
01:30:58,400 --> 01:30:59,679
covariation

2634
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:00,719
but then

2635
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:02,800
what's really cool about this paper is

2636
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:04,880
that they use several techniques from

2637
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,960
information theory which

2638
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:09,040
we see all the time in fep information

2639
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,480
thermo cool

2640
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:13,040
going that way but then also puts it

2641
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:14,320
explicitly

2642
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:17,199
in a comparative evolutionary framework

2643
01:31:17,199 --> 01:31:20,239
so this is really moving towards models

2644
01:31:20,239 --> 01:31:22,800
that can just very seamlessly integrate

2645
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:25,440
different kinds of data as easy as

2646
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:27,360
integrating the same kind of data just

2647
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:29,760
the matrix is type a of data by type b

2648
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:32,400
of data rather than type a by type a

2649
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:34,880
so these kinds of models that cross

2650
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:37,280
data input types

2651
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:38,800
need to be connected to broader

2652
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:41,040
traditions like thinking about

2653
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:43,679
development ecology evolution

2654
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:44,480
and

2655
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:47,040
it's just also interesting how these

2656
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:48,639
fields which are increasingly data rich

2657
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:49,430
are going to be using

2658
01:31:49,430 --> 01:31:50,480
[Music]

2659
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:52,239
different cutting edge theoretical

2660
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:54,400
frameworks so that just one closing

2661
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:55,600
thought about

2662
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:57,840
where is evolution in this where's

2663
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:59,120
developments

2664
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:00,560
where's

2665
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:02,320
what are we doing all these components

2666
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:03,360
that

2667
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:05,520
discussion elicits

2668
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,120
so

2669
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:09,280
any last thoughts otherwise thanks blue

2670
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:11,040
and steven

2671
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:13,280
and dean because this was fun to work on

2672
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:15,440
and i think we all got to learn a lot

2673
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:17,678
here

2674
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:22,880
more tomorrow yep i know i know it's

2675
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:25,199
only a few we've just been so

2676
01:32:25,199 --> 01:32:27,839
not on top

2677
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:31,199
okay all right thank you again thanks

2678
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:34,239
everyone for watching peace out

2679
01:32:34,239 --> 01:32:37,239
bye
