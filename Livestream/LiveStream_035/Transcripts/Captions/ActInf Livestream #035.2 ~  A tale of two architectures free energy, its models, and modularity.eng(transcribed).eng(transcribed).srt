00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,360
number 35.2

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,600
discussing the paper a tale of two

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,640
architectures free energy its models and

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,480
modularity

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,040
welcome to the actin flap we are an

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,120
online participatory lab that is

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,960
communicating learning and practicing

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,200
applied active inference you can find

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,360
more information on this slide

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,520
this is a recorded in an archived live

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,600
stream so please provide us with

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,920

25
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,439
video etiquette for live streams

26
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,520
all of our activities in the lab are

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,680
participatory so if you would like to

30
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,720
and see what is there

31
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,479
today in

32
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,720
live stream 35.2 we're going to be

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,520
having our third discussion continuing

34
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,759
on the paper a tale of two architectures

35
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,400
free energy its models and modularity

36
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,960
written by majeed benny who we're really

37
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,159
appreciative is joining us today to talk

38
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,439
and see where it goes so we'll um get to

39
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,040
the introduction in a second but

40
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,200
basically we're gonna just

41
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,439
pick up on some of the threads that we

42
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,640
opened in earlier discussions we have a

43
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,040
few specific things written down

44
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,240
and

45
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,000
i'm sure we'll go many different ways

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,719
with people joining and ideas coming up

47
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,680
and

48
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,759
questions in a live chat and all of that

49
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,318
so we can kind of go any which way but

50
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,239
we'll just start with the introduction

51
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,360
and warm up so we can each say hello

52
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,520
maybe blue and i can just say what we're

53
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,920
excited about for the dot two and then

54
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,920
mageed it'd be awesome to hear any

55
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,200
context for the paper so i'm daniel i'm

56
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,360
a researcher in california

57
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,280
and

58
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,640
i

59
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,200
didn't expect the rabbit duck to appear

60
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,640
in dot one

61
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,959
but i'm looking forward to continuing

62
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,840
that and seeing how is this drawing like

63
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,519
a scientific model

64
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,840
and then what does that

65
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,280
philosophical or conceptual paradox or

66
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,400
ambiguity say about scientific modeling

67
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,720
so blue

68
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,519
i'm blue i'm a researcher in new mexico

69
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,800
and i am excited to

70
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,840
probe deeper into the relationship um

71
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,319
between agents and their environment and

72
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,599
also the intransitivity um argument and

73
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,599
modularity and how those kind of all fit

74
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,000
together

75
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,760
excellent ajit

76
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,159
you are muted and then please continue

77
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,640
so hello you can hear me no

78
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,120
so uh i'm magic i'm an assistant

79
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,599
professor of philosophy at metoo middle

80
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,760
east technical university and

81
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,519
i'm obsessed with

82
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,159
models and structures across science and

83
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,239
perception and mind and

84
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,640
this is for it's for a while that i'm

85
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,640
engaged with this issue of model

86
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,280
applying model-based approach to

87
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,360
science to free energy principle and

88
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,120
predictive coding and i'm very happy to

89
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,720
be here thank you very much for inviting

90
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,720
me

91
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,560
great well maybe just for like

92
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,840
background and context

93
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,040
what

94
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,599
brought you to write this

95
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,000
specific paper like recognizing

96
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,599
modularity as an important topic and

97
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,599
where does this fit into

98
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,280
some of your other

99
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,920
threads related to fep and model based

100
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,840
science

101
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,879
um

102
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,320
well well

103
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,959
that's a very good question i'm not uh

104
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,880
quite sure why

105
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,960
so one reason for

106
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,000
uh

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,880
focusing on modularity in this paper is

108
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,560
that uh most probably it has some sort

109
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,479
of psychological explanation because i

110
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,000
started to learn about philosophy of

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,280
mine and philosophy of collective

112
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,639
science by

113
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,520
reading this language of toads and

114
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,720
i think that even in the earlier stages

115
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,720
when i was when people were studying

116
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,639
there no one was thinking that the brain

117
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,600
is actually a syntactical engine

118
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,280
no one was thinking that

119
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,600
if you open up a brain or a cognitive

120
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,400
system you actually find things that are

121
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,720
inside the brain in terms of

122
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,759
uh propositional like entities language

123
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,000
like entities or syntactical engines or

124
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,479
anything of that sort but

125
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,560
at the same time people were believing

126
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,160
that that perspective on hold brain

127
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,520
works

128
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,240
uh have some sort of explanatory gain

129
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,000
there is something that we can learn by

130
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,080
taking that perspective on

131
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,320
uh the brain and cognitive system

132
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,680
and

133
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,000
well i think that uh

134
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,960
the

135
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,840
general idea behind beyond behind

136
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,759
applying this model-based approach to

137
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,720
sciences is that it is the explanatory

138
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,360
interest explanatory as well as

139
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,440
practical interests of the modeler of

140
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,440
the people who are engaged with

141
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,759
scientific enterprise that

142
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,280
uh provide a handle on

143
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,360
the target system the things that we try

144
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,960
to explore and understand and uh

145
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,919
well uh i think that then i was reading

146
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,919
uh

147
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,600
uh the target paper uh by uh by

148
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,520
kirchoff and hippolytu uh

149
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,160
well uh

150
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,199
what

151
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,160
what stroked me as odd was that uh

152
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,400
they were taking it very very much for

153
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,360
granted true of course through very well

154
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,520
articulated

155
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,570
and philosophical arguments that

156
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,240
[Music]

157
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,680
there is no

158
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,720
such modularity inside the brain or

159
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,160
cognitive system

160
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,400
and i just wanted to bring the point to

161
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,280
attention that it would be a matter of

162
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,120
as i said earlier practical and

163
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,039
explanatory goals and interests of the

164
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,960
modeler whether there is

165
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,440
a modularity there or not so

166
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,400
uh one thing that i

167
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,520
i'm going to emphasize underline in this

168
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,919
session is that it doesn't need to lead

169
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,840
i mean this model relativity it doesn't

170
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,680
need to lead to

171
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,880
uh dawn right materialism about

172
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,120
uh theories of brain and cognitive

173
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,720
system i mean

174
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,599
model relativity is not all about

175
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,960
taking an untreatable attitude toward

176
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,080
brain science but at the same time

177
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,639
so the the old goal the old project is

178
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,800
to end up with some sort of

179
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,960
subtler

180
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,120
perspective on scientific realities

181
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,800
about cognitive science and

182
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,479
and

183
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,039
the brain science

184
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,280
you for the context welcome

185
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,120
dean if you'd like to

186
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,039
say hello and um if you have any

187
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,919
opening shots to fire

188
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,240
i i don't have any opening shots of fire

189
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,360
my name's dean

190
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,080
i'm in calgary i'm uh sorry for coming

191
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,599
in late but my

192
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,000
link was sending me off into another

193
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,440
corner of the uh

194
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,639
universe so glad i'm here thanks for uh

195
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,560
thanks for being here majido really glad

196
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,599
that you're

197
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,520
here to talk about this paper i found

198
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,720
the paper fantastic

199
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,840
pleasure is all mine

200
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,160
so modularity

201
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,639
i mean it's in the title

202
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,039
modularity models

203
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,800
and then the free energy

204
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,599
um

205
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,280
and then the tale of two architectures

206
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,199
which was a little bit of a reference

207
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,319
towards the tale of two densities

208
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,120
another active

209
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,080
paper

210
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,519
so um

211
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,279
just

212
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,519
how would you

213
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,760
reframe the argument of hippolyto and

214
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,880
kirchoff

215
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,839
majeed and where do you think like in 22

216
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,600
what can we say now that we couldn't

217
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,720
have said

218
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,600
in 2019

219
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,519
oh well

220
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,600
what

221
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,680
well i do not think that we could say

222
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,080
anything more than we were saying in

223
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,880
2019 because all of the actual stuff was

224
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,000
there i think that this is something

225
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,120
that

226
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,839
comes with philosophy because uh no

227
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,240
information has been added

228
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,240
as a matter of fact i just elaborated on

229
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,519
the

230
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,000
information that was there in terms of

231
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,200
the argument from intransitivity and

232
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,000
all of that discussion of uh

233
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,240
causal modelling and dynamical modeling

234
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,600
and all that so

235
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,000
uh i don't think that any actual

236
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,760
information has been added the only

237
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,519
thing that has been

238
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,000
elaborated on was the emphasis on the

239
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
rule of the modeler the

240
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,880
uh which if we insist on

241
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,160
uh so

242
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,360
as i was watching this in the previous

243
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,880
discussion of

244
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,000
uh of uh the same paper in active

245
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,440
inference lab

246
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,200
uh and uh

247
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,040
i was so

248
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,440
dean's discussion of the

249
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,600
in terms of the bob alice

250
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,160
uh metaphor the discussion of the

251
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,560
perspective of the observer the

252
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,880
observer that is watching both

253
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,560
bob and alice

254
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,680
uh interested me very much so if i want

255
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,279
to rephrase the discussion of the

256
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,120
modeler in terms of information here we

257
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,240
can as well

258
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,120
start

259
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,480
real estate that's in terms of the

260
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,839
observer but

261
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,600
uh i think i don't think that the point

262
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,279
is that technical the point is rather

263
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,920
philosophical than scientific or formal

264
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,000
in terms of information theory so

265
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,320
uh no actual information has been added

266
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,640
during these two years only and i think

267
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,200
that this approach is gaining momentum

268
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,800
this emphasize on the rule of

269
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,480
uh modeler or interpreter is uh

270
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,680
drawing even

271
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,640
more

272
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,399
this uh is leading to even more

273
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,480
discussions in the free energy principle

274
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,040
literature

275
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,240
i totally agree with that point and then

276
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,920
blur dean um

277
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,079
it made me think of quantum

278
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,480
and how the

279
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,959
double slit experiment kind of kicking

280
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,800
and screaming

281
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,279
has taken 100 years

282
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,680
in that one limited setting

283
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,480
to consider the role of the observer

284
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,320
even though it's really complex thing we

285
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,920
won't go into it but we'll talk about

286
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,839
quantum and fep um in a few weeks but

287
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,000
that was like the anomaly

288
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,800
that signaled yeah you need to take the

289
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,920
observer into account as part of the

290
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,680
measuring apparatus

291
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,720
very quantitative empirical observation

292
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,920
that there was a non-negotiable or um

293
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,000
irreducible role of the observer and

294
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,399
then on the qualitative side

295
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,120
the relational insight

296
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,600
that scientists are human and science is

297
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,440
a human activity

298
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,920
and um that

299
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,920
was not driven on

300
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,399
uh empirical observations of wave and

301
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,839
particle on a screen like the twin slit

302
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,000
was but it was just a sort of

303
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,639
low level philosophical argument that

304
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,720
there isn't a uh

305
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,959
a fungible role for the observer or the

306
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,680
modeler and so it is very interesting to

307
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,920
see how that has started to

308
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,279
catch on

309
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,760
and then how does that change the way we

310
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,600
do science

311
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,200
when that

312
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,860
is taken

313
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,040
[Music]

314
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,360
as like a starting point

315
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,200
that there's an observer

316
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,680
modeling the system

317
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,920
um so like that was in this diagram when

318
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,600
we started with um

319
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,760
just talking about like the functional

320
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,600
and the effective connectivity and then

321
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,200
the mechanism which is kind of not

322
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,639
either those

323
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,519
and then

324
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,200
it wasn't until the very end when we're

325
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,760
like oh but it's the scientist

326
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,480
projecting in

327
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,560
to this whole model that's another level

328
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,440
of

329
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,279
how we think about it we can't just like

330
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,959
all be sitting around just talking about

331
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,399
bob and alice

332
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,000
but then now there's going to be us with

333
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
multiple perspectives looking at the

334
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,839
scientists taking multiple perspectives

335
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,200
on bob and alice so are we stuck in this

336
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,120
sort of

337
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,440
subjective infinite regress

338
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,560
how are we going to salvage

339
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,599
cognitive realism

340
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,360
are you asking me

341
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,680
anyone

342
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,560
but if you have any thoughts definitely

343
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,880
go for it

344
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,000
i have some ideas but i i mean i prefer

345
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,720
if other

346
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,839
how about yeah dean and then majida than

347
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,760
blue if you want to

348
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,199
well

349
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,000
one of the things majid that i

350
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,240
that i took away from reading your paper

351
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,480
was

352
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,360
this is this is funny because

353
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,120
typically when i

354
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,199
when i pick something up it's pretty

355
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,519
foreign to me it starts out being way on

356
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,760
the other side of a markov blanket

357
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,079
and then i i guess i somehow alright i'm

358
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,079
able to sort of get inside of it and

359
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,639
relate it back to the things that i know

360
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,320
and eventually i get it

361
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,720
a bit of a grip on it and then next

362
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,079
thing you know there's

363
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,639
four duck rabbits um spinning madly out

364
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,160
of control on a

365
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,120
on a

366
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,560
on a gradient

367
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,240
but one of the things that i took away

368
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,000
from this was

369
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,920
um and i think i mentioned it in the in

370
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,680
the point one is

371
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,800
is

372
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,880
are you nine o'clocking when we're

373
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,560
taking these slices in time and we're

374
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,560
building these models

375
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,839
my

376
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,920
question was what are the specifics of

377
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,959
that i mean if if we take an fmri

378
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,320
image

379
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,800
i know the the machine itself that's

380
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,199
taking those slices of time

381
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,320
isn't necessarily conscious but it is

382
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,839
carrying out some sort of an

383
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,360
instantiation

384
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,760
exercise and so one of the things i

385
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,360
wanted to kind of talk to you a little

386
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,480
bit about

387
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,639
not necessarily on a quantum level but

388
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,320
one of the sections of your paper which

389
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,720
was really really influential to me

390
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,079
was a section on a golden thread

391
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,720
i wanted to i was hoping that perhaps

392
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,720
within that idea of partitioning

393
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,079
whether it's through quantum quantum

394
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,720
methodology or quantum series or

395
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,759
whatever

396
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,680
if you could maybe talk a little bit

397
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,160
about that that idea of what you meant

398
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,000
by a golden thread not just

399
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,639
metaphorically but maybe materially and

400
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,959
maybe

401
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:44,959
influentially if there is such a word

402
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,480
because that part of it

403
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,160
really mattered to me and i it actually

404
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,440
got me writing a whole set of sub notes

405
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,240
based on that section so maybe maybe you

406
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,680
could expand on that a little bit

407
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,800
because i think there's a lot there

408
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,800
thanks dean for the great question so

409
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,959
yes we'd love to learn more about the

410
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,758
golden thread

411
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,720
unmute and then continue i i thought

412
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,320
that uh so

413
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,279
very well uh so if i may do a bit of

414
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:20,639
advertisement uh i have been discussing

415
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,279
this specifically this specific issue

416
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,240
this dog rabbit thing in another paper

417
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,000
which is published in a philosophy

418
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
journal it is named cognitive

419
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,160
penetration and cognitive realism and it

420
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,240
is published in

421
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,040
in

422
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,920
episode it relates this issue to

423
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,800
uh the issue of theory ladenness in

424
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
philosophy of science works of thomas

425
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,399
green and all that but

426
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,320
uh so i can't uh so uh

427
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,680
well

428
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,079
what i say here so i'm also interested

429
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,560
in the relation between feb and quantum

430
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,519
theory and uh i'm i'm working on a

431
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,199
project that relates steps to cubism in

432
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,320
as one of the significant

433
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,720
interpretations of quantum mechanics but

434
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,079
uh in this context uh i cannot so

435
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,160
the paper is not directly related or

436
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,240
even indirectly to quantum mechanic and

437
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,160
the rule of observer i

438
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,400
rather take some sort of

439
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,559
so if i want to say this in more

440
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,640
technical terms i would use

441
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,919
shannon's theory of information to

442
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,400
uh to articulate the rule of the

443
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,320
observer a bit clearer so

444
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,400
about the question if i understand it

445
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
correctly what happens

446
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,360
when the picture rotates and

447
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,919
there's a scanning of some sort of

448
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,960
scanning is taking place

449
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,360
whether

450
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,160
uh

451
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,160
so

452
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,160
i correctly understand

453
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,160
that your question is about what happens

454
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,080
when there is a rotation but there is no

455
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,919
observer to

456
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,480
uh want to work out whether it is a dog

457
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,440
or a rabbit right

458
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,240
and then the whole business of so so

459
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,000
when we're trying to encapsulate

460
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,640
something and you you spoke

461
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,120
clearly in the in the paper about we we

462
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,080
don't necessarily have to see this as a

463
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,400
as a hard and fast edges kind of thing

464
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,880
we can kind of appreciate that there's a

465
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,039
certain amount of fuzziness that's

466
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,840
actually enabling our conversation

467
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,760
and so that because the lines aren't

468
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,120
abrupt

469
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,120
and and when we do decide to put a

470
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,600
markov blanket around something it's us

471
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,080
choosing to do that at a certain scale

472
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,720
with a certain amount of specificity and

473
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,960
steven sillett in the point one talked

474
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,840
about so what what is available at a

475
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,360
meso scale

476
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,480
so that golden thread business that what

477
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,240
do we last sue

478
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,039
what is that fmri actually

479
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,919
trying to entail that's what i was

480
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,440
hoping that you could maybe tease out

481
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,080
for us a little bit very well also uh i

482
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,720
can't be all clear about that because

483
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,039
being a philosopher i'm a bit naive

484
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,799
about neuroimaging and that sort of

485
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:07,760
stuff but

486
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,520
as some sort of general insight and

487
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,200
trivial insight from philosophy of

488
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,760
science i would say that it would depend

489
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,240
on what we are trying to trace by using

490
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,360
a fmri or any other observational device

491
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,520
or measurement so

492
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,799
and

493
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,400
the fact that we could use this

494
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,160
measurement devices in a number of

495
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,720
different ways and by by devices i do

496
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,120
not only refer to actual devices but

497
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,120
also theoretical devices such as markov

498
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,840
blankets and that sort of stuff so and

499
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,840
applying that to different scales and

500
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,320
different different levels doesn't

501
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,080
need to mean that there is no object

502
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,400
effect of matter to be represented by

503
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,160
these devices so

504
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,600
uh i might be able to use different

505
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,960
theoretical and mathematical devices to

506
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,039
measure the

507
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,160
space of my room uh i may be able to use

508
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,919
for example

509
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,360
kilometers i or i may be able to use

510
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,320
with noodles or something of that sort

511
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,080
and uh

512
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,600
this doesn't mean that there is no fact

513
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,120
of matter to be

514
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,080
to be

515
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,919
measured after all we can see this

516
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,000
picture in terms of either

517
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,760
rabbit or

518
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,960
a duck but not as a dog or a cow for

519
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,840
example and whether we see it as a dark

520
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,559
or rabbit again is influenced by so

521
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,120
uh it i would say that to some extent it

522
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,600
will depend on the original

523
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,480
vagueness of the picture to what extent

524
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,039
the subjectivity to what extent

525
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,919
can affect the perception what we see

526
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,600
is a matter of

527
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,600
uh the target system itself the

528
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,440
properties of the target system itself

529
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:45,660
so

530
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,880
[Music]

531
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,720
i mean no matter how hard we drive we

532
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,720
could hardly be able to see this duck or

533
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,200
rabbit as a cow or a dog or something

534
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,240
else but at the same time to some extent

535
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,880
especially when the target system allows

536
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,919
for some

537
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,440
vagueness to some extent or

538
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,120
presuppositions or

539
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,120
goals and

540
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,120
intentions be around the actual

541
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,039
situation and

542
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,320
uh

543
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,960
so there is some sort of constraint or a

544
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,000
moderate amount of theoreticalness to

545
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,240
use a jargon by philosophy philosophers

546
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,799
of science that is taking place here

547
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,240
but

548
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,039
it doesn't mean that there is no

549
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,120
i mean it doesn't need to

550
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,360
strip the target

551
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,520
of all of its objective features

552
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,360
i still i i'm still not sure whether i

553
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,600
could address your worry correctly or

554
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,440
not because i couldn't see the point

555
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,039
about the

556
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,799
fmri and neuroimaging techniques so

557
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:55,200
well all i was i guess i'm kind of

558
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,960
i'm agreeing with the argument that

559
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,799
you're putting forward which is that any

560
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,679
time we make an observation and then we

561
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,760
drop some kind of a representation we

562
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,360
call that a model

563
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,679
even in those even in those efforts to

564
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,480
try to be precise we have to leave open

565
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,640
a little bit of latitude a little bit of

566
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,159
wiggle room

567
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,679
because

568
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,320
as you pointed out you can have a

569
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,120
dynamic causal model and to get into an

570
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,440
argument whether or not that's the

571
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,039
appropriate model it should be an

572
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,559
acyclic one

573
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,480
right for example that was what you were

574
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,799
saying and

575
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,039
that kind of gets you going down a path

576
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,559
of arguing about

577
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,000
which is the right

578
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,440
tool as opposed to saying do tools

579
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,400
leverage

580
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,480
right i think that's what maybe that's

581
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,240
what i was reading into

582
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,400
what you were trying to say

583
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,880
that's all

584
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,520
thanks dean um blue and then majeed

585
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,159
so i think this kind of goes into um

586
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,840
what dean was saying about

587
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,520
scale-friendly versus scale-free and so

588
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,400
like with a markov blanket and with like

589
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,840
this um

590
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,200
you know

591
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,320
uh denotation of a module whether it's

592
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,679
vertical or horizontal uh a horizontal

593
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,840
or vertical mod module

594
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,640
um

595
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,440
you know we impute the markov blanket on

596
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,760
whatever scale we're trying to

597
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,760
separate conditionally

598
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,320
so i just wanted to to bring that that

599
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,760
point um

600
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,520
back in and also um that this idea of

601
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,799
maybe like

602
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,280
in incomplete

603
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,720
partitioning

604
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,360
so i mean if there was a a complete

605
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,880
partition around each module um there

606
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,200
would be like no ability to transfer

607
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,840
information from module to module

608
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,679
and in the brain i mean we do know that

609
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,159
that definitely um

610
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,679
some

611
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,520
the pieces have to communicate to make

612
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,520
the entire brain or it wouldn't be

613
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,760
considered an organ you know we wouldn't

614
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,360
be able to mark off blanket you know

615
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,799
these this idea of nested markov

616
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,120
blankets so i don't know about this

617
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,039
information encapsulation or or

618
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,240
information

619
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,720
leakiness magetta would be nice if you

620
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,120
um maybe kind of

621
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,879
unpacked that a little bit more for us

622
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,120
yes the information encapsulation

623
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,000
topic

624
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,919
so uh the thing is that i can't see uh

625
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,320
for some reason i can't see you in this

626
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,559
picture and i have to shift to the

627
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,400
youtube page in order to see you and

628
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,720
it's called you can maybe go to on the

629
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,279
bottom bar toggle tile view

630
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,919
there's like i use that but

631
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,600
it's all right

632
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,400
it's for some reason i can't see that

633
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,880
there are pages of people but i cannot

634
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,360
just see your faces it is

635
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,960
it shows

636
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,840
d the initial

637
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,200
and b

638
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,200
it may have to do with what countries

639
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,279
we're all in which is totally fine at

640
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,200
least we have audio

641
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,080
let me try it once more with well oh yes

642
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,120
at least we have audio so very well

643
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,880
so uh

644
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,320
uh

645
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,120
uh

646
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,840
well about information encapsulation uh

647
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,320
shelley ex try to explain that in terms

648
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,919
of that bob alice metaphor

649
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,919
great

650
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,360
yeah information encapsulation as

651
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,000
applied to the bob alice

652
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,440
parable all right very well so

653
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,279
for one thing this information

654
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,400
encapsulation is one of the features of

655
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,360
uh jerry fodor's original statement of

656
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,279
uh the thesis of modularity and so

657
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,640
uh

658
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,279
which which is quite uh

659
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,760
flexible a flexible thesis and motives

660
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,480
so

661
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,679
for me

662
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,520
in the way that i see that

663
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,440
model relativity

664
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,640
entails this kind of

665
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,960
modularity information encapsulation

666
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,600
because in order to have model and again

667
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,440
it can be stated in terms of market

668
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,120
blankets and whether the mark of

669
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,440
blankets are embodied or nested or not

670
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,679
is itself another issue but the very

671
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,000
fact that we can use markov blanket or

672
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,799
markovian models it indicates that we

673
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,919
can we are able to set some sort of

674
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:26,880
in

675
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,120
barriers conditional independence

676
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,159
between

677
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,200
uh internal and external spaces so in

678
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,720
order to state this free energy

679
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,840
principle of crystalline there's uh

680
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,840
interpret these spaces in terms of

681
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,039
active spaces and sensory spaces but at

682
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,760
the same time it indicates that there is

683
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,760
some sort of barrier even though if the

684
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,120
barrier is conditional and probabilistic

685
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,039
i do not think that for information

686
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,360
encapsulation we need anything stronger

687
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,240
than

688
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,159
this kind of

689
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,320
flexible conditional barrier between

690
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,880
inside and outside or between different

691
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,080
spaces

692
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,720
and this is the point that uh so when i

693
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,159
was watching your discussion in the

694
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,360
previous uh session zero three five

695
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,320
point one uh i saw that this metaphor of

696
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,279
bob and

697
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,360
alice came out and there was the

698
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,960
question of whether there is any sort of

699
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,440
cause or relation between them and

700
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,760
whether the relation between them is

701
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,799
anyway correlated so as i argued in the

702
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,039
paper they may be some sort of causal

703
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,840
relation or correlation uh

704
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,480
which can be stated in terms of internal

705
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,480
interventionist approaches which are of

706
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,080
course liable to

707
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,720
their own uh

708
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,559
to other sorts of criticism that we

709
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,440
don't

710
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,919
need to discuss right though but

711
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:46,720
uh

712
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,200
i think that information encapsulation

713
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,159
doesn't need anything that stronger than

714
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,080
the general model relativity that i

715
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,159
tried to advertise advocate in this

716
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,960
paper so the main point is that

717
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,960
regardless of whether or not there is

718
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,039
any kind of causal relation

719
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,880
actual relationship between the actions

720
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,799
of bob and the actions of uh alice or

721
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,559
perhaps i have to call them

722
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:11,600
uh

723
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,760
charles and lucy in order to

724
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,039
be more loyal to the ruler to the

725
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,080
soul of

726
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,399
the tale of two cities uh the thing is

727
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,960
that to the extent that the information

728
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,159
in each unit is not available accessible

729
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,559
to the other unit we can speak of

730
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,279
information encapsulation and then we

731
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,520
are making models i mean if we can't set

732
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,080
any kind of distinction between internal

733
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,799
and

734
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,520
external spaces and if we can't in the

735
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,159
same way that we may not be

736
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,960
able to set a distinction between models

737
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,279
and their targets there wouldn't be any

738
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,039
modeling practice there wouldn't be any

739
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,799
scientific activity on the other hand if

740
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,720
we are able to set a distinction between

741
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,640
internalized external

742
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,039
or any kind of distinction between

743
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,080
uh

744
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,960
models and their target

745
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,799
we would be able to

746
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,039
to state some sort of conditional

747
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,159
barrier

748
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,080
it still doesn't indicate that there is

749
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,320
no kind of information

750
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,200
uh

751
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,960
uh

752
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,039
so it setting the barrier by itself

753
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,880
doesn't show that the information in one

754
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,960
block is not available to the other

755
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,240
black but

756
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,559
uh the yeah and i can't see the uh

757
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:27,440
yeah

758
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,440
i i was fascinated by this picture when

759
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,880
i was watching your discussion in the

760
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,520
previous session so uh in terms of the

761
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,760
relationship between bob and alice the

762
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,640
action of bob brushing the teeth is

763
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,919
a correlated with what alice does in the

764
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,039
other

765
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,679
unit but it has been assumed that the

766
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,399
information in the unit is not available

767
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,720
the information in bob unit is not

768
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,039
available to alice and vice versa even

769
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,640
though the information

770
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,520
may be available to us as observers or

771
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,559
if we

772
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,039
contrive another observer a third person

773
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,200
the information might be available to

774
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,840
her to the observer but to the extent

775
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,080
that the information in each unit is not

776
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,000
available to the person in the other

777
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,080
units i think that we can speak of some

778
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,679
sort of partial information

779
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,480
encapsulation

780
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,320
thanks very

781
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,640
uh

782
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,919
interesting

783
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,840
if we couldn't i just really like

784
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,200
calling that part about how if we

785
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,440
couldn't make a distinction between the

786
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,200
target system and the model

787
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,600
between the territory and the map then

788
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,440
it's not modeling so it's kind of like

789
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,600
well when you kick a football does it

790
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,039
model a parabola well it doesn't have

791
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:41,919
the

792
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,320
modeling the self model the integrated

793
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,559
world model whatever one wants to call

794
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,080
it such that it is just

795
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,320
the actual causal relationships that

796
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,600
it's engaging in the world and no more

797
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,799
whereas

798
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,559
cognitive entities

799
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,480
like scientists

800
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,740
are engaging in

801
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,840
[Music]

802
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,760
modeling and then that means that they

803
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,799
are able to engage in counter factuals

804
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,519
in thinking through other minds

805
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,960
they are reducing their uncertainty

806
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,200
from

807
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,559
a partial information encapsulation

808
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:21,440
view

809
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,440
and sometimes you get more information

810
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,440
than the system has

811
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,440
available

812
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,200
but other times it's radically less

813
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,159
and so it's kind of like an application

814
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,200
of a markov blanket partitioning

815
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,360
with some

816
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,880
non-markov concepts from philosophy of

817
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,159
science

818
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,039
to the scientists investigating target

819
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,159
systems

820
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:49,519
getting partial measurements that's

821
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,320
their observations coming in

822
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,399
and then they're updating their hidden

823
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,480
state inference

824
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,240
about what they think is happening the

825
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,600
likelihood of different hypotheses

826
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,678
just like any active entity would

827
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,000
well if i may elaborate a bit more on

828
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
this and it returns to the question of

829
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,720
cognitive realism uh i think that

830
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,360
despite speaking of all of this model

831
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,519
relativity it doesn't need to lead to

832
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,679
some sort of global or

833
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,559
uh general form of anti-realism because

834
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,039
well uh a part of my activity in the

835
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,720
past years was

836
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,559
dedicated to developing some sort of

837
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,120
cognitive reality that is based on flip

838
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,240
assuming that the practice of scientific

839
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,440
model making is underpinned by

840
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,360
the dynamical interaction between

841
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,760
scientists or groups of scientists and

842
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,080
their environment so

843
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,640
this kind of model relativity

844
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,559
i mean the relation between free energy

845
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,399
principle and

846
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,880
model based science is very complicated

847
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,640
and it is not something that is directly

848
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,039
related to this aspect of them of this

849
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,440
paper but this paper is a piece of a

850
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,880
larger project that has been

851
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,960
finding its own shape in the past few

852
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,039
years and it is about the

853
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,600
uh as i say the general idea here is

854
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,720
that in the same even though

855
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,720
the free energy principle the

856
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,559
theoretical framework experimental

857
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,039
activity that

858
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,120
is embodied in the research stream that

859
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,799
leads to the development of free energy

860
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,000
principle

861
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,960
is

862
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,799
basically some sort of model based

863
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,039
scientific activity on the other hand if

864
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,399
you are interested in explaining

865
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,159
scientific activity and scientific model

866
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,919
making and if you are naturalist we are

867
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,559
interested in finding good natural

868
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,799
explanations for that we have to look

869
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,120
into the underpinning natural mechanism

870
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,799
that makes scientific model making

871
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,840
possible right and a good place to look

872
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,600
for that is

873
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,760
the scientific accounts of the

874
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,440
interaction between the agent the

875
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,000
organism and the environment and because

876
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,080
free energy principle provides a viable

877
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,240
account of the relation between agents

878
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,960
or as i discussed in my more recent work

879
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,360
a group of agents which is the community

880
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,440
of scientists and their environment both

881
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,280
social environment and biological

882
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,520
environment we can as well grow in

883
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,119
scientific model making in the

884
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,040
mechanisms of free energy principles so

885
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,839
the situation is quite complicated and

886
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,639
runs in both direction

887
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,040
we like running in both

888
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,599
directions

889
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,399
so i guess that's okay

890
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:31,359
um

891
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,119
so we have a few different

892
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,639
ways we could go dean or blue do you

893
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,679
want to ask a question or we can go to

894
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,879
one that we've previously written down

895
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,918
can i ask a quick question daniel yes

896
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,320
yeah so

897
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,320
in the in the point one blue brought up

898
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,879
something that i'm still sort of

899
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,040
trying to untangle when she talked she

900
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,000
was asking about genes in particular and

901
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,119
how it might relate to what

902
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,880
this paper was

903
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,200
potentially pointing to at least it

904
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,079
raised the specter around the idea

905
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,320
of so

906
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,640
information encapsulation

907
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,440
do we need time in order for us to be

908
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,000
able to take a measure or put a boundary

909
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,200
around

910
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,200
or encapsulate or somehow

911
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,599
mark in a markovian way

912
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,000
decide where the partition is

913
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,280
and

914
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,400
so

915
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,160
i'm still trying to figure out whether

916
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,520
or not

917
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,320
we are talking about

918
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,640
a world where because i think a world

919
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,480
exists where there are two things going

920
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,359
into

921
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,880
not necessarily

922
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,839
the same direction we got one thing

923
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,359
where we look at the world and we ask

924
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,119
ourselves whether something was

925
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,440
completed we do a completion analysis we

926
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,320
take an account and i think models

927
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,720
fit nicely into that world what i

928
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,119
thought this paper

929
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,960
raised some some ideas around was

930
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,440
is that half of the if is that half of

931
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,880
the whole picture is the other half

932
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,200
do models and and being modular allow us

933
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,040
to include

934
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,440
or make sure that we have included

935
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,839
everything that we need in order to be

936
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,800
able to get the best sense of what's on

937
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,880
the other side of that divide so when

938
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,599
we're making these inferences we can use

939
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,000
models as a way to account for things

940
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,960
but are we also able to project off of

941
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,599
that and and sort of make better guesses

942
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,359
better inferences

943
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,200
i've used that i've used the expression

944
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,720
prediction matter expert and so i i was

945
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,640
wondering again

946
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,880
those words weren't exactly used in this

947
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,680
paper but was that part of what we were

948
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,079
trying to sort of dig down to is it is

949
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,480
it is it just a matter of

950
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,599
people use models people people's models

951
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,880
account for things in in in certain ways

952
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,520
but they also if we don't get too hung

953
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,079
up on the precision of that account they

954
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,680
can also be

955
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,520
sort of fuzzy and left

956
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,160
semi-open and give us an opportunity to

957
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,880
also be creative and decide

958
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,720
essentially whether or not we have

959
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,800
enough information to make that next

960
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,720
best guess so just kind of wondering

961
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,959
about that

962
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,480
yes please all right very well that's a

963
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,560
that's a very brilliant point so uh it

964
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,480
it comes back to the issue of

965
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,040
completeness of models their accuracy

966
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,119
certainty and that sort of stuff and

967
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,040
completely agree so

968
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,560
uh it uh

969
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,880
it has been taken for granted and i

970
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,640
think that part of it

971
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,920
part of this interest has been rised by

972
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,359
richard levine's uh paper the strategy

973
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,000
of model-based science in population

974
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,280
biology that we are making models but

975
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,680
the accuracy of models is very important

976
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,920
so the models have to be accurate enough

977
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,560
to represent uh to do the

978
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,040
representational task well and

979
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,880
they have to be complete in the sense

980
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,280
that they have to be detailed you know i

981
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,520
think that this is very good point but

982
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,480
look

983
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,320
uh how much

984
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,680
accuracy is enough i mean we can speak

985
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,000
of completeness of models but

986
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,480
uh absolutely complete models i think

987
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,119
that uh i've been reading a shorter

988
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,760
story from a north and american uh

989
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,640
writer the on the executive of science

990
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,400
or something like that which is the

991
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,320
story of people in an empire who are

992
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,119
trying model map makers cartographers

993
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,040
who are trying to make maps of the

994
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,200
empire and they are very obsessive they

995
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,359
want to have conflict maps but they end

996
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:48,240
up with having maps that are

997
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,440
oh all right perfect poor house yes yes

998
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,359
precisely so they end up with having

999
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:56,079
maps that are as big as the empire

1000
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,520
itself so

1001
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,240
uh then at least so and it's completely

1002
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,280
true that

1003
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,680
levin's two speak of accuracy and

1004
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,000
detailedness of models but

1005
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,599
uh then again

1006
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,839
uh

1007
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,119
uh

1008
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:11,920
uh

1009
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,520
completeness in it so details i mean

1010
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,320
more details are not necessarily leading

1011
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,880
to better models because accuracy works

1012
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,400
only in combination with some other

1013
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,000
virtues such as

1014
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,720
generality and precision of predictions

1015
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,680
so

1016
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,960
even though

1017
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,240
uh so the other question is that home

1018
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,640
how to find how to strike the right

1019
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,800
balance

1020
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,440
between generality one hand and accuracy

1021
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,440
and precision of models on the other

1022
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,079
hand and i'm tempted to say that i

1023
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,160
understand that i'm just trying to point

1024
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,240
to the same direction to speaking of the

1025
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,760
rule of modal scientific models and

1026
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,760
model making but then again how much

1027
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,839
precision and

1028
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,079
accuracy have to be taken into account

1029
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:56,880
and

1030
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,880
have to be related to

1031
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,800
uh have to put

1032
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,160
in harmony with generality again i would

1033
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,839
i'm tempted to say that it is again a

1034
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,400
matter of interest and explanatory and

1035
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,960
predictive goals of the model maker

1036
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,800
so

1037
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,920
i will ask a question from the live chat

1038
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,280
from stephen

1039
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,480
so stephen majeed was curious about your

1040
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,800
understanding of

1041
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,359
the relationship in which practitioners

1042
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,280
seek to apply low dimensional

1043
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,920
computational modeling with other scales

1044
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,079
of knowing in uncertain and dynamic

1045
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,280
environments

1046
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,520
so for example there's the awareness and

1047
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,800
the perception of the duck rabbit

1048
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,160
and then there are the affordances

1049
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,800
in our niche that go beyond just sort of

1050
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,760
a visual toy example

1051
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,920
so open-ended question about what um

1052
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,960
you might think about that kind of

1053
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,520
application of modeling perhaps in a

1054
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,000
social setting

1055
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,880
do the models in the social setting need

1056
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,480
to be dimensional or what if i see that

1057
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,560
in terms of the relation between

1058
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,000
dynamical causal models and

1059
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,599
dags so for example i

1060
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,000
assume that dags could provide some sort

1061
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,040
of low dimensional model that is capable

1062
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,160
of representing the network aspects or

1063
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,118
something like that

1064
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,480
yeah i think that's a

1065
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,440
good

1066
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,040
question i mean continue with that and

1067
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,200
i'll write some things down

1068
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,920
all right very well so uh

1069
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,640
uh so

1070
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,920
uh

1071
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,599
i'd like to i'm tempted to repeat this

1072
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:58,800
uh well

1073
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,480
i think that it provides a good example

1074
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,680
so

1075
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,920
take the verb of social relation or

1076
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,760
social events that we may want to model

1077
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,280
so

1078
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,280
this provides actually a good nice

1079
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,319
example of multi-scale or

1080
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,640
multi-scale nature of target phenomena

1081
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,839
so this

1082
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,240
uh the social events

1083
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,640
is constituted by the relationship

1084
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,640
between people and event and environment

1085
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,440
and uh well people are actual human

1086
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,280
being they are

1087
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,400
biological entities constitute of

1088
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,160
uh

1089
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,079
people who are

1090
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:42,079
self-organizing system and we are able

1091
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,400
to explain people and their behavior at

1092
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,760
some level

1093
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,760
on the basis of

1094
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,200
uh

1095
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,440
biological facts so we may be uh able to

1096
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,319
use

1097
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,079
some sort of modeling system that are

1098
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,240
applicable in biology or that sort of

1099
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,720
stuff but at a larger scale when we try

1100
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,520
to model the relation between different

1101
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,920
people as nodes in networks and that

1102
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,560
sort of stuff we may need to change our

1103
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,319
modeling device to

1104
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:11,599
i don't know

1105
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,480
devices that are good at representing

1106
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,640
uh a small board networks or that sort

1107
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,240
of stuff

1108
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,599
if that

1109
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,319
does make any sense i think that i just

1110
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,000
get confused by the point about low

1111
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,640
dimensionality of models

1112
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,680
in social systems but

1113
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:29,950
um

1114
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:32,000
[Music]

1115
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,560
it could be a steven ism or one way at

1116
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,560
least that i would read that would be

1117
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,079
like the

1118
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,800
maps that we make are lower dimensional

1119
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,800
than the territories they have a

1120
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,720
different resolution but also they don't

1121
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,720
consider they're not trying to be a full

1122
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,359
inventory of every variable in the

1123
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,440
system like there might be a thousand

1124
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,680
chemicals circulating in our blood but

1125
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,359
then somebody might make a lower

1126
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,599
dimensional model with just blood sugar

1127
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,440
or two-dimensional model with just you

1128
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,760
know cortisol and blood sugar

1129
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,410
and um

1130
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:03,599
[Music]

1131
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,760
i think it's uh

1132
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,280
an active inference

1133
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,920
open question when we make lower

1134
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,720
dimensional models of complex

1135
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,280
multi-scale target phenomena like you

1136
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,640
addressed

1137
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:16,890
um

1138
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:19,839
[Music]

1139
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,280
it

1140
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,119
uh i mean i don't want to jump to and

1141
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,200
answer but it seems clear like that the

1142
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,680
philosophical

1143
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,880
implications of a lower dimensional map

1144
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,760
shouldn't be confused with

1145
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,560
systems accounting of the territory

1146
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,760
because

1147
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,720
it's

1148
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,319
not the same thing

1149
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:44,720
and um yeah steven just followed up in

1150
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,119
the chat he just said generally how does

1151
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,839
majeed see the informational or physical

1152
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:52,240
sense of systems

1153
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,560
like some people talk about systems in

1154
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,319
the more ontological sense about the

1155
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,160
parts and how they're connected

1156
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,000
other times we're talking about systems

1157
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,520
informationally

1158
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,520
like our analysis of the measurement

1159
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,760
data and so the system like the default

1160
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,440
mode network is a connectivity pattern

1161
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,599
that isn't necessarily the anatomical

1162
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,240
connection so how do we think about

1163
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,160
these different kinds of systems

1164
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,000
and maybe where does the fep come into

1165
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,599
play with that

1166
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,640
all right very well uh uh that's a very

1167
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,119
good question so i'm a tag you're a

1168
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,520
structural realist so i'm committed to

1169
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,520
some sort of information theoretic

1170
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,880
ontology and i think that uh

1171
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,880
well and i say that i'm defending some

1172
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,440
sort of embodied informational uh

1173
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,520
structure realism so

1174
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,480
uh

1175
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,240
when i say that i was advocating

1176
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,000
cognitive realism it was it would have

1177
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,520
been more precise to say that i'm

1178
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,319
advocating cognitive search or realism

1179
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:49,920
which is actually the title of the book

1180
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,800
that i wrote about this topic so

1181
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,680
uh

1182
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,760
and what rule free energy principle

1183
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,160
plays in this context uh is a very

1184
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,880
complex rule so let's assume that we

1185
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,160
have the structure of scientific

1186
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,079
theories or scientific models on the one

1187
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,160
hand so let's assume that we have a

1188
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,800
class of models

1189
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,280
or scientific models on on the one hand

1190
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,720
and on the other hand we have or causal

1191
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,720
structure of the word which is or target

1192
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,119
system something that we are trying to

1193
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,640
represent by or scientific model so uh

1194
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,520
when i speak about a structural realism

1195
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,520
uh i think that it has been the official

1196
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,760
wisdom of philosophy of science for the

1197
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,880
past

1198
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,240
uh 15 years or so and

1199
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,560
people were trying to use different kind

1200
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,839
of

1201
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:39,359
formal

1202
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,839
vehicles such as set theory model theory

1203
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:43,680
category theory to speak of this

1204
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,000
representational relation between the

1205
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,160
class of models and the causal structure

1206
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:52,640
of the world right but i uh so my beef

1207
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,960
with that was that the

1208
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,520
formal relations such as isomorphism do

1209
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,560
not contribute to strengthening realism

1210
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,680
because

1211
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,400
these formal models such as isomorphism

1212
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,400
are not informed to i mean you can use

1213
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,560
isomorphism to relate

1214
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,280
any two sets together provided that

1215
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,520
there have enough number of set members

1216
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,240
so it doesn't contribute to

1217
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,359
uh realism much so what i was trying to

1218
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,920
do was to use feb free energy principle

1219
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,880
to account for the class of models and

1220
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,559
their target system in the world

1221
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,240
assuming that

1222
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,000
scientists are

1223
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,040
self-organizing system that aim at

1224
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,800
minimizing the

1225
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,720
discrepancy between their models and

1226
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,680
their target system in the real world so

1227
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,920
uh but it is my take i mean it is

1228
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,680
something that i'm trying to develop i

1229
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,400
won't i don't say that this is the

1230
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,599
uh

1231
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:52,559
this is a very well uh this is not the

1232
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:55,119
orthodox view either in the philosophy

1233
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,839
of science common commodity or in the

1234
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:00,240
flip community but i think that

1235
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,559
uh when we speak of representation in

1236
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,960
terms of the representational capacity

1237
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,880
of the model of models in terms of the

1238
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,040
relation between class of models

1239
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,160
and causal structure in the world

1240
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,440
free energy principle can play a very

1241
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,920
subtle and

1242
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,839
a specific rule there

1243
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,040
maybe we're in a little strange neck of

1244
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:30,559
the woods but i think having

1245
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:33,520
scientists as real entities

1246
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,079
doing something

1247
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,599
seems at home

1248
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:38,880
here

1249
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,119
blue

1250
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,240
so i think you presented us with a lot

1251
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,280
of things that don't contribute to

1252
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,599
realism but is there anything that you

1253
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,839
think does contribute to realism

1254
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,079
[Music]

1255
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,319
well

1256
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:05,040
could you elaborate cbs uh i mean uh

1257
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,280
because of the model relativity or

1258
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,160
because of free energy principle

1259
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,079
well well so like in in terms of

1260
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:15,520
cognitive structural realism like what

1261
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,400
what

1262
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,359
does provide evidence for the cognitive

1263
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,359
structural realist argument i mean like

1264
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,119
you've given us a lot of things that

1265
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:24,960
you've deconstructed that but is there

1266
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,880
can you take the opposite side and

1267
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,319
provide evidence for cognitive

1268
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,280
structural realism or

1269
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,319
fair enough

1270
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:33,839
uh look

1271
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,520
the general

1272
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:39,839
i think that the general arguments for

1273
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,160
scientific realism in general have been

1274
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,480
always stated in some sort of

1275
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,160
uh numerical arguments assuming that if

1276
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,559
science was not representing the

1277
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:52,079
structure of reality it would be a

1278
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,280
matter of cosmic co in the empirical

1279
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,440
adequacy of science has been a matter of

1280
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,559
cosmic

1281
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:01,200
coincidence so there are some sort of

1282
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,680
uh arguments usual arguments in the

1283
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,319
philosophy of science that try to

1284
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,720
relate empirical adequacy of scientific

1285
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,480
theories to

1286
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,119
approximate truth of scientific theories

1287
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,400
right and

1288
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,880
uh structural realism just tries to

1289
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,200
model this representational relation the

1290
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,240
veracity of or variety verity called

1291
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,640
representational relations in terms of

1292
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,359
say theory and modal theory so in my

1293
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:30,000
view it would be more realistic to

1294
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,160
consider scientists as actual human

1295
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,200
being constitute by flesh and blood who

1296
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,000
aim at minimizing the

1297
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,400
discrepancy between their models and the

1298
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,720
world i would say that the evidence that

1299
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,079
i could provide for this take on realism

1300
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:47,119
uh

1301
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,960
could be

1302
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,480
has its roots in uh evolutionary biology

1303
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,440
because

1304
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,640
uh if

1305
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,680
if we had not been successful in

1306
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,760
minimizing the discrepancy between our

1307
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:00,960
models

1308
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,599
reality we would also fail to maximize

1309
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:05,520
or survey well so

1310
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,400
uh i think that i can in as a way of

1311
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,400
evidence or argument i can try to

1312
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,760
ground the argument the usual scientific

1313
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,319
realist argument that aim to relate the

1314
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,319
empirical adequacy of science to truths

1315
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:23,440
of theories i can try to

1316
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,880
relate the or success to maximizing or

1317
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,559
survival as an evidence of

1318
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:34,000
or success in minimizing the discrepancy

1319
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,920
between our scientific models and their

1320
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,760
target system the causal structure of

1321
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,240
reality

1322
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,400
thanks that also plays into some other

1323
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,839
discussions we've been having about like

1324
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:48,480
the objective function of science and

1325
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,839
this sort of multi-scale nature that

1326
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:54,559
scientific fields research labs and

1327
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:57,040
organizations and individuals are

1328
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,319
engaged in

1329
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:00,880
pragmatic and epistemic

1330
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,000
actions and so in active inference we

1331
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,359
have this

1332
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:08,400
scale-friendly approach which a priori

1333
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,400
doesn't require a specific scale of

1334
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,760
analysis which is what you brought up

1335
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,680
with markov blankets

1336
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,800
and

1337
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,119
any specific application

1338
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:19,440
will entail a specific scale of analysis

1339
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,160
because it's empirical and so it's this

1340
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,720
uh one foot in both world just like

1341
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,400
linear models are

1342
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,359
the model doesn't have uh a priori scale

1343
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:31,280
but then when we specify it we do make

1344
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,119
it specific and what's interesting about

1345
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:36,400
active is that we could think about this

1346
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,880
action and perception loop

1347
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,200
of different kinds of nested entities

1348
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,880
now definitely it's going to get complex

1349
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,520
for any nested entity

1350
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,119
and then it brings a whole other level

1351
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:48,960
with a strange loop

1352
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,280
and the meta modeling and the cognizer

1353
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,880
and the thinking about oneself that's

1354
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,119
like a whole another level

1355
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:56,640
but just

1356
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,119
a way to talk about vertically and

1357
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:01,440
horizontally interacting

1358
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,000
systems is an awesome start

1359
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,280
so blue

1360
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,559
and then uh

1361
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,000
either majeed you could respond to what

1362
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,119
blue says or dave feel free to say hello

1363
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:12,720
i just wanted to

1364
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,559
compliment you on that awesome like

1365
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,200
prelude to like next week's discussion

1366
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,839
about modeling ourselves right so like

1367
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:21,440
it's a very interesting

1368
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,240
perspective when when the modeler is the

1369
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,240
model is the modeler is the model it's a

1370
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,240
loop

1371
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:32,640
cool um dave would you like to say hello

1372
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,640
or ask anything

1373
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,400
or hi um nothing particular to ask i'm

1374
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,440
sorry to be late i've been in

1375
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,480
marinating myself in neuropsychoanalysis

1376
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,240
for the last week and a half so that's

1377
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,480
my closest i've got to an excuse for

1378
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,640
being late

1379
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,160
fair enough

1380
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,040
um

1381
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:53,839
so

1382
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:55,760
let's go to a few of the other topics

1383
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,839
that we had written down

1384
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:00,960
so i think before we get to this more

1385
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,680
the

1386
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,880
the liftoff on the post dot 2

1387
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,480
let's talk a little bit about

1388
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,079
intransitivity

1389
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,160
because in our discussions we had looked

1390
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,559
at intransitivity in a preference

1391
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:14,319
framework where intransitivity of

1392
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:16,400
preferences has been transformational in

1393
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,480
microeconomics for example

1394
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,240
and then there's intransitivity from a

1395
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,720
game theoretic perspective

1396
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,800
like the rock paper scissors and just

1397
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,520
strategic intransitivity which also

1398
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,960
brings us back to

1399
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,720
the population biology modeling but you

1400
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,400
were discussing um intransitivity in a

1401
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,040
specific context which is about the

1402
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,680
predictive processing architectures

1403
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,079
and models of cognitive architecture so

1404
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:45,920
could you maybe unpack a little bit what

1405
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,400
does untrans intransitivity

1406
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,960
mean in that context who disagrees

1407
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,079
what would be different if it weren't

1408
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:54,559
that way

1409
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,880
uh yeah sure so

1410
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:57,760
uh

1411
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,920
i think that the uh so uh

1412
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:06,279
the thing is that

1413
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:08,720
if we assume that there is translativity

1414
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,400
information could be transferred from

1415
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,160
one unit to another

1416
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,040
uh

1417
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,599
we would have a serious problem in

1418
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,400
defending uh i was thinking of saying

1419
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,000
something more about active inference

1420
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,880
and objective inferences because but i

1421
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,720
will put that in the background for the

1422
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,040
time being but the thing is that

1423
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,520
uh the point that i was trying to make

1424
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,640
in the

1425
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,960
paper was that this all of this talk

1426
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,720
about uh the distinction between

1427
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,280
transitivity and intransitivity only

1428
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,359
works with regard to

1429
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:40,160
uh

1430
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:43,680
invoking a specific kind of model which

1431
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,760
is no wonder because the paper is about

1432
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,079
the significance of scientific models so

1433
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:49,880
we can defend

1434
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,240
transitivity or intransitivity of the

1435
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,160
cognitive structure depending on the

1436
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,559
kind of modeling that we summon so if we

1437
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,559
assume that the only kind of

1438
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:01,520
models that are

1439
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,520
allowable in the context of free energy

1440
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:08,000
principle or dynamical causal models we

1441
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,480
will end up by

1442
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,400
a straightforward rejection of

1443
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,640
modularity but this doesn't need to be

1444
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,400
the case because free energy principle

1445
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,000
is not all about

1446
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,799
uh representing the actual causal

1447
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,200
mechanisms neurophysiological mechanisms

1448
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,559
of the brain so uh this is as much about

1449
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:28,400
representing this neurophysiological

1450
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:32,400
structures as the general properties of

1451
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,079
the the

1452
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:35,839
it is as much

1453
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:38,960
about representing the local significant

1454
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,280
uh neurophysiological mechanism as it is

1455
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,440
about explaining the relation between

1456
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,920
different units and different component

1457
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,040
counterparts that are uh implemented in

1458
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:52,400
the brain so it is supposed to be

1459
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,119
a theory a unifying theory of the brain

1460
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:57,040
and

1461
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,359
in some sense it may indicate that we do

1462
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:02,000
not need modularity enough because if we

1463
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,920
want to defend some sort of unity

1464
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,119
between different

1465
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:06,880
components between different parts of

1466
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,040
the structure we do not need to be able

1467
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:09,760
to

1468
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,000
modulate the brain and the paper tries

1469
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,559
to argue the reverse that

1470
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:16,319
speaking of the connection between

1471
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:19,279
different parts

1472
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:23,440
in terms of mainly in terms of

1473
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,680
and again it comes back to the

1474
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:26,960
distinction between effective

1475
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,319
functionality and functional

1476
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,319
connectivity that you discuss very well

1477
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:31,920
most probably better than i would be

1478
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,839
able to in the previous session

1479
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:37,040
would be a matter of uh

1480
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,319
the

1481
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:41,440
kind of uh properties of the cognitive

1482
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,079
system that we aim to model by invoking

1483
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:45,760
free energy principle whether there are

1484
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,599
local properties of the brain or the

1485
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,240
global unifying properties of the brain

1486
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:52,480
and if you want to

1487
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,440
model the brain in its unity we also

1488
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,960
need to be able to speak about the

1489
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,799
connection between different parts and

1490
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:00,400
from the very fact that we assume that

1491
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,160
there are different parts

1492
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:05,200
uh it follows that we have to

1493
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,839
assume that there is some sort of

1494
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:09,839
encapsulation or a weak point a moderate

1495
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:13,520
form of modularity

1496
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:20,400
very interesting thank you any other

1497
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,880
thoughts on that

1498
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,319
well then i'm going to go to a hard

1499
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:26,640
question which is

1500
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:30,079
what makes a model active inference

1501
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:32,720
is that a uh

1502
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,480
in the in the circle or out of the

1503
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,599
circle is it a binary classifier

1504
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:41,520
is it a zero to one scale

1505
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,720
what will happen when people disagree

1506
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,839
does simply any model involving action

1507
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:49,440
and inference

1508
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:53,200
qualify as active inference

1509
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:53,870
um

1510
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:55,520
[Music]

1511
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,920
we have asked it on a few previous

1512
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,440
discussions and i think we've gotten a

1513
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,040
range of answers but it's definitely an

1514
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,640
important one to

1515
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,440
revisit from this

1516
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,319
model-based science

1517
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:10,960
perspective

1518
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:20,319
well i mean i have been defending some

1519
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:22,160
sort of pan psychism i have been

1520
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,920
marshaling free energy principle in

1521
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,119
defense of versions of pan psychism so

1522
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:30,960
uh i'm tempted to say that any kind of

1523
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,520
self-organizing system that can minimize

1524
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,440
the discrepancy between its internal

1525
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,760
models and the environment

1526
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,240
is capable of forming active inferences

1527
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,280
but

1528
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,240
uh

1529
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,880
it is not directly to

1530
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,880
i mean it is not specifically related to

1531
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,359
this issue of modal relativity unless we

1532
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:50,559
assume that

1533
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:51,440
uh

1534
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,480
model

1535
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,799
relativity is quite obvious it is

1536
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,960
everywhere in scientific activity i

1537
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,319
cannot find any specific relation

1538
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:01,440
between

1539
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,160
that kind of

1540
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:07,040
pan psyches account of active inference

1541
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,280
and a specific discussion of model

1542
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,280
relativity

1543
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,960
dana can ask a question

1544
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,599
yep dean and then blue

1545
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:21,280
sorry blue maybe you want to go first

1546
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,960
you put your hand up and i just blurted

1547
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,880
out go ahead dean

1548
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,200
okay sorry about that thanks

1549
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:30,480
so in at the end of the last of the last

1550
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,720
live stream there was a question posted

1551
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:35,440
in the live chat about so does active i

1552
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,880
know maybe this ties in with what you

1553
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,799
were just asking daniel does active

1554
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:40,240
inference what does active inference

1555
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,839
tell us about the model of the person

1556
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:44,160
trying to kick the ball

1557
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:47,359
and i'm i'm curious about this

1558
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:48,240
because

1559
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,400
you wrote another paper with a you

1560
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,079
co-authored a paper on active inference

1561
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:54,640
and abduction with somebody if i

1562
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,559
pronounced their last name incorrectly i

1563
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:59,520
apologize p pia taranin

1564
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:00,720
and and

1565
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,400
i'm kind of curious because i think what

1566
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,960
active inference enacting an active

1567
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,760
inference within model building

1568
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:12,000
and modularity is it it

1569
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,480
it gets us asking a question much like

1570
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,720
charles saunders pierce would ask if you

1571
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:19,599
walked in late on bob and alice

1572
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:20,799
okay

1573
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:23,440
it's nine o'clock but you're not really

1574
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,960
paying attention to the clock right now

1575
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,520
you just walk to into a room and there's

1576
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,520
on the other side of the one-way mirror

1577
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:33,520
is a is a subdivided two two cubes one

1578
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,280
with bobbin and one with alice in it but

1579
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,200
you've you've walked in

1580
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,040
and you don't have a model yet other

1581
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,400
than the fact that you're on the other

1582
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,160
side of the curtain you don't have a

1583
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,799
smiley face or a frowny face what you

1584
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:46,480
have is

1585
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,720
a moment where you have to ask

1586
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,799
if you're actively inferring and you're

1587
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:52,880
enacting this is

1588
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,520
what should i be surprised if and what

1589
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:58,880
should i not be surprised if as the as

1590
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,760
the as the stuff that's carrying out in

1591
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,359
bob's room

1592
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:05,359
somehow is

1593
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:07,599
appears to not being carried out in

1594
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,200
alice's room

1595
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,439
so

1596
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:14,880
i don't know that that modeling

1597
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,599
can can sort of segregate itself out

1598
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,960
scale free

1599
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,599
from the idea of of the specifics like

1600
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:24,240
pierce would say if you walked in and

1601
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,880
into a room and somebody opposite of you

1602
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,880
had a bunch of white beans in their left

1603
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,119
hand and a bag of beans in their right

1604
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:33,440
hand and asked you as the person walking

1605
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:34,480
to the room

1606
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,799
did these beans in this one hand come

1607
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,240
from this bag

1608
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,359
you wouldn't have enough information

1609
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:43,839
to be able to give a specific

1610
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:45,680
and clear

1611
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,920
answer to that but you could start a

1612
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,839
process of modeling

1613
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:51,359
you could start

1614
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:55,039
a modularity exercise to try and gather

1615
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:57,599
from an an abductive

1616
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:00,480
sense what what what led up to this

1617
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,839
moment and so i'm just kind of wondering

1618
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:07,680
how do you how how you take this paper

1619
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:08,960
and and

1620
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,119
that example and sort of tie it in with

1621
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:12,160
some of the

1622
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,000
other work that you've been

1623
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,400
because i i'm hoping maybe i'll talk to

1624
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,480
you after this but maybe i would like to

1625
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,480
be able to review your active inference

1626
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,720
and abduction paper as well if you have

1627
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,319
time

1628
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:26,160
anyway i'm just wondering what because i

1629
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,359
think if we're looking at this from

1630
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:30,079
active inference and enacting sometimes

1631
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:32,240
we walk in and we walk in and we have to

1632
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,559
infer based on a limited amount of

1633
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:36,799
information and so i think that's what

1634
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:38,799
we're trying to do

1635
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:41,520
we're basically saying when we walk in

1636
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:44,559
do or don't be surprised if and then

1637
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:46,240
whatever plays out

1638
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,920
approximately on the on those time

1639
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,760
scales next

1640
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,920
what do you agree with

1641
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,000
yes

1642
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,160
i do agree and

1643
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:56,960
uh

1644
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:59,839
well uh i'm very happy that you uh

1645
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:01,680
mentioned that paper because i wanted to

1646
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,920
speak about that too earlier so the

1647
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,079
thing is that as i say there are two

1648
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:08,640
phases of the same project so in this

1649
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,480
project i mean in the project that has

1650
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,359
been

1651
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:14,079
uh stated in this uh a tale of two

1652
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:15,839
architectures and in another paper a

1653
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:17,680
critical analysis of mark kobe and

1654
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:21,520
monism i was emphasizing the modal base

1655
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,520
modal relative nature of active

1656
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,440
inference as an activity

1657
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:28,799
uh but the main reason why i was getting

1658
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:30,400
interested in that because of the mark

1659
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,240
of blankets because i think that marco

1660
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:35,919
blankets are also very

1661
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,400
strong and uh

1662
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,200
reliable modeling tools also for the

1663
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,119
general scientific modeling purposes so

1664
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:45,599
it is the other side of my project when

1665
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:49,119
i'm trying to ground scientific realism

1666
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:51,280
and scientific model making in active

1667
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,119
inference and free energy principles so

1668
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:55,359
this is the other side and

1669
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:56,160
uh

1670
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,200
going back to the general arguments for

1671
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,640
uh

1672
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,880
scientific realism again a strong

1673
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:05,039
version of the defense of scientific

1674
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:10,000
realism uh is reliant on invoking uh

1675
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,039
infra

1676
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:13,520
explanatory inferences by developing

1677
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:14,960
something that is called

1678
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,599
uh inference to the best explanation and

1679
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:19,280
this project that you mentioned the

1680
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,520
paper that has been written by me and

1681
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,839
arty and there is another paper

1682
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:26,480
uh we were collaborating on another

1683
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:29,839
paper uh on the same subject aims to

1684
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:32,720
show that how the general explanatory

1685
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,359
inferences how the general

1686
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:37,039
abduction is

1687
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:39,119
grounded in the process of active

1688
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:41,440
inferences right so

1689
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,280
i think that there are two sides of the

1690
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:46,079
same coin and there are two intertwined

1691
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:47,760
two interrelated

1692
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:50,400
uh projects but uh

1693
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:54,720
as i say i do not see uh so

1694
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,599
do you want to also explore the uh

1695
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:00,240
implications what of that for the

1696
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:03,039
metaphor of bob and alice i mean do you

1697
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:05,200
think that it has any specific

1698
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,280
ramifications for this

1699
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,359
bob and alice metaphor

1700
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:11,359
yeah that's that was

1701
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:13,520
that's exactly what i think it does and

1702
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:16,000
again it's a separate paper

1703
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,720
and it's another excellent excellent

1704
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,799
insight if you if you get a chance to

1705
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:23,119
read it but i think when we're trying to

1706
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:24,960
figure out what's effective and

1707
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,520
functional

1708
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:31,359
we we come in to a situation looking at

1709
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:32,880
bob and alice

1710
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,960
and and over time

1711
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,880
our model grows as well right and i

1712
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:39,440
think that's part of where

1713
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,520
my question about what is

1714
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,359
what is scale free

1715
01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:45,920
yes bob and alice are in their cubicles

1716
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,680
and those cubes are of the same

1717
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,599
dimensions and then there's a scale

1718
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:52,319
friendly part that kind of grows over

1719
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:54,960
those slices of time so yes i i actually

1720
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:57,440
do think that it would be interesting to

1721
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:00,319
sort of say when when did we walk in on

1722
01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:01,599
this

1723
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:04,319
bob analysis observation

1724
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:08,319
very well so i would say that for the uh

1725
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:10,799
moderate weak sense of encapsulation

1726
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:13,760
that is at issue in this specific paper

1727
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:16,559
a tale of two city uh it would be the

1728
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:18,880
the necessary condition is that the

1729
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:21,119
information in each unit is not

1730
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:23,200
available to them to the person in the

1731
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,920
other unit or in the other black so

1732
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,160
uh to the extent that the information

1733
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:30,799
about for example bob brushing his teeth

1734
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:33,359
is not available to alice there is some

1735
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:35,440
sort of weak encapsulation and i think

1736
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,039
that it is you know for

1737
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:39,280
establishing some sort of

1738
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,319
uh

1739
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:43,200
moderate uh modulation but the other

1740
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:46,000
part the uh the more fundamental uh the

1741
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,559
more fundamental question about the

1742
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:52,000
uh scale relativity and to what extent

1743
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,039
so

1744
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:54,960
it is some sort of scientific fact that

1745
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,280
we can choose this scale that we need on

1746
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,280
the basis of our explanatory interests

1747
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:02,000
so at this specific setting my

1748
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
explanatory interest my scientific

1749
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,680
interest was to

1750
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:09,119
come to to set the limits of the scale

1751
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:11,039
at the

1752
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:13,680
level of the rooms of bob and alice

1753
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:14,960
because i wanted to explain

1754
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,920
encapsulation so in another situation so

1755
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,520
assume that you are an information

1756
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,279
theorist and you want to develop a

1757
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:24,080
general theory of communication between

1758
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,479
these two units so you it is natural for

1759
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:28,880
you to take the point of view of the

1760
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,120
third person of another observer and

1761
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,960
then there might be another person who

1762
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:34,479
wants to speak about the relation

1763
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:37,120
between this third person and the target

1764
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:40,560
system and a techno so it made it might

1765
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,759
go observer observer all the way up and

1766
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:44,960
observable

1767
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,120
uh all the way down and it would be a

1768
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,319
matter of

1769
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:50,560
uh what you are trying to do with

1770
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:53,520
changing the scale what what goal do you

1771
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,439
aim to achieve so

1772
01:08:55,439 --> 01:08:58,719
again at some papers i i was trying to

1773
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:00,880
stay limited to the level of individual

1774
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,319
so for example when i wanted to

1775
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:06,880
model the activity of a scientist

1776
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:09,198
specifics an individual scientist i was

1777
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:11,679
focusing on the processes of

1778
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:13,520
minimization of

1779
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,520
uh

1780
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,759
predictive uh predictions at the level

1781
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:21,120
of individuals but at points i wanted to

1782
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,960
model the behavior or speak about the

1783
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,960
behavior of all scientific commodities

1784
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,719
assuming that scientific practice is a

1785
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:29,920
social act and i was

1786
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:33,120
for that reason i was trying to expand

1787
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,520
the limits of the scale and apply that

1788
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:38,080
to the old community of scientists or a

1789
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,759
specific group of scientists rather than

1790
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:42,238
individual scientists what was important

1791
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:44,238
for me and what i think is important is

1792
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:45,198
to have

1793
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:48,000
good and satisfactory justifications for

1794
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,560
changing the level to be able to explain

1795
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:51,920
clearly

1796
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,520
what was the purpose of changing the

1797
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,520
level taking it to

1798
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,840
an upper level or a lower level and i

1799
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:58,880
think that

1800
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,480
to the extent that we are speaking about

1801
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,800
encapsulation and modulation it is

1802
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,480
justifiable to

1803
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:07,920
limit the module to the specific cells

1804
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:12,560
in which bob and alice are dwelling

1805
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:17,600
so just wrote a few things down and

1806
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:18,880
maybe this

1807
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,880
captures it but the free energy

1808
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,280
principle especially as you're

1809
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,080
applying it in this um

1810
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:26,239
[Music]

1811
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:28,560
embodied informational and cognitive

1812
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:32,159
structural realism perspective the fep

1813
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:34,480
as a

1814
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,719
theory of things is providing the

1815
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:38,800
conceptual continuity for modeling

1816
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,960
different complex systems including

1817
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:42,480
scientists in the world and other

1818
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,719
processes as they engage in their niche

1819
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:47,600
and then the active inference

1820
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,640
uh

1821
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:50,880
framework we can say

1822
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:54,320
is operationalizing this imperative for

1823
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,880
persistence of different systems

1824
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,280
and then connecting that

1825
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,920
a priori process ontology

1826
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:02,719
to

1827
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:04,719
a whole host of other

1828
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:06,719
patterns motifs

1829
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:09,360
that we uh must explain in the world

1830
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,760
like abduction

1831
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,000
in the social and

1832
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,760
communication case

1833
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:18,560
and narrative information inference

1834
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:21,040
on one end of us but then on the other

1835
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,600
end we also want to have active

1836
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,800
really dial in and get at exact

1837
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,199
inference in certain cases where it's

1838
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:32,000
like we made the fmri measurements and

1839
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
we kind of want to like

1840
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
leave philosophy

1841
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,440
in the lab

1842
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:40,400
and just plug and chug this pipeline

1843
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:41,920
and we don't want that to be a pipeline

1844
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,120
of nowhere

1845
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,199
or um we don't want the output of the

1846
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:46,800
pipeline to be interpreted in a

1847
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,120
fallacious philosophical

1848
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,480
milieu

1849
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:51,440
but

1850
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,040
at the same time

1851
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,199
if we try to take that philosophical

1852
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:57,280
baggage through every step

1853
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:00,640
of the processor and the ram and the gpu

1854
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,800
we get into these little nano debates

1855
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,520
which you highlighted which is like

1856
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,560
people

1857
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:10,159
arguing whether cyclic or directed

1858
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:11,600
acyclic

1859
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,440
graphical models have philosophical

1860
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,120
impact

1861
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,840
when they're both just models that

1862
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,080
scientists chose

1863
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:23,640
for different reasons

1864
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,400
uh i have to say that you have the knock

1865
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,800
of explaining my ideas far more clearly

1866
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,159
than i can so

1867
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:34,320
here's my everybody majidi is a

1868
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,640
brilliant young man

1869
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,400
here's my next question for you because

1870
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,400
there's multiple

1871
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,920
fep

1872
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:46,480
um frontiers here you have the book

1873
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:49,440
then there's the markovian monism that

1874
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,600
we had earlier discussed

1875
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,199
the abduction one which we haven't

1876
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:55,600
gotten a chance to discuss this paper

1877
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:57,199
obviously

1878
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:58,880
so

1879
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,960
how do you keep the information

1880
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,760
organized or

1881
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:05,520
assess how new

1882
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,600
papers coming in

1883
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,159
play into how you want to develop these

1884
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:11,600
different threads of research or

1885
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,679
determine where

1886
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:16,840
you can be making an impact

1887
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:20,640
by targeting this paper or assessing

1888
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,120
this phenomena or stepping into this you

1889
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:27,199
know 5 000 year old philosophical debate

1890
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:32,719
well uh

1891
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:36,159
it is very hard to uh explain where

1892
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:39,760
these ideas are coming from i mean

1893
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:42,800
well i do not i mean if i could

1894
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,520
state the process in this fashion i most

1895
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,760
probably i would be able to hire someone

1896
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,840
to write a program that does this

1897
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:52,320
instead of doing that myself so

1898
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,800
uh i think that it is mainly a matter of

1899
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:58,080
intuition although it is

1900
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,159
it is very ironical because

1901
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:02,159
philosophically i'm not

1902
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:03,760
someone who

1903
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:04,640
uh

1904
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,280
escorts too much credit by the intuition

1905
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,239
so

1906
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:10,239
uh but i think that i have a general

1907
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:13,120
program as and as i said i'm trying to

1908
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,440
defend some sort of

1909
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,760
moderate version of cognitive realism

1910
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:20,080
that tries to account for scientific

1911
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,159
representation to grow scientific

1912
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:24,239
representation in

1913
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:28,640
uh in the relationship between uh set a

1914
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,360
commodity of self-organizing agents and

1915
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,199
their environment so

1916
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:35,920
i think that i'm starting from the

1917
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:39,679
uh uh from the uh simpler bits so for

1918
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:42,719
example starting by just stating the

1919
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:44,560
point that scientific representation

1920
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,560
could be grounded in free energy

1921
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:49,280
principle and then i'm just fleshing out

1922
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:50,239
the

1923
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:51,120
uh

1924
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,199
other complex issues so for example

1925
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:55,679
wanting so as they say one thing leads

1926
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:59,679
to another as soon as you try to

1927
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:01,520
account for scientific representation in

1928
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:03,600
terms of free energy principle

1929
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:04,880
uh people

1930
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,960
point out and there have been excellent

1931
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,719
papers by

1932
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:11,520
excellent criticism for example by

1933
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:14,800
uh uh max jones who were pointing out

1934
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,640
this criticism that science is not an

1935
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:18,320
individual activity it is a social

1936
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,960
activity and then i am going back to

1937
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:23,040
play showed the social aspects of my

1938
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,600
view so i think that it is again some

1939
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,159
sort of dynamical social

1940
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:30,800
uh process that leads to development of

1941
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,520
these ideas and then i'm trying to deal

1942
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,760
with this social aspect

1943
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,199
uh i

1944
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:39,199
stumble on reading thomas kuhn and i see

1945
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:41,120
that i have to also take care of theory

1946
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,440
lateness for example and i engage with

1947
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:46,000
that issue but i think that i started to

1948
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,520
work on these applying this

1949
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:51,760
model

1950
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,600
relativity the

1951
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,520
model based nature of scientific

1952
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:58,239
activity to philosophy of mind since

1953
01:15:58,239 --> 01:16:01,120
2016 and then

1954
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:02,640
as i say

1955
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:05,920
one thing led to another and i'm where i

1956
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:08,640
am now and i'm i have no idea

1957
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:12,239
what impact would this project lead to

1958
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:14,480
what group what group of people because

1959
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,960
most probably the project is a bit too

1960
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:19,120
scientific for philosophers and a bit

1961
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:22,000
too philosophical for scientists but

1962
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,600
uh well

1963
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:24,719
it is

1964
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:26,800
the only way that

1965
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,960
i know for developing my philosophical

1966
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,600
ideas

1967
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,800
awesome thank you blue if you wanted to

1968
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,360
raise your hand otherwise uh go for it

1969
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:41,120
if not and then uh okay blue then dave

1970
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:42,080
um

1971
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:45,040
so i think my comment was it's kind of

1972
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:47,679
old at this point but but really like

1973
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:50,800
i was just curious about um

1974
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:51,920
linking

1975
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:52,960
this

1976
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:55,360
or or under what

1977
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:58,000
circumstances or how can we apply this

1978
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,040
um

1979
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:02,719
the active inference framework to um

1980
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:04,000
partially

1981
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,320
encapsulated systems

1982
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,000
and so i mean i think that this is it

1983
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,840
gets into like i i guess that's the big

1984
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,600
question right so always just i would

1985
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,520
love to hear your thoughts on

1986
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,080
how information is passed from module to

1987
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,679
module or or

1988
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:20,320
what is this idea of mutual information

1989
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,800
um you know in the collective uh pan

1990
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,920
psychism sense like how do you think or

1991
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:29,360
to what degree is it shared and can you

1992
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:31,360
perhaps

1993
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:34,159
maybe shed some light on mathematically

1994
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:36,560
ways that you think it would make sense

1995
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,239
to talk about

1996
01:17:38,239 --> 01:17:41,599
partial encapsulation

1997
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,360
uh well uh so

1998
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:48,320
starting from from the last part i think

1999
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:50,320
that mathematical representation is

2000
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:52,560
rather the easier part so

2001
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:55,199
we can easily

2002
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:56,400
model this

2003
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,960
partial encapsulation by invoking some

2004
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,239
sort of

2005
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:03,040
uh partial isomorphism so it is enough

2006
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:07,280
to have two sets of models and try

2007
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,679
to and try to show that to what extent

2008
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:11,520
or through what relation what parts what

2009
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,000
subparts of these sets are related to so

2010
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:14,880
to

2011
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:18,400
uh what subsets of the other system uh

2012
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,560
to the extent that there are

2013
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,719
significant chunks that are not related

2014
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:24,560
together through some sort of isomorphic

2015
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,960
relation we can retain some sort of

2016
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:29,280
partial isomorphism the other way i

2017
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:31,679
think that the more other more intuitive

2018
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:34,960
way of doing that is by invoking markov

2019
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,800
blankets i think that as a matter of

2020
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,480
fact i think that

2021
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:41,600
partial encapsulation is a direct uh

2022
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,760
results ramification of invoking

2023
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,440
markovian blankets because they are

2024
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:46,560
setting

2025
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:47,360
uh

2026
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:48,159
uh

2027
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:50,239
some sort of conditional independence

2028
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:52,239
between different chunks

2029
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:55,760
uh right so uh

2030
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:56,640
well

2031
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,880
uh from the very fact that there is some

2032
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:01,120
sort of partial encapsulation it doesn't

2033
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,679
follow that there is no

2034
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:04,480
uh

2035
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:06,719
amount of transfer of information

2036
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:09,600
between the tanks at all the only thing

2037
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,360
thing that is necessary for retaining

2038
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:13,600
this partial encapsulation is that

2039
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:17,440
at a given moment there is no actual

2040
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:19,120
so the only thing i think that the

2041
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,040
necessary condition and it is very

2042
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:23,280
minimal for retaining some sort of

2043
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:25,840
partial encapsulation is that at any

2044
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:28,719
given time information at one unit is

2045
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:31,679
not accessible to the observer in the

2046
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:34,159
other unit i think that this condition

2047
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:36,000
could be satisfied quite easily it is

2048
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,120
why i think that some sort of partial

2049
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:42,640
uh encapsulation endures

2050
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:44,800
despite the validity of kirchoff and

2051
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,600
hippolyta arguments

2052
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:50,960
thanks blue and then go ahead so so i

2053
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,760
guess this is um

2054
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:55,199
how how

2055
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:56,800
so so my my question was probably

2056
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:59,120
backwards so what about how is

2057
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:01,679
information shared not is how do you

2058
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:03,360
demonstrate information sharing as

2059
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,600
opposed to information encapsulates in

2060
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,239
encapsulation like if there's a markov

2061
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:09,920
blanket we establish conditional

2062
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,679
independence but like

2063
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:13,760
where can we establish conditional

2064
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:16,080
dependence or how can we establish

2065
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:19,280
conditional dependence that's

2066
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:20,800
the part that's that's really i'm

2067
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,320
curious about sorry all right it's very

2068
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:25,520
old so uh look uh the internal and

2069
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,920
external estates or the

2070
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,760
sensory and active states are related

2071
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,920
together but the thing is that the

2072
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:35,040
observer or if if you are encapsulated

2073
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:37,600
inside the markov blanket you can

2074
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:41,120
uh infer the properties of outside only

2075
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,920
indirectly so what i was trying to do to

2076
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:46,080
some extent is to instead of assuming

2077
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,840
that the cognitive system is cons is

2078
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:50,639
composed of markov blankets i try to put

2079
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:52,960
myself inside the marker blanket

2080
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,080
and see

2081
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:56,960
uh how could i get access to information

2082
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:59,120
that is outside the mark of blanket or

2083
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,120
inside other mark of blanket and to the

2084
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,360
extent that there is no

2085
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,360
direct relation or the information is

2086
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,719
not directly

2087
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:09,280
accessible at a given time

2088
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,920
i think that some sort of encapsulation

2089
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:14,920
endures

2090
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:17,360
it's like a

2091
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:19,920
cup half full cup half empty

2092
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:23,280
channel half open channel half closed

2093
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:26,320
it's the two

2094
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:27,520
extremes

2095
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:29,520
complete integration

2096
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:30,480
which

2097
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,560
maybe doesn't even make any sense like a

2098
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:34,960
solid-state drive i mean what would it

2099
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:36,560
even mean if all the information were

2100
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:38,080
connected to all the other information

2101
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:40,480
at the same time and just not compatible

2102
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,159
with the architectures of physical

2103
01:21:42,159 --> 01:21:43,600
systems

2104
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:44,560
so

2105
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:47,040
interesting thought experiments though

2106
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,120
for total integration

2107
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:51,520
and then any realized system

2108
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:52,960
is either going to be

2109
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:54,840
fully conditionally

2110
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:58,159
independent entirely markov blanketed

2111
01:21:58,159 --> 01:21:58,440
um

2112
01:21:58,440 --> 01:21:59,760
[Music]

2113
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:02,560
or there'll be some partial relation

2114
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:04,320
and then part of the realism and

2115
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,239
instrumentalism okay that partial

2116
01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:07,679
relation

2117
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:09,520
can be an

2118
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:11,520
edge like an effective or a functional

2119
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,120
connectivity edge

2120
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:16,880
which doesn't imply a causal role

2121
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,760
it's a scientific projection uh

2122
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:21,199
situationally

2123
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:22,400
defined

2124
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:23,280
edge

2125
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,800
that's being inferred

2126
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,360
in a specific statistics framework

2127
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:28,960
and then there are

2128
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:31,679
hidden states of the world of observers

2129
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:33,600
who are supposing

2130
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,120
causes

2131
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,040
like hypotheses about how things happen

2132
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,280
in the world and then they engage in all

2133
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:41,280
kinds of studies like loss of function

2134
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,960
gain of function

2135
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:45,040
blinded research

2136
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:47,280
those are protocols or affordances that

2137
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,280
scientists engage in to reduce their

2138
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,120
uncertainty about

2139
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,960
this hypothesis

2140
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:55,040
space

2141
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:57,040
so it's a very

2142
01:22:57,040 --> 01:23:02,000
interesting area uh dave and then dean

2143
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,080
right um

2144
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:04,880
the

2145
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,800
perfect lead into what i was going to

2146
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:09,520
ask about the uh where you draw the

2147
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:12,560
boundaries where you draw the um

2148
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:16,000
the blankets is really important um

2149
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,320
i like to say nasty things about donald

2150
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,480
hoffman or or more specifically the way

2151
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:22,960
he allows himself to be portrayed is

2152
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,480
thinking that there's

2153
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:27,120
absolute freedom and

2154
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:29,040
throwing blankets wherever you want that

2155
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:32,239
the boundaries are totally arbitrary and

2156
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:35,199
so we are all one of the

2157
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:38,080
really though uh blanketing is a matter

2158
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:41,600
of where what's actually happening um

2159
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,760
are you majeed familiar about there we

2160
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:46,880
go are you familiar with mara beller's

2161
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:50,880
work on the level of actual scientific

2162
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:53,520
interaction

2163
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,320
can you describe that work a little bit

2164
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:59,280
mara bella yeah she was um for a number

2165
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:01,360
of years she was perhaps the leading

2166
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:04,000
historian of the early days of quantum

2167
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,520
mechanics

2168
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:08,159
and as she got more and more in depth

2169
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:10,239
into what actually was happening there

2170
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:11,840
are certain papers

2171
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:14,400
uh by boar that are

2172
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:16,800
widely as regarded as being totally

2173
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,560
incomprehensible

2174
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,639
you'd go from one thing that he's saying

2175
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:22,960
in the paper to a few sentences later

2176
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,320
and there doesn't seem to be any

2177
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:25,840
connection at all and people are

2178
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:28,800
thinking well what was he had he lost it

2179
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,040
was he too tired when he gave this talk

2180
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:33,120
well she went down and and trying to

2181
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:35,520
take sentence by sentence and phrase by

2182
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:36,719
phrase

2183
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:38,320
asking the same question that a good

2184
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,960
drama coach asks

2185
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:43,120
for each statement that you have to

2186
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,560
deliver

2187
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:46,719
what question

2188
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:50,800
is that speech an answer to

2189
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,960
and she found if you went through the

2190
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,679
people that that bore was in intimate

2191
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:56,840
dialogue

2192
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:00,480
with whether he was on their side or

2193
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:03,440
being driven crazy but like einstein if

2194
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:05,840
you kept that in mind and asked who is

2195
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:08,719
he talking to who was born talking to

2196
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:11,199
at each moment

2197
01:25:11,199 --> 01:25:13,199
everything became very straightforward

2198
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:16,320
he was having a series of dialogues

2199
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,800
with a dozen people

2200
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,719
and just stringing one fragment of the

2201
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:22,719
dialogue after another and

2202
01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:26,000
and i haven't read it yet but um that

2203
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,760
totally ties in with the concept of

2204
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:32,239
conversation theory which was something

2205
01:25:32,239 --> 01:25:35,280
put together in the 1960s and 70s by my

2206
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:36,719
teacher

2207
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:38,880
of cybernetic learning theory gordon

2208
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:42,560
pask who defines the minimum unit of

2209
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:46,719
consciousness as the conversation

2210
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:48,560
and also

2211
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,199
represents each conversation or at least

2212
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:54,080
each enduring conversation as a

2213
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:57,440
psychological individual

2214
01:25:57,440 --> 01:26:00,320
so you have very much nested markov

2215
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:03,360
blankets you have very much

2216
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:06,320
the leipnician hierarchy and the

2217
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:08,880
indefinitely large or infinitely large

2218
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:10,639
and deep hierarchy

2219
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:13,840
of minds composed of minds composed of

2220
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:16,320
minds

2221
01:26:18,159 --> 01:26:20,000
and

2222
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,719
when the way beller presents that that's

2223
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:24,639
what science is about

2224
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:26,800
uh having lots of dialogues figuring out

2225
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:28,320
how they fit together

2226
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:31,360
the dialogues be getting new dialogues

2227
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:32,159
and

2228
01:26:32,159 --> 01:26:34,960
uh in past sense those conversations

2229
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:38,320
themselves in the best case become

2230
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:40,480
the enduring individuals maybe the

2231
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:43,040
immortal individuals that make up a

2232
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:47,120
successful living science

2233
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,120
well yeah

2234
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:51,840
thank you very much for uh the input

2235
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:54,000
yeah i agree that the

2236
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:54,880
the

2237
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:57,040
issue of choosing the scale is not

2238
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:59,199
arbitrary so i think that earlier in the

2239
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:01,360
paper i refer to

2240
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:03,440
the works of rodolf carnap and thomas

2241
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,679
kuhn to point out that i think that

2242
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:08,480
there should be some general

2243
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,960
considerations that rule over the choice

2244
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,960
of a specific scale

2245
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:15,040
this is partly

2246
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:17,280
determined by the property of the target

2247
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:19,600
system itself and partly by the interest

2248
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:22,080
of the modeler depending on what the

2249
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:24,159
model is trying to work out about the

2250
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:26,719
target system so i completely agree with

2251
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:27,760
that

2252
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:32,239
and evolves the collaborative and uh

2253
01:27:32,239 --> 01:27:34,239
distributes it so uh

2254
01:27:34,239 --> 01:27:35,920
i don't know whether it is i'm reading

2255
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:38,000
too much onto what you said right but

2256
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,920
into what you said right now but

2257
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:43,360
uh i'm completely on board the

2258
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,840
uh some sort of

2259
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:47,520
collective uh distributed take on

2260
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:49,040
scientific activity and this is

2261
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:51,600
something that i have been defending in

2262
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,400
recent papers in the previous year so

2263
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:57,040
uh i completely agree with that

2264
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,199
and uh well

2265
01:27:59,199 --> 01:28:01,199
uh my

2266
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:04,400
so the point about in individuals and

2267
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:06,080
how to

2268
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:09,040
define an individual or the borders of

2269
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:10,480
consciousness the limits of

2270
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:12,560
consciousness is still

2271
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:17,199
uh very much at the center of my uh my

2272
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:19,440
intellectual interpre enterprises so

2273
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:21,760
this is something that i'm trying to

2274
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:25,120
explore more so

2275
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,120
and this is something that i'm thinking

2276
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:29,040
about these days whether the

2277
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:31,360
unit of scientific activity is

2278
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:33,840
especially a region in the

2279
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,920
popular a population of neurons in the

2280
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:38,159
brain of a scientist or an individual

2281
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:41,199
scientist or a group of scientists so

2282
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:43,280
these are all very interesting topics

2283
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:45,920
thank you very much

2284
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:47,280
thanks

2285
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,120
for the response

2286
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:50,480
so

2287
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:53,840
dean and then blue

2288
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:56,719
shield i think what you've done is

2289
01:28:56,719 --> 01:28:59,120
you've hit on a really important point

2290
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:00,560
and that is that

2291
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:03,840
whenever we do isomorphism

2292
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:06,880
we can sort of take an iso an isovis

2293
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:09,199
stance i've read a book a long time ago

2294
01:29:09,199 --> 01:29:11,760
by uh the editor author was james

2295
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:13,199
brockwell it was

2296
01:29:13,199 --> 01:29:15,440
it was called um

2297
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:17,600
uh the visual world and memory and what

2298
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:20,239
he said was is that

2299
01:29:20,239 --> 01:29:22,239
the way that we capture

2300
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:25,520
uh can be one of two types the eyes of

2301
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:28,000
this stance that sort of isomorphism

2302
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,800
that we're outside and we're creating a

2303
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:33,040
representation with frames

2304
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:34,320
around them

2305
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:36,320
or we can be spatially enveloped which

2306
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:38,719
kind of ties in really conveniently with

2307
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:40,560
the idea of being

2308
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:41,840
either in the

2309
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:44,000
cubbyhole that bob is in or alice is in

2310
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,239
or anybody that's within spatially

2311
01:29:46,239 --> 01:29:47,280
enveloped

2312
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,639
within

2313
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:50,080
that sort of

2314
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:53,520
entailed world where we're sort of now

2315
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:56,480
the subject of whatever the walls are

2316
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,719
limiting us from being able to see

2317
01:29:58,719 --> 01:29:59,760
and so

2318
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:02,480
i don't think we walk away from the idea

2319
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:03,360
that

2320
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:05,840
we can make models we just have to be

2321
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:08,880
able to ask on a moment especially to to

2322
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:11,360
blues point how do we how do we make

2323
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:13,360
something available as opposed to

2324
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:14,560
keeping it

2325
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:17,679
sort of cleaved off or or sectioned off

2326
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:19,679
we have to kind of take the perspective

2327
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:21,600
or the view of the person who's

2328
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:22,719
enveloped

2329
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:24,560
who doesn't necessarily have that

2330
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:25,920
isovist

2331
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:29,040
slash model ability to nest thing and

2332
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:31,280
look at the world from their eyes which

2333
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:32,239
is

2334
01:30:32,239 --> 01:30:34,719
okay it's not what you're seeing

2335
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:36,480
necessarily in terms of what's on the

2336
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:39,679
page it's how you're entering the room

2337
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:41,679
with maybe not as much background and

2338
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:44,800
not as much ability to step outside of

2339
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,480
all of this information

2340
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:49,360
and start juggling and so i think that

2341
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:51,840
is one of the really key points to try

2342
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:54,080
to remember here when we model

2343
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,800
that just because i have a model

2344
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:58,960
that i can take that eyes of his stance

2345
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:01,920
doesn't mean i am able to also remember

2346
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:05,440
what it was like to be the one

2347
01:31:05,679 --> 01:31:06,639
sort of

2348
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:08,880
captured or enveloped by less

2349
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,280
information but still trying to catch up

2350
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:13,520
i think if we can hold both up at once

2351
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,600
it's back to that minimum

2352
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:18,159
two things at once don't be surprised if

2353
01:31:18,159 --> 01:31:19,920
do be surprised if

2354
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:22,639
or active and inference like i think i

2355
01:31:22,639 --> 01:31:24,080
think what we're what we're really

2356
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:26,000
basically saying here is

2357
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,320
bumping it up by including two things

2358
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:30,960
that sort of depth perception piece

2359
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:33,040
yes it does make it more complicated or

2360
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:36,159
complex but that doesn't mean it's

2361
01:31:36,159 --> 01:31:38,159
it's overwhelming it gets overwhelming

2362
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:40,400
if you try to do i guess maybe seven or

2363
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,480
ten dimensions at once but

2364
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:45,199
we can bump up to two

2365
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:46,800
we can take the eyes of his stance we

2366
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,800
can do the model and we can also be

2367
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:50,000
remember what it was like to be

2368
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,040
spatially enveloped

2369
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:54,719
you're gonna get overwhelmed and

2370
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:57,120
surprised by the real world when the

2371
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:58,480
train

2372
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,239
comes at you if you don't have depth

2373
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:02,000
perception so

2374
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,920
it's a very interesting

2375
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:06,159
take dean like

2376
01:32:06,159 --> 01:32:09,360
yes two and two is truer than one but

2377
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:14,159
also there's other benefits too blue

2378
01:32:14,239 --> 01:32:16,719
so just to kind of clarify like what i

2379
01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:18,080
was talking about earlier and then add

2380
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:20,560
on to what dave was saying like i i want

2381
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:22,239
to know how to draw

2382
01:32:22,239 --> 01:32:24,960
a partial marsh markov blanket like how

2383
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,360
do how do you like like to me a markov

2384
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:29,040
blanket like represents a distinct

2385
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:31,440
boundary between like self and other

2386
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:33,520
internal and external and so how do you

2387
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:35,360
make this kind of partial

2388
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:37,520
markov blanket and i like what dave was

2389
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:40,159
saying or about what um his teacher put

2390
01:32:40,159 --> 01:32:42,159
forward about

2391
01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:44,239
the conversation being

2392
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:46,320
a unit of consciousness and i am very

2393
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:47,199
much

2394
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:50,080
a ascriber to pan psychism like i i

2395
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:51,440
don't think that

2396
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:52,800
it necessarily needs to be a

2397
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:56,320
conversation between two humans um

2398
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:59,760
but but really maybe fundamentally each

2399
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:02,800
relationship between two objects perhaps

2400
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:05,760
each relationship has then its own

2401
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:09,280
markov blanket like you know my heart

2402
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:10,480
and my

2403
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,320
liver have a relationship with each

2404
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,320
other that that itself is encapsulated

2405
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:16,639
with a markov blanket and this can you

2406
01:33:16,639 --> 01:33:18,560
know be attributed to any two cells or

2407
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:20,400
two organisms or

2408
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:23,839
so on and so forth

2409
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:27,840
uh

2410
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:31,600
very well so by the way of uh an example

2411
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:33,440
i completely agree so

2412
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:34,400
uh

2413
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:36,560
especially about the part that this uh

2414
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:38,320
so uh

2415
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:40,080
uh

2416
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:43,360
well i do not want to

2417
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:46,320
use

2418
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,639
the term conversation because i do not

2419
01:33:48,639 --> 01:33:50,719
know the theoretical implications very

2420
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:51,679
well but

2421
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:53,360
uh i think that

2422
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:54,159
so

2423
01:33:54,159 --> 01:33:54,960
uh

2424
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:57,600
i used this when i started this project

2425
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:59,120
for example on

2426
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:01,280
modeling scientific activity as some

2427
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:03,520
sort of active inference i was thinking

2428
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:06,159
of individual scientists as

2429
01:34:06,159 --> 01:34:08,000
the units of

2430
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,040
uh

2431
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:11,679
scientific activity so science an

2432
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:13,920
individual scientist has been enveloped

2433
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:16,639
by markov blanket and she was trying to

2434
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:19,360
get an access to the causal structure of

2435
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:21,440
the world by forming influences from

2436
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:22,960
beyond the

2437
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:24,400
blanket but

2438
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,880
as i worked more on this

2439
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:29,280
aspect i understood that the situation

2440
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:32,960
is becoming complex uh very quickly so

2441
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:35,920
uh then i just uh then i thought that we

2442
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:38,880
could put all of the scientific group or

2443
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:41,280
scientific community inside the mark of

2444
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:43,600
blanket and then try to explain their

2445
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:46,639
relation with the environment as

2446
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:49,360
uh the parts of a general markov blanket

2447
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:51,360
by just expanding the scale that

2448
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:54,080
includes them and then at the stage i

2449
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:56,560
also told that we could also moder in

2450
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:58,480
the same way that we could envelop the

2451
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:01,760
relation between uh two scientists

2452
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:03,679
inside the markov blanket we could just

2453
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:05,520
expand that and also include the

2454
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,920
artifact the object the major the

2455
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:09,119
scientific

2456
01:35:09,119 --> 01:35:11,760
uh experimental tools inside the

2457
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:13,520
community of the scientists so

2458
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:15,679
scientific activity is basically about

2459
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:17,199
the relation between scientists

2460
01:35:17,199 --> 01:35:19,600
scientists human human activity and

2461
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:22,639
human artifact uh relationship and

2462
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:25,119
scientific activities distributed

2463
01:35:25,119 --> 01:35:26,000
to

2464
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,400
all of this group which includes both

2465
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:29,920
human beings and

2466
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:33,199
artifacts and then like depending on

2467
01:35:33,199 --> 01:35:34,960
your take on

2468
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:37,360
uh free energy principle whether you are

2469
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:39,280
defending a representation of this

2470
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:42,159
stance or an activist stance you can

2471
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:43,840
speak about the relation of this group

2472
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,440
to their environment in terms of

2473
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:47,440
classical representation

2474
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:48,239
or

2475
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:51,280
coupling or a hybrid view which includes

2476
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:56,040
both representations and coupling

2477
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:02,239
thank you very interesting makes me

2478
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:05,040
think about science and technology and

2479
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:06,880
how the word science relates to like a

2480
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:09,600
lot of inference and

2481
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,760
psi and scry and all that and then

2482
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:13,840
technology technique

2483
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:16,000
and that has a little bit more of the

2484
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,159
implications of tool

2485
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:22,320
deployment and finesse and measurement

2486
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:23,679
and

2487
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:25,679
the blurry line between science and

2488
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:28,080
technology and the who and the what and

2489
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:30,400
the how

2490
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,000
so it's very cool

2491
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,719
let's um in our last little bit here

2492
01:36:34,719 --> 01:36:37,040
first if anybody watching live has

2493
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:39,040
questions we totally can

2494
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:40,320
address them

2495
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:42,320
but this was the question that we left

2496
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:43,440
off on

2497
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:46,560
at the end of the 0.1

2498
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:48,000
video

2499
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,320
which was

2500
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:52,320
how do you utilize functional and

2501
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:54,080
effective connectivity in active

2502
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:56,320
inference analysis to better inform an

2503
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:58,159
answer to a question

2504
01:36:58,159 --> 01:37:00,239
such as in football why i scored the

2505
01:37:00,239 --> 01:37:03,440
goal so how does that enrich in analysis

2506
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:05,360
because we've talked a lot about how the

2507
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:07,600
chosen

2508
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:10,560
models deployed by scientists are goal

2509
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:11,760
driven

2510
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:15,280
and so what exactly is

2511
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:17,440
active inference

2512
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:19,360
helping us

2513
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:22,400
do or how is it enriching our account

2514
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:25,440
of a situation like scoring a goal

2515
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:28,719
in a sports ball game

2516
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:30,800
well

2517
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:33,360
as a philosopher i feel that i have to

2518
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:35,679
stay silent about this question to avoid

2519
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:38,159
revealing my deep ignorance of the

2520
01:37:38,159 --> 01:37:42,000
technical aspects of how this works so

2521
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,880
i i mean i have some general ideas and i

2522
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:47,119
can try but i think that it would be

2523
01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:49,119
better to

2524
01:37:49,119 --> 01:37:53,360
stay silent and not reveal my ignorance

2525
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:55,280
how about start it off with something

2526
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:57,360
ignorant and then we'll see if any other

2527
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:59,360
researchers have thoughts

2528
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:01,520
well uh i do not know about this

2529
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:03,840
specific example but for me the

2530
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,280
distinction between functional

2531
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:07,360
connectivity and effective connectivity

2532
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:09,040
was about the

2533
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:12,239
our causal physical aspects of the

2534
01:38:12,239 --> 01:38:16,719
target system and the general

2535
01:38:16,719 --> 01:38:19,040
global and structural features of the

2536
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:21,119
system so i was not thinking of this in

2537
01:38:21,119 --> 01:38:22,480
terms of so

2538
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:24,239
the point that i was trying to make

2539
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:27,840
whether to try to focus on modeling the

2540
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:30,480
causal physical aspects or focus on the

2541
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:32,639
structure or global aspect would be a

2542
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:34,880
matter of the interest of the scientists

2543
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,520
or the modeler whether at the

2544
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:39,280
moment or whether

2545
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,840
in order to do the task at hand she

2546
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:44,800
prefers to stay focused on the general

2547
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:46,639
aspect speaking about the relation

2548
01:38:46,639 --> 01:38:48,880
between different parts in

2549
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:51,760
unifying structural terms or going into

2550
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:54,000
the details and trying to model

2551
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,840
local specific

2552
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:57,280
uh features

2553
01:38:57,280 --> 01:39:00,480
i'm not quite sure how i can apply that

2554
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:01,520
to the

2555
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:03,600
the example of

2556
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:06,480
scoring a goal

2557
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:09,760
dean

2558
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:12,080
or anyone else

2559
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:14,320
i just think it's in scoring the goal

2560
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:15,679
again

2561
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:17,840
pre pre-kicking the ball you could be

2562
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:20,159
asking yourself two questions

2563
01:39:20,159 --> 01:39:22,000
why am i surprised

2564
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,400
about the result or

2565
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:26,560
should i be surprised about the result

2566
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:27,840
because i think that's what active

2567
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:29,440
inference

2568
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:31,600
affords it gives you that

2569
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:34,080
it gives you that possibility of

2570
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:37,199
two outcomes i scored a goal or i kicked

2571
01:39:37,199 --> 01:39:39,119
it up into the stands but before you

2572
01:39:39,119 --> 01:39:41,199
actually kick the ball

2573
01:39:41,199 --> 01:39:42,960
perhaps

2574
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:45,119
perhaps if you're not really really

2575
01:39:45,119 --> 01:39:47,440
skilled at kicking a ball

2576
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:49,280
you can ask yourself whether or not

2577
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:51,920
there's enough

2578
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,600
enough in this particular case

2579
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:56,480
mechanical familiarity and background to

2580
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:58,960
actually finish off what you

2581
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:01,040
intended to do

2582
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:03,600
that's what i think active inference

2583
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:06,320
allows for but again my ignorance shines

2584
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:09,760
through too so

2585
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:11,679
okay i'll

2586
01:40:11,679 --> 01:40:12,960
give a thought

2587
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:15,119
so i think there's active inference and

2588
01:40:15,119 --> 01:40:16,719
then there's functional and effective

2589
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:18,560
connectivity because

2590
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,400
functional effective connectivity have

2591
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:24,559
gone back further so first

2592
01:40:24,639 --> 01:40:26,639
applying the techniques of functional

2593
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:28,560
effective connectivity help us separate

2594
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:30,880
out hypotheses about physical causal

2595
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,080
mechanisms

2596
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:33,040
from

2597
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:34,800
a whole variety of different kinds of

2598
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:36,560
edges that might be

2599
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:38,960
uh applied like there's time correlation

2600
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:41,040
there's mutual information

2601
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:42,239
there's um

2602
01:40:42,239 --> 01:40:44,719
change with respect to like you know

2603
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:46,239
condition on this one going up in that

2604
01:40:46,239 --> 01:40:49,119
split second this one goes up as well so

2605
01:40:49,119 --> 01:40:50,639
all kinds of different

2606
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:52,719
uh edges that can be drawn

2607
01:40:52,719 --> 01:40:54,560
essentially in a graphical

2608
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:56,639
framework so not just like visual but on

2609
01:40:56,639 --> 01:40:58,960
a nodes and edges

2610
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:01,600
active inference gives us a

2611
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:03,280
i mean among other things so this of

2612
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:05,280
course would not be a

2613
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:07,280
complete or

2614
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:09,760
authoritative answer but it does provide

2615
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:12,560
us with a a framework and a nexus

2616
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:14,239
and a community

2617
01:41:14,239 --> 01:41:17,119
that can scaffold and nurture

2618
01:41:17,119 --> 01:41:19,199
accounts of the target phenomena so

2619
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:20,800
kicking a goal

2620
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:23,119
we want to have the biomechanics

2621
01:41:23,119 --> 01:41:24,560
researcher

2622
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:27,199
and the force on the knee and

2623
01:41:27,199 --> 01:41:29,040
physical rehab

2624
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:30,560
and then also

2625
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:32,400
there's an easy way to go into like the

2626
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:34,800
um social inter-subjectivity of the game

2627
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:36,400
rules and

2628
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:38,000
regimes of attention and thinking

2629
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,239
through other teammates

2630
01:41:40,239 --> 01:41:40,800
and um

2631
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:42,239
[Music]

2632
01:41:42,239 --> 01:41:44,080
cyber physical systems of the soccer

2633
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:45,360
stadium

2634
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:47,600
and then like reviewer two just

2635
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:48,719
addressing

2636
01:41:48,719 --> 01:41:49,760
the inner

2637
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:51,760
or outer critic

2638
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:54,239
and knowing that we don't need to to

2639
01:41:54,239 --> 01:41:55,840
have a theory of everything to talk

2640
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:56,800
about

2641
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:58,960
the ball being kicked

2642
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:01,280
so i'd say that actin specifically

2643
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:02,800
provides um

2644
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:04,719
value for the researcher the the goal

2645
01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:06,719
scoring researcher

2646
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:08,719
because it will help them reduce their

2647
01:42:08,719 --> 01:42:10,560
uncertainty about what contribution to

2648
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:13,119
make to the research literature by just

2649
01:42:13,119 --> 01:42:15,040
saying like giving really good

2650
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:16,480
connection points if they're doing the

2651
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:18,239
biomechanics paper

2652
01:42:18,239 --> 01:42:20,000
it can have awesome connection points to

2653
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
the cultural and the social and all of

2654
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,360
that and if they're doing the social

2655
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:26,480
paper it could have nice articulation

2656
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:27,280
with

2657
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:30,400
the biomechanics

2658
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:32,239
and that would even be before we get

2659
01:42:32,239 --> 01:42:34,239
into the um

2660
01:42:34,239 --> 01:42:36,960
some of the details of the active

2661
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:42,119
modeling per se um

2662
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:45,520
so

2663
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:47,360
if anyone in the live chat would like

2664
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:48,320
any

2665
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:50,239
final questions otherwise we will sort

2666
01:42:50,239 --> 01:42:51,679
of

2667
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:52,960
cruise out

2668
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:54,800
you know in the dot zero we do the

2669
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:56,719
background and it's the time that we all

2670
01:42:56,719 --> 01:42:58,400
need to take to like work through these

2671
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:00,480
very

2672
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:02,880
provocative and interesting and

2673
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:05,440
far-reaching papers then dot one is a

2674
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:08,000
lot of times like a mess

2675
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,280
because we're exploring a lot of

2676
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:11,199
different avenues and we never finished

2677
01:43:11,199 --> 01:43:12,880
them all in the dot 2 but this is sort

2678
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:14,560
of where we

2679
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:16,719
take off into our next

2680
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:18,560
set of discussions it happens to be that

2681
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:19,679
in the coming weeks we're going to be

2682
01:43:19,679 --> 01:43:21,760
talking about the nature of

2683
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:24,320
self representation so that might have

2684
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:26,800
some themes but majeed i'm just curious

2685
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:28,000
like what

2686
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:31,679
are you excited about for 2022

2687
01:43:31,679 --> 01:43:33,520
what um

2688
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:36,800
directions or policies

2689
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:39,040
are like exciting to you now that you've

2690
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:42,080
very recently completed this work

2691
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:46,159
well uh uh i'm uh excited about a new

2692
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:48,400
book that is under review and it's true

2693
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:49,280
so

2694
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:51,520
uh a structural realism as i said was

2695
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:52,880
the

2696
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:55,360
the officialism of philosophy of science

2697
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:56,960
for quite a while

2698
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:57,760
and

2699
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:00,560
uh i tried to develop a cognitive

2700
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:02,400
version of a structural realism before

2701
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:06,000
no in a new book that is

2702
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,440
in a new book that is going to be

2703
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:09,199
published it is not i mean it is a

2704
01:44:09,199 --> 01:44:11,199
sequel to the book that you are seeing

2705
01:44:11,199 --> 01:44:13,280
in a new book that is under review right

2706
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:15,360
now i'm going to play show the social

2707
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:17,840
aspects of scientific activity so

2708
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:19,600
a structural realist despite all of

2709
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:22,000
their virtues they were not too much

2710
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,920
attending speaking about the social

2711
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:26,239
aspects of science and i think that that

2712
01:44:26,239 --> 01:44:29,280
aspect has has been to some extent

2713
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:31,280
neglected in the contemporary philosophy

2714
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:34,719
of science so it has it had its high day

2715
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:38,239
in works of thomas kuhn and fireband and

2716
01:44:38,239 --> 01:44:39,600
then it has been pushed into the

2717
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:42,239
background and now i'm

2718
01:44:42,239 --> 01:44:45,199
building up on free energy principle

2719
01:44:45,199 --> 01:44:47,760
so the theories of social communication

2720
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:49,280
that are grounded in free energy

2721
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:52,560
principle to bring back the

2722
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:53,360
uh

2723
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:56,560
uh this discourse on uh social aspects

2724
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:59,280
of scientific activity so the book that

2725
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:00,960
is under review is

2726
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:03,360
the title is aptly called

2727
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:05,520
uh bringing social awareness to a

2728
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:08,159
structural realism so i'm very excited

2729
01:45:08,159 --> 01:45:09,760
about that i still do not know whether

2730
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:12,159
it will pass the review and whether it

2731
01:45:12,159 --> 01:45:13,520
will go

2732
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:15,520
to the press or not but i'm very much

2733
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:18,480
excited about that

2734
01:45:20,719 --> 01:45:22,400
nice

2735
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:23,440
um

2736
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:25,760
reminds me of bruno latour reassembling

2737
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,560
the social of course different aim

2738
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:30,480
but that almost feels invoked in the

2739
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:34,080
title well uh well it is a different aim

2740
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:37,119
but as i say uh it has so it is mainly

2741
01:45:37,119 --> 01:45:39,520
about works of thomas kuhn and

2742
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:42,320
fireman but it also has references to

2743
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:44,400
the works of social constructivist la

2744
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:46,159
tour and others and

2745
01:45:46,159 --> 01:45:48,080
specifically uh sorry i have to change

2746
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:51,199
the place to put my laptop into the

2747
01:45:51,199 --> 01:45:54,159
charge again but uh the thing is that

2748
01:45:54,159 --> 01:45:56,320
uh

2749
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:59,679
lotto was one of the main people who was

2750
01:45:59,679 --> 01:46:02,080
complaining about this kind of

2751
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:04,639
uh dismissiveness of social aspects of

2752
01:46:04,639 --> 01:46:07,360
scientific activity and i think that

2753
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:09,600
people who were working in distributed

2754
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:12,239
cognition were trying to they're

2755
01:46:12,239 --> 01:46:15,119
actually explicitly mentioning works of

2756
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:16,800
lottery and some other

2757
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:18,960
social cognitives to

2758
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:21,360
uh find

2759
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:25,520
a foothold for bring for

2760
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:27,440
creating cognition or knowledge as some

2761
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:30,080
sort of distributed social activity

2762
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:33,679
uh so uh what i try to do is to develop

2763
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:35,520
some sort of

2764
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:38,159
elective distributed account of uh

2765
01:46:38,159 --> 01:46:39,679
scientific cognition this has been

2766
01:46:39,679 --> 01:46:41,679
something that people such as ronald

2767
01:46:41,679 --> 01:46:44,320
geary have been doing before and no uh

2768
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:46,239
non-synergy and some other people are

2769
01:46:46,239 --> 01:46:48,560
doing these things but what i was trying

2770
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:50,000
to do is to

2771
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:54,560
try to reinforce and reconstruct this uh

2772
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:57,600
very interesting insights by drawing on

2773
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:59,520
recent development in free energy

2774
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:01,840
principle so some sort of free energy

2775
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:03,440
principle account of social

2776
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:06,719
communication i'm building upon that to

2777
01:47:06,719 --> 01:47:09,840
reconstruct uh classical accounts of

2778
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,840
distributed scientific cognition which

2779
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:14,400
as well has its roots in works of latter

2780
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:16,639
and some other social cognition

2781
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:19,280
social constructivists so you were very

2782
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:23,360
sharp to spot the relation again cool

2783
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:24,200
nice um

2784
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:25,520
[Music]

2785
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:27,280
connection there looking forward to that

2786
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:29,360
like actor network theory

2787
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:30,320
ant

2788
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:32,320
distributed systems

2789
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:34,000
kind of makes sense

2790
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,639
um

2791
01:47:36,639 --> 01:47:38,960
well i think if anyone else wants to

2792
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:40,560
give

2793
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:42,560
a final

2794
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:45,199
thought or comment anyone other than the

2795
01:47:45,199 --> 01:47:47,600
author then we'll provide the last word

2796
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:49,440
to the author so blue and then either

2797
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:52,000
dave or dean

2798
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,320
this is a lot of like fun thought

2799
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:57,520
experiments and um just thanks for your

2800
01:47:57,520 --> 01:47:58,639
time and

2801
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:01,679
as any good paper opens more questions

2802
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:04,480
than provides answers i think so

2803
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:07,440
i'm curious to see what your next work

2804
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:11,919
is and how it all unfolds in the future

2805
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:15,040
thank you very much for for

2806
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:19,520
your contribution as well

2807
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:20,800
uh

2808
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:24,239
dean and then dave if you would like

2809
01:48:24,239 --> 01:48:26,400
majida as as i mentioned earlier i hope

2810
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:28,080
that uh

2811
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:29,520
if if

2812
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:32,000
in a couple months time and there's a

2813
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,800
slot where you have some availability

2814
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:36,590
i would like to also look at that um

2815
01:48:36,590 --> 01:48:38,800
[Music]

2816
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:40,239
this work that you've done around

2817
01:48:40,239 --> 01:48:43,040
abduction and the idea of active

2818
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:45,199
inference as well because i think

2819
01:48:45,199 --> 01:48:47,440
in terms of trying to be able to

2820
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:49,440
cast a wider net and get a better sense

2821
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:50,560
of how

2822
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:52,800
we model and look at things through

2823
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:54,960
through time frames both before during

2824
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:56,320
and after i think that would be

2825
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:57,440
something that

2826
01:48:57,440 --> 01:48:59,360
i'd like to take up because going

2827
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:01,600
through this paper certainly

2828
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:02,000
um

2829
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,280
[Music]

2830
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:04,880
brought a lot of things to the forum was

2831
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:06,320
really really helpful so thank you very

2832
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:07,679
much thank you for showing up today was

2833
01:49:07,679 --> 01:49:09,360
really appreciated

2834
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:11,199
no so thank you very much for your

2835
01:49:11,199 --> 01:49:14,480
interest so i learned quite a lot too

2836
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:16,480
both from participating today and from

2837
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:18,639
watching the video the the previous

2838
01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:21,920
video of the discussions

2839
01:49:22,239 --> 01:49:26,080
great well yep as always super fun to

2840
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:28,480
read and to interact with you to take it

2841
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:29,599
from a

2842
01:49:29,599 --> 01:49:31,679
epistemic stigmargy

2843
01:49:31,679 --> 01:49:34,159
interaction with your asynchronous

2844
01:49:34,159 --> 01:49:35,360
artifact

2845
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:38,159
into something that is spatially remote

2846
01:49:38,159 --> 01:49:39,599
but still

2847
01:49:39,599 --> 01:49:41,440
interactive hashtag effective

2848
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:42,719
connectivity

2849
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:44,880
um so

2850
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:46,719
just keep in contact with us and anytime

2851
01:49:46,719 --> 01:49:49,040
you would like to discuss more or do

2852
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:50,400
anything else with the lab just be in

2853
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:53,760
touch and anyone else as well so

2854

you very much uh and sorry for being a

2856
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:01,040
bit busy after teaching and

2857
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:03,199
this end of the semester

2858
01:50:03,199 --> 01:50:05,840
hassle so thank you very much take care

2859
