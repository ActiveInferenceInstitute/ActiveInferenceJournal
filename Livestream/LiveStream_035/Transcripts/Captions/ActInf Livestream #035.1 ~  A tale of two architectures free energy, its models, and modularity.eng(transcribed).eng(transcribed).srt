00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,679
all right

3
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,519
hello and welcome everyone

4
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,680
this is actin flab live stream number

5
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,440
35.1

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,879
it's january 5th 2022.

7
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,520
welcome to the active inference lab we

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,680
are a participatory online lab that is

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,920
communicating learning and practicing

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,079
applied active inference you can find us

11
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,399
at the links here on this slide

12
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,960
this is a recorded and an archived live

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,480
stream so please provide us with

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,199
feedback so that we can improve our work

15
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,120
all backgrounds and perspectives are

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,399
welcome here

17
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,160
and we'll be following good video

18
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,319
etiquette for live streams plus playing

19
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,479
with our new affordance thanks to our

20
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,799
jitsi repair person

21
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,840
and uh that'll be

22
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,320
fun go to activeinference.org if you

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,759
want to learn more about how to

24
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,159
participate or get involved if you're

25
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,400
listening to this live stream

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,720
live or in replay allocating your regime

27
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,720
of attention this way then maybe you'd

28
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,320
like to get involved a little bit more

29
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,920
actively with projects including

30
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,320
planning the live stream

31
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,159
so today we are in active stream 35.1 we

32
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,799
are discussing the paper that dean and

33
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,360
blue and i did 35.0 on yesterday and

34
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,119
that paper is a tale of two

35
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,399
architectures

36
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,960
free energy it's models and modularity

37
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,079
by majeed benny in december 2021

38
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,399
and we're gonna be

39
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,880
talking modifying slides asking

40
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,640
questions going into some things that we

41
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,640
brought up in the dot zero

42
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,520
connecting a few dots and also preparing

43
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,000
for hopefully majeed to join in the dot

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,759
two video

45
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,680
we're going to be discussing this again

46
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,919
next week at the same time

47
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,680
so

48
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,840
let's begin with some introduction and

49
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,080
warm-up we will

50
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,120
each go around and just say hello and

51
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,720
introduce ourselves

52
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,440
as well as maybe just add something that

53
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,599
we're curious about what got us really

54
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,080
excited to discuss this paper and what

55
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,000
are we looking forward to reducing our

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,760
uncertainty about in the coming

57
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,280
days and weeks

58
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,120
so i'll start i'm daniel i'm a

59
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,440
researcher in california

60
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,560
and i think i'm excited to talk about

61
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,120
the information encapsulation and what

62
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,040
that means as well as to go into that

63
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,680
parable of alice and bob and see who

64
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,519
here wants to

65
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,200
relay that story to us and

66
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,040
shine some light on narrative based

67
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,000
understandings of free energy principle

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,360
and i'll pass it to stephen

69
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,800
thank you yeah i'm stephen i'm here in

70
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,000
toronto

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,040
i'm really interested in um

72
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,680
this ability to step back and look at

73
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,200
some of the underlying

74
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,000
uh processes of actually modelling that

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,519
this talks about

76
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,120
and the philosophies of that in quite a

77
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,360
practical way so i uh

78
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,840
i'm i'm excited by that potential from

79
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,440
this paper so and also what the group

80
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,200
here is making of that because i think

81
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,440
it's a it's challenging us to start to

82
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,440
think about some foundational stuff in

83
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,879
our work so

84
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,200
um i'm going to pass this over to

85
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,760
dave we're going to just skip dave for

86
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,120
some audio

87
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,840
oh

88
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,440
dean is dean amount yep

89
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,440
uh my i'm dean i'm in calgary

90
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,840
uh for me it's always trying to be able

91
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,319
to hold up two things at once and so for

92
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,080
those two things in this paper or the

93
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,480
moment of instantiation or the sort of

94
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,200
the model slice aspect of

95
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,200
what we're looking at and then

96
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,640
also to instantiate her to modulate and

97
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,920
so

98
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,640
those two things together what does that

99
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,200
imply and that's what i want to talk

100
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,639
about a little bit today with bob and

101
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,759
ellis and i'll

102
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,479
pass it to blue

103
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,759
hi i'm blue i'm a research consultant in

104
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,040
new mexico

105
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,960
and something i'm excited to talk about

106
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,840
today is or maybe next week um is the

107
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,639
idea of modularity in the free energy

108
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,040
principle and how that might work in the

109
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,600
absence of a brain where the fep still

110
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,040
applies to brainless systems and how how

111
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,639
that might be also modular or not

112
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,160
okay

113
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,520
so there's so many

114
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,479
places to jump in but thankfully we have

115
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,240
some questions in the live chat which

116
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,520
we'll begin with and then as per usual

117
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,199
we will

118
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,680
modify our slides

119
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,400
and just keep on adding more slides

120
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,759
adding more questions so if you're

121
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,440
watching live thanks again for all these

122
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,680
great questions and i'll

123
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,039
uh first bring them into this slide so

124
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,960
joseph clark asks

125
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,160
this is a little bit of a general

126
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,680
question and then we'll move to a

127
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,120
question that's a bit more specific to

128
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,960
the paper so the general question is

129
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,800
there a space space

130
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,280
on either the discord or live streams to

131
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,120
discuss active inference in reference to

132
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,120
more traditional philosophical

133
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,880
psychological linguistic or social

134
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,560
science questions

135
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,080
what would anyone say on that

136
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,639
well i suppose that

137
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,400
that that we

138
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,639
do have some of those conversations as

139
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,000
part of the active inference lab um

140
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,639
some of the social science questions um

141
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,600
it can get in the weeds um with too many

142
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,199
different

143
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,120
assumptions in the background which they

144
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,360
themselves could be contentious so

145
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,039
i think it's helpful

146
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,199
to do some of the type of work that

147
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,880
we're doing now to sort of think about

148
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,479
what does it actually mean to model

149
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,680
something what are the sort of

150
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,360
assumptions

151
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,280
that are even going on

152
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,160
before we start to dive into

153
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,280
broad

154
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,000
sort of popular

155
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,680
theoretical frameworks because

156
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,080
are we going to come at this from

157
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,900
the position of um

158
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,960
[Music]

159
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,520
a very low dimensional modeling approach

160
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,319
which is shed light onto things like

161
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,520
autism things like schizophrenia things

162
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,039
like

163
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,800
types of behavior

164
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,280
or are we going to come at this more

165
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,319
from a

166
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,199
structured principled approach

167
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,840
where we have an ecological niche

168
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,639
relating to an agent and a generative

169
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,680
model

170
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,520
some of those things i think are more

171
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,759
helpful to

172
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,639
start to pass

173
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,080
so that we know

174
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,800
how we're locating the discussion but

175
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,120
i'm not sure if others agree with that

176
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,199
because it's very easy to get caught up

177
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,759
in a discussion which is essentially

178
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,520
located

179
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,400
in

180
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,440
say the social sciences

181
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,160
and trying to work from there with all

182
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,400
the implicit assumptions and get back to

183
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,400
active influence

184
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,319
and it can get quite heady and kind of

185
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,840
confusing

186
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,560
it's maybe better working the other way

187
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,160
addressing something

188
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,560
from okay how do we take a type of

189
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,120
modeling approach used around fep active

190
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,520
inference in relation to something

191
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,840
what's useful from that but that's

192
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,520
that's my uh

193
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,319
that's my feeling and uh i also believe

194
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,080
it's nice to do stuff where you're doing

195
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,560
interactive dialogue and working with

196
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,120
documents in real time as much as it is

197
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,080
through

198
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,479
a text chat because i think that also

199
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,680
can start to get it can't quite handle

200
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,440
the level of complexity at play

201
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,319
thanks steven blue

202
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,680
so i would push back on joseph um for a

203
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,240
specific example of a question that

204
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,479
might fall into this category um and

205
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,000
also um

206
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,479
is there a particular paper that that

207
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,800
might be related to active inference in

208
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,000
this field uh because i do feel like we

209
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,960
do discuss a lot of philosophical

210
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,120
and social science questions i'm not

211
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,039
sure i guess there's some linguistics

212
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,879
also i can't remember like a stream it's

213
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,360
just not like like linking in my brain

214
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,000
but um i mean we just did um thinking

215
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,519
like a state which is very social

216
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,080
science based i think and um so yeah i

217
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,919
would just love to see what particular

218
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,279
questions you would like to see

219
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,440
addressed and if you can find a paper

220
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,440
and recommend it uh that we discuss on

221
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,360
the live stream more than happy to

222
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,800
accommodate that

223
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,000
um yeah yep the linguistics

224
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,240
guest stream was eliot murphy so i'll

225
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,720
respond in terms of affordances i think

226
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,399
there are probably more so create your

227
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,040
own affordance modify the acting flab as

228
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,839
your niche as you see fit but

229
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,839
there's always the informal discord

230
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,560
affordance just post in general and say

231
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,200
hey everyone i'm gonna be

232
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,040
curious about these ideas i don't even

233
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,240
know

234
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,560
what to know but i'm gonna be curious

235
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,920
about these different things these

236
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,720
topics these three questions and uh in

237
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,040
two hours i'll be doing it or in two

238
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,920
weeks at this time so you can always

239
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,000
just say when you're gonna be in the

240
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,720
voice chat on discord and maybe some

241
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,560
people will drop in or you can invite

242
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,959
some friends specifically and then a

243
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,120
little bit more formal of an affordance

244
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,080
is we can host a guest stream or a panel

245
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,200
so that would be done through the

246
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,080
dot-coms organizational unit and we

247
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,279
would work to plan the timing and then

248
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,519
also set up the discussion so it's not

249
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,200
just like we show up and it's like okay

250
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,880
well who is going to prepare like we can

251
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,680
just

252
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,399
to whatever extent is required

253
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,160
get a jamboard ready get some slides

254
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,839
ready some questions that will spark the

255
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,519
conversation and that can also invite

256
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,440
people outside of the active community

257
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,240
so it can be whatever you like so by

258
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,600
asking the question you've signaled that

259
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,760
you understand that such an affordance

260
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,480
could be important and so

261
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,000
looking forward to seeing how you follow

262
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,800
through

263
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,399
so let's go to

264
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,680
joseph's second question which brings us

265
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,720
i think a little bit closer towards the

266
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,600
paper

267
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,959
it will uh

268
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,320
zoom in towards it so how do you stop

269
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,200
overfitting on one layer of the model

270
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,120
for example leg movements to avoid

271
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,440
compromising the larger goal that an

272
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,600
agent or person wants to do like kicking

273
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,279
a football

274
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,279
i feel this question may also help put

275
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,120
some of the debates around modularity

276
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,800
versus hierarchical information

277
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,160
segregation in an analogous context

278
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,079
so it's a

279
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,880
great

280
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,640
question we talked a lot about

281
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,200
hierarchical modeling

282
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,640
and about that lateral modularity kind

283
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,279
of the collective behavior element

284
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,760
and then the nested

285
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,120
modularity

286
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,040
which is the multi-scale systems

287
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,320
perspective

288
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,279
and in active inference as we explored

289
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,600
with the mental action paper and deep

290
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,200
active inference

291
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,680
we sometimes have these nested models

292
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,920
that are expanding over multiple time

293
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,880
scales

294
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,000
so that the action at one time step

295
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,519
isn't just greedily pursuing the overall

296
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,640
preference

297
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,480
but rather the preference can be

298
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,120
realized or uncertainty about realizing

299
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,120
the preference can be achieved through

300
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,880
policy selection over a given time

301
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,399
horizon even when the micro movements

302
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,000
might not be

303
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,959
um

304
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,959
intuitive so sort of taking one step

305
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,480
back so that you can

306
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,680
go a better path

307
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,680
what would anybody

308
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,480
add to that or we can start to diagram

309
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,519
some pieces out here

310
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,519
i would just say don't don't

311
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,000
drop one or the other don't drop the

312
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,160
idea of the moment of instantiation or

313
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,160
that model slice

314
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,480
and don't drop the ins to instantiate or

315
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,839
to modulate

316
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,000
make sure that like i i've used the

317
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,240
expression when it does zoom in zoom out

318
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,600
when you're zooming out you're actually

319
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,560
trying to incorporate longer time frames

320
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,360
versus a moment in time and and that's

321
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,279
how i would

322
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,120
that's how i would mitigate some you

323
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,639
keep i don't know that you can wipe out

324
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,160
the overfitting problem there's always

325
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,519
potential for that

326
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,279
but you can mitigate it somewhat by

327
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,800
making sure that you

328
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,240
keep the two

329
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,600
ideas

330
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,680
up at the same time without one blending

331
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,160
into the other or total focus on one or

332
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,560
the other

333
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,480
all right i threw up a image from

334
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,760
uh

335
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,839
paper 25

336
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,079
which was the mental action paper of

337
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,160
sandvik smith

338
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,959
and

339
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,040
um this is kind of

340
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,760
one way to address it

341
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,120
so let's just say that the overall goal

342
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,440
were to kick the football it's a good

343
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,519
example you know it works for whichever

344
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,760
side of the pond you're on with kicking

345
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,519
the football

346
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,240
the overall preference would be for for

347
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,639
example the sensory observation of

348
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,279
seeing the football far away

349
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,920
or of observing the

350
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,720
foot making contact with the football

351
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,600
at

352
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,440
high velocity

353
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,440
and the foot is starting in a neutral

354
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,959
position

355
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,519
so just sort of like standing

356
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,600
and the greedy gradient descender

357
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,760
would just go from the neutral position

358
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,760
to just kick forward

359
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,440
but maybe it's possible there's like a

360
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,600
three-step movement for example in the

361
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,839
first time step you pull the leg back

362
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,920
and then you move it forward two times

363
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,120
so over three clicks of time

364
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,560
in the model

365
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,160
that is going to be

366
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,360
the outcome that ultimately best

367
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,519
realizes your preferences of making

368
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,120
contact with your foot on the ball at

369
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,680
the maximum possible velocity

370
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,120
and so

371
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,320
the policy selection is happening at the

372
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,199
motor level so the policy here is a

373
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,320
parameter that's describing like

374
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,880
the angle of the hip

375
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,360
that is the um

376
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,519
state that's being inferred so we won't

377
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,760
go too deep into the skilled performance

378
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,120
angle or the

379
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,560
interactionism angle but 23 check it out

380
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,839
um and

381
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,279
two policies

382
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,240
can be

383
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,160
compared or a whole family of policies

384
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,000
can be compared with one another one

385
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,720
policy is just move the like forward the

386
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,800
other policy is move leg backwards then

387
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,880
forward twice another policy would be

388
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,399
like move it backwards then forwards and

389
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,000
backwards and forwards never kick the

390
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,680
ball

391
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,240
then over a given time horizon like the

392
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,120
time that the organism has to make this

393
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,399
kick

394
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,120
different expectations can be calculated

395
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,959
for different policy

396
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,480
sequences

397
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,800
and again if it turns out that moving

398
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,199
the leg back one step and then forward

399
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,440
two steps makes contact with the ball at

400
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,920
higher velocity then

401
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,880
at the

402
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,240
level of deep policy selection that

403
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,480
three-step sequence will be selected

404
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,680
over

405
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,480
the

406
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,560
just move the leg forward sequence or

407
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,160
the back and forth

408
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,079
not kicking sequence

409
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,480
so that's a mechanical

410
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,759
version

411
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,199
and

412
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,680
it's also the kind of model structure

413
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,079
that applies to not just motor actions

414
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,079
but mental action

415
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,000
so i hope that gets a little bit towards

416
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,759
it and also starts us towards this

417
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,600
discussion of modularity because

418
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,680
where is the modularity in what we just

419
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,759
described so steven and then anyone else

420
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,759
who raises their hands or throws out a

421
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,560
string of emojis

422
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,120
yeah this is a very useful

423
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,680
example um

424
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,120
um

425
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,800
because you see how it's about

426
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,800
phenomenology

427
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,079
um and it's interesting because

428
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,399
traditionally philosophical

429
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,440
psychological perspectival type

430
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,880
uh approaches

431
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,279
averaging out over social

432
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,639
approaches

433
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,920
um

434
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,160
aren't phenomenological

435
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,040
and phenomenological ties in more

436
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,279
with our best guess approach of how an

437
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,000
agent is experiencing things so in what

438
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,240
you just mentioned here i think this is

439
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,759
quite good for the kick and the

440
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,680
footballers i'm trying to work out how

441
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,839
to kick the football what am i trying to

442
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,839
do as i said in policy selection i'm

443
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,560
trying to work out the best way to do it

444
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,320
and i may be unaware of what i'm paying

445
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,240
attention to

446
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,240
in trying to help do that there might be

447
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,399
some subconscious processes which are

448
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,800
helping to calibrate it however once

449
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,839
i've actually mastered

450
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:02,839
that

451
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,199
performance what i'm paying attention to

452
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,199
may not be how to do it i might be in

453
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,599
the flow and now my what am i paying

454
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,839
attention to is how do i look up and

455
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,199
just kick the ball

456
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,359
towards another player so i think that

457
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,039
i'm wondering what people's thoughts are

458
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,640
there in terms of how that changes

459
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,880
things to now be in an agent-based mode

460
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,480
good

461
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,039
question i think it also relates to the

462
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,000
event-based cognition for example martin

463
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,480
butz and what he talked about

464
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,520
um

465
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,120
the micro level is indeed the policy of

466
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,600
each muscle and joint

467
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,160
being selected to

468
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,840
write something

469
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,960
however

470
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,120
there's a modularity

471
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,720
that arises

472
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,559
from cognitive chunking

473
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,120
of complex motor actions for example

474
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,880
into

475
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,919
broader more handleable

476
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,039
units so like writing a letter

477
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,520
is like a unit of motor actions it's

478
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,400
actually a

479
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,039
really complex sequence of motor actions

480
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,160
and then writing a word is a given event

481
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,080
that subsumes

482
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,640
or entails or requires or

483
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,559
is supervening upon

484
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,760
lower level policy selections like which

485
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,880
way to move a muscle of a thumb

486
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,960
however it's

487
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,240
the um increasingly chunked

488
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,400
and modular perhaps even semantic levels

489
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,840
that

490
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,440
appear to arise more to our

491
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,160
phenomenology which is why we

492
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,320
for example reach for something and a

493
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,559
whole host of processes

494
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,280
play out without us needing to

495
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,200
micromanage the

496
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,200
motor actions

497
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,480
yes uh dean

498
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,919
oh uh

499
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,039
i was just

500
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,000
kind of

501
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,720
i think what to steven's point i think

502
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,200
what we are asking here is

503
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,640
does the mind

504
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,559
or can the mind go in two directions

505
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,960
namely do we start with a frame or an

506
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,720
architectural scaffold or a model

507
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,679
or

508
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,160
does the process

509
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,039
of of what we're watching i.e kicking a

510
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,080
ball

511
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,120
spectralize the relativity i.e does it

512
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,760
confirm what the edges are

513
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,320
so those are those are different

514
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,440
completely opposite views of things over

515
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,720
over a time scale so then

516
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,480
i guess what we have to ask ourselves is

517
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,720
does the representation

518
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,039
act as the takeoff point meaning do we

519
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,039
start with the model do we start with

520
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,360
that scientific view or

521
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,840
and or does the representation

522
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,320
evolve as the results sort of more the

523
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,960
creative view i think we're capable of

524
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,160
doing both

525
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,760
in fact there's lots of evidence that we

526
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,919
do do both so i would come back to

527
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,760
do we modulate yes is that a process yes

528
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,520
do we can we take slices of a modulation

529
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,039
exercise

530
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,000
and see them as representational

531
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,679
and and modeling yes

532
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,080
so that's all i would point to i don't

533
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,679
know when the transition is stephen when

534
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,480
it's kicking a ball

535
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,400
banksteen stephen and then anyone else

536
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,240
yeah with this transition

537
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,720
this may be part of what changes and i

538
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,080
suppose this is one of the interesting

539
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,559
things is it depends on the nature of

540
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,799
the situation um

541
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,200
but everything at some level which is

542
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,159
interesting

543
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,640
is is hidden in active inference and

544
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,039
we're trying to get some purchase on

545
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,640
that which is interesting as opposed to

546
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,520
it being out there as knowledge

547
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,320
and with and we and we somehow know it

548
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,960
it's like okay what am i perceiving

549
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,120
will always be more hidden states than i

550
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,480
can ever really know

551
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,559
what am i trying to do there with more

552
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,320
hidden states what am i paying attention

553
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,280
to

554
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,919
um and i think what's quite

555
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,720
interesting is what is at the

556
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,960
the the realm of

557
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,640
being available to us in our

558
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,880
consciousness okay so the sort of thing

559
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,559
that daniel was talking about the sort

560
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,360
of process the sense-making process

561
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,720
which is present when it's not

562
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,720
immediately obvious how to kick a ball

563
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,200
because messi doesn't do that messi

564
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,480
knows he just

565
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,400
he feels it right

566
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,640
but the there's a there's something

567
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,240
really interesting about the scale and i

568
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,280
think

569
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,080
my feeling is if we have a meso middle

570
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,480
scale there's things which

571
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,200
come out of our awareness or are harder

572
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,919
to purchase or get a grip on as they

573
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,760
become faster

574
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,280
and

575
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,799
as they become

576
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,400
low slower

577
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,320
so you know what am i paying attention

578
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,559
to there may be something that's

579
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,880
my unconscious is sort of aware of that

580
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,440
phenomenological feeling about how the

581
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,760
events is going and how my stomach is

582
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,919
feeling waiting for the next meal which

583
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,280
is sort of

584
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,000
too slow for me to really notice

585
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,120
and there's other things like we're

586
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,799
saying we should just

587
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,520
biologically at speeds faster than the

588
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,440
rates at which conscious awareness

589
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,480
operates

590
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,559
and we've sort of got

591
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,480
both of these and that moves a little

592
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,200
bit depending on how i take my attention

593
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,840
in the world

594
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,559
thanks steven

595
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,159
yes so

596
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,480
we have a few different

597
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,679
axes or continuum here

598
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,880
there's the phenomenological or what is

599
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,440
experienced and then there's sort of the

600
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,280
third person

601
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,159
impersonal where it's more just about

602
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,840
what's happening in the model and we

603
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,400
don't even associate it with

604
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,720
a conscious experience

605
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,080
in this mental action paper

606
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,000
it threads the line because it is

607
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,280
talking about computational

608
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,520
phenomenology however this is the

609
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,600
structure of deep active inference

610
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,919
policy selection models which don't need

611
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,799
to require any kind of phenomenological

612
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,480
experience

613
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,200
so

614
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,039
blue and then we will continue to the

615
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,520
next slide

616
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,679
so just in thinking about

617
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,400
agent systems and information

618
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,320
encapsulation

619
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,440
it seems like to be part of the same

620
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,480
system there must be partial information

621
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,039
encapsulation like you can't play a

622
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,600
basketball game with a bunch of other

623
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,919
people without sharing

624
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,760
information such as the position of the

625
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,080
ball right like so there's you know and

626
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,200
the rules of the game etc so the

627
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,760
partial information encapsulation i mean

628
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,640
how to what degree like what percentage

629
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,960
is information encapsulated between

630
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,880
individuals between modules of an

631
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,440
individual tissues of an individual and

632
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,679
so forth i really wonder about that i

633
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,039
mean even like you think about the

634
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,279
butterfly effects like we're all sharing

635
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,840
i mean globally information such as

636
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,240
climate change or or this type of thing

637
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,760
so there's there's information at a

638
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,080
global level that affects every single

639
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,679
one of us because we're all part of the

640
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,240
same global system and so

641
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,960
there's gotta be some kind of partial

642
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,440
encapsulation i think

643
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,559
uh um

644
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,080
just to be connected in a system

645
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,480
great stephen

646
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,480
i think that's a good point blue blue

647
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,880
makes there because

648
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,960
there's only certain things available at

649
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,200
certain temporal scales

650
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,120
to make some of these

651
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,080
um

652
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,679
the the the temporal depth of being

653
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,760
aware of the ball

654
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,919
in a in a practical sense

655
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,080
is a certain there's a certain at some

656
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,919
point it just becomes noise it's too

657
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,919
fast to sequence it there's no point

658
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:54,799
getting

659
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:55,679
um

660
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,919
outside of actually processing sensory

661
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,919
information itself at these faster

662
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,080
levels and as happens with all the

663
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,679
uncertainty

664
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,440
and error prediction that goes up the

665
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,679
chain there's a certain

666
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,799
goldilocks zone right for knowing

667
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,200
um how the ball is going in the game and

668
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,720
if i'm standing i'm watching the game

669
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,799
there's a sort of a golden lock speed

670
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,799
which is probably relatively slow just

671
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,640
like in a soccer game if i'm sort of

672
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,039
running down the wing and uh not getting

673
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,600
the ball a lot and uh but when the ball

674
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,200
is actually kicked to me i've got a

675
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,120
player coming in to tackle me i've got

676
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,559
another player running and i've got to

677
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,880
do something with it now bang i've got a

678
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,480
window that's got to happen in their

679
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,200
shortest period of time you know the

680
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,960
the the regime of attention and the

681
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,960
action policy selection

682
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,880
is is is in this in the terms of like um

683
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,640
half a second maybe milliseconds of

684
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,480
which some then are not even available

685
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,799
in our conscious awareness unlike maybe

686
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,200
the tracking of the game which might be

687
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,840
of a window of 5 10 15 seconds maybe

688
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,400
longer i think that in itself would that

689
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,240
not itself create some sort of

690
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,039
modularity

691
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,000
great

692
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,440
question so

693
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,520
we explored several different

694
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,880
senses of modularity in the dot zero so

695
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,600
there is the physical connectedness like

696
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,159
the anatomical connectivity

697
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,960
anatomical modularity and then we talked

698
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,760
about the effective and functional which

699
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,080
are two statistically different they're

700
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,760
not interchangeable but they're two

701
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,080
different ways to talk about modularity

702
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,279
um

703
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,720
so now we're exploring how these notions

704
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,640
of modularity line up with potentially

705
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,919
the

706
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,480
nesting of multi-scale systems through

707
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,679
space and time

708
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,159
so i'm pulling up one of the figures

709
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,960
from ramstead at all 2018 answering

710
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,480
schrodinger's question

711
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,279
if i can just resize it properly and so

712
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,279
here on the

713
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,880
x-axis is time and on the y-axis is

714
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,559
spatial scale

715
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,360
and what this graph is

716
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,440
laying out loosely and it's been

717
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,799
described in other papers and

718
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,480
discussions since

719
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,880
is that things are kind of existing

720
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,720
on the

721
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,520
um

722
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,720
line

723
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,039
where we're seeing that smaller things

724
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,039
are happening faster

725
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,399
and larger things are happening slower

726
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,120
things that happen over continents

727
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,960
are happening over longer time scales

728
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,720
than things that can happen at a sub

729
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,320
cellular scale

730
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,960
so there is kind of this natural

731
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,640
relationship between spatial and the

732
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,120
temporal scale of processes

733
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,279
and how does that relate to

734
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,159
the

735
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,279
modularity that blue was describing

736
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,760
if there's complete encapsulation of a

737
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,320
given module

738
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,880
if such a thing could even exist in

739
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,200
reality is one question

740
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,760
now if something could exist in our

741
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,120
model

742
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,120
of course it's true we can develop a

743
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,520
model that has that connectivity amongst

744
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,440
variables doesn't mean it's the best

745
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,880
model or it's the one that is the

746
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,000
perfect

747
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,640
um territory description itself but it's

748
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,559
not it's a map

749
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,200
and then if we had no integration

750
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,480
that's kind of like saying that it's

751
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,080
just encapsulated at the next scale up

752
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,720
um or i'm sorry no encapsulation

753
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,399
within a level is kind of like saying

754
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,080
it's just perfectly encapsulated at the

755
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,279
next level

756
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,600
so in a way the partial information

757
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,120
encapsulation

758
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,440
is the gray zone that everything is

759
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,279
going to be existing within

760
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,720
steven and then anyone else

761
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,640
yeah i mean and actually because they

762
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,159
have they've sort of gone back on this

763
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,000
page on this particular diagram to some

764
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,760
extent after feedback from casper has um

765
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,120
i think this is

766
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,200
really where there is a um

767
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,880
because this continuum this idea of a

768
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,880
continuum going out

769
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,120
is what i think active inference um

770
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,880
sort of

771
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,600
changes how we see that and it's hard

772
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,520
because when we try and map things like

773
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,320
what

774
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,399
maxwell was doing here he was taking

775
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,279
stuff from the social sciences and the

776
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,320
different

777
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,720
approaches that are mainstream and this

778
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,399
is how it pans out

779
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,120
but if this is often because this is

780
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,200
what we

781
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,600
think of something from the outside we

782
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,520
see from the outside groove behavioral

783
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,600
patterns we see an organism we

784
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,240
categorize it we make models of it and

785
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,960
they sort of stack up in this way over

786
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,399
time and

787
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,679
in time and temporal and physical scales

788
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,120
however

789
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,679
from the perspective of the dynamics

790
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,320
are we having a different goldilocks

791
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,679
zone

792
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,360
within smaller and faster temporal

793
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,399
dynamics

794
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,480
in terms of what's actually happening

795
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,960
and when that means something's out in

796
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,559
the niche

797
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,600
we may see stuff dropping out from that

798
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,200
but there's no reason for instance where

799
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,120
niche construction

800
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,840
is not being under

801
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,840
girdled by rapid decision making

802
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,399
at real time

803
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,840
just like the soccer players are all

804
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,840
making choices on the pitch

805
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,000
around where they run it changes the way

806
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,080
the grass is going to get worn down

807
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,960
okay

808
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,320
so

809
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,159
this is interesting actually now looking

810
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,480
at well so what is the replacement to

811
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,840
this diagram

812
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,360
has there been one

813
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,720
that doesn't have this kind of

814
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,679
micro macro and actually is able to have

815
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,640
an action orientated miso that can

816
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,880
meet the requirements of

817
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,320
um

818
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,080
what we're talking about pluralistic

819
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,720
ontologies and ontological pluralism

820
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,240
well where is that

821
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,240
where is that being described and i

822
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,760
think that's a missing link at the

823
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,158
moment

824
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,000
right

825
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,559
i think that this takes us to a uh

826
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,000
good return on the

827
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,559
markov blanket scale free or scale

828
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:13,600
friendly

829
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,960
debate

830
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,840
because um just like you said stephen

831
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,120
somebody talking about a cellular scale

832
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,600
and the kinds of perception cognition

833
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,360
action happening at a cellular or an

834
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,960
organismal scale

835
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,799
they're not saying that niche

836
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,240
construction

837
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,440
um

838
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,840
doesn't exist ecological scale niche

839
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,039
construction because we could also think

840
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,000
about tissue level niche construction

841
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,200
um

842
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,840
rather that the regime of attention of

843
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,880
the scientific modeler is being directed

844
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,000
towards a given kind of modeling

845
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,799
and so that's sort of

846
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,679
how we take something that is

847
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,200
a unifying

848
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,679
theory like free energy principle

849
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,450
or a scale free or a

850
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,679
[Music]

851
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,120
scale

852
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,640
a priori

853
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,880
model whether it's markov blankets or

854
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,320
linear regression

855
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,600
but in any application to a given system

856
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,120
there are going to be time scales of

857
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,880
analysis that just do and don't make

858
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,080
sense

859
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,120
and

860
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,960
um

861
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,000
that's

862
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,200
where we operationalize the

863
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,279
markov like it or as benny wrote

864
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,640
although markov blankets are in

865
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,399
principle scale free

866
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:31,519
meaning there are no inherent

867
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,360
constraints on their size and scope

868
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,960
their application or imputation to

869
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,880
various target systems will impose a

870
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,440
definite scale on markov blankets dean

871
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,120
yeah and i think again that's why i want

872
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,559
to talk a little bit about the

873
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,720
instantiation moment

874
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,000
sort of

875
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,679
piggybacking on yours and steven's

876
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,840
comment when we apply a markov blanket

877
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,000
we can ask the question

878
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,880
from an encapsulation perspective did

879
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,720
you see what i saw

880
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,159
it's a question

881
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,159
we're both behind a blanket we're both

882
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,519
wondering

883
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,519
if there's some agreement

884
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,039
that we've gained some sort of a

885
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,960
contextual alignment

886
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,360
i could also say to you

887
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,120
did you see that

888
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,159
which is it

889
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,000
it may sound like almost the same

890
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
question but it's not the same question

891
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,760
it's not even it's they're radically

892
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,559
different questions because one says

893
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,320
are we in agreement on what's being

894
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,480
encapsulated

895
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,360
meaning are we are we forming a a

896
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,039
co-contextualization or the other one

897
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,960
says

898
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,080
uh i'm not sure

899
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,519
right so i'm not sure what you're seeing

900
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,240
so to this question of scale

901
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,919
it's it's it free energy is moving us i

902
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,799
think to that place of

903
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,000
of coexisting context

904
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,080
but i think the critical thing is

905
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,679
we've talked about this so many times

906
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,760
don't don't confuse the

907
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,600
to something or other the map with the

908
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,159
field or whatever i just get i get lost

909
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,199
in it all but but the bottom line is

910
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,520
can we do two things at once i know we

911
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,199
can our brains can

912
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:17,760
realize that applying a partition

913
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,839
versus or with

914
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:22,239
in in conjunction with what is that

915
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,918
slice of time

916
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,879
as a relativity question and then when

917
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,359
does that relativity question appear at

918
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,839
the beginning is that our takeoff point

919
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,639
or is that our conclusion

920
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,639
that's all that this paper to me does is

921
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,520
it says at what moment do we employ

922
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,480
categorization

923
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,599
interesting dean thank you dave and then

924
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,919
anyone else

925
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,440
um yeah you know to dean's uh comment

926
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,480
uh when i asked did you see what i saw

927
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,599
the

928
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,359
proximal

929
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,960
pull

930
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,800
of your attention is being invited to be

931
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,680
projected into me

932
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,680
so you're seeing it

933
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,720
through me

934
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,040
you might compare that to what some

935
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,720
crazy russians were doing a hundred

936
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,480
years ago

937
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,160
they were uh

938
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,320
trying to get the notion across that

939
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,079
very few people are conscious more than

940
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,160
a few times a year

941
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,320
and they said well look i can explain

942
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,000
away your impression that you're

943
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,200
conscious a whole lot

944
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,240
here's what i can say i can say hey are

945
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,240
you conscious

946
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,480
the very fact that i asked you are you

947
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,560
conscious causes you to be conscious

948
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,440
it shocks you into consciousness and you

949
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,839
wake up and you say well yes i am of

950
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,279
course you are because

951
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,079
and this takes in the idea of

952
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,520
what is

953
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,920
the adjacent possible

954
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,560
what is available in that ecosystem for

955
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,320
awareness that we're talking about so

956
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,960
just like you said there if someone says

957
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,079
did you see that

958
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,000
that can take someone into a sense of

959
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,839
like i'm trying to work out

960
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:30,800
often

961
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,839
particularly if there's a power

962
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,599
difference between people

963
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,400
um

964
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,119
what that other person's now

965
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,280
wanting me to see

966
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,640
and i've seen this a lot actually when

967
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,240
we're doing work in south africa with

968
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,640
communities one of the first things is

969
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,160
to let people

970
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,599
and you ask them a question to get them

971
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,040
to a point where

972
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,560
they're actually

973
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,320
telling you what they think

974
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,119
not what they think you

975
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,200
are thinking about what they should be

976
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,320
saying

977
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,160
okay so where is

978
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,240
that attention just like say it where is

979
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,160
it in terms of being conscious as an

980
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,839
awareness

981
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:08,000
and how much of this scale is well

982
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,680
what's available

983
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,560
and what's going to be an impact

984
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,920
in terms of the adjacency so a cell

985
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,920
has some awareness potentially maybe

986
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,640
even some adaptive inference at the kind

987
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,240
of

988
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,960
at the actual organ level potentially

989
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,800
and maybe further

990
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,960
it will have an impact maybe in terms of

991
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,680
the way cells divide on the nature of

992
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,920
speciation

993
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,720
yes there's it's it's but it hasn't

994
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,599
necessarily got

995
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,640
any trajectory to adaptively

996
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,119
um couple it it's not in its adjacent

997
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,920
possibles and i think that is quite

998
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,119
useful

999
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,520
in terms of it starts to open up in

1000
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,280
terms of the information either

1001
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,200
temporally how much is something

1002
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,960
separated by time

1003
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,800
spatially how much it by space but i

1004
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,880
suppose also by statistical

1005
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,640
contingencies

1006
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,520
and the ability to adapt and interact

1007
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,240
those types of things well what is

1008
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,119
either within or adjacent and what

1009
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,760
becomes outside of that

1010
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,839
i think that starts to

1011
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,079
give some of these

1012
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,800
these scaly modularity questions just

1013
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,480
maybe an applied

1014
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,280
direction to come out

1015
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,480
thank you stephen blue

1016
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,440
there is a huge fundamental difference

1017
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,760
between asking someone what do you see

1018
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,079
and do you see that even if you don't um

1019
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,079
give them that you're still looking in a

1020
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,079
direction of that

1021
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,280
right so the what do you see like lets

1022
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,320
someone

1023
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,720
look at their surroundings take stock in

1024
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,599
what they see and give their independent

1025
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,240
observations versus just even like do

1026
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,160
you see that and like you look over in a

1027
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,760
direction at least like you're directing

1028
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,000
someone's intent attention

1029
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,640
with your question so asking an open

1030
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,359
question versus a directed question can

1031
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:10,160
give very different answers

1032
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,000
and i wonder what

1033
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,119
the impact of that would be on

1034
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,040
modularity like

1035
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,920
or even just an information sharing like

1036
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,320
there's more shared information in do

1037
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,680
you see that or do you see what i see

1038
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,720
that's like

1039
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,480
like an intention to share your

1040
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,720
generative model at that point

1041
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,880
versus what do you see is actually

1042
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,800
trying to take stock in someone else's

1043
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,359
model it's just an interesting thought

1044
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:38,320
yeah

1045
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,839
these all

1046
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:40,720
point

1047
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,440
using the example of communication and

1048
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,160
visual perception to

1049
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,480
where we have partial information

1050
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,839
encapsulation

1051
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,839
if the two entities were totally

1052
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,160
encapsulated they couldn't communicate

1053
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,960
if there was no encapsulation such a

1054
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,880
question wouldn't be required to be

1055
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,960
asked but there's a

1056
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,520
specific type of edge

1057
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,640
in this

1058
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,920
network we could almost think of these

1059
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,040
like two modules as like maybe the two

1060
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,359
generative models of the individuals and

1061
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,200
there's this connection

1062
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,880
when some of the modules are

1063
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,920
connected

1064
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,599
and it is a

1065
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,520
nice how we're kind of exploring these

1066
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,240
subtly different questions i think did

1067
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,680
you see that

1068
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,720
is

1069
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,440
that is corresponding to an external

1070
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,599
state like an observation did you see

1071
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,040
that that

1072
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,040
red blur in the sky

1073
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,160
i don't know what it was could have been

1074
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,599
a comment but did you see that versus

1075
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,440
what i saw um

1076
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,079
well we know that you see with your mind

1077
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,640
generative model of vision and whatnot

1078
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,560
and so especially when we're

1079
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,560
outside of the signal processing

1080
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,400
paradigm of vision

1081
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,800
did you see what i saw is like quite

1082
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,440
literally asking is your internal hidden

1083
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,760
state

1084
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,319
related to mine are we seeing the same

1085
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:03,200
thing

1086
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,960
that doesn't mean are the photons

1087
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,119
hitting both of our retina it means do

1088
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,240
we have a shared generative model of

1089
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,560
visual objects

1090
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,440
so

1091
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,400
dean

1092
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,040
and then dave

1093
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,480
just one last thing that's a great

1094
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,400
summary first of all

1095
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,920
secondly um

1096
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,000
when we're talking about

1097
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,400
what is the nature of the partition

1098
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,040
we're we're i think as a group we're

1099
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:29,920
still

1100
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,920
trying to define what we

1101
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,200
hope is

1102
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,960
is is not completely definable yet

1103
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,319
do you want to understand with that

1104
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,480
partial encapsulation

1105
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,480
not saying it's undefined i'm not saying

1106
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,000
it's zero although

1107
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,839
down the road i might say we're passing

1108
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,160
through zero because that's what i i'm

1109
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,040
kind of

1110
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,000
moving towards but i think

1111
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,760
when we partition

1112
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,760
that partition

1113
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,880
is not

1114
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,920
static

1115
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,000
and it's not and the

1116
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,720
the definition of it is to leave it

1117
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,079
somewhat

1118
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,520
undefined

1119
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,319
that's

1120
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,319
i like your explanation better daniel

1121
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:09,200
but

1122
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,760
that's what i think we're trying to move

1123
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,560
towards here

1124
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:18,319
eventually great dave do you want to

1125
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:19,839
add something there

1126
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:20,880
okay

1127
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,720
so um

1128
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,680
uh

1129
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,680
blue

1130
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,799
or if not blue then stephen

1131
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,200
i went already i'm good

1132
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,880
i suppose just pushing a question back

1133
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,119
we talk about this encapsulation

1134
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,280
modularity

1135
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,040
and where we

1136
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,119
put that by putting the blanket

1137
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,800
somewhere

1138
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,000
seems to be

1139
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,319
kind of implied by that

1140
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,000
so

1141
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,960
that kind of is

1142
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,240
done through

1143
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,319
a way of speculating on where the

1144
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,079
observations

1145
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,560
are generating some

1146
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,040
sensory states

1147
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,920
and where we are in terms of the action

1148
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,119
dynamics at play how much is this

1149
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,000
dropping out of

1150
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,119
the literal availability

1151
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,119
at a certain scale

1152
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:24,000
and then we make the blanket around it

1153
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,560
and how much of it comes from structure

1154
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,000
in the blanket

1155
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,400
in terms of how we implement this i

1156
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,520
think

1157
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,000
i think that changes what modularity may

1158
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,839
or may not mean

1159
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:36,800
um

1160
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,359
because i think that

1161
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:40,560
how those

1162
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,440
separations of modularity are done

1163
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,319
you know is it is it a case of how

1164
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:50,160
sort of parallel processes are happening

1165
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,839
and are being integrated and they're

1166
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:56,160
modularly almost independent maybe

1167
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,560
certain senses are independent and how

1168
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,839
much is it that they're independent

1169
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:02,800
um

1170
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,440
because they're separated at an

1171
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,359
integrated level

1172
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:11,200
by temporal physical space

1173
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,599
great

1174
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:14,640
questions

1175
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,440
are these partitionings

1176
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,240
are

1177
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,480
a priori model

1178
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,720
or do we merely specify what we're going

1179
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,280
to measure and then the blankets if

1180
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,359
we're using the technical definition of

1181
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,599
a markov blanket like the set of

1182
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:30,800
variables

1183
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,680
upon which two other sets of variables

1184
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,440
called internal and external states

1185
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,079
become conditionally independent

1186
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,040
in that case you don't need to specify

1187
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,240
which nodes are blanket states you just

1188
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,839
make the measurements

1189
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:46,800
and then

1190
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,480
relative to a target set of states some

1191
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,400
other set become

1192
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,720
a blanket with respect to a third

1193
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,760
external

1194
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,440
type of states

1195
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,040
so dean

1196
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,119
and then blue

1197
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,720
okay i'll be super quick

1198
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,640
this idea that our minds are able to

1199
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,079
categorize

1200
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:10,000
it's a world of segregations like in

1201
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,839
backslashes when we're looking at

1202
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:17,520
symbolically or integrations i.e hyphens

1203
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,599
these are symbolic knots to the market

1204
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,920
up markov blanketing

1205
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,720
so the instantiating

1206
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,640
or partitioning of an applica

1207
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,960
partitioning

1208
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,960
and applying i'm sorry

1209
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,520
so my example here might be a little

1210
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,280
strange but

1211
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,720
be generous

1212
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,319
when yellow becomes orange in an fmri

1213
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,480
or a rainbow

1214
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,520
which begs the question is a rainbow a

1215
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,839
piece of encapsulated information

1216
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,160
okay

1217
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,720
is that representation transitive or

1218
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,960
intransitive

1219
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,599
okay so i.e the claim that the most

1220
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,880
important color in the rainbow is yellow

1221
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,160
on one end

1222
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,400
on the other is at the end of all

1223
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,119
rainbows must exist prisms made up of

1224
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,680
unicorns sea serpents and flying monkeys

1225
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,520
or maybe free

1226
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:18,640
and energy and dynamic or principle

1227
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,880
see where i'm going with this our minds

1228
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,480
are able to do

1229
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,640
both ends of that continuum at once

1230
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,480
and that's what i think that where the

1231
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,599
architecture and the process

1232
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,839
both come into play

1233
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,520
if we can look at this from us from a

1234
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,400
support more of a did you see what i saw

1235
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,760
perspective and most people won't say

1236
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,720
they're comparing flying monkeys to

1237
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,920
free energy

1238
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,760
dynamics but people can

1239
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,760
and maybe i think maybe that's what

1240
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,400
affordance our minds are trying to set

1241
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,720
up here it certainly is with how we

1242
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,200
encapsulate the information how we as

1243
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,920
the observer choose to do that and then

1244
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,960
try to gain some consensus around that

1245
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,079
thank you for your patience

1246
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,880
late nights in the dean household

1247
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,759
um blue and then stephen

1248
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:21,520
tickles me just tickles me

1249
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,319
um so i have to just comment on dean's

1250
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:25,839
comment really quickly and then i want

1251
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:27,680
to go back to what stephen said so

1252
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,119
um when yellow becomes orange in an fmri

1253
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,880
now i don't really

1254
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,520
know a lot about how fmri works but i

1255
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,280
don't think that there's actually any

1256
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,400
color spectra applied like yellow is

1257
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,280
570 to 590 nanometers in the

1258
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,640
electromagnetic spectrum but i don't

1259
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,319
think that fmri actually turns out

1260
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,400
yellow i think it actually turns out

1261
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,839
something between 0 and

1262
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:54,640
256. so like in terms of light intensity

1263
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,240
and we just fakely apply yellow to that

1264
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,960
right that's correct right yeah so so

1265
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,559
it's an arbitrary distinction when

1266
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,800
yellow becomes orange or rainbow

1267
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,720
like this is just something we made up

1268
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,440
um

1269
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,440
um just you know

1270
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,240
to to share our generative model like to

1271
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,599
share information about the picture that

1272
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,359
we're seeing on the screen um but but

1273
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,640
going back to what stephen said and then

1274
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,240
this is going to hit on a point that

1275
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,400
dean is going to love also

1276
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,280
you know

1277
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,760
because we apply

1278
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,319
the markov blanket to the system that

1279
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,480
we're interested in studying like to the

1280
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,240
organism the individual the heart the

1281
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,119
liver the cell to to define what makes

1282
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,280
the internal and external states

1283
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,440
conditionally independent we apply the

1284
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,559
blanket

1285
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:41,520
therefore we create the module is that

1286
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:46,040
the same or is that not the same

1287
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,280
i vote saying are we engaged in module

1288
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,680
projection or module discovery and

1289
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,280
not even or or what other

1290
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,119
ways do modules apply so stephen with a

1291
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,880
raised hand and then anyone else

1292
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,760
so there are two two interesting points

1293
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,520
um just been made there by blue and

1294
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,520
in that moment and dean

1295
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,800
what when we say doing both at once

1296
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,440
i think there's also times i would argue

1297
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,160
though

1298
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,480
that we're able to do both and some of

1299
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,760
these processes can be

1300
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:31,599
possibly be run in parallel however the

1301
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,559
regimes of attention at certain scales

1302
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:35,870
we can't do

1303
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:37,359
[Music]

1304
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:38,880
together

1305
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,520
in the same way we almost have to go

1306
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,040
from one to the other unless there's an

1307
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,280
adjacency between the two types of

1308
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,520
regimes i would say

1309
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,000
to enable that to happen so if i'm

1310
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,400
thinking about

1311
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,720
something for instance that's quite

1312
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,319
somatic

1313
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:57,920
and then i'm thinking about something

1314
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,079
which is quite um abstract

1315
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:03,839
over time i might be able to train

1316
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:07,359
myself for that abstract to have a

1317
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:10,319
marker in the somatic that i can then

1318
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:12,400
integrate with but i'm still integrating

1319
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,400
two semantics together in the somatic

1320
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,800
regime or i might have a model of the

1321
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,000
somatic

1322
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,599
in the kind of

1323
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,119
ocular visual

1324
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:23,440
modeling mode and i can imagine the two

1325
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,559
but

1326
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:28,480
in the same moment i can't hold both

1327
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,960
with the same type of embodiment

1328
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,440
so that's that's one of the things that

1329
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,200
i think is quite important

1330
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,079
to wonder and then also once we then get

1331
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,400
into these is that

1332
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,200
um

1333
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,400
ability to configure is that

1334
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,400
the markov blanket and this sort of

1335
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,520
takes us into sense finding sense making

1336
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,280
type of work is the sense finding that

1337
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,960
okay how am i even sensing what to do in

1338
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,359
this moment when we we have that

1339
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:59,599
um and then i start to sense and then

1340
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:01,440
i'm sense making how to do it and then

1341
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,040
i'm into skillful practice and maybe i

1342
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,319
can just do it

1343
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,640
so some things are more or less

1344
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,319
um in and out of is that sense finding

1345
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:12,079
sort of a line in the blanket by

1346
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:13,920
basically aligning what the sensory in

1347
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,400
action kind of states that are relevant

1348
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,680
are going to be done and then are we

1349
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,000
maybe have that set and now we're in a

1350
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,359
kind of more

1351
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:26,480
um generative sense making maybe even

1352
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,520
just skillful flow okay okay i've got my

1353
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,599
general blanket in place i'm in a

1354
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:34,640
skillful flow now right um

1355
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,520
and

1356
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,480
that sometimes takes time you know

1357
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,400
um and it's also maybe you know we can

1358
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,640
only switch attention to something

1359
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,200
that's in a different regime with a

1360
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,280
certain speed you know

1361
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,720
um so anyway at both those points really

1362
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,319
struck me

1363
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:55,040
the speed of attention it's really

1364
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,319
interesting

1365
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:57,760
and

1366
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,000
pristine and others have related that to

1367
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,880
the

1368
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,480
rapid oscillations like the gamma cycles

1369
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,599
in the brain

1370
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:07,040
which you know they don't happen a

1371
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,559
hundred thousand times per second but

1372
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,240
they do happen more than once a second

1373
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,240
they there's a certain number of times

1374
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,160
and it's interesting how that lines up

1375
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,119
with our

1376
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:16,640
uh perceptual

1377
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,119
capacity like when something is like

1378
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:21,440
alternating and rotating and then it

1379
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,960
goes from sort of black and white to

1380
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,079
gray

1381
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:25,040
there's

1382
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,119
a moment where the perceptual speed is

1383
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:29,200
just not able to

1384
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,160
um

1385
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,640
see that anymore as two contrasting

1386
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,760
states but it's one blurred state and it

1387
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,040
doesn't have to do with the photons

1388
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,119
hitting the retina being blurred it has

1389
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,880
to do with the generative model of

1390
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:41,920
vision

1391
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,079
dean

1392
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:45,920
stephen i completely agree with you and

1393
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,040
i i

1394
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,880
reference back to sort of wicked

1395
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,800
wittgenstein's illusion of the duck

1396
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,839
rabbit

1397
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,920
and how do we put a markov blanket

1398
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,920
between those two representations you

1399
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,079
can't see the rabbit when you see the

1400
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:01,359
duck and vice versa

1401
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:02,880
and then that leads me to this the

1402
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,880
parable of bob and alice so i just

1403
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,640
wanted to put that in there i think

1404
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,680
that's a great time let's um

1405
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,079
move bob and alice up let's put bob and

1406
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:14,240
alice on their own page with a with a

1407
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,359
duck

1408
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:16,800
i don't want to even buy us which one it

1409
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,040
is with this um

1410
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,119
representation so

1411
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:23,440
would you like to maybe set up the bob

1412
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,800
and alice or we can look up the um full

1413
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,200
text go with the text because it's

1414
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,160
really clear yeah awesome all right so

1415
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,879
here we go

1416
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:39,440
okay

1417
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:43,319
okay

1418
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,319
all right

1419
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,000
we're going to assume there are two

1420
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,520
neighbors bob and alice so a and b kind

1421
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,640
of a classic quantum parable

1422
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,160
every night when bob is beginning to

1423
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,400
brush his teeth alice begins to read

1424
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,640
a section of a tale of two cities at the

1425
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,400
adjunct flat

1426
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,400
state b contains bob beginning to brush

1427
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,400
his teeth in his flat and state a

1428
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,640
contains alice beginning to read

1429
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,079
the book at hers

1430
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:09,599
let us assume there is no causal

1431
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:11,599
relationship between the states a and b

1432
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:14,240
given the two states are segregated

1433
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,000
there may or may not be a common cause

1434
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
that pre-establishes a harmony between a

1435
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:18,800
and b

1436
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,680
say

1437
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,359
when what happens in a and b are both

1438
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,359
bedtime activities coordinated because

1439
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:25,119
of various cultural and geographic

1440
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:26,160
habits

1441
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,559
however the assumption of common cause

1442
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:30,079
does not need to affect the present

1443
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:32,079
discussion because what is important for

1444
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,319
us is that information processing is in

1445
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:36,799
a is inaccessible to information

1446
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:39,119
processing and b and vice versa

1447
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:41,040
this is in harmony with satisfying the

1448
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,040
assumption of encapsulation and the

1449
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,799
assumption of modularity to some

1450
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:46,640
interesting extent

1451
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,440
so dean maybe unpack or explain what you

1452
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,359
think is interesting and i'll start to

1453
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:52,480
get some

1454
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,119
uh nodes and edges on this slide okay so

1455
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:57,680
i don't know which which

1456
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,440
the duck or the rabbit which is bob or

1457
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,920
which is alice but to the observer

1458
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,720
there's information encapsulated in that

1459
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,640
which can be broken down

1460
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,760
into a or b

1461
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,000
then the question becomes one of so how

1462
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,240
do we modulate

1463
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:17,200
how does the switch between those two

1464
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:21,200
different representations held in one

1465
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,440
one block of pixels

1466
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,559
work

1467
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:27,119
how do we partition

1468
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,200
when that

1469
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,599
potential for one other or the other

1470
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:34,799
exists did did you see what i saw

1471
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,160
i guess we're coming back to that

1472
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,558
question

1473
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:43,680
okay

1474
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,920
steven and then i'll be

1475
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,119
developing these nodes a little bit

1476
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:51,119
yeah and what we see

1477
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:53,280
um

1478
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,799
well i'm going to add one thing here is

1479
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:56,960
sort of related i think is if you look

1480
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,240
at that rabbit and that duck okay

1481
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,040
well

1482
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,839
the rabbit is forward looking

1483
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,400
and decisive and the back is backward

1484
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,319
looking at the past

1485
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:09,440
because

1486
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,599
the grip the visual grammar that we use

1487
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,839
in the west is mostly that the left of a

1488
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:15,280
vertical

1489
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,319
flat image or flat piece of

1490
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:19,760
paper

1491
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,839
is the left is the past the right is the

1492
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:22,960
future

1493
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,240
so even that flipping

1494
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,000
the nature of

1495
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:28,960
that

1496
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,440
rabbit is

1497
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,400
caught within a cultural frame

1498
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,400
okay which would be different if the

1499
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,760
duck was facing the other way and the

1500
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,520
rabbit was looking backwards

1501
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,559
so

1502
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:42,400
um

1503
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,000
i suppose there's something interesting

1504
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,599
there yeah

1505
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,760
yeah now now the the rabbit's like

1506
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,400
looking back in the past right

1507
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,440
um

1508
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,200
so there's there's something interesting

1509
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,280
there about um

1510
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,079
uh

1511
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:00,960
other kind of uh the contextuality i

1512
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,440
suppose of how things are so i just

1513
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,920
thought i'd add that in but

1514
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,040
yes as the symposium with fristen

1515
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,280
discussed a lot illusions reveal our

1516
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,760
priors so if you're trained in ballerina

1517
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,400
dance and it's only a clockwise rotation

1518
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,480
when you see the rotating ballerina

1519
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,720
you're going to see that that's going to

1520
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,000
be

1521
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,720
having overwhelming posterior likelihood

1522
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:27,440
given the ambiguous visual stimuli or if

1523
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,359
cubes are always facing down into the

1524
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:31,520
left you're going to perceive that when

1525
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,319
you see an ambiguous cubic stimulus

1526
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:36,960
and so it does matter um

1527
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,359
these deep priors on how we perceive

1528
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:43,598
even visual stimuli blue

1529
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,280
so

1530
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,680
there's an important component i think

1531
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,640
that's missing from the bobbin alice

1532
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,680
paradigm and the author alludes to it in

1533
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,319
describing shared cultural norms bedtime

1534
00:57:58,319 --> 00:57:59,359
etc

1535
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:02,640
but there's bob and there's alice and

1536
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,760
then there's

1537
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,920
the niche the environment essentially

1538
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,599
that they both reside in the environment

1539
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:10,319
and in the environment it's nine o'clock

1540
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:11,920
and so something interesting that it

1541
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,799
reminds me of is um that i was reading

1542
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:16,799
that intransitivity paper i was just

1543
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:18,400
looking for it daniel maybe you have it

1544
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,799
in a slide and can reference it here but

1545
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:22,799
they talked about intransitivity in

1546
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:24,960
various contexts and we gave the example

1547
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,520
of rock paper scissors but um

1548
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:30,480
they also mentioned intransitivity in

1549
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,640
the laptop

1550
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,480
population model with the fox and the

1551
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,079
rabbit right so normally like you don't

1552
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,760
think about that as being an

1553
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,480
intransitive um relationship it's like

1554
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,160
the foxes go up and the rabbits go down

1555
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,920
and the rabbits go up and the fox you

1556
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,920
know it's like this cyclical thing

1557
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,839
between the fox and the rabbit but they

1558
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:49,839
mentioned the importance of the

1559
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:51,839
environment and how like it's just

1560
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:53,440
normally considered that environmental

1561
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,079
resources are constant but that's not

1562
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:59,200
normally the case and so eventually like

1563
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,520
if the rabbits eat all the grass the

1564
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,000
population of rabbits will go down

1565
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,559
unrelated to the population of foxes and

1566
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:09,119
and so it's um i think important to

1567
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:12,559
consider in bob and alice um in this

1568
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:14,400
relationship like what is the role of

1569
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,160
the niche environment and then does does

1570
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,799
like this third hidden state like okay

1571
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:22,480
we see bob and we see alice and they

1572
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,160
don't know anything about each other so

1573
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,000
information is encapsulated like bob

1574
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,359
doesn't know anything about alice alice

1575
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:29,280
doesn't know anything about bob but they

1576
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,880
both live in the same place and that's

1577
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:31,920
what i was saying earlier about the

1578
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,920
butterfly effect and climate change like

1579
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,799
the environment plays a role in the

1580
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:38,559
distribution of information between bob

1581
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:41,040
and alice

1582
00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:46,720
great um

1583
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,280
so we can look at two

1584
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,680
different stories and i think this

1585
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,240
totally gets to the um difference

1586
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,559
between realism and instrumentalism as

1587
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:57,599
well

1588
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:00,160
so what are the difference between these

1589
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:01,200
two

1590
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,280
these two uh well first off it's funny

1591
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,920
that the book being read is um

1592
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,520
a tale of two

1593
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,720
cities

1594
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:09,680
because

1595
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,599
that's like the tale of two den cities

1596
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:12,880
like we read

1597
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,839
and it's also invoked in the title of

1598
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:17,040
this paper

1599
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,880
so there's going to be

1600
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:22,240
two stories of red lines these are two

1601
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,680
narratives that can be told

1602
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:26,079
scientifically by modelers

1603
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:28,640
okay so no one's disagreeing about the

1604
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:29,920
niche no one's saying well they're

1605
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,440
they're actually they're in a you know

1606
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,520
one's on the moon and one's on earth so

1607
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,839
we're talking about the same niche

1608
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:38,559
now let's imagine that bob and alice

1609
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:42,799
were two brain regions b and a so we

1610
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:44,240
observe brushing

1611
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,599
and reading

1612
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:48,720
to be co-activated they're co-expressed

1613
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:49,920
behaviors

1614
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,040
and so

1615
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:54,160
what does this edge reflect

1616
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,640
we have an answer there

1617
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,119
it's the functional connectivity

1618
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:02,079
functional connectivity first to 94.

1619
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,680
functional connectivity is a temporal

1620
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,000
correlation between spatially remote

1621
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,040
events

1622
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:07,839
so

1623
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:10,160
that is functional connectivity the

1624
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,680
alternative is to

1625
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,760
refer to effective connectivity which is

1626
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,839
the influence of one neuronal system

1627
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:17,440
over another

1628
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,240
let's go back to bob and else so

1629
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:23,760
this is a functional connectivity edge

1630
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,319
if there was an effective connectivity

1631
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:27,920
edge

1632
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:28,640
it

1633
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,400
would have none

1634
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,079
because although they happen at a

1635
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:34,000
temporally correlated time let's just

1636
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,559
say they each did it 90 of the time so

1637
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,880
overall like 81 percent of the time

1638
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,240
they're both doing it

1639
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:41,839
and so there's a really high temporal

1640
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:43,920
correlation however

1641
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,680
the 10 percent of the time when one is

1642
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,760
not doing it it doesn't have an effect

1643
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:48,799
on the other

1644
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:50,640
so they're conditionally independent so

1645
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,480
actually the effective connectivity

1646
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,240
wouldn't have an edge if it were

1647
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:55,839
calculated appropriately

1648
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:57,920
so functional connectivity we see an

1649
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,839
edge effective connectivity we don't see

1650
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:03,119
an edge and then there's the third

1651
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:04,880
uh story then dean

1652
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,039
which is a causal

1653
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:08,960
mechanistic story

1654
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,039
which is the niche

1655
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:14,960
broadly being the time zone and the

1656
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,520
human circadian rhythms and all these

1657
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,200
other features

1658
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,240
the niche is influencing bob and alice

1659
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,760
independently it's like a confounding

1660
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:24,960
variable

1661
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,799
and then

1662
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:28,960
that is what causes bob to brush and

1663
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,640
alice to read

1664
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,960
and so yes we do get this temporal

1665
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,400
correlation

1666
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,640
arising from a

1667
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,280
latent cause and causing variable

1668
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:40,720
and so

1669
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,480
how does that relate to neuroimaging

1670
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,559
studies when people find that there's

1671
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:46,319
functional or even effective

1672
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:48,720
connectivity amongst brain regions

1673
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,039
and then cast that as a mechanistic

1674
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:52,240
story

1675
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,799
about what is actually happening

1676
01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:56,720
dean and then stephen

1677
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,720
isn't the effective i'm asking because i

1678
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,559
don't know is the effect of connectivity

1679
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:02,400
here it on a z

1680
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,160
plane meaning

1681
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,880
from the observer's standpoint

1682
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,680
the effect is

1683
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:13,520
this x y relationship

1684
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,359
um

1685
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:19,200
so

1686
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,359
because that's time right the changes

1687
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:26,079
through is through that from my eyeballs

1688
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:29,359
through that screen into that slide

1689
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:31,359
and then beyond on the other side of

1690
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:33,280
that is that not the effect of connected

1691
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,720
connectivity

1692
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,559
i know we can't show it here because we

1693
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:38,640
have to work on on

1694
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:42,079
on 2d rectangles but isn't that it

1695
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:42,960
um

1696
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,640
correct you could think about for any

1697
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,799
given edge

1698
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:48,880
like between brushing and reading

1699
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,359
there's gonna be some function fc score

1700
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:53,039
between zero and one

1701
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:54,240
and then there's some effective

1702
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,720
connectivity score between zero and one

1703
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,039
yeah and so you could have cases where

1704
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:02,240
that edge is like a zero comma zero

1705
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,240
it doesn't have effective nor functional

1706
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,240
connectivity in a given experimental

1707
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,280
measurement

1708
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,000
right

1709
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,160
and then you could have high for both

1710
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,079
and it always has to be described in

1711
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:13,680
terms of the measurement that's being

1712
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:15,440
taken because

1713
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,200
the temporal

1714
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,680
the temporal correlation

1715
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,680
doesn't exist outside of the time series

1716
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,079
that the correlation is being done on

1717
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:25,200
and so

1718
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,440
that is where benny introduces the model

1719
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,200
based science it's like

1720
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,960
like if you're talking at all about the

1721
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,520
connectivity statistically defined

1722
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,119
you're talking about a statistical model

1723
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:37,440
on a specific experiment so even if

1724
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,799
you're using a tool like a markov

1725
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:41,520
blanket or a linear aggression that is

1726
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,400
not posing in a priori scale

1727
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,799
in that time series there isn't a priori

1728
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,960
scale it's the specific time scale that

1729
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,079
you measured

1730
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:51,440
um

1731
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,480
so yes

1732
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,039
the edges can be of different kinds and

1733
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:57,039
in neuroimaging again as we talked about

1734
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:58,960
dot zero there's the anatomical the

1735
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,960
functional and the effective

1736
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:01,920
and so

1737
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,119
wouldn't that be

1738
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:04,799
simple if they were all the same but

1739
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:06,559
it's just literally not the case there's

1740
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,160
brain regions that don't have direct

1741
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,839
connections to each other

1742
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:11,839
that have temporal correlations and

1743
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:13,760
there's ones that are directly connected

1744
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:14,799
but they don't have temporal

1745
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:16,640
correlations and every other

1746
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,559
combination that's why we have to do

1747
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:20,000
empirical measurement

1748
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,480
so stephen

1749
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:25,520
this

1750
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:28,000
the the the difference as well is now we

1751
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,640
see niche being brought in

1752
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,799
when we have functional connectivity in

1753
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:33,920
the brain

1754
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,559
it's kind of assuming that it's all

1755
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:38,079
brain

1756
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:40,240
processes so you okay you've got the

1757
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,599
brain and what's going on and the

1758
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:43,680
connection between different areas now

1759
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,599
if we start coming out and we start

1760
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:48,400
looking at well there's active inference

1761
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,359
with markov markovian approaches

1762
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:54,160
okay there's brushing but brushing

1763
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,039
is

1764
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:57,119
an action

1765
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:59,200
right reason is an action

1766
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,599
coupled to a niche and the body and the

1767
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,359
generative model

1768
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:05,440
and so you've now come

1769
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,920
and the niche it's not just that there's

1770
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,319
a niche out there that's also

1771
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:11,839
interacting

1772
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:13,280
with

1773
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,920
a kind of a brain based process you've

1774
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,839
got a niche but there's also then

1775
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:21,119
another recursion where okay we're now

1776
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:24,160
looking at the idea

1777
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,480
which is maybe been reformulated

1778
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,799
conceptually more

1779
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:32,160
of this whole thing happening

1780
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,720
and this whole thing this whole process

1781
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,480
this model

1782
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,799
is in a niche itself

1783
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:41,599
okay and there's i'm i'm creating in

1784
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:43,119
this model

1785
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:44,880
of this story

1786
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,200
a functional connectivity which may be

1787
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,359
substantiated through data if science is

1788
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:51,680
used between brushing and reading

1789
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:54,480
because the story has put that system of

1790
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:57,119
information to me because i've never met

1791
01:06:57,119 --> 01:06:58,960
bob or alice and they most likely

1792
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,400
fictional so there's an interesting move

1793
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,720
from what started out as brain regions

1794
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,079
being looked at

1795
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:08,799
as functional connectivity

1796
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:11,440
trying to then think what that's doing

1797
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,039
because this

1798
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:16,400
something out there this hidden states

1799
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,440
to

1800
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,000
an active influence agent where you now

1801
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,039
have

1802
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:24,000
action to give you a grounding to

1803
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
jumping back out again to another sort

1804
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:26,839
of

1805
01:07:26,839 --> 01:07:29,520
conceptual system of information which

1806
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,359
we may be working with

1807
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:33,760
to look at ourselves so

1808
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,079
i think that that changes where does

1809
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:40,440
that work niche fit

1810
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:45,520
great thanks dean

1811
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:48,480
i just think that if i'm

1812
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,119
if i'm going to incorporate effect

1813
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:53,359
effective

1814
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:56,160
connectivity i'm actually looking at the

1815
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:59,119
observer observing

1816
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:00,799
so

1817
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:02,960
if somebody

1818
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,200
somebody throws me into a

1819
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,079
cat scan machine starts taking slices on

1820
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:09,599
my brain i'm sure they're going to be

1821
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,200
able to point out some sort of a

1822
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,119
functional connection between

1823
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:15,520
what image pops out when i when it my

1824
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:18,799
brain is focusing on the rabbit or my

1825
01:08:18,799 --> 01:08:21,279
brain is focusing on the duck

1826
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:22,799
that functional connection will

1827
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:24,719
definitely be able to show up in terms

1828
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:26,000
of

1829
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,238
some sort of differentiation

1830
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:30,319
between those two

1831
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:32,719
ways that i'm i'm perceiving that that

1832
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:33,920
image

1833
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,399
i think it's harder and maybe there's

1834
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:38,080
because i don't know but maybe there is

1835
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,719
some way of being able to show

1836
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:43,679
how the brain is swapping

1837
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:45,839
building the markov blanket

1838
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:47,359
in situ

1839
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:49,040
i don't know

1840
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,880
but if there is a paper about that i'd

1841
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,839
like to read it

1842
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:57,839
because i know that i know the observer

1843
01:08:57,839 --> 01:08:59,359
in in

1844
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:00,479
betty's

1845
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:04,238
example here is swapping at some point

1846
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:05,520
between

1847
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,120
am i looking at bob

1848
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,960
am i looking at alice or am i looking at

1849
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:13,359
nine o'clock or am i looking at the swap

1850
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:15,279
and i'm not sure if it's easy to be able

1851
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:17,279
to show the swap part but it's

1852
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:20,238
definitely there

1853
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:21,759
great blue did you want to add it

1854
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:23,040
something about the

1855
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:26,560
the intransitivity of the volterra

1856
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,799
ecological modeling

1857
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:32,158
so i i had already mentioned it okay

1858
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:35,120
yeah okay great steven

1859
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,799
sort of it's gonna be a little bit of a

1860
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:38,640
question but it's rhetorical if you want

1861
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,000
it to be but

1862
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,319
if we've got here

1863
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:43,759
um

1864
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:45,679
the relationship between

1865
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:48,319
the the brain processing or the the body

1866
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:49,759
processing

1867
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:51,359
of the organism

1868
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:53,520
there could be effective con

1869
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:56,159
connectivity because there's some

1870
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:59,440
common relational processes

1871
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,679
if we're talking about

1872
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:02,960
how they're

1873
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:06,480
in their niche and maybe some

1874
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:09,199
loose way that feedback loops can

1875
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:10,880
reverberate through the buildings that

1876
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:13,280
they're in and the social

1877
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:14,640
miller

1878
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,880
you can see the niche coming in

1879
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,199
and then if we then go to well what in

1880
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:21,199
this system of information

1881
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:23,040
that we're engaging

1882
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,920
so if alice and bob

1883
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,360
are coupled

1884
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:30,719
in our system information here

1885
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:33,360
that could be functional

1886
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:34,400
because we

1887
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,960
i i i it's within

1888
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,679
the variables that i assign to alice and

1889
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:43,520
bob in whatever way that i'm embodying

1890
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,360
this meaning making so i was wondering

1891
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:48,880
if if those three

1892
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:50,560
it sort of ties in a bit of what you've

1893
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,480
got here but i i kind of feel it's

1894
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:53,920
useful to

1895
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,600
it starts to think about where was

1896
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:58,080
fristen coming from when it was a kind

1897
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,280
of a

1898
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:02,159
trying to get at what the brain's doing

1899
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:04,400
in response to

1900
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:06,000
and really get at what's going on in

1901
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,199
there

1902
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:09,040
to when it's something which is actually

1903
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,719
happening

1904
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:12,960
to something again which becomes a kind

1905
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:16,480
of an abstracted level and

1906
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,560
i don't know which of those is closest

1907
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,880
to what is normally being taught

1908
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:23,600
or you know does that change between the

1909
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,360
actual nature

1910
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:28,719
of the the system do we do we have a way

1911
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:29,679
to

1912
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:31,920
to to think about that

1913
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:35,440
or is that speaking to this um

1914
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:38,719
process that when you just have dcm

1915
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:40,400
models and you just have these kind of

1916
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,400
informational models

1917
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,400
that has to be kind of set

1918
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,000
you have to kind of tell it and believe

1919
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,840
that what you're talking about

1920
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:50,400
the beauty of active inference is

1921
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:51,760
i have

1922
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:55,360
a deeper anchor to help me tether all of

1923
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,880
those three

1924
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,280
you know i have an embodied way of

1925
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,199
knowing how it is to imagine i have an

1926
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:02,880
embodied way of knowing how to brush and

1927
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,640
read i have

1928
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:07,360
um an embodied way

1929
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:09,920
of enacting motor skills

1930
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,520
um

1931
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,040
in real time

1932
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,360
to make the brushing and reading even

1933
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:16,719
possible

1934
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:19,600
and that's something that the previous

1935
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,159
models

1936
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:23,920
really got a plausible mechanism to

1937
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,440
explain

1938
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:28,159
until we got active influence

1939
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:30,159
dcm doesn't seem to have that ability

1940
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:32,880
it's all still kind of untethered

1941
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:36,920
information based approaches

1942
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:38,159
okay

1943
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:40,560
interesting so i think

1944
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,520
these

1945
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:42,880
three

1946
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,159
tale of three

1947
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:46,080
cities now

1948
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,120
we have

1949
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,480
um

1950
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:49,360
a

1951
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,520
functional so these are predicated upon

1952
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:54,239
observations of so

1953
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:56,560
first to steven's point yes we could

1954
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:58,400
think about brushing and reading as

1955
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:01,120
affordances and embodiment and that is

1956
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,960
something that active inference brings

1957
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,880
to the table which is like the ability

1958
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:05,679
to

1959
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:06,800
zoom in

1960
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,920
on one of these observations

1961
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:12,080
and it's like well we're not just

1962
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:13,840
studying the observation of brushing

1963
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:16,000
there's an entity that's engaged in this

1964
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,600
skillful action that's encultured and

1965
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,120
that just takes you a million other

1966
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:20,880
places so yes active inference is a

1967
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,199
development on what fristen and others

1968
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:26,320
have been doing for 30 years

1969
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,560
we really have to be careful

1970
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,239
whether we're using terms in their

1971
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:31,360
technical

1972
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:34,400
statistical sense or not like just to

1973
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:36,640
show how easy it is to get mixed up you

1974
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,040
can say well i mean brushing and reading

1975
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,040
are correlated so it's like they're

1976
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:44,159
effectively connected

1977
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:46,080
but they're not that's called functional

1978
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,159
connectivity functional connectivity is

1979
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:49,760
the temporal correlation and then here's

1980
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,199
how easy it is to get confused on the

1981
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:53,120
other side

1982
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,600
here's a story about the world where bob

1983
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,600
does call alice but we are not

1984
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,880
wiretapping

1985
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,640
and bob says hey i'm brushing you should

1986
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:01,840
read

1987
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,120
and so

1988
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:06,000
it turns out that in this world

1989
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,560
not just are brushing and reading

1990
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:10,560
functionally correlated

1991
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,560
like they have a time series correlation

1992
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:15,040
but actually brushing does

1993
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:17,280
induce reading through a mechanism that

1994
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,760
we didn't observe

1995
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,040
that sounds like a functional

1996
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,480
correlation

1997
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:24,880
or a functional connection it's not

1998
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:27,520
it's an effective connection

1999
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:29,440
how it's technically defined the

2000
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:32,239
influence of one system on another

2001
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:35,600
and so yes function is happening action

2002
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:39,760
is happening but it is very

2003
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,280
important

2004
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:44,719
that when thinking about these edges

2005
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:46,400
people are accurate because these

2006
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,159
stories are all happening at the same

2007
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:51,280
time and different experimental designs

2008
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:53,280
or statistical analyses

2009
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,120
might not be contradictory to each other

2010
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,040
they might be totally complementary to

2011
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:58,000
each other

2012
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,920
somebody might be describing

2013
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,640
the enculturation of how brushing and

2014
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,159
reading come to be

2015
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:05,760
and somebody else might be talking about

2016
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:06,800
the functional or the effect of

2017
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,960
connectivity or all these other kinds of

2018
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:12,000
pieces and so i agree active

2019
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,760
helps us

2020
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:16,400
understand the non-rival risk dynamics

2021
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:19,840
of all these different descriptions

2022
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,520
however we're going to be on the ground

2023
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:22,880
floor forever

2024
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,480
if we can't

2025
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,400
be clear about what those different

2026
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:29,520
descriptions are and adjust our regime

2027
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:30,800
to these different

2028
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,000
important

2029
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,400
parts of the system

2030
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:38,280
dave and then dean

2031
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:42,159
okay dean and then dave if you unmute

2032
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:44,960
later so dina then stephen and then yeah

2033
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:47,760
so could you put a second thought bubble

2034
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,880
uh under ec and could you be hey i'm

2035
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:54,719
nine o'clocking are you

2036
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,920
like because that to me is the effect of

2037
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,239
connectivity i i keep the hey i'm

2038
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:02,560
brushing you should read but also there

2039
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,840
should be a second one hey i'm nine

2040
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,400
o'clocking

2041
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,719
are you nine o'clocking because that to

2042
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:12,400
me is it speaks as much to the if effect

2043
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,679
as opposed to the function

2044
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:17,600
yes

2045
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,640
good point and this there'd be depending

2046
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:21,920
on how literal you want to take this

2047
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,679
metaphor or how you're imagining the

2048
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,360
story bob analysis or how close you want

2049
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:28,000
to tie it to neural systems

2050
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,840
one could imagine various pieces this is

2051
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,840
just to highlight like that red is this

2052
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:34,239
causal chain the difference that makes a

2053
01:16:34,239 --> 01:16:36,880
difference the actual phone call that

2054
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:40,000
induces reading that's unobserved in

2055
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,440
this experiment so fmri is measuring

2056
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:47,280
blood oxygen level dynamics bold signal

2057
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:49,840
and so that's not even neural activity

2058
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,320
now read the spm textbook because that's

2059
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,480
how you infer neuronal activity from the

2060
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:57,120
bold signal but it's not what's being

2061
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,199
directly measured

2062
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:00,800
great

2063
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,120
but but i just want to add so even the

2064
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:07,360
observer is nine o'clocking

2065
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,080
so now bob is nine o'clocking alice is

2066
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,239
nine o'clock and the observer of bob and

2067
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:14,880
alice is nine o'clock

2068
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,880
that's the that's what i i kind of want

2069
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:19,840
to bring into the conversation

2070
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:22,640
yes totally agree like here's our um

2071
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:25,600
happy scientists

2072
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,480
don't know if there's a better icon to

2073
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:30,239
represent the scientists but right

2074
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:32,640
they're going to be observing

2075
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:34,640
they're the ones who are making all of

2076
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,320
these observations

2077
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:37,440
and it's it's um

2078
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:38,719
[Music]

2079
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:41,040
it's somewhere between misguided to

2080
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,080
dangerous

2081
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:43,840
when it's like well this is simply how

2082
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,679
it is it's like well no there's the

2083
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:47,199
smiley guy

2084
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:49,600
who's projecting that who's modeling

2085
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,920
model-based science science is a social

2086
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,040
practice

2087
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:56,080
humans doing science

2088
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,400
this is really important to keep in mind

2089
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,239
um otherwise you might have you know a

2090
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:02,400
smiley and a frowny and then they're

2091
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,880
debating two different stories

2092
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,880
and one is actually talking about the fc

2093
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,199
and one is the ec and one's debating the

2094
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:10,880
niche and you could have all these

2095
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,480
different perspectives

2096
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,800
and they don't have a common

2097
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,239
rosetta stone

2098
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:18,320
to actually come together

2099
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,679
and some people are just talking about

2100
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:21,679
what happens in principle no reference

2101
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:23,280
to a data set someone else is talking

2102
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:24,800
about an empirical correlation

2103
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,159
coefficient from a specific data set

2104
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:29,440
so yes

2105
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:32,559
steven then blue

2106
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:34,880
yeah this is very helpful to to map it

2107
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:37,280
out like this and

2108
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,120
it sort of gives a sense of this journey

2109
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:41,440
of functional connectivity

2110
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:44,000
functional um to

2111
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,360
effective

2112
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:46,400
and i'm

2113
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,000
wondering whether

2114
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,960
we the the process has evolved even

2115
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:53,679
further to affective

2116
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:56,640
connectivity um in the sense of like

2117
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:59,920
alice could ring up bob and say hey bob

2118
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:02,159
i i'm feeling good tonight

2119
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:03,840
it's been a great day

2120
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:04,800
okay

2121
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,360
bob's like okay

2122
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,960
i'm feeling good hey i'm gonna brush my

2123
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,560
teeth

2124
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:11,840
um

2125
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:12,719
so

2126
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:14,080
um

2127
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:17,360
the the there's a there and uh i'm i'm a

2128
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:19,679
bit more motivated to be into that big

2129
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:21,920
book that i i really am not wasn't so

2130
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,600
interested in before but i know alice

2131
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,679
likes you know so there's a

2132
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:28,159
is that is that kind of that extension

2133
01:19:28,159 --> 01:19:30,080
something that's almost could be charted

2134
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:33,040
here from functional to effective to

2135
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:36,040
affective

2136
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,718
so

2137
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,360
it's a good question we can imagine this

2138
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:44,480
little variable because again we're not

2139
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,159
um

2140
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:48,480
in the territory we're on the map

2141
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,480
if this variable

2142
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:52,400
is bob's affect

2143
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,679
and bob's affect has an edge

2144
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:58,159
that is influencing how likely bob is to

2145
01:19:58,159 --> 01:19:59,600
undertake the policy selection of

2146
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,199
calling alice

2147
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:02,480
then yes

2148
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,880
there is an effective edge

2149
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:06,800
or a connectivity between the variable

2150
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:09,440
corresponding to bob's affect

2151
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:12,000
and then the policy

2152
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,760
of what to say

2153
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:14,800
and then

2154
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,679
continue onwards but not every single

2155
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:19,840
piece is

2156
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,159
explored here but yes affects can enter

2157
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:24,960
the picture and that's what's so fun and

2158
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,719
exciting about these

2159
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:29,520
incredibly composable and flexible

2160
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,920
models like active inference so stephen

2161
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:34,480
and then blue

2162
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,800
and this also you know sort of harking

2163
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,400
back to that earlier question about

2164
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,120
social sciences and other sciences and

2165
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:45,120
this actually does provide a useful

2166
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,480
way to

2167
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:49,360
have a construct to look even at arts

2168
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:51,679
and the the sort of relationship people

2169
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:53,360
be having so as you may be thinking

2170
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:54,480
about

2171
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,159
as people think about narratives and

2172
01:20:56,159 --> 01:20:59,440
stories as well as okay what is

2173
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:01,440
explicitly happening and measurable

2174
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,880
through modeling

2175
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:05,040
what kinds of

2176
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:06,400
relational

2177
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:09,440
dynamics might be at play

2178
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:12,480
and that itself could be a useful

2179
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:15,520
boundary object in construction

2180
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,040
co-creation

2181
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,719
work because you started to get some

2182
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:20,800
sort of framework again

2183
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:24,480
provided you get some of the minimal

2184
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,880
constructs clear so that it doesn't just

2185
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:29,840
become noise

2186
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:33,919
thanks blue

2187
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:35,760
so i'm also wondering about the

2188
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:38,000
relationship between functional

2189
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,199
connectivity and effective connectivity

2190
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:43,199
um and just really

2191
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:45,360
i think about this always in in relation

2192
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:48,159
to like gene expression right so you

2193
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:49,199
know we

2194
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:51,360
observe a functional connectivity

2195
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,639
because

2196
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:54,560
two genes are expressed in the same

2197
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:55,840
tissue at the same time they're both

2198
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,760
upregulated right so this is something

2199
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,679
like that that daniel and i have studied

2200
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:01,040
and maybe four into the rest of you guys

2201
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:02,800
but um

2202
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:05,600
effective connectivity also in terms of

2203
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:06,960
gene expression is like there's a

2204
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,679
downstream effector molecule right like

2205
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:11,840
so there's a a molecule that has an

2206
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:14,719
effect downstream of the gene expression

2207
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:16,159
so like you know there's one

2208
01:22:16,159 --> 01:22:17,600
transcription factor that diffuses

2209
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,920
through a tissue and then activates the

2210
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,760
the transcription of something else

2211
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:22,840
right

2212
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:25,440
um and i wonder

2213
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:26,239
so

2214
01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:28,239
it's not that i think functional

2215
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:30,800
connectivity and effective connectivity

2216
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:33,360
um can occupy the same space at the same

2217
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:35,679
time but but what is it then when

2218
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:36,639
there's

2219
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:38,400
effective connectivity like i'm the

2220
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:41,199
transfix i am the transcription factor

2221
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:43,120
so i'm effectively connected to

2222
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,280
downstream genes right

2223
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,679
and so when i activate two genes at the

2224
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:49,199
same time are those effectively

2225
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:50,719
connected to the transcription factor

2226
01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:52,880
but functionally connected to each other

2227
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,800
like i i wonder just if there's any

2228
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,719
degree of overlap between functional

2229
01:22:56,719 --> 01:22:59,600
connectivity and effective connectivity

2230
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,120
thanks dean

2231
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:03,280
can i ask you a question blue

2232
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:06,480
is is because i know nothing about genes

2233
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:10,239
other than i wear them occasionally do

2234
01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:11,040
do

2235
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,239
genes

2236
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:14,080
automatically go

2237
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:15,920
to the place of

2238
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:19,040
affording us certain things as an effect

2239
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:21,040
or can genes

2240
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:21,920
be

2241
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:23,840
an affordance as a cause because it

2242
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:26,400
sounds to me knowing nothing about genes

2243
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,560
that you're describing that you're

2244
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:31,760
saying that genes can also be a cause

2245
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:33,520
which i think would be really

2246
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:34,960
interesting

2247
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:36,880
but i'm not sure if that's i don't know

2248
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:37,600
like

2249
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,639
is it is gene only an effector or is

2250
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:44,400
gene also an affordance around cause

2251
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,960
so genes can be causes especially like

2252
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:49,040
genes like transcription factors what i

2253
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:50,480
was mentioning earlier um a

2254
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:52,320
transcription factor just like activates

2255
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:53,760
the transcription of other genes that's

2256
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:56,320
like what it that's what its job is so

2257
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:57,840
and and it's something that happens like

2258
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,600
very normally during the processes of

2259
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:00,960
development and the transcription

2260
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:03,840
factors diffuse along axes and then it

2261
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:07,440
you know causes like a cascade of um

2262
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,199
you know developmental gene expression

2263
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:11,679
timing that happens

2264
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:13,840
so if it can be both a cause and effect

2265
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:16,480
are you saying that it has

2266
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,320
whether we whether we

2267
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:20,080
measure it traditionally

2268
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:24,400
with a time stamp that it it in effect

2269
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,560
has a built-in affordance for time is

2270
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:29,760
that because it's it sounds fascinating

2271
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:31,360
if it's true because i said i don't know

2272
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,360
anything about this but if that's the

2273
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,600
case maybe some of the traditional ways

2274
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:39,280
that we measure change

2275
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:42,400
have to be reviewed

2276
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:43,360
so

2277
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:45,840
right like like in so i'm

2278
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:47,679
let me see if i can understand your

2279
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:49,520
question fully so in the process of

2280
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,679
development there are specific genes

2281
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:53,760
that are expressed in specific tissues

2282
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,920
at specific times that aren't expressed

2283
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:59,040
any other time so in that way it could

2284
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:01,040
it could i i guess mark time is that

2285
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:04,159
kind of what you're asking yeah

2286
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:06,719
yes genes as kairos

2287
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:09,040
is a very interesting idea like there

2288
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,880
are certain critical periods where

2289
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:13,199
developmental factors are expressed in

2290
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:15,679
sequence but let me also respond to the

2291
01:25:15,679 --> 01:25:17,360
comment about what blue said about

2292
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:19,360
genetics so

2293
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,760
unsurprisingly genetics uses a different

2294
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:24,239
ontology they use a different onft

2295
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:26,159
actually ontology narrative formal

2296
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:28,960
documents and tools than neuroscience

2297
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:31,280
so when people in genetics

2298
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,360
are describing functional

2299
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:36,239
connectivity or functional interactions

2300
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:37,840
call those connectivity

2301
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:38,880
usually

2302
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:41,199
for cellular biologists function is

2303
01:25:41,199 --> 01:25:43,280
equivalent to mechanism and so a

2304
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:45,040
functional connection

2305
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,040
would be like a mechanistic

2306
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:49,760
physical linkage so two proteins that

2307
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:51,360
bind that's called a protein-protein

2308
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:54,639
interaction or like dna protein binding

2309
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:56,400
like the transcription factor example

2310
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,639
that blue mentioned so

2311
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:00,800
that is often what is meant by

2312
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,719
functional connectivity

2313
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:04,960
effective connectivity i don't think is

2314
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:08,400
used that much but if it were it would

2315
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,960
be used informally to describe the

2316
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:12,639
effect of one

2317
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:14,320
on another

2318
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:15,840
mechanistically

2319
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:18,719
probably not in this time series

2320
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:21,120
perturbation framework

2321
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:22,800
and this is one of the most

2322
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,120
fascinating areas like people talk about

2323
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:26,719
gene networks or gene regulatory

2324
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:27,760
networks

2325
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:30,400
but there are multiple kinds of networks

2326
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:31,679
that you can make

2327
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:34,880
you can make networks of

2328
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:37,040
proteins that bind to each other

2329
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:40,080
you can make networks of proteins that

2330
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:40,960
are

2331
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:43,199
co-expressed so they have correlated

2332
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:45,920
expression patterns which is functional

2333
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:47,360
connectivity

2334
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:48,880
but that doesn't mean that they're

2335
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:51,760
functionally related there could be one

2336
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:54,400
factor or a cellular scenario that

2337
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,560
causes two genes to be upregulated so

2338
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,080
they're going to appear in the same

2339
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:00,239
coexpression group

2340
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:02,080
and therefore a neuroscientist would say

2341
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:04,560
that they're functionally connected

2342
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:05,520
a

2343
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,600
biologist might jump to say there's a

2344
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,520
functional relationship or oh there's a

2345
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:11,679
gene ontology enrichment of this

2346
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:13,760
coexpression module so there's some sort

2347
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,440
of functional relationship but it's

2348
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:18,159
being used in a slightly different way

2349
01:27:18,159 --> 01:27:19,120
and

2350
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:21,360
wouldn't that be fun to have shared

2351
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:24,719
ontology for systems that ultimately are

2352
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:26,480
related like gene expression and

2353
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:28,080
neurophysiology

2354
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:30,320
so blue and then stephen

2355
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:31,679
okay let me just respond to that really

2356
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:34,320
quickly okay so so take my gene

2357
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:36,400
expression um

2358
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,239
comment aside

2359
01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:40,400
let's go back to the brain so say there

2360
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:41,120
are

2361
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:43,280
two neurons that light up at the same

2362
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:46,320
time they're not connected right so that

2363
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:50,080
is a functional connection between those

2364
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:52,800
two g neurons or brain regions right so

2365
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:55,120
but let's just use neurons for the sake

2366
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:57,199
of simplicity so two neurons that light

2367
01:27:57,199 --> 01:27:58,880
up at the same time they're they're

2368
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,400
functionally connected

2369
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:03,440
now one neuron that lights up and then

2370
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:05,280
touches another neuron and tells it to

2371
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:07,040
light up that's an effective connection

2372
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,040
is that correct

2373
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:13,120
yes or if you had a hidden third neuron

2374
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:15,120
with a time delay and it influenced one

2375
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:16,800
in one time step and it took two time

2376
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:18,800
steps to get to the second one you would

2377
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,960
see an effective connection between the

2378
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:22,800
two that you measured because the second

2379
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,239
one would always get activated after the

2380
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:26,480
first one and so that's the challenge

2381
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:29,199
with interpreting effective connectivity

2382
01:28:29,199 --> 01:28:31,360
as a mechanistic story

2383
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:33,679
when actually a whole

2384
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:36,080
diversity of mechanisms can give rise to

2385
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:37,600
the observed empirical effect of

2386
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:38,800
connectivity

2387
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,719
okay but wait so here's my question like

2388
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:42,800
i'm trying to see if there's any overlap

2389
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,320
between this functional and effective

2390
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:46,639
connectivity so say i have one neuron

2391
01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:49,679
that touches two neurons and tells those

2392
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:51,920
two neurons to light up at exactly the

2393
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:52,960
same time

2394
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:54,320
is that

2395
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:56,480
effective connectivity between the

2396
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:58,960
original neuron and the two neurons that

2397
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:00,480
light up subsequently and then

2398
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:02,800
functional connectivity only between

2399
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:04,159
those two neurons that light up at the

2400
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:05,520
same time but are not touching is that

2401
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:07,760
correct to think of it that way yes the

2402
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,159
two children would have functional

2403
01:29:10,159 --> 01:29:11,600
connectivity because they have a

2404
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:13,280
temporal correlation between remote

2405
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:15,199
events however they would not have an

2406
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:17,760
effective connectivity because activity

2407
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,199
in one would be conditionally

2408
01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:21,600
independent upon activity in the other

2409
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:23,040
and then from the point of view of that

2410
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:24,800
parent's neuron

2411
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,480
it would not have functional

2412
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:27,920
connectivity

2413
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:30,080
because let's just assume that it spikes

2414
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:31,520
and then the next one and then the next

2415
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,520
time step it's not spiking in the the

2416
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:36,080
children are so it wouldn't have a

2417
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:38,320
temporal correlation in its activity at

2418
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:40,080
a lag of one it gets a little bit more

2419
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:41,840
complex when we're talking about

2420
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:43,440
time lag models

2421
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:45,440
but it would have effective connectivity

2422
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:46,560
through time

2423
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:49,520
because it is like a directed edge

2424
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:50,960
influencing them

2425
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:53,679
and functional and effective are

2426
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:55,120
independent of

2427
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:56,800
the anatomical connectivity which is

2428
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:58,320
what you'd find out with a microscope

2429
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,480
without taking any measurements

2430
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:02,320
so there's no overlap between these two

2431
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:03,440
categories

2432
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:06,239
there are situations where they can be

2433
01:30:06,239 --> 01:30:08,239
high for both or they can be low for

2434
01:30:08,239 --> 01:30:09,920
both

2435
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:11,840
and the there can be anatomical

2436
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:14,880
connectivity and functional or effective

2437
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:17,920
or any combination it's like for two

2438
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:18,880
nodes

2439
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:20,960
there's like a tuple

2440
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:23,760
of how strong that edge is

2441
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:25,520
functionally effectively and

2442
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:28,080
anatomically and it could be one one one

2443
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:29,760
it could be negative one one negative

2444
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,679
one it could be anything

2445
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:33,440
so i'm trying to think of a circumstance

2446
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:36,239
where something can be functionally and

2447
01:30:36,239 --> 01:30:38,159
effectively connected how is that

2448
01:30:38,159 --> 01:30:39,600
possible

2449
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:42,000
so there would be um like

2450
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:42,960
two

2451
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,880
cryptocurrencies

2452
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:47,520
who over the year time scale

2453
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:49,840
have both gone up so at the course

2454
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:51,440
graining they have a positive

2455
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:52,960
correlation that's the functional

2456
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:54,239
connectivity

2457
01:30:54,239 --> 01:30:55,600
and

2458
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,360
they have a day-to-day correlation in

2459
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:58,560
their movements

2460
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:02,560
such that one moving leads the other um

2461
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:03,920
that day

2462
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:05,280
so then they'd have an effective

2463
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:07,120
connectivity on the short time scale

2464
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:08,719
because through time changes in one

2465
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:10,239
caused the same direction of changes in

2466
01:31:10,239 --> 01:31:12,560
the other and when you zoom out they

2467
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:16,280
have a broad scale correlation

2468
01:31:18,159 --> 01:31:20,719
got it so depending on the time scale

2469
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:24,800
they can be functional or effective

2470
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,480
yes and this is like where it does

2471
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:28,639
matter exactly how there's not just one

2472
01:31:28,639 --> 01:31:30,639
way to do a time series correlation

2473
01:31:30,639 --> 01:31:32,880
because a time series correlation can be

2474
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:34,000
just

2475
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,760
um like

2476
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:40,320
an arima model can have different time

2477
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,400
horizons so one can look at the temporal

2478
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,400
correlation like let's just say you had

2479
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:48,000
two um out of phase oscillators

2480
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,239
if you had a time horizon of one they

2481
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:51,440
would have very strong negative

2482
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:52,639
correlation

2483
01:31:52,639 --> 01:31:54,560
but if you had very very long time

2484
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:56,800
windows they would have about the same

2485
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:57,679
average

2486
01:31:57,679 --> 01:31:59,199
so you'd think that they were

2487
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:01,760
uncorrelated for example so time series

2488
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:04,320
correlations extremely depend on the

2489
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:06,800
specifics of how it's calculated

2490
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:08,480
which brings us back to model based

2491
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:09,760
science

2492
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:12,159
and you know a w for the

2493
01:32:12,159 --> 01:32:14,560
instrumentalists over the realists

2494
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,719
and that's why benny is saying like yeah

2495
01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:19,840
don't get too concerned

2496
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,520
about

2497
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:24,639
whether we're finding cyclic or directed

2498
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:26,880
acyclic models

2499
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:28,880
because those are just modeling

2500
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:32,000
conveniences that are downstream of the

2501
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,719
experimental setup and the measurement

2502
01:32:34,719 --> 01:32:36,880
and the quantification techniques so

2503
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:38,960
let's focus on that

2504
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,800
and we'll see that we're engaged in

2505
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,320
different flavors

2506
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:44,480
of the scientific endeavor

2507
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:45,520
and

2508
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:47,440
ones that include humans and all the

2509
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:48,880
ways that they work

2510
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:51,120
and that just trying to look at that um

2511
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:52,639
distilled kernel of like well the

2512
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:57,280
coefficient is 0.7 so it's a module

2513
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:58,400
that is

2514
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:01,840
um a metaphysical conclusion

2515
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:04,320
or an ontological conclusion being drawn

2516
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:06,480
from a methodological process that might

2517
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:09,638
be unwarranted

2518
01:33:17,199 --> 01:33:19,520
so in our oh yeah steven go for it yeah

2519
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:21,280
i was so

2520
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:24,400
if we were to take um

2521
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:25,920
between these two and i think this has

2522
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:27,520
really helped clarify because yeah i

2523
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:31,360
think you're right the these words are

2524
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:33,440
possibly open to

2525
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:35,280
some confusion at first

2526
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:37,840
if we're to take a brain scan in which

2527
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:39,440
is essentially you've got the you know

2528
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:41,040
you can have electrical

2529
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:43,760
signals which aren't very easy to

2530
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:45,600
identify

2531
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,840
where they're coming from but you can

2532
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:51,199
get a good sense of temporal fidelity

2533
01:33:51,199 --> 01:33:53,679
and then you've got fmri which tends to

2534
01:33:53,679 --> 01:33:57,920
be a bit more um over time

2535
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:00,080
briston was bringing had has been

2536
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:02,560
bringing that to the table the idea that

2537
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:04,719
well what's the gen the more general

2538
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:09,040
function at play and what's the type of

2539
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:10,800
spatially

2540
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:12,639
um

2541
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:15,360
understood changes happening

2542
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:17,360
over that temporal

2543
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:18,639
depth

2544
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:20,719
whereas

2545
01:34:20,719 --> 01:34:23,120
the effective connectivity might be more

2546
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:25,120
like

2547
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:29,199
what can we effectively say changes

2548
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:32,400
between this and this

2549
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,880
for a more specific

2550
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:37,360
um definitive time scale would that be

2551
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:39,120
one way that that you're talking about

2552
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:41,360
the methods influencing which types of

2553
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:43,280
models are relevant

2554
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:44,239
um

2555
01:34:44,239 --> 01:34:46,880
that would tie into that

2556
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:47,920
yes

2557
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:48,800
awesome

2558
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:51,119
point about um

2559
01:34:51,119 --> 01:34:52,719
sensor fusion

2560
01:34:52,719 --> 01:34:55,440
as well as the differences between fmri

2561
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:57,920
and m and eeg

2562
01:34:57,920 --> 01:34:59,760
so eeg

2563
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:02,239
is on the surface of the scalp although

2564
01:35:02,239 --> 01:35:03,199
you can also take electrical

2565
01:35:03,199 --> 01:35:04,960
measurements within the scalp

2566
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:07,040
it's on the surface and it has extremely

2567
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:09,760
fast temporal resolution like many many

2568
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:11,840
times per second

2569
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,920
and it's localized and it's measuring

2570
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:16,159
electromagnetic activity

2571
01:35:16,159 --> 01:35:17,360
fmri

2572
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:19,520
has a very different

2573
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:22,800
spatial and temporal resolution

2574
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,639
and it's measuring something different

2575
01:35:24,639 --> 01:35:27,040
which is the blood oxygenation dependent

2576
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:28,960
signal inside of the brain which is

2577
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:30,639
related to the hemodynamics and the

2578
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:33,440
metabolic activity of brain regions and

2579
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:35,280
the vasculature so they're measuring

2580
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:36,800
different things

2581
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:39,520
that's why it's so important that in

2582
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:41,360
active style

2583
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:42,800
models

2584
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:45,920
that we clarify what our observations

2585
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,440
are

2586
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:48,960
and what the hidden states are that

2587
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,880
we're doing inference on

2588
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:52,800
and so one of the ways that sensor

2589
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:54,840
fusion happens in

2590
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:56,800
spm

2591
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:57,760
is

2592
01:35:57,760 --> 01:35:58,719
so what's being described here is

2593
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:01,199
multimodal integration of the eeg and

2594
01:36:01,199 --> 01:36:03,119
the fmri

2595
01:36:03,119 --> 01:36:07,040
is there's a latent unobserved variable

2596
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:10,159
which is the neuronal activity and then

2597
01:36:10,159 --> 01:36:13,520
that neuronal activity at a given voxel

2598
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:15,440
is going to have an edge

2599
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:18,320
that outputs fmri measurements and then

2600
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:21,119
another edge that measures eeg

2601
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:22,480
outcomes

2602
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:23,760
and then

2603
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:25,840
what's happening with that unobserved

2604
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:27,119
variable

2605
01:36:27,119 --> 01:36:28,560
is being fit

2606
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:30,320
based upon

2607
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:32,159
the

2608
01:36:32,159 --> 01:36:35,440
jointly measured fmri and eeg

2609
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:37,040
so it's not just like you take a big

2610
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:38,639
time series and do descriptive

2611
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:40,159
statistics

2612
01:36:40,159 --> 01:36:44,239
but rather you use this hidden state

2613
01:36:44,239 --> 01:36:46,159
and that's what allows the generative

2614
01:36:46,159 --> 01:36:47,440
modeling

2615
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:49,920
of brain activity

2616
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,760
because you're fitting the hidden state

2617
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:53,760
which gives rise to observations which

2618
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:56,719
can be of totally different types

2619
01:36:56,719 --> 01:36:57,600
so

2620
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,360
it is an awesome

2621
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:01,840
thing to explore i hope we can continue

2622
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:04,159
to delve into this type of like

2623
01:37:04,159 --> 01:37:06,080
sensor fusion and what these bayesian

2624
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:08,800
graphical models actually enable dean

2625
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:10,639
and then stephen

2626
01:37:10,639 --> 01:37:12,239
i'm trying to i'm trying to see if i can

2627
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:14,239
come up with ways of being able to sort

2628
01:37:14,239 --> 01:37:16,320
of keep the effective connectivity and

2629
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:18,880
functional connectivity segregated

2630
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:20,880
before they're reintegrated

2631
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:24,560
i don't know whether if we were to

2632
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:26,000
we were to find ourselves out in the

2633
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,080
middle of the wilderness and come upon

2634
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:30,080
an ant hill and suddenly out of that ant

2635
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:32,320
hill poured a bunch of elephants the

2636
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:35,040
size of ants whether we would need to

2637
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:36,800
look at the mechanics of that or we

2638
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:37,920
would just be

2639
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:40,000
drawn into the idea that now there's

2640
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,360
these really

2641
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:43,360
what

2642
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:47,280
what was surprising and essentially

2643
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:49,119
ant ant-sized elephants or if we saw

2644
01:37:49,119 --> 01:37:51,920
elephants suddenly walking or ambling

2645
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:52,960
as though

2646
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:54,719
they're still the normal-sized elephants

2647
01:37:54,719 --> 01:37:56,639
but petting

2648
01:37:56,639 --> 01:37:58,960
as though they were ants so taking the

2649
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:02,159
tiniest of footsteps relative to their

2650
01:38:02,159 --> 01:38:04,639
overall scale i think that's where the

2651
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:08,719
effective connectivity and the influence

2652
01:38:08,719 --> 01:38:10,400
based on something some of it based on

2653
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:12,960
priors but essentially i want to keep

2654
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,719
the functional and the effective apart

2655
01:38:14,719 --> 01:38:17,679
not that they can't overlap or that our

2656
01:38:17,679 --> 01:38:19,520
minds aren't able to

2657
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:22,639
make those connections but i think each

2658
01:38:22,639 --> 01:38:24,400
serves a purpose

2659
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:26,560
so that when we come up against

2660
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:28,639
surprisal

2661
01:38:28,639 --> 01:38:29,679
we know

2662
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:32,159
kind of what went into that

2663
01:38:32,159 --> 01:38:35,360
that moment or that event

2664
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:37,600
i'm kind of seeing the size of the

2665
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:39,920
animal as the the year performance of

2666
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:42,320
the crypto and then the day-to-day

2667
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:44,400
is the effective connectivity with the

2668
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:46,719
footsteps so

2669
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:48,480
yeah the scale piece all i was trying

2670
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:50,320
the scale and relativity as opposed to

2671
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:52,480
the sequence

2672
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:54,000
interesting stephen and then there's a

2673
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,639
question in live chat

2674
01:38:56,639 --> 01:38:58,400
i'm going to ask a little question

2675
01:38:58,400 --> 01:38:59,520
with this

2676
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:02,400
again maybe rhetorical

2677
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:03,360
over

2678
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:06,960
the time scale of

2679
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:09,679
this effective connectivity

2680
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:10,800
um

2681
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:14,000
it can effectively be brain bound to

2682
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,760
some extent

2683
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:17,040
um

2684
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:19,760
when we have functional

2685
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:21,440
connectivity

2686
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:22,560
it's

2687
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:24,320
the the

2688
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:25,360
the

2689
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:26,400
the measure

2690
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:30,000
or the unit of analysis is implying

2691
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,159
something outside

2692
01:39:32,159 --> 01:39:34,639
as being connected to that

2693
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:36,480
or something that's a slightly more

2694
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:38,880
macro i.e the idea of the function

2695
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,560
that's being used

2696
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:42,800
to

2697
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:45,679
as a unit of analysis

2698
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:46,560
to

2699
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,679
then

2700
01:39:47,679 --> 01:39:48,880
um

2701
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:51,760
give a way to get purchase on

2702
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:54,639
temporal correlations would that

2703
01:39:54,639 --> 01:39:56,239
seem to be fair enough and would that

2704
01:39:56,239 --> 01:39:58,639
also possibly also then reflect the sort

2705
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:00,880
of journey that's happened in cognitive

2706
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:02,239
neuroscience

2707
01:40:02,239 --> 01:40:04,159
and computational neuroscience because

2708
01:40:04,159 --> 01:40:05,040
of

2709
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:07,119
christian's work

2710
01:40:07,119 --> 01:40:10,880
it started to that that even in itself

2711
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,480
brought in this

2712
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:14,639
process of well what does it mean to

2713
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:16,710
have function

2714
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:18,000
[Music]

2715
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,440
again we want to be

2716
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:22,320
precise about what function means here

2717
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:24,159
if the measurements are all brain

2718
01:40:24,159 --> 01:40:25,280
related

2719
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:27,679
then that's the nodes

2720
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:29,280
corresponding to the variables that

2721
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:31,600
edges are going to be calculated within

2722
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:33,360
if there are measurements that are

2723
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:34,719
outside of the brain

2724
01:40:34,719 --> 01:40:36,080
then you can have functional or

2725
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:38,000
effective connectivity amongst those

2726
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,239
variables but we're not actually talking

2727
01:40:40,239 --> 01:40:44,400
about function like mechanistic impact

2728
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:47,280
nor teleological impact in the niche

2729
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:48,880
which is like the function of the hammer

2730
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:50,320
is to nail things that's not what

2731
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:52,320
functional is meaning here and just to

2732
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:54,880
give an example of this is the um

2733
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:57,520
awesome recent work by

2734
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:00,159
guillaume dumas and collaborators

2735
01:41:00,159 --> 01:41:03,280
and so this is a toolkit that expands on

2736
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:04,560
this

2737
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:06,639
neuroimaging framework

2738
01:41:06,639 --> 01:41:08,080
and just says

2739
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:09,760
well we're just going to concatenate

2740
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:12,159
those matrices kind of reminds us of the

2741
01:41:12,159 --> 01:41:15,199
stochastic chaos paper 32 right like

2742
01:41:15,199 --> 01:41:17,040
when we went from having one coupled

2743
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:19,920
system to having the two coupled systems

2744
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:22,080
and then remember in the off diagonals

2745
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:23,600
we had the effect of the two different

2746
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:25,520
systems on each other

2747
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:27,679
the causal impact of the systems on each

2748
01:41:27,679 --> 01:41:28,639
other

2749
01:41:28,639 --> 01:41:30,560
the effective connectivity of those

2750
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:33,280
systems and so this is hyperscanning

2751
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:35,280
where you have two

2752
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:36,400
people

2753
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:38,639
or it could be a human and a computer

2754
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:40,560
whatever it is whatever the measurements

2755
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:42,880
you're making are the rows and columns

2756
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:44,560
on this matrix

2757
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:45,920
and then you have that matrix the

2758
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:47,679
measurements at each time slice going

2759
01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:50,080
through time it's a tensor and then you

2760
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:52,960
do time series statistics on that tensor

2761
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:55,520
and so these connections between the two

2762
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:56,800
brains

2763
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:58,800
are not anatomical

2764
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:00,560
people's brains are not actually wired

2765
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:01,920
up that way

2766
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:02,960
however

2767
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:04,960
you could calculate the functional

2768
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:06,239
connectivity

2769
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:07,920
which is not the function of one on the

2770
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:10,080
other it's the temporal correlation

2771
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:12,800
between the events and you could also

2772
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:14,719
calculate the effective connectivity

2773
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:17,360
which is what is the statistical impact

2774
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:19,920
of one variable on another through time

2775
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:21,760
whether or not that's the mechanistic

2776
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:22,719
link

2777
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:24,639
is a separate question

2778
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:27,520
and that is what was revealed with this

2779
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:28,400
example

2780
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:30,000
was even if you hyper scan those

2781
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,360
people's brains

2782
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:32,880
and you see i mean come on

2783
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,960
this brain region always leads this

2784
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:36,880
other brain region in the other person

2785
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:37,920
but that doesn't mean that's the

2786
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:40,480
mechanistic connector it just means that

2787
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:42,560
it's an effective connective edge

2788
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:44,080
and so this

2789
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:45,920
toolkit and this hyperscanning approach

2790
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:47,840
like really demonstrate

2791
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:49,520
that you can

2792
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:50,560
have functional and effective

2793
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:51,840
connectivity

2794
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:53,600
amongst any variables that are being

2795
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:56,080
measured in your experiment

2796
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:57,440
but that's not the same thing as a

2797
01:42:57,440 --> 01:43:00,560
mechanistic story about what's happening

2798
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:02,960
stephen

2799
01:43:03,679 --> 01:43:05,440
okay actually just one thing to clarify

2800
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:07,199
so is that bottom diagram saying that

2801
01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:08,880
there's both

2802
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:12,320
fmri and eec

2803
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:14,719
there's there's electrical and um blood

2804
01:43:14,719 --> 01:43:16,800
flow measurements happening and they've

2805
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:18,320
been integrated

2806
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:20,239
um this one

2807
01:43:20,239 --> 01:43:21,280
uh so

2808
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:22,960
in this paper

2809
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:25,040
that was the sensor fusion that was the

2810
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:27,600
integration of multiple neuro imaging

2811
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:31,520
modalities fmri and eeg yeah yeah here

2812
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:34,159
you could do sensor fusion hyper

2813
01:43:34,159 --> 01:43:35,280
scanning

2814
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:37,840
or you could just have eeg on each

2815
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:39,520
person or you could have eeg on one

2816
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:41,679
person and fmri on the other you'd have

2817
01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:43,600
to qualify what it is that you were

2818
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:45,840
actually measuring but this is a general

2819
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:47,440
framework for

2820
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:49,760
multi-agents

2821
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:51,199
neuroimaging

2822
01:43:51,199 --> 01:43:54,080
statistics okay perfect so then the

2823
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:55,600
point i was thinking that sort of

2824
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:57,600
relates is

2825
01:43:57,600 --> 01:43:58,960
is you're i think it's this really

2826
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:01,760
useful point that you say about how

2827
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:03,520
it's not functional in some sort of

2828
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:07,040
teleological sense however

2829
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:11,040
sort of hidden in the in the linguistic

2830
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:14,000
uh couching that's going on here for it

2831
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,159
to be viable okay

2832
01:44:16,159 --> 01:44:17,679
not necessarily for it to be

2833
01:44:17,679 --> 01:44:20,320
experimentally how it's done is

2834
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:22,159
implicitly

2835
01:44:22,159 --> 01:44:24,719
the effective connectivity

2836
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:26,239
seems to be

2837
01:44:26,239 --> 01:44:27,760
couched on

2838
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:29,040
or

2839
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:31,199
there to be something meaningful

2840
01:44:31,199 --> 01:44:32,239
happening

2841
01:44:32,239 --> 01:44:36,239
or some some sort of process happening

2842
01:44:36,239 --> 01:44:39,199
effectively

2843
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:40,239
a

2844
01:44:40,239 --> 01:44:42,800
one neuron has to exert something or

2845
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:45,119
potentially have some

2846
01:44:45,119 --> 01:44:47,440
direct effect okay so there's

2847
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:49,760
it's it's like a contingency

2848
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:51,119
that's um

2849
01:44:51,119 --> 01:44:52,880
is present

2850
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:54,080
functionally

2851
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:56,560
it's like okay within

2852
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:58,960
whatever functions going on but we don't

2853
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:00,960
necessarily know what that is but within

2854
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:04,320
some sort of process

2855
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:06,800
there is something

2856
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:11,040
happening that we can infer

2857
01:45:11,119 --> 01:45:14,000
is useful it's coming into play we're

2858
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,679
not saying because we know they're

2859
01:45:15,679 --> 01:45:16,719
spatially

2860
01:45:16,719 --> 01:45:20,159
separated we can't say for sure then

2861
01:45:20,159 --> 01:45:21,760
um

2862
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:24,800
or they're they're temporarily

2863
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:26,719
hard too fuzzy

2864
01:45:26,719 --> 01:45:29,600
we can't necessarily say they have to be

2865
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:32,159
connecting but functionally

2866
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:34,960
we're getting a feel for

2867
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:36,400
um

2868
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:38,320
that this dynamic

2869
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:40,719
is present rather than

2870
01:45:40,719 --> 01:45:41,600
this

2871
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:45,360
almost more signal based approach

2872
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:48,000
if there was more effective and i think

2873
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,320
that that is

2874
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:52,159
philosophically

2875
01:45:52,159 --> 01:45:55,759
couched in those two words

2876
01:45:57,360 --> 01:46:00,000
yes i totally hear you

2877
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,320
um

2878
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:05,360
the mathematical and the statistical

2879
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:07,040
definitions are the ones that are being

2880
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:09,040
calculated so

2881
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:11,360
trying to read a lot into the english

2882
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:12,560
word

2883
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:15,440
and then apply that reading in to the

2884
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:17,679
calculation is where we get a little

2885
01:46:17,679 --> 01:46:18,800
lost

2886
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:20,960
because again the effect of connectivity

2887
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:22,080
it doesn't mean that there's a

2888
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,840
mechanistic relationship

2889
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:25,679
you could have spatially remote neurons

2890
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:28,239
that have an effective connectivity edge

2891
01:46:28,239 --> 01:46:29,920
like the example we discussed earlier

2892
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:32,159
where there's a causal neuron and then

2893
01:46:32,159 --> 01:46:34,080
there's a it takes one time step to get

2894
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:36,080
to this one and two to get the other

2895
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:37,760
so then those two

2896
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:39,760
recipient neurons are going to have an

2897
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:42,400
effective connectivity edge

2898
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:44,320
it's a hypothesis whether there's a

2899
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:46,480
mechanistic edge but that's something

2900
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:47,920
that you can explore

2901
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:49,040
with science

2902
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:51,600
is you can actually look at whether

2903
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:53,520
then you test well what happens if i

2904
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:55,760
silence this one you go wow the firing

2905
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:57,199
pattern didn't change

2906
01:46:57,199 --> 01:47:00,080
so i falsified or reduced the posterior

2907
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:03,199
likelihood of a mechanistic story that

2908
01:47:03,199 --> 01:47:06,159
involved a mechanistic edge it doesn't

2909
01:47:06,159 --> 01:47:08,080
invalidate the measurement of an

2910
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:09,760
effective connectivity

2911
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:11,199
it just means that you have to look

2912
01:47:11,199 --> 01:47:13,040
elsewhere for your mechanistic story you

2913
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:15,040
know you shut down bob's phone

2914
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:16,639
and there still is this effective

2915
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:18,800
connection between the brushing the

2916
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:21,360
teeth and the reading well now

2917
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:23,199
you look back in the system iterated

2918
01:47:23,199 --> 01:47:24,800
scientific modeling

2919
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,239
so i just want to ask this question from

2920
01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:28,159
the chat this will be our last

2921
01:47:28,159 --> 01:47:30,400
question and while final thoughts but

2922
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:32,400
very fun and interesting and i hope next

2923
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:33,920
week majid will join and that will be

2924
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:36,960
great to hear his perspective as well so

2925
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:39,920
joseph clark in the chat asked

2926
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:42,639
how do you utilize functional and

2927
01:47:42,639 --> 01:47:44,400
effective connectivity in active

2928
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:47,040
inference analysis to better inform an

2929
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:49,520
answer to a question such as why i

2930
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:50,880
scored the goal

2931
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:55,560
i.e how does it enrich an analysis

2932
01:48:11,679 --> 01:48:13,520
so dean

2933
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:15,520
yes something

2934
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:17,600
i would need time to think about that

2935
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:19,600
question so maybe that's

2936
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:21,440
something i can think about and point to

2937
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:22,800
because

2938
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:24,400
right now

2939
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:26,560
i'm trying to figure out if a gene is

2940
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:28,800
both a cause and an effect

2941
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:30,400
how is that then going to be

2942
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:32,880
encapsulated and partitioned

2943
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:36,239
because basically blue blew up my day

2944
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:37,760
and now i'm going to need to go away and

2945
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:39,360
rest for a little while and think about

2946
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:40,960
this because if it's

2947
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:42,560
if it's both

2948
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:45,119
is there information just encapsulated

2949
01:48:45,119 --> 01:48:46,480
is that information partially

2950
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:48,480
encapsulated because now it's a whole

2951
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:50,000
bunch of genes that are

2952
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,239
dealing with their betweenness

2953
01:48:52,239 --> 01:48:54,400
and all of that good stuff but again

2954
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,800
again my final thought on this paper is

2955
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:58,480
is that i think

2956
01:48:58,480 --> 01:49:00,480
whether we keep it on the

2957
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:03,360
abstract level of something or partial

2958
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:05,280
or whether we pull it down as he does in

2959
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:07,360
the paper to the actual

2960
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:10,320
moment of we're looking at something now

2961
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:11,760
in particular

2962
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:12,880
um

2963
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:15,119
now i've got to sort of go and take that

2964
01:49:15,119 --> 01:49:18,719
off to the level of jeans and

2965
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:20,320
see whether or not that

2966
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:24,000
changes exactly it flipped my my duck

2967
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,159
rabbit on a

2968
01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:28,159
i'm rolling downhill here i need to take

2969
01:49:28,159 --> 01:49:29,760
a break

2970
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:30,639
um

2971
01:49:30,639 --> 01:49:33,679
i i agree i think this is an excellent

2972
01:49:33,679 --> 01:49:35,760
question because effective and

2973
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:37,920
functional connectivity you'll find

2974
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:39,920
like tens of thousands of citations in

2975
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:41,440
the neurosciences

2976
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:44,080
and you'll find people talking about the

2977
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:47,040
applications and translational value of

2978
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:48,400
neuroimaging

2979
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:49,920
towards real life settings i'm sure

2980
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:52,400
there's even neuroscience of

2981
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:54,239
football or of soccer

2982
01:49:54,239 --> 01:49:56,639
so how do we actually connect all those

2983
01:49:56,639 --> 01:49:57,840
dots

2984
01:49:57,840 --> 01:49:59,920
and describe how

2985
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:01,840
specifically within an active inference

2986
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:03,360
framework

2987
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:04,719
how do we think about these different

2988
01:50:04,719 --> 01:50:07,040
kinds of modularity

2989
01:50:07,040 --> 01:50:09,119
functional the effective the anatomical

2990
01:50:09,119 --> 01:50:11,040
the informational

2991
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:13,119
how is that related to markov blankets

2992
01:50:13,119 --> 01:50:15,840
what's unique about the framing in

2993
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:18,400
active inference compared to

2994
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:20,239
the neural imaging that has existed for

2995
01:50:20,239 --> 01:50:22,239
40 years now much of it was also

2996
01:50:22,239 --> 01:50:24,639
developed by fristen but

2997
01:50:24,639 --> 01:50:26,800
still there's more to it so i think

2998
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:28,480
these are great things so one thing that

2999
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:31,199
we know we'll discuss is that question

3000
01:50:31,199 --> 01:50:32,800
how do we deploy

3001
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:35,119
functional and effective connectivity so

3002
01:50:35,119 --> 01:50:38,000
that we can get better answers

3003
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
we also want to talk about

3004
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,480
modularity intransitivity and

3005
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:44,080
preferences

3006
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:45,840
and let's um

3007
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:47,760
stephen and then any other last thoughts

3008
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:50,320
what are you excited to discuss next

3009
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:52,320
week

3010
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:54,320
yeah i think this is a good question to

3011
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:57,440
end and also start the next one um

3012
01:50:57,440 --> 01:51:00,320
i suppose one thing this idea of

3013
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:03,520
that this is useful is how

3014
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:07,119
ideas of how certain types of effective

3015
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:08,800
connectivity

3016
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:10,960
was important

3017
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:12,800
for scoring a goal

3018
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:15,040
like what

3019
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:16,719
was tethered to what

3020
01:51:16,719 --> 01:51:18,840
in terms of the

3021
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:21,679
connectivity and where are we talking

3022
01:51:21,679 --> 01:51:23,679
about something where

3023
01:51:23,679 --> 01:51:26,880
what's the dynamical system

3024
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:30,080
the generative type of system

3025
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:31,199
where that

3026
01:51:31,199 --> 01:51:33,119
involves making it happen

3027
01:51:33,119 --> 01:51:36,400
i get a sense that

3028
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:37,199
the

3029
01:51:37,199 --> 01:51:39,199
functional approach

3030
01:51:39,199 --> 01:51:41,360
is more

3031
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:43,760
connected to dynamical systems

3032
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:45,280
thinking

3033
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:46,320
and

3034
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:48,560
in comparison to the effective approach

3035
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:51,280
which might be more related to how

3036
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:52,719
things are

3037
01:51:52,719 --> 01:51:54,960
potentially wired up and what's first

3038
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:57,280
order second order third order

3039
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:58,480
effects

3040
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:00,000
so but

3041
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,199
i don't know that other people see the

3042
01:52:01,199 --> 01:52:02,400
same but

3043
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:04,000
it's helping me this is really useful

3044
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,679
for me starting to think okay i see

3045
01:52:05,679 --> 01:52:06,639
where

3046
01:52:06,639 --> 01:52:09,199
briston was sort of coming in with this

3047
01:52:09,199 --> 01:52:11,679
question of how to address

3048
01:52:11,679 --> 01:52:12,800
um

3049
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:14,400
these hidden states these hidden

3050
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:15,520
dynamics

3051
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:19,199
these hidden causes and how

3052
01:52:19,199 --> 01:52:22,880
by coming in it through this

3053
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:24,719
functional

3054
01:52:24,719 --> 01:52:26,080
dynamical

3055
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:28,719
inference approach

3056
01:52:28,719 --> 01:52:29,760
it

3057
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:31,760
you could say it changes everything in

3058
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:34,400
some ways so it certainly means that you

3059
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:36,960
have to have more than one

3060
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:39,599
um way to understand the hidden states

3061
01:52:39,599 --> 01:52:42,320
which is also like how the footballers

3062
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:44,719
also got more than one way of trying to

3063
01:52:44,719 --> 01:52:46,800
understand what it even means to score

3064
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:48,639
the appropriate sections being mixed

3065
01:52:48,639 --> 01:52:50,480
with visual being mixed with auditory

3066
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:51,840
being mixed with

3067
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:53,599
uh tactile

3068
01:52:53,599 --> 01:52:56,480
all these things are

3069
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:58,480
some things do need to effectively

3070
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:01,040
happen certain muscles need to happen in

3071
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:03,119
a certain order if certain coordinated

3072
01:53:03,119 --> 01:53:06,320
action has to effectively happen for it

3073
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:08,480
to even be possible but there might be

3074
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:11,440
multiple dynamical functional ways that

3075
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:12,560
i could

3076
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:15,599
also bring

3077
01:53:16,239 --> 01:53:18,880
purchase and have different ways to get

3078
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:20,320
to the same result

3079
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:21,360
so

3080
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:23,040
and again it's not

3081
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:24,800
it becomes relevant

3082
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:26,400
when you're trying to do the type of

3083
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:28,239
measurements that are being designed for

3084
01:53:28,239 --> 01:53:29,920
a particular reason

3085
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:31,520
so that you can get bet you're not going

3086
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:33,360
to try and get at

3087
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:34,159
the

3088
01:53:34,159 --> 01:53:36,800
short temporal

3089
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:40,159
inferences through using fmri

3090
01:53:40,159 --> 01:53:43,679
and vice versa so i think that that's uh

3091
01:53:43,679 --> 01:53:46,800
something that's quite useful

3092
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:48,320
great

3093
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:49,280
my

3094
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:51,280
closing thought will be

3095
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:52,480
studying

3096
01:53:52,480 --> 01:53:55,760
the footballer is our football

3097
01:53:55,760 --> 01:53:58,080
as researchers of football

3098
01:53:58,080 --> 01:54:00,400
yeah

3099
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:02,400
thanks dave

fun to participate today and thanks a

3103
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:10,639
lot majeed for writing this

3104
01:54:10,639 --> 01:54:13,760
provocative paper and getting our 22

3105
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:15,920
off on a good foot
