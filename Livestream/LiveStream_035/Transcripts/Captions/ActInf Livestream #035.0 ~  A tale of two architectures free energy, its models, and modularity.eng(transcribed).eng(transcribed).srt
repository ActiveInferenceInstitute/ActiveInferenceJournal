come get involved with actonflab

29
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,399
today in active livestream number 35.0

30
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,320
we are going to be learning and

31
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,040
discussing this paper a tale of two

32
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,880
architectures

33
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,680
free energy its models and modularity by

34
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,560
majeed benny in december 2021

35
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,960
but kind of published in 22

36
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,040
and just like all the other dot zeros

37
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,439
the video we're about to do is just an

38
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,079
introduction and a discussion it's not a

39
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,119
review or a final word and in fact we're

40
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,878
very much looking forward to the two

41
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,319
upcoming weeks when majeed may join us

42
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,400
and hopefully many of you will join us

43
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,480
and we're just gonna have a good time

44
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,239
talk about the paper what did we learn

45
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,640
from it and what are the implications

46
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,120
today we're going to be more focused on

47
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,840
the aims and claims the abstract the

48
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,480
roadmap the background the keywords and

49
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,239
there aren't any figures or formalisms

50
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,680
but we'll go through some of the key

51
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,280
arguments which are very

52
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,840
provocative and very salient

53
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,000
so if you want to get involved just get

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,760
in touch and we will

55
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,680
let you know how to participate

56
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,599
let's begin with a little bit of an

57
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,160
introduction and a warm-up so feel free

58
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,400
to say hello and maybe just one thing

59
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,480
that made you excited to discuss this

60
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,680
paper so i'm daniel i'm a researcher in

61
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,040
california and i was excited to

62
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,920
read philosophical work by benny who

63
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,560
always writes very interesting things

64
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,800
and just understand how

65
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,280
architectures of physical systems and

66
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,879
their functional descriptions are

67
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,879
related to the fep

68
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,120
dean

69
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,560
thanks danny i'm dean i'm here in

70
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,480
calgary it's uh

71
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,400
really really cold and snowy

72
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,239
but that's not why we're here

73
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,640
my real question was so what do we do

74
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,440
about this seeming

75
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,680
failure or attraction to the ability to

76
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,080
categorize and so the question is do we

77
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,599
model up

78
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,799
and yeah so reading the paper i

79
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,879
i kind of tried to figure out the answer

80
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,640
to that i'll pass it down to blue

81
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,560
so i like this paper from the

82
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,879
perspective of like multi-scale

83
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,959
dimensionality um

84
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,840
and also modularity like modules at

85
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,080
different dimensions um the scale-free

86
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,159
aspect of the markov blanket and or the

87
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,599
not scale-free aspect of the markov

88
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,000
blanket and anyway i thought it was just

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
really neat and a cool um

90
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,360
way to fit the pieces together

91
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,120
excellent so

92
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,959
we have

93
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,599
some slide with things that we want to

94
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,080
discuss in the dot one and the dot two

95
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,639
and beyond so at any point feel free to

96
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,120
add information there and we'll be

97
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,720
writing things there so we're not gonna

98
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,400
get to it all we're not gonna make this

99
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,040
a 11 hour video we'll get things down to

100
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,479
discuss in 35.1 and 2.

101
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,880
but we can lead in with

102
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,759
the big question a big question

103
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,479
which is how do we think about

104
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,199
modularity of different kinds like

105
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,759
functional effective and anatomical

106
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,840
which we'll be discussing later

107
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,919
in active inference and free energy

108
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,199
principle

109
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,520
and why does that matter why does it

110
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,000
matter how we think about modularity of

111
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,160
different kinds what does it mean

112
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,800
on this slide are some images related to

113
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,280
just different uses of modularity

114
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,080
just

115
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,479
modules like lego bricks

116
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,880
other times modularity can refer to like

117
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,120
part of a network that's more densely

118
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,199
connected like a click

119
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,840
other times modularity doesn't refer to

120
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,720
hot swap ability but rather to

121
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,960
a larger structure that's composed of

122
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,800
smaller modules

123
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,960
whether they're the same or different

124
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,800
it's often applied to mathematical

125
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,720
systems or biological systems so there's

126
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,240
so many

127
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,560
aspects of modularity and today we're

128
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,320
going to be exploring

129
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,320
what are those aspects of modularity and

130
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,680
why does it matter for the free energy

131
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,639
principle

132
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,560
blue or dean like any thoughts on the

133
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,600
general

134
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,880
modularity question

135
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,400
i got i got a quick question so

136
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,360
for me

137
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,360
when we see these sort of images that we

138
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,199
externalized and artifacts and that sort

139
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,720
of thing

140
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,320
when i got it started getting to the

141
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,800
paper uh the real problem for the

142
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,120
modularity argument is

143
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,800
what does localized mean when we're

144
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,440
talking about

145
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,000
fmri

146
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,880
representations as the tool does a bump

147
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,720
in electrochemical impulse mean a

148
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,600
clearly defined border

149
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,039
i don't think so

150
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,560
of course not

151
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,120
where one bump ends and another begins

152
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,800
all inside the same energy field might

153
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,720
be captured through my fmri imaging and

154
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,240
is that misleading because there's no

155
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,720
moment of stasis because the magnets

156
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,240
inside our heads

157
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,639
keep wearing constantly so that was

158
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,319
again another question

159
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,440
that i

160
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,520
sort of tried to carry on through as i

161
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,160
was reading what the author wrote out

162
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,039
yeah

163
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,840
where are we talking about modules

164
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,240
where are we modularizing

165
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,400
and does that map onto potentially

166
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,880
realism and instrumentalism

167
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,759
any

168
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,080
big setting ideas blue or we can

169
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,479
continue to aims all right

170
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,479
so the paper that we're discussing is by

171
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,039
majeed benny a tale of two architectures

172
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,000
free energy its models and modularity

173
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,960
and it's in the paper consciousness and

174
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,599
consciousness and cognition

175
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,319
just to go through some of the key aims

176
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,319
and claims and then feel free to add a

177
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,800
comment so the paper presents a model

178
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,599
model-based defense of the partial

179
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,680
functional informational segregation of

180
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,479
cognition in the context of predictive

181
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,919
architecture

182
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,599
more specifically to defend the

183
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,319
modularity thesis the paper computes two

184
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,560
counter arguments that lie at the center

185
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,440
of hippolyto and kirchoff's 2019 recent

186
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,319
confitation of the modularity thesis to

187
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,280
confuse is like to refute

188
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,120
the main insight of the paper is that

189
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,360
hippolyto kirchoff's counter arguments

190
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,879
miss the mark because they dismiss a few

191
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,120
rudimentary facts about the model based

192
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,520
nature of dynamical causal models and

193
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,479
markov blankets

194
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,479
so that's why we kind of led in with a

195
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,400
big question about modularity why does

196
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,479
it matter because we're kind of down the

197
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,199
road a little bit like okay modularity

198
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,879
matters it matters how we think about

199
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,080
and analyze and design modular systems

200
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,520
and then

201
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,520
how does it apply to fep

202
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,160
and hipolito and kirchoff make a

203
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,240
computation of the modularity thesis

204
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,160
which we can look at soon

205
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,599
and then benny is firing back

206
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,919
with this current paper so that situates

207
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,000
us like in the biggest scope of thinking

208
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,560
about modularity

209
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,880
h k 2019 and here we are with mdb 2021.

210
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,279
so can i add to that daniel

211
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,640
yeah so

212
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,200
he does we didn't put encapsulation in

213
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,360
here but i know we're gonna talk about

214
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,800
that a bit

215
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,880
but in order to be able to make sure

216
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,800
that we don't mix things up we have to

217
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,839
understand that encapsulation is a

218
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,240
separation of what matters or what we

219
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,920
consider to be a signal from the noise

220
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,160
and i always think back to nate silver

221
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,320
when i try to compare those two things

222
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,320
so it's a momentary on offer it's a

223
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,399
momentary in out not that there's a

224
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,480
walled off section per se

225
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,480
in the brain like we can diagram out or

226
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,600
represent

227
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,720
as a as an artifact

228
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,279
fmri images however might coerce us into

229
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,040
thinking that that's what's happening

230
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,480
that there's actually a walled off

231
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,600
section

232
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,440
when that isn't actually the case to

233
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,920
avoid the cognitive overload

234
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,320
there are break stop mechanisms in our

235
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,720
mind we don't have to tell our pancreas

236
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,800
or basic ganglia what to do

237
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,720
which then assists us in our ability to

238
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,640
take the external states

239
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,480
like these slides in

240
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,320
and i think that's what benny was trying

241
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,080
to point to although

242
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,519
he didn't probably go into that

243
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,440
explanation the way that i just did but

244
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,160
i'm

245
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,160
i'm kind of in defense of this author so

246
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,080
i'm i'm starting off right now i'm in

247
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,959
his corner i'm ready to tag up and climb

248
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,359
in the ring

249
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,920
so just to kind of piggyback onto that

250
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,519
like when you're talking about

251
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,440
encapsulating

252
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,360
it's really talking about drawing a

253
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,839
boundary around something and like isn't

254
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,320
the markov blanket like isn't that the

255
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,000
ability to draw a boundary around

256
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
something right so so i don't know like

257
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,560
this encapsulating markov blanketing

258
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,320
boundary drawing like all of those are

259
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,079
conflated in my mind and i don't know if

260
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,519
there's like a separate way to tease

261
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,760
them all apart or if or if i have

262
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,959
cracked correctly grouped them

263
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,000
great

264
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,200
onwards

265
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,800
so

266
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,360
i'll read the first two and then

267
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,440
blue for the second two

268
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,839
the paper presents a model based defense

269
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,600
of the partial functional informational

270
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,680
segregation of cognition in the context

271
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,680
of the predictive architecture

272
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,680
the paper argues that the model

273
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,160
relativeness of modularity does not need

274
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,320
to undermine its tenability

275
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,040
in fact it holds that using models

276
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,440
is indispensable to scientific practice

277
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,360
and it builds its argument about the

278
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,519
indispensability of modularity to

279
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,959
predictive architecture on the

280
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,480
indispensability of scientific models

281
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,399
more specifically to defend the

282
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,600
modularity thesis the paper confused two

283
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,440
counter-arguments that lie at the center

284
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,640
of hippolyto and kirchoff's 2019 recent

285
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,279
confitation of the modularity thesis the

286
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,800
main insight of the paper is that

287
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,560
hippolito and kirchoff's counter

288
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,560
arguments miss the mark because they

289
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,640
dismiss a few rudimentary facts about

290
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,880
the model-based nature of dynamical

291
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,480
causal models and markov blankets

292
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,360
great so

293
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,240
nice

294
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,760
philosophy abstract

295
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,959
here is the roadmap where we are going

296
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,720
and so this has a fun

297
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,519
roadmap there are nine

298
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,279
sections

299
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,360
there's the introduction and then there

300
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,000
are eight sections with uh or dare i say

301
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,680
eight modules

302
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,959
that have kind of interesting names

303
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,160
that we'll be

304
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,839
looking into

305
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,959
and there are not any figures or

306
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,399
formalisms

307
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,760
but the sections are here maybe dean

308
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,600
will rejoin

309
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,279
and uh

310
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,360
welcome back dean

311
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,600
um

312
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,519
i need an ethernet cable

313
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,160
from my heart to yours

314
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,120
um

315
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,720
the keywords

316
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,040
are free energy principle model based

317
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,040
science modularity and then there's dag

318
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,120
directed acyclic graphs

319
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,800
and then dcm

320
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,600
which is going to have two different

321
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,959
unpackings as directed cyclic models

322
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,680
and as dynamical causal models

323
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,120
and we're going to go through these

324
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,079
keywords kind of as they appear in the

325
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,880
paper we're not going to have a separate

326
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,920
section

327
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,639
so let's go right into the introduction

328
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,399
section of the paper

329
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,200
where

330
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,240
we find somewhat of an epistemic

331
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,760
preamble

332
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,279
so not to read the whole thing but benny

333
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,680
belongs to the clan of philosophers with

334
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,120
karnap and kun

335
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,320
who can see that the choice of

336
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,079
theoretical frameworks is not completely

337
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,200
arbitrary

338
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,440
because some pragmatics

339
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,000
affect the choice of theories so okay we

340
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,560
have dispensed with the naive

341
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,279
postmodernist perspective

342
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,920
and more generally benny identifies

343
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,160
as a naturalized metaphysician in the

344
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,040
sense of ladyman and ross

345
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,440
in that metaphysics is worthwhile when

346
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,360
it is informed by our best scientific

347
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,040
theories of the field

348
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,519
so it's kind of just like a classy

349
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,880
co-informing process between

350
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,279
science and metaphysics

351
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,240
and

352
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,199
it is drawing on this work by ladyman

353
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,399
and ross

354
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,360
every thing must go

355
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,279
metaphysics naturalized

356
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,199
and then just like look at the chapter

357
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,120
titles because it's not a

358
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,320
book that i was very familiar with

359
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,720
they're defending science

360
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,440
they're defending a scientific realism

361
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,600
and a structuralism so maybe we're not

362
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,880
going to be in touch with the ultimate

363
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,040
reality but at least we can be in touch

364
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,480
with something that's constructively

365
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,199
empirical and scientifically real

366
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,120
they talk about the unity of science

367
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,760
consilience like eo wilson

368
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,639
and about causation in a world that's

369
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,120
structural but also complex

370
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,399
and so

371
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,600
that's sort of

372
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,120
the preamble

373
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,480
where benny characterizes his own stance

374
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,399
and kind of gives this background that

375
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,560
is quite personal in some ways but then

376
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,279
will lead into our understanding about

377
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,120
the paper and the contributions so

378
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,480
anything to add on that

379
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,760
all i would

380
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,920
try to quantify here is that he's not

381
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,320
starting from a position of did you see

382
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,160
that he's basically starting from a

383
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,800
position of did you see what i see

384
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,399
he holds that as being valuable

385
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,720
great

386
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,959
that takes us to model based science so

387
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,959
as we saw in the chapters

388
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,399
uh of

389
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,399
ladyman and ross

390
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,800
scientists use models

391
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,519
it's kind of like saying we use maps on

392
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,279
territories

393
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,320
and

394
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,120
there's so many kinds of models

395
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,120
a few that we've seen

396
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,800
are for example a graphical

397
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,720
visualization

398
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,440
of a bayesian statistical model and one

399
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,600
example of that is like this partially

400
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,839
observable markov decision process that

401
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,079
we often look at

402
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,880
and what do models do well that's quite

403
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,720
a big topic but they represent

404
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,160
hypotheses

405
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,720
as well as useful models of conceptual

406
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,440
or empirical systems and so there's many

407
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,519
many kinds of models

408
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,160
and some of them can be reflected

409
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,519
graphically

410
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,440
and in that

411
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,160
sentence graphical is referring to

412
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,800
visual like a computer graphic but also

413
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,920
graphical like a graphical network

414
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,920
and so we're going to be talking about

415
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,120
the visual aspects of graphs

416
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,680
but this isn't in a study in aesthetics

417
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,040
this is going to be talking about the

418
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,120
topology of graphs in their network

419
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,519
sense but model-based science is just

420
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,199
the kind of

421
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,199
pragmatic perspective that scientists

422
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,880
use models implicitly and explicitly and

423
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,240
there are certain things that we can say

424
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,959
about those models

425
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,440
anything that either of you would add on

426
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,920
model-based science

427
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,240
i'd want to know who who disagrees who

428
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,480
doesn't think that scientists are using

429
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,360
models like is this just a total

430
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,519
uh

431
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,079
meaningless claim or are are there

432
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,639
controversies related to this

433
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,440
okay so let's look at a few different

434
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,519
types of models

435
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,680
specifically these graphical

436
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,199
models that can be represented by

437
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,720
networks

438
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,399
so one kind of special graphical model

439
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,520
is called a directed acyclic graph or a

440
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,720
dag

441
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,679
and so

442
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,720
dags as their name would have it do not

443
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,240
have cycles amongst variables so nodes

444
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,720
are variables and edges are directed

445
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,319
influences and there are no cycles in

446
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,359
dags

447
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,839
and so it turns out that computing

448
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,959
dags

449
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,119
it's relatively efficient

450
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,520
and it has known algorithms

451
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,360
so here is a

452
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,200
image of a dag that i

453
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,559
got from a 2012 paper in ecology and so

454
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,240
the parameters are defined here and you

455
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,600
can look for more details but just

456
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,720
visually

457
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,240
these are different

458
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,960
modules of the model there's like this

459
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,039
underlying process model there's the

460
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,799
individual covariate model there's an

461
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,799
observation model whatever those things

462
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:53,520
are

463
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,400
but

464
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,720
one can imagine that you can like start

465
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,520
at the parts that don't have any parents

466
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,679
and then kind of

467
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,440
drip coffee your way to n and y which

468
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,360
are like the ultimate grandchildren

469
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,320
nodes

470
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,039
and then n and y don't feedback to

471
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,039
change the other

472
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,480
upstream parameters so dags

473
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,360
are

474
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,480
not

475
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,000
um all of this exact shape or type but

476
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,919
what makes them in a category is that

477
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,880
they don't have cycles in the way that

478
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,840
the variables are influencing each other

479
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,600
that makes them easy to compute and

480
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,639
relatively straightforward

481
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,360
we can contrast that

482
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,960
with directed cyclic models so we're

483
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,960
still talking about graphical models

484
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,240
here

485
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,120
directed cyclic models or dcm

486
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,039
have causal loops in the graphical

487
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,240
models

488
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,360
and so

489
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,799
this can make certain kinds of

490
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,440
computation more difficult i'm sure

491
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,360
people can think about different ways

492
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,159
that that might happen

493
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,480
the direction of the edges determines

494
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,240
the influence of one random variable on

495
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,440
another

496
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,160
so

497
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,880
if it doesn't have cycles it's a dag

498
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,039
and inference on those dags may be

499
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,600
performed exactly using algorithms such

500
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,240
as belief propagation or variable

501
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,840
elimination

502
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,679
like you can kind of collapse a subtree

503
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,480
into

504
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,200
a simpler system but with cycles it's a

505
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,120
little bit more complex

506
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,320
so

507
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,400
that's the difference between the dag

508
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,480
and the dcm directed cyclic model but

509
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,000
then there's going to be another dcm

510
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
coming up later

511
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,880
any comments there

512
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,080
do you think that the

513
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,760
the looping

514
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,160
can can be gets kind of a spiraling kind

515
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,960
of a

516
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,440
an accumulation effect that the dag

517
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,320
model

518
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,240
which with its narrowing and narrowing

519
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,200
and and sort of elimination

520
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,679
focus

521
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,520
benny talks about the fact that they

522
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
they're actually complementary but

523
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,799
do do you actually think they're

524
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,440
complementary as well

525
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,440
i think that they

526
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,919
exhaustively describe the landscape of

527
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,840
graphical models because either it has a

528
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,520
cycle or it doesn't but it's quite

529
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,280
literally the difference between like

530
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,679
dropping a coin in a little

531
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,159
machine that just dribbles down and then

532
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,400
playing pinball where you could have all

533
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,600
kinds of

534
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,760
feedback so i think they're mutually

535
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,360
exhaustive

536
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,480
but that may be sort of a deflationary

537
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,600
stance because they're defined as

538
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,559
contrary to each other

539
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,360
um we're not gonna go too into detail

540
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,159
here

541
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,840
but sometimes

542
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,280
um

543
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,320
you want to use a model that is

544
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,679
acyclic even for a cyclic system for

545
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,840
example within one time step it might be

546
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,880
a heuristic approximation to make it a

547
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,120
um

548
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,320
[Music]

549
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,799
dag model directed acyclic model rather

550
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,640
than a cyclic model so we're talking

551
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,559
about our statistical models here not

552
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,559
the topology of how things are connected

553
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,559
in the real world but

554
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,360
i just thought it was very interesting

555
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,260
to um

556
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,440
[Music]

557
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,000
talk about bayesian networks

558
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,360
and uh

559
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,520
often bayesian networks are framed as

560
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,520
only dags so the standard definition

561
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,280
according to these authors the standard

562
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,720
definition of bayesian networks is

563
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,799
usually one directional acyclic directed

564
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,320
graphs

565
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,720
in higher dimension systems

566
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,480
further probabilistic relations can be

567
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,799
recovered from network cyclic properties

568
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,320
and the joint probability of all

569
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,440
variables and this paper shows like for

570
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,480
a two

571
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,440
system

572
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,360
where there's a just a kind of back and

573
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,120
forth between these two x and y

574
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,280
variables here's x y and z in a

575
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,480
three-way loop

576
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,559
and then here's a four-way loop and then

577
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,400
they also look at n order loops so it

578
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,600
can generalize so

579
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,280
what was once only imagined is now

580
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,159
proved

581
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,919
in other words let's not

582
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,320
get too confident about like what can or

583
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,600
can't be done

584
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,760
with one type of model family or the

585
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,400
other because it's just one clever paper

586
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,679
away for their to be an approximation or

587
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,960
to be an exact solution

588
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,200
now we turn to

589
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,240
the other

590
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,400
sense of dcm

591
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,320
and this is dynamical causal models and

592
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,720
so these dcm

593
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,840
can

594
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,360
have graphical structure that also is

595
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,080
directed acyclic graph but

596
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,159
it's a different usage of the term

597
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,400
and so dcm

598
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,960
here we could point to many resources

599
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,600
like fristen at all the 2007s

600
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,440
statistical parametric mapping textbook

601
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,880
or a later paper of fristen at all on

602
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,360
network discovery with dcm

603
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,520
and so i thought that 2011 paper was a

604
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,679
little bit more relevant because it's

605
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:54,480
about

606
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,799
specifically inferring or discovering

607
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,240
the functional architecture of

608
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,880
distributed systems using dynamic causal

609
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,400
modeling

610
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,480
what does this technique do

611
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,960
it uses bayesian model selection

612
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,200
so comparison of the relative adequacy

613
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,720
and complexity of different bayesian

614
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,120
models to identify the sparcity

615
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,280
structure which is where there are edges

616
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,480
or not

617
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,159
or where there aren't which is the same

618
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,679
thing as where they are

619
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,520
in a graph that is best explaining in

620
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,000
observed time series

621
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,159
the implicit adjacency matrix that's

622
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,400
that spare city structure specifies the

623
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,880
form of the network eg cyclic or acyclic

624
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,480
and then later on we see unlike

625
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,840
conventional approaches to network

626
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,320
discovery dcm permits the analysis of

627
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,440
directed and cyclic graphs

628
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,400
so

629
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,120
dcm is an approach for looking at a time

630
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,200
series that's the dynamic part through

631
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,240
time

632
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,039
and then looking at how variables

633
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,679
statistically cause each other

634
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,000
and so a statistical cause is like when

635
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,880
one thing happens and then at some later

636
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,720
time point there's another thing

637
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,279
happening that's a statistical causal

638
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,720
model like granger causality

639
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,279
we're talking about our model so if

640
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,000
bitcoin price goes up and then later oil

641
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,600
price goes up across the whole time

642
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,600
series so there would be a directed

643
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,120
causal edge

644
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,559
there might be a bi-directional causal

645
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,640
edge or a one-directional causal edge it

646
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,200
doesn't mean that in the real world one

647
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,919
going up caused the other it's just

648
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,240
talking about our time series data so

649
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,320
that's dynamic causal modeling and it

650
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,720
can be applied to neuroimaging data blue

651
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,360
i have a quick question here so um i get

652
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,799
the time series that that makes it

653
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,159
dynamic but i also thought like you

654
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,720
could have functional studies that also

655
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,480
fall into the category of dynamic causal

656
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,240
modeling like gene knockouts right so

657
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,679
like you'd knock out a gene not

658
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,279
necessarily a time

659
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,600
um variation but like a variation in the

660
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,760
graph itself and so you knock out a gene

661
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,279
and then isn't that also dynamical

662
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,640
causal modeling or that's something

663
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,960
different

664
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,559
um one could have like the nodes be

665
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,039
gene expression through time

666
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,600
and then test how

667
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,559
perturbations or counterfactual

668
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,360
network architectures would result in

669
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,360
different

670
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,480
expressions through time

671
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,720
but can you take the time out of it and

672
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,400
have it still be a dynamic model i guess

673
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,960
it's just snapchats right so it's not um

674
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,200
not time series but like gene series i

675
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,559
don't know like knocking out the genes

676
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,320
in the series to make it a dynamic model

677
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
if it were just a single

678
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,120
time slot slice

679
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,320
then

680
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,400
it's a little bit unclear what the edges

681
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,000
would reflect

682
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
because cause is like effect through

683
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,120
time

684
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,600
in the statistical sense so if it were

685
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,440
just like i have like you know there's

686
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,440
50 people here and 20 people here and 10

687
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,960
people here

688
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,960
it's hard to say where is there a causal

689
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,440
edge whereas if all three were changing

690
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,440
then one could draw these causal edges

691
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,360
okay

692
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,880
now we turn

693
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,480
under the scope of the big question

694
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,679
about modularity two specifically

695
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,320
modularity and the free energy principle

696
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,440
fep

697
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,240
okay

698
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,880
so this is the big topic and kind of the

699
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,919
um

700
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,200
the entree

701
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,640
that benny is bringing to us to discuss

702
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,320
and it's highlighting a really important

703
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,559
issue which is the conceptual

704
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:25,919
compatibility

705
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,520
of modularity with the free energy

706
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,720
principle

707
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,919
and

708
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,039
it's a

709
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,520
speculation that this conceptual point

710
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,960
may well become

711
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,799
significant in the course of scientific

712
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,200
development of the fep so this is like a

713
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,320
philosopher engaging in a scientific

714
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,960
discussion because there actually is a

715
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,440
lot on the table if we get modularity

716
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,720
right or wrong

717
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,520
so what is the relationship between fep

718
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,120
and modularity

719
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,960
is it compatible

720
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,520
is it necessary sufficient

721
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,880
incompatible like if we have modularity

722
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,039
do we get fep

723
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,200
right that's sufficient do we need

724
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,400
modularity for the fep necessity

725
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,840
if we have it

726
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,960
can we not get the fep incompatibility

727
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,880
are we talking about the modularity of

728
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,159
our world

729
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,399
carving up nature of the joints or of

730
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,480
our scientific statistical models

731
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,960
instrumentalism carving up our models at

732
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,200
the joints that we designed

733
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
and then how does our stance or our

734
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,640
perspective

735
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,760
on this topic of modularity and the fep

736
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,840
influence our generative model how we

737
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,399
think and act whether we're the ones

738
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,080
collaborating and writing scientific

739
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,039
papers

740
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,240
or not

741
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,520
and then just to add one more note

742
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,000
despite the great unifying scope fep has

743
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,679
been criticized on account of not

744
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,600
discussing the functional mechanisms of

745
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,799
the brain

746
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,520
so the unifying scope is kind of like

747
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,880
top down

748
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,000
that's the ramstead at all 2018 all of

749
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,120
space and time under the fep envelope

750
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,360
that's the top down description

751
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,360
and then the functional mechanisms are

752
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,679
like those minute particulars that's the

753
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:08,960
bottom up

754
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,320
components

755
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,760
that build

756
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,120
the system

757
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,679
and that sort of meets in the middle

758
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,840
with the real world systems that people

759
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,679
are always

760
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,600
discussing so

761
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,080
we're talking about how modularity works

762
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,880
with the fep or not any thoughts blue or

763
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,880
dean

764
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,000
well only thing i would add is that it

765
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,480
you can you can be strictly top down

766
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,640
or you can actually

767
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,880
as benny would point out keep an open

768
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,960
mind which means that you've got

769
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,640
some movement for both top down and

770
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,000
bottom up

771
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,799
so

772
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,399
we'll probably get into that more in the

773
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,240
0.1.2

774
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,440
yes

775
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,520
exactly

776
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,559
um

777
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,279
we're now going to go to some

778
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,720
classic citations

779
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,440
so benny writes to address this problem

780
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,000
of modularity in fep

781
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,240
fep theorists may want to provide finer

782
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,080
details about the functional mechanisms

783
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,000
that enable fep so that's how we're

784
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,159
going to make a comeback to colombo at

785
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,000
all 2021 columbo and wright 2016 is by

786
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,840
providing finer detail

787
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,200
in addition to reinvigorating its unifi

788
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,840
unificatory

789
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,000
scope unifying scope maybe that would be

790
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
in line with fristen's preceding remarks

791
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,720
that despite its roughness fep may be

792
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,880
developed to provide a guide to brain

793
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,919
functions so we're going to do both

794
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,600
we're going to keep the big scope and

795
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,960
we're going to provide details so let's

796
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,279
look at some of those details

797
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,440
this is also going to provide a really

798
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,880
good introduction to the difference

799
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,200
between the functional and effective

800
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,080
connectivity and connectivity here is

801
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,360
referring to

802
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,360
statistical measurements coming from

803
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,760
brain regions because anatomical

804
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,320
connectivity is just are the pieces

805
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,640
physically connected you know the knee

806
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,640
bones connected to the leg bone that

807
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,720
kind of descriptive anatomical

808
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,880
connectedness

809
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,039
first in 1994

810
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,799
functional and effective connectivity in

811
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,120
neuroimaging a synthesis

812
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,399
so back when we were younger weren't we

813
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,880
the paper reviews the basic distinction

814
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,240
between functional and effective

815
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,000
connectivity in neuroimaging

816
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,520
going over to the origins and

817
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,960
definitions

818
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,799
functional connectivity is defined as

819
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,960
the temporal correlations between

820
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,120
spatially remote neurophysiological

821
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,919
events so that's not the only way to say

822
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,399
it in english or any other language but

823
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,200
we're not talking about a philosophical

824
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,039
um sense of

825
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,080
function

826
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,679
like what does it mean or what is its

827
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,159
teleology we're talking about

828
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,600
statistical

829
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,559
variation in measurements

830
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,519
this definition is operational

831
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,720
very cool

832
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,559
and provides a simple characterization

833
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,640
of functional interactions

834
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,799
the alternative is to explicitly refer

835
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,799
to effective connectivity

836
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,360
i.e the influence that one neuronal

837
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,840
system exerts over another

838
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,559
so

839
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,399
temporal correlation

840
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,440
is things that are um like they could be

841
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,679
uncorrelated in the micro but then

842
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,760
they're both going up together

843
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,559
that would have functional connectivity

844
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,200
whereas effective connectivity would be

845
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,000
looking at how changes in one

846
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,919
at the next time step influence changes

847
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,320
in the other and so those could be like

848
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,080
going in different directions at the

849
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,200
macro

850
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,720
but they could have effective

851
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,000
connectivity

852
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,679
because they influence each other

853
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,399
statistically

854
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,039
let's stay with this fristen 94 theme

855
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,080
but we're not going to go through the

856
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,320
whole thing this is just to show like

857
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,559
what was being discussed and explored

858
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,720
and characterized

859
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,799
about 30 years ago

860
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,279
so keep that in mind we have a long

861
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:05,279
pheromone trail to catch up with carl on

862
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,480
this is

863
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,440
back in 1994 this is 94.

864
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,840
yeah they had models back then

865
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,840
well they were made of wood but yes

866
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,399
um this is a statistical parametric map

867
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:21,679
spm

868
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,080
projected onto a brain

869
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:24,960
and

870
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,559
on this map

871
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,200
of the images

872
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,360
taken through time of a brain that were

873
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,760
fmri in this case

874
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,279
one can take that

875
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,799
data object and find the eigenvalues

876
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,279
and there are mathematical relationships

877
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,039
between functional and effective

878
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,320
connectivity

879
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,159
not going to go into it but it's an

880
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,640
awesome topic explored here and in

881
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,360
several earlier papers and in the 2007

882
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,199
spm textbook and in later papers

883
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,080
what was able to be said

884
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,919
even way back then

885
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,279
well

886
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,279
this is one of the figures

887
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:03,520
um

888
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,720
[Music]

889
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,679
these are

890
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,600
looking at the

891
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,960
loadings

892
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,039
on different

893
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,559
vectors

894
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,200
so it's a spatial mode that reflects an

895
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,880
eigenvector so it's kind of like a

896
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,440
vector through space and time activity

897
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,919
that explains a large proportion of

898
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,559
variance in the data

899
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:27,600
and

900
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,039
the first

901
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,960
vector that's this top one

902
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,320
is clearly related to the difference

903
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,240
between word generation even numbered

904
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,399
conditions and word shadowing odd number

905
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:37,440
scans

906
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,399
so

907
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,480
this was a experimental paradigm where

908
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,320
the person was being asked to do two

909
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,320
different things alternating generate a

910
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,399
word and then shadow a word like i guess

911
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,960
repeat a word that was already said

912
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,640
and then

913
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,799
this vector

914
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,039
which had this activation pattern on the

915
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,799
right in the brain

916
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:57,600
was

917
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,640
negatively correlated with the odds and

918
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,039
evenly correla and positively correlated

919
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:07,279
with the even so it's a plausible

920
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,040
mechanistic

921
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,239
statement about the differences in the

922
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,879
activated neuroanatomy

923
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,839
doesn't mean it's simple to interpret

924
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:18,719
but

925
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,119
it's a vector whose expression is

926
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,800
correlated with something in the

927
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,399
experimental design

928
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:27,199
like if you did a double-blind study and

929
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,480
these people got the drug and these

930
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,159
people got a different drug

931
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,159
the correlation between them would be

932
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,079
ascribed to the difference that you as

933
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,960
the experimenter imposed

934
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,199
whereas here's an example of another

935
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,320
vector

936
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,079
that declines throughout the entire

937
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,839
experiment

938
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,560
and so that might reflect for example

939
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,679
attention

940
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,320
dropping off through time and so that's

941
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,040
a lot of neural imaging then and now

942
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,290
looking into these summarized um

943
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:57,920
[Music]

944
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,040
statistical representations of activity

945
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,599
patterns through time

946
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,839
and also for um

947
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,079
later just it's cool to look at some of

948
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,160
these citations like the edelman

949
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,760
citations tonini and sporns 92

950
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,040
these are really

951
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,040
classic citations

952
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,200
so there we were in 94

953
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,160
and then this is a dream of the future

954
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,160
from 94.

955
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,520
so here's

956
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,160
um zargami and firsten

957
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:28,839
in

958
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:30,800
2020.

959
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,079
again

960
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,560
talking about effective connectivity

961
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,240
biologically grounded models like

962
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,320
dynamic causal modeling and dynamical

963
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,240
systems theory

964
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,240
so

965
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,720
improving and iterating on those basic

966
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,839
ideas

967
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,440
and then also what does it look like to

968
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,240
apply it and what kinds of conclusions

969
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,079
and statements do scientists make when

970
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,320
just applying these uh

971
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,359
methods

972
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,040
so for example

973
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,440
this paper was in 2019

974
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,040
and it is called

975
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,880
dynamic causal modeling of effective

976
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,160
connectivity

977
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,320
should sound familiar during anger

978
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,480
experience in healthy young men

979
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,280
seven tesla mri imaging study

980
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,480
and so

981
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,440
um

982
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,760
you can read the abstract but they

983
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,079
find that viewing certain kinds of films

984
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,240
leads to activation of certain brain

985
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,359
regions

986
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,839
dot dot dot we propose a model of

987
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:25,680
effective connectivity associated with

988
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,839
the anger experience based upon dynamic

989
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,200
causal modeling

990
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,040
the findings have implications for

991
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,960
psychiatric disorders

992
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,599
so that's what people do they put people

993
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,720
into scanners they take measurements of

994
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,440
the hemodynamics of the brain

995
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,640
and then

996
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,880
make a statistical model of it and the

997
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,079
edges

998
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,720
that exist across all subjects or only

999
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,200
in the ones who have this diagnosis or

1000
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,440
only in these experimental conditions

1001
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,839
those edges are interpreted

1002
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,920
in a certain way

1003
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,400
that's what's on the table but we're

1004
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,680
discussing all these techniques

1005
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,079
any comments on fristen94 or we'll go to

1006
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,160
the other classic

1007
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,839
just that effective connectivity is what

1008
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,040
i was thinking of like in the gene

1009
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,880
network like how are they effectively

1010
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,440
connected so it's like makes sense now

1011
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:18,800
yes

1012
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,920
another

1013
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,400
classic but a more recent one is 2009

1014
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,240
firstin's paper again single author

1015
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,599
paper

1016
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,920
the free energy principle a rough guide

1017
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,280
to the brain

1018
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,440
so now that's

1019
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,440
how long ago 13 years ago

1020
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,960
the free energy principle might provide

1021
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,480
a comprehensive account of how we

1022
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,320
represent the world and come to sample

1023
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,720
it adaptively

1024
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,200
through action by moving our little eyes

1025
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,359
around

1026
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:50,960
the fep provides a mathematical

1027
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,839
specification of what the brain is doing

1028
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,560
now that starts to sound like realism

1029
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,920
right what the brain is doing not

1030
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,680
a functional description of the models

1031
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,880
we make about the brain

1032
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,119
it is suppressing free energy if it uses

1033
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,720
gradient descent

1034
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,760
and so

1035
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,560
um

1036
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,720
the box with the questions for future

1037
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,720
research

1038
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,680
um

1039
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,119
are really

1040
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,079
still key what optimization schemes does

1041
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,079
the brain use these are like still

1042
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,599
important questions

1043
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,839
and then also um

1044
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,520
the domains

1045
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,359
of application

1046
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:30,560
it's just

1047
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,359
always good to see like what was the

1048
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,000
fep's description and scope

1049
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,240
13 years ago

1050
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,680
some of the images

1051
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,440
we've even seen

1052
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,119
again and again

1053
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,240
with

1054
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,560
sometimes some variants

1055
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,599
but these are like images that we see

1056
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,320
commonly we talk about action to

1057
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,000
minimize surprise

1058
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,560
and perception to optimize the bound so

1059
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,079
this is like the predictive processing

1060
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,160
element and this is like the control

1061
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,240
theory element

1062
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,480
um we talk about the topology of

1063
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,240
perception cognition and action

1064
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,440
so

1065
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,760
suffice to say that there are

1066
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,880
equations

1067
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,560
figures and it's another great paper on

1068
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,359
the long road towards the fep

1069
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:23,359
any comments on 2009 paper

1070
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,359
all right

1071
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,040
blue would you like to describe

1072
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,280
modularity

1073
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,160
sure

1074
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,440
so um i just wanted to explicitly define

1075
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,480
it because we talked about it a little

1076
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,680
bit in the abstract and we're going to

1077
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,240
talk about it a lot more but um in the

1078
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,599
paper the the author defined modularity

1079
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,640
as information encapsulation which

1080
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,119
dean mentioned earlier

1081
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,760
and he says informational encapsulation

1082
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,680
holds that when engaged in information

1083
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,240
processing the subsystems do not have

1084
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,320
access to information processing in

1085
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,079
other compartments and information

1086
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,560
processing within each subsystem is

1087
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,160
constrained within the combination

1088
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,480
computational mechanisms of that

1089
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,839
subsystems

1090
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,760
of that subsystem and so the modules are

1091
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,680
then defined by information segregation

1092
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,400
um and it's interesting to compare

1093
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,240
modularity like is encapsulating

1094
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,880
information in a module versus defining

1095
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,280
individuality which um

1096
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,800
but both like mike levin and the

1097
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,319
computational boundary of a self paper

1098
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:26,480
that we did last summer and then um

1099
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,800
david krakauer in his 2020 theory about

1100
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,560
the information theory of individuality

1101
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,440
both

1102
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,760
of those authors um

1103
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,000
talk about information sharing like

1104
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,400
information sharing um like with cells

1105
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,160
to form a tissue for example in mike

1106
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,160
levin's work and then in the information

1107
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,160
theory of individuality paper like up

1108
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,319
and down across different levels so that

1109
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,319
you can define individuality at any

1110
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,319
given level but it talked about how

1111
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:51,760
information is shared

1112
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,160
with this bi-directional causation

1113
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,760
in that paper and so i think it's

1114
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,200
interesting to compare this idea of

1115
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,680
informational encapsulation in a module

1116
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,839
with these definitions of biological

1117
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,319
individuals

1118
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:07,359
very cool like is modularity the same

1119
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,760
thing as individuality

1120
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,319
how about continue describing maybe in

1121
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,400
this discussion on intransitivity

1122
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,280
well so i had to like look this up so i

1123
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,599
i i just like it i went into the paper

1124
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,119
like i just wanted somebody to just

1125
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,720
define what does this intransitivity

1126
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,800
mean and so the author says the general

1127
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,400
insight in is based on the

1128
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,319
intransitivity of the passage of

1129
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,839
prediction errors

1130
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,240
between levels whose information can

1131
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,359
affect one another only in cases of

1132
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,680
uncertainty and noise

1133
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,560
so

1134
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,920
i feel like that this is like

1135
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,800
intransitivity of information between

1136
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,280
the modules like but i it was just not

1137
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,720
clear enough for me so then i tried to

1138
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,560
look up like what is intransitivity what

1139
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,319
is its intransitivity theory and i came

1140
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,480
across this really cool paper um which

1141
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,400
is 2015 and entropy

1142
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,640
intransitivity in theory and the real

1143
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,000
world and it

1144
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,520
i think it's really different than like

1145
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,680
what we're talking about here but it

1146
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,920
talked about like uh intransitivity in

1147
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,839
terms of preferences and it said the

1148
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,079
choice between transitive which are

1149
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,319
transitive which are absolute and

1150
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,640
intransitive which are relativistic

1151
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,839
models depends on the nature of the

1152
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:17,200
processes that these models are expected

1153
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,359
to reproduce many people however have a

1154
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,599
psychological difficulties in accepting

1155
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,599
a relativistic approach expecting an

1156
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,359
absolute scale of judgment from bad to

1157
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,440
good which can be suitable in some cases

1158
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,160
but excessively simplistic in others and

1159
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,720
they gave the idea of intransitivity in

1160
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,720
game theory and so like an intransitive

1161
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,359
game is just rock paper scissors

1162
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:39,359
which obviously like your choice there's

1163
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,440
no it's not rock is always good paper is

1164
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,359
always good tails never fails it's

1165
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:46,400
always relative to what the other people

1166
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,800
are choosing right in this in this game

1167
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,680
um and then they really go into like

1168
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,119
multi-dimensionality and intransitivity

1169
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:55,680
so he says in the paper coarsening which

1170
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,119
is like coarse graining in

1171
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,280
multi-dimensional cases becomes strictly

1172
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,040
intransitive

1173
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,319
and the cases without strict

1174
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,000
intransitivity are degenerate either

1175
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,920
dimensions are redundant or coarsening

1176
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,440
is performed after

1177
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,119
merging the fractional variables into

1178
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,720
the overall utility instead of

1179
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,720
independent questioning for all or some

1180
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,319
of the criteria

1181
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,160
from a philosophical perspective this

1182
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,599
statement can be presented as a

1183
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,480
continuum argument for intransitivity

1184
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,079
small alterations are commonly

1185
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:23,920
overlooked for secondary parameters but

1186
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,920
can be accumulated into critical

1187
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,839
differences and so i just thought that

1188
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,119
this was cool because it talks about

1189
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:30,400
like philosophy and some things that

1190
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,560
we're talking about and relative or like

1191
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,400
you know realist versus instrumentalist

1192
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,800
but it's completely unrelated and i just

1193
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,640
wonder like is it completely unrelated

1194
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,160
or can we go back and then like link

1195
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,839
intransitivity

1196
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:43,599
full circle into what we're discussing

1197
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,359
here today so it was just i put this in

1198
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:46,319
here because i thought it was a cool

1199
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,000
paper and in my search for

1200
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,480
intransitivity um that's what i ran into

1201
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,440
awesome putting a number on something

1202
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,680
often makes it seem like whatever you're

1203
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,040
putting the number on they are

1204
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,800
transitive you know if everybody gets a

1205
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,480
score out of 100

1206
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,560
then there's a natural order or if we're

1207
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,160
ranking policies according to their

1208
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,240
expected free energy then there might be

1209
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,240
some ordering of policies according to

1210
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,079
which ones are best minimizing free

1211
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,160
energy and i think this idea of

1212
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,000
intransitivity within the graphical

1213
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,040
model

1214
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,119
what kinds of information are being

1215
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:20,240
passed

1216
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,920
and what does it mean and then just more

1217
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,359
broadly like you brought up with the

1218
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:26,880
game theory it's very interesting

1219
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,680
all right let us continue almost

1220
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,720
finishing the first section and get to

1221
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,480
modularity fep and the target

1222
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,680
of the paper

1223
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,160
which is the hippolito and kirchoff

1224
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,200
paper

1225
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,920
so without intending to map the course

1226
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,400
of the evolution of the fep like we will

1227
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,440
blue

1228
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,200
i will just remark that the assumption

1229
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,800
of modularity has been fruitful in the

1230
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,960
study of brain functions

1231
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,000
and so

1232
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,280
keeping an open mind about that

1233
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,200
assumption could be fruitful for the fep

1234
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,680
too some significant critiques such as

1235
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,599
hippolito and kirchhoff 2019 not

1236
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,359
withstanding

1237
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,119
if you want to read more

1238
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,880
definitely check out this paper from

1239
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,640
late 2019 by ines and michael and they

1240
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,560
are also as well as any of you welcome

1241
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,319
to come on and discuss this paper that

1242
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,319
could be really cool to like kind of

1243
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:19,599
embody and enact the paper and

1244
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,680
are we on the same page or what are our

1245
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,200
perspectives even if we are on the same

1246
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,160
page

1247
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,480
and this paper is engaging in the

1248
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,319
discussion of the relationship between

1249
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:31,119
modules and modularity

1250
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:32,560
the main goal of the paper is not to

1251
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,880
defy hippolyto and kirchoff's attack

1252
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,319
completely

1253
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,640
the notion of modularity that benny will

1254
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,400
defend is weaker than the notion that

1255
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,920
they attack

1256
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:42,880
so

1257
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,200
what senses or types of modularity are

1258
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,480
we dealing with

1259
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,440
what are the stronger and weaker claims

1260
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,839
and we'll look at their definition on

1261
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:53,119
the next slide

1262
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:55,440
the main point of the discussion

1263
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,359
is that according

1264
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:59,760
following hippolyta on kirchoff the

1265
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,680
modest definition of modularity is

1266
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,880
neither insignificant nor indispensable

1267
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,200
so that made me ask are we seeing a

1268
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,280
trend towards

1269
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,720
instrumentalism bottom-up weak claims

1270
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,599
like the entailment exploration of 34

1271
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,680
and deflationary models

1272
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,839
and moves away

1273
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:20,800
from

1274
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,480
naive or

1275
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,680
realist

1276
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,440
strong claims

1277
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,520
and so that just totally

1278
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,160
points to the role of philosophy in an

1279
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,200
ongoing scientific domain

1280
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,560
because um

1281
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,480
things like strong and weak emergence or

1282
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,800
entailment relationships and these

1283
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,440
discussions on modularity they really

1284
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,079
matter for how science is done and how

1285
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:46,560
it's interpreted so it's just really

1286
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,640
cool to be seeing that happen

1287
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,440
in a new way

1288
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,800
again we're not going to go into the

1289
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,520
whole argument of hippolyta and kirchoff

1290
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,160
check out the paper but

1291
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,079
they are going to

1292
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,800
consider the three most well articulated

1293
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,240
which is funny because that means well

1294
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,760
said but also

1295
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,400
well jointed

1296
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,319
arguments for the view that modularity

1297
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:11,680
and predictive processing work well

1298
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,280
together

1299
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,720
so predictive processing here is also

1300
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,480
referring to kind of that component of

1301
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,480
active inference

1302
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,680
and they're going to argue that all

1303
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,440
three of these arguments for modularity

1304
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,119
come up short albeit for different

1305
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:25,440
reasons so they kind of do like a steel

1306
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,440
person where they give the strongest

1307
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,440
argument for that

1308
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,160
attack and then they refute it and the

1309
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,160
three arguments they discuss are the

1310
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,200
epistemic bayesian courtroom argument

1311
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,200
which is just the idea that

1312
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,040
court rooms are modular

1313
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,880
and cognition's kind of like a courtroom

1314
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,200
like the eye is like a witness and then

1315
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,720
there's like another witness thereof and

1316
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,960
so if that's modular then shouldn't

1317
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,640
predictive cognitive architectures be

1318
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,160
modular

1319
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,880
b the intransitivity argument

1320
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,720
which is that the causal influences

1321
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,040
across hierarchical levels

1322
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,720
are instantiating mechanisms that

1323
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,680
implement causal bayesian networks

1324
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,160
and they basically say

1325
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,599
that is pitching

1326
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:11,280
predictive processing in terms of the

1327
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,319
dag

1328
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:13,760
as opposed to

1329
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,880
cyclic models

1330
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,480
and see the markov blanket argument the

1331
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,559
notion that a markov blanket grounds the

1332
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:25,200
idea that predictive processing exhibits

1333
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,480
modularity

1334
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,599
and so

1335
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:30,480
they are going to explore those and

1336
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,359
confuse them as they say

1337
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:36,240
and one of the key points is when

1338
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,000
cognitive neuroscience works with an

1339
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,720
acyclic markov decision scheme so that's

1340
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,319
like the partially observable markov

1341
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,559
decision process that we were talking

1342
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:47,880
about earlier

1343
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:49,839
it may

1344
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:53,440
very well be methodologically misguided

1345
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,119
why because there's an increasing

1346
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,040
tendency within neuroscience to

1347
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,720
emphasize recurrent and reciprocal

1348
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,960
neuronal processing within the newly

1349
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,720
emerging dynamical causal modeling

1350
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,319
frameworks

1351
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,160
so

1352
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,760
how are we going to think about the fact

1353
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,599
that the brain does have these feedback

1354
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,280
feedback loops

1355
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,160
and

1356
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,000
square the circle with the dags and the

1357
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,599
dcms and

1358
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:17,200
that's kind of the introduction that's

1359
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,280
where we're set up which is that

1360
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,160
hippolyta and kirchoff have framed

1361
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,040
and then

1362
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,319
attacked

1363
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:27,839
three pro arguments for modularity

1364
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,760
and cognitive architectures related to

1365
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,359
predictive processing

1366
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:33,359
benny is going to kind of

1367
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,520
take some of that energy and with a

1368
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,480
weaker

1369
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,760
version

1370
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,040
com or a little bit of a different

1371
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,640
version not simply stronger or weaker

1372
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,640
because that would actually imply

1373
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,720
transitivity of strength but with a

1374
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,400
slightly different tack

1375
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,079
is going to

1376
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:49,280
um

1377
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,359
recall us to life

1378
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,799
through a discussion of modularity

1379
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,599
so this section is only going to have

1380
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:58,400
one

1381
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,319
slide on it and then either of you

1382
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,520
please uh feel free to add any comments

1383
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,839
there's been a long history of debate on

1384
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:08,880
modularity in neuroscience

1385
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,880
and fodor who's a very influential

1386
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,400
cognitive scientist

1387
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,880
define modular cognitive systems

1388
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,280
as systems that are domain specific

1389
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,000
innately specified hardwired autonomous

1390
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,680
and not assembled

1391
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,920
that's not exactly the definition of

1392
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,079
modular that we've explored in some

1393
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:27,760
other slides but

1394
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,480
the words are what they are

1395
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,440
and

1396
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,520
that is the benny quote about that

1397
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,720
functional

1398
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,280
isolation between modules is what

1399
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,040
defines them so it's kind of like when

1400
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,559
there's more connection within than

1401
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,000
between then that's modular and so benny

1402
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,160
writes the present paper does not intend

1403
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,680
to defend fodor's version of the

1404
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,000
modularity thesis fully probably because

1405
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,520
some of these pieces about like innate

1406
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,000
specification hardwiring autonomous

1407
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,920
unassembled

1408
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,240
take it or leave it it was the 80s

1409
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,160
but benny is simply aiming to show that

1410
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,640
some critiques of modularity do not need

1411
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,480
to undermine the possibility of

1412
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,040
informational encapsulation

1413
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,800
so

1414
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,880
although a falsification

1415
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,440
of informational encapsulation leads to

1416
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,839
the renunciation of modularity

1417
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,160
a defense of partial encapsulation would

1418
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,160
not establish a full-blooded form of

1419
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,359
modularity so if

1420
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:25,760
you refute encapsulation

1421
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,880
you have to renounce modularity

1422
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,720
however parcel

1423
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,280
or transient encapsulation

1424
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,599
doesn't give you strong modularity

1425
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:36,720
claims

1426
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,880
however it can be compatible with the

1427
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,440
instrumental usage of models that have

1428
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,960
modularity

1429
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,160
so

1430
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,319
those are some of the main arguments

1431
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:48,319
that set bennie up to defend a version

1432
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:51,359
of modularity that's quite modest

1433
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:53,359
and it's almost like after that kind of

1434
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:56,000
a modest deflationary take the question

1435
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,200
is really

1436
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,119
is there any value

1437
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:02,079
in that definition of modularity at all

1438
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,240
so the debate isn't over whether we can

1439
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,160
discuss things modularly

1440
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,480
if we're going to take this different

1441
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,800
tack then really the question is like

1442
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,040
does it matter

1443
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:16,558
any comments on section 2

1444
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,280
so i don't know i don't want to get too

1445
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,960
deep into it maybe better to hold off

1446
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,559
for the

1447
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,040
dot one but i just wonder about like if

1448
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,839
encapsulation so if it's if something's

1449
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:30,480
fully informationally encapsulated like

1450
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,760
you know my heart is fully

1451
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,839
informationally encapsulated from

1452
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:36,160
my brain like how do you how does a

1453
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,359
living system function right so so this

1454
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:41,280
partial encapsulation if that's not

1455
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,280
strong enough for modularity like i

1456
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,359
don't know how full encapsulation as

1457
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:48,960
possible i just i i don't see it so

1458
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,200
yes

1459
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,599
section three is entitled a golden

1460
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:57,280
thread free energy principle and so

1461
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,720
we just had to go there with a blake

1462
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,720
reference because on his gravestone and

1463
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,200
one of his most famous lines is

1464
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,920
i give you the end of a golden string

1465
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,920
only wind it into a ball it will lead

1466
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,520
you in at heaven's gate built in

1467
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,040
jerusalem's wall and then here's a

1468
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,359
drawing that he made with a mythological

1469
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:14,400
character

1470
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,599
walking with a golden string

1471
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:20,000
so the general idea according to benny

1472
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,520
behind predictive coding is that the

1473
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,520
brain uses approximate bayesian

1474
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,359
inference to decrease discrepancy

1475
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:29,520
between predictions and inputs

1476
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,200
that is one of the

1477
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,160
key contentions of the fep

1478
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,200
and

1479
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,720
the organism's interaction with its

1480
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,960
environment can be represented by marco

1481
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,880
blankets

1482
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,720
here i am using representation and

1483
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,319
modeling when speaking of markup

1484
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,599
blankets and consider them to be

1485
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,960
markovian models so check out

1486
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,480
benny's

1487
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,000
guest stream appearance i think it's

1488
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,599
number one

1489
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:57,520
on markovian monism and

1490
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,440
this sentence makes it clear we're

1491
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,000
talking about models we're in the realm

1492
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,440
of instrumentalism

1493
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,520
we're talking about

1494
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,680
markovian models

1495
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,359
not about whether we're making an

1496
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:11,440
ontologically real claim about markov

1497
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,040
blankets like being the structure of

1498
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,119
reality so in these models markov

1499
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:16,800
blankets are describing

1500
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,119
the conditional independence of internal

1501
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:20,960
and external states

1502
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,119
and then it's that fristen innovation

1503
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:25,520
beyond pearl and markov's

1504
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,319
to

1505
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:28,079
describe the incoming dependencies as

1506
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,160
sensory and the outgoing dependencies as

1507
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,920
active states

1508
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:32,960
so

1509
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,200
what is the golden thread

1510
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,839
the fep is an approach for embroidering

1511
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:41,040
or what creating markov blankets finding

1512
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,520
them what is the golden thread

1513
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,359
what is the silver thread and golden

1514
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:47,759
needle

1515
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,160
so what do you think the illusion means

1516
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,160
and what does the fep have to do with it

1517
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,400
well i'll speak a little bit on this i

1518
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,559
might get it wrong but that's okay we're

1519
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,640
still 0.0

1520
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,040
i think the predictive coding

1521
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,319
as a as an entailment question fits

1522
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:10,160
inside of

1523
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,599
the um

1524
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:15,680
what did he call bcc brain

1525
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:17,119
uh

1526
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:20,640
brain brain brain brain brain

1527
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,200
i can't find it now in here anyway i

1528
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,359
think that i think there's a subtle and

1529
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:27,760
a nuanced difference between what fep is

1530
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,559
as a process and as a principle and what

1531
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,920
fvp

1532
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,559
architecture is and i think that

1533
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:37,359
is what he is trying to bring

1534
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:38,880
to the table

1535
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,119
there is a difference between the

1536
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:43,280
architecture or the product that results

1537
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,400
from the use of an fep process and the

1538
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,440
fe pre fep process itself and once i

1539
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,079
figure out my own notes here i can speak

1540
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,720
to what that bcc is but i'll i'll shut

1541
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,040
up for a second

1542
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,319
very well

1543
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:00,240
interesting to describe the difference

1544
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,160
between the principle and the realized

1545
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,319
architecture

1546
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,920
section 4

1547
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,799
the track of a storm

1548
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,079
so here's another

1549
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:12,000
single slider

1550
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,680
so there's some apparent tension between

1551
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,520
the modularity thesis and the predictive

1552
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,720
architecture

1553
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,240
so that's

1554
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,359
what kirchoff and hippolyta described

1555
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:23,839
while the thesis of modularity points in

1556
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:25,680
the direction of segregation and

1557
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,839
encapsulation

1558
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:29,839
the predictive architecture grounds the

1559
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:32,079
integration of information

1560
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:34,240
in a hierarchical top-down architecture

1561
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,720
that unifies the mechanisms of

1562
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,400
cognition perception and action under

1563
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,599
the fpp

1564
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:41,920
so it's like what blue just said

1565
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,559
wait if it's encapsulated and defined by

1566
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:46,079
its separation

1567
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:49,040
then how is it part of this integrated

1568
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,559
whole

1569
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:51,680
well

1570
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,000
howie in 2013 the book the predictive

1571
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:54,960
mind

1572
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,960
and other people in other places have

1573
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,799
suggested that this conditional

1574
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:00,480
independence between

1575
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,160
the various levels of the hierarchical

1576
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,880
structure of predictive coding under fep

1577
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,400
could be construed

1578
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,240
along the lines of functional

1579
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,000
segregation and informational

1580
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,640
encapsulation which is why fodor was

1581
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,598
brought up earlier

1582
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,599
drayson

1583
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:19,200
argued that the predictive architecture

1584
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,440
can be modeled in terms of this causal

1585
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,599
probabilistic dependency

1586
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:27,520
where different nodes could influence

1587
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,640
the um adjacent levels but there isn't

1588
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,760
global transitivity so like the lower

1589
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,440
most nodes

1590
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,280
are not influencing all just the ones

1591
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,000
directly above them

1592
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,240
however the hippolyto and kirchoff paper

1593
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,200
challenge

1594
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,680
that vertical and horizontal account so

1595
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:46,960
the vertical account is like the

1596
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,720
multi-scale nested systems the

1597
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,079
horizontal account is like the

1598
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,720
collective behavior interactions across

1599
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:56,799
within a level and so they aim to refute

1600
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:58,880
this account of functional informational

1601
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,640
modularity

1602
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,280
according to hippolyta and kirchoff and

1603
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,400
let's

1604
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,559
hear from them if it's not the case

1605
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:08,160
the intransitivity argument for

1606
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,559
modularity is based on dax

1607
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,799
however they're going to argue that dags

1608
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:14,079
are not suitable for that kind of

1609
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:15,440
modeling

1610
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,880
because

1611
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,839
the brain has these cyclic mechanisms

1612
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:22,400
and so dags have to be replaced by

1613
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,119
cyclic models which don't have the

1614
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:27,839
limitations of dags

1615
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:30,000
um and then with respect to the markov

1616
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,400
blanket point benny asserts that

1617
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,520
hippolito and kirchoff argue that

1618
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:38,079
the argument from markov blankets is of

1619
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:42,240
little avail to establishing modularity

1620
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,520
he will

1621
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,839
get to both of those arguments he kind

1622
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:47,359
of doesn't really worry about the

1623
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:49,920
courtroom as much but the intransitivity

1624
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,319
and the markovian blanket

1625
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:54,240
arguments are what benny's gonna focus

1626
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,599
on but

1627
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:56,559
first

1628
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:58,559
remark on the importance of scientific

1629
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:00,079
models

1630
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:01,440
so

1631
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,760
kind of a fun tack but that's section

1632
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:04,400
four

1633
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,839
yes please d

1634
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:07,680
yeah so i found out

1635
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:10,400
bcc is brain's cognitive capacities

1636
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,880
that's how he described it in the paper

1637
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,640
so i don't think it's a rock paper

1638
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:17,599
scissors issue either i believe that

1639
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:19,359
predictive coding

1640
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:21,520
is entailed by the brain's cognitive

1641
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,799
capacities

1642
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:24,559
i believe that the brain's cognitive

1643
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:27,119
capacities are entailed by the free

1644
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:29,920
energy principle so it sounds like

1645
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,000
you've got a rock paper scissors but

1646
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,240
that's not the same as the free energy

1647
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,720
principles architecture

1648
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:40,880
being entailed by predictive coding

1649
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,119
i would have to diagram that out for you

1650
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:45,400
but that's where he's saying it's not an

1651
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,440
intransitivity argument

1652
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,920
and that's that's just notes to me

1653
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,400
and that's where i kind of j ran into

1654
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,920
his corner even though i

1655
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,760
i want to actually do a paper later this

1656
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,319
year a review of one of hippolyta's

1657
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:00,319
papers on an action that i think is

1658
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:02,880
fantastic in instrumentalism but that

1659
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,960
this was the moment where

1660
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,000
it it was clear to me that it's not an

1661
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,400
intransitivity argument because back

1662
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,559
that what axel pointed out to we have to

1663
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:15,839
know what entails what

1664
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,598
very cool

1665
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,440
section five

1666
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,400
a knock at the door

1667
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:26,839
models and

1668
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:28,640
modeling we

1669
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,960
we really do need to do that joke stream

1670
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,760
knock knock jokes like you know

1671
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,119
who's there i don't know who are you

1672
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:36,160
expecting

1673
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,680
who do you prefer

1674
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,520
um

1675
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,839
in this

1676
01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:42,480
section

1677
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,119
benny is going to describe some comments

1678
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:48,079
on modeling

1679
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,520
he writes i do not think we can find a

1680
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:54,160
reliable model independent handle on the

1681
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,880
architecture of the brain

1682
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,400
so it's kind of like saying

1683
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,920
if we're going to science

1684
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,359
we're going to model

1685
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:03,760
so let's not think that we could science

1686
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,920
without modeling

1687
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,000
the general insight is that the

1688
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,839
interface of scientific theories and

1689
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:11,680
their target systems

1690
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,680
takes place through scientific modeling

1691
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:16,480
so theories about the brain

1692
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,440
the brain itself and then the edge is

1693
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,079
the scientific modeling now the brain is

1694
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:24,799
like a special and fascinating system

1695
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:26,559
because it can be

1696
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:29,760
reflexively modeling itself but if you

1697
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,200
think about um

1698
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,480
theories of pendulum pendulums theory of

1699
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,520
pendulum

1700
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:36,480
and then

1701
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,799
the target system of the actual pendulum

1702
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:39,760
it's pretty clear to see where the

1703
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,760
modeling relation comes into play

1704
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,760
however again it gets kind of strange

1705
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,079
loopy with the brain

1706
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:49,520
and benny is drawing upon various works

1707
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:53,040
some of it is the weisberg work on like

1708
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,359
simulation and similarity using models

1709
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:57,119
to understand the world

1710
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:00,160
and also some of benny's earlier work

1711
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,240
for example the ways in which markov

1712
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,839
blankets are construed as scientific

1713
01:02:04,839 --> 01:02:06,880
models and

1714
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,280
similar points have been discussed by

1715
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:13,200
mel andrews 2021 that was actin 14.

1716
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,240
so

1717
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,760
scientists

1718
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,760
are making and applying

1719
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,119
models

1720
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:20,559
and so we're not going to break out of

1721
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:22,079
that

1722
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:24,880
vip room in plato's cave

1723
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:25,920
so

1724
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,280
we have different kinds of models and

1725
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,599
maybe some of them are preferable but

1726
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:32,400
like if your argument is predicated on

1727
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,720
breaking free of a given scientific

1728
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:35,599
model

1729
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:37,280
it is um

1730
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,680
something to hear if you think you have

1731
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:40,559
it

1732
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:42,799
dean

1733
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:44,720
so this is it got interesting for me

1734
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,640
here too because if you

1735
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,799
if you look for example at a slice of

1736
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:51,680
time in an fmri image you could be

1737
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,880
focused

1738
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:53,920
on

1739
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,559
the concentration of heat

1740
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:58,640
in different areas of the brain that

1741
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:00,720
would be one bit of information that you

1742
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,960
could take away or

1743
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,359
you could look at the

1744
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:07,920
proportion

1745
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:08,799
of

1746
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:11,039
blood in different areas of the brain

1747
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:13,039
which is going to tell you a little bit

1748
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,680
of different information than the

1749
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:18,079
the actual concentration of heat that

1750
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:19,920
heat bump per se

1751
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,559
and so i was kind of curious

1752
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:23,440
who

1753
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:26,559
who is a modeler here because he talks

1754
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:29,200
about we can't take our we can't take

1755
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,559
the the observer out of the observation

1756
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,000
so again

1757
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,160
what relative what relative bit of

1758
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:39,440
information do we tend to hone in on or

1759
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,760
or do we think is the the

1760
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,000
the more

1761
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,039
um

1762
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:47,039
priority information to take away from

1763
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:49,000
one of these slices of time

1764
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,880
representations

1765
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,319
that was really important to me right

1766
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:53,599
here because if you think of

1767
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,079
encapsulation as that sort of frenetic

1768
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:57,839
image a few slides backward all the

1769
01:03:57,839 --> 01:04:00,720
brain is is chopped up like

1770
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:03,520
like here's the bacon and here's the ham

1771
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,839
and right the different parts of the pig

1772
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:08,240
you're you're you're choosing what it is

1773
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,319
that you think

1774
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:13,359
is the way of of of encapsulating but i

1775
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:14,559
don't think that's what he's talking

1776
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,799
about

1777
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:18,000
we'll

1778
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,240
explore it but yes

1779
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,920
taking this kind of a really strong

1780
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,640
principled stance on scientific modeling

1781
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:27,200
means that we can always ask who is

1782
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,160
doing the modeling why and so actually

1783
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,400
it's not just this sterile philosophical

1784
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,200
point

1785
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,880
it really brings us to consider the

1786
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,960
social and the operational aspects of

1787
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,039
science so it's very important like

1788
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:41,760
socio-technical

1789
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,119
point

1790
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:44,480
section six

1791
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,400
the game made

1792
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,960
the intransitivity argument

1793
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,720
okay we're not gonna go through all the

1794
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,640
details here we might have time in the

1795
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:55,200
dot one and two but

1796
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,039
there uh

1797
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:59,200
benny is going to focus on hippolyto and

1798
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,640
kirchoff's

1799
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,799
specific reply to the intransitivity

1800
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:03,920
argument

1801
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,599
that is centering the distinction

1802
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:07,440
between the

1803
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,520
directed acyclic graphs

1804
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:13,680
and directed cyclic graphs

1805
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,960
benny is going to argue

1806
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,359
that these two kinds of statistical

1807
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:22,640
models do different things

1808
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,960
it turns out they actually also map onto

1809
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,240
the difference between functional and

1810
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:27,839
effective connectivity

1811
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:30,559
and so applying one sort of the model

1812
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:33,440
dag or the cyclic model in a specific

1813
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,520
situation is a matter of practice

1814
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:36,400
practical

1815
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,640
exigency and methodological

1816
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,240
consideration as well as the goals in

1817
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,720
the interest of the modeler so it's like

1818
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:46,400
we're 100 miles down choosing a model

1819
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,839
free freeway

1820
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:49,920
and then whether you take this slight

1821
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,440
difference between

1822
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,599
one topology of graphical model that's

1823
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:56,480
quantitative versus a different topology

1824
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:00,160
maybe that is not going to be super

1825
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,799
philosophically impactful because we

1826
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:05,680
already have taken like the big pill

1827
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:08,000
which was making a scientific model or

1828
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,119
making a graphical quantitative model

1829
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:11,360
um

1830
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:12,559
[Music]

1831
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:15,839
there's a citation to the fristin visa

1832
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:18,880
hobson 2020 paper

1833
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,839
that also describes like where the

1834
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:24,319
cyclic versus acyclic are

1835
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:26,000
uh preferable

1836
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,680
and

1837
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:30,799
uh benny recaps and just basically to

1838
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:32,559
summarize there is no universal reason

1839
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:35,839
for extolling dags over dcms

1840
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:37,280
because the focus on functional

1841
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:40,240
connectivity or effective connectivity

1842
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,640
is a matter of explanatory predictive

1843
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,480
goals and interests

1844
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,680
so

1845
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,280
scientists are using different kinds of

1846
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,480
models

1847
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:51,599
and so maybe we should pull back to

1848
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:54,720
scientists use models

1849
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,039
and think about the implications of that

1850
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:58,880
rather than try to

1851
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,520
finesse out some philosophical

1852
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:04,720
implications from the very specific kind

1853
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:08,240
of last mile modeling choices

1854
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,680
dcms

1855
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:13,280
can do certain things whereas dags can

1856
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,760
do other things

1857
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,200
which one of these approaches can be

1858
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,520
used to analyze data in the context of

1859
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,319
the fep we're going to discuss it

1860
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:25,359
in 35.1

1861
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:27,440
benny says i do not think hipolito and

1862
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,920
kirichoff 2019 are bound to concede a

1863
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,559
non-realist reading of dcm

1864
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:34,720
rather the critique

1865
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,799
of how h and k compute the

1866
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:38,880
intransitivity argument is pointed at

1867
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,440
their unjustified partiality towards

1868
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,039
dcms

1869
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:43,920
so

1870
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:47,119
it's like if you could just scapegoat

1871
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:48,160
the

1872
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,520
dag

1873
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:52,079
then the dcm is the savior

1874
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:54,559
but if both of them are just types of

1875
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:56,160
scientific models that are chosen

1876
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,480
situationally operationally as thriston

1877
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:01,359
described then

1878
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:03,039
there is no

1879
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:05,760
savior model coming in to save the day

1880
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,559
dcms are formal devices

1881
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:10,880
and then there's a citation to the

1882
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,680
emperor's new markov blankets with yella

1883
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:14,799
at all

1884
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:16,960
live stream number 20.

1885
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,479
and so drawing attention to the

1886
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:20,399
difference between dags and dcms which

1887
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:22,080
are complementary modeling tools as we

1888
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,000
discussed earlier they're defined as

1889
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,439
complementary

1890
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:27,279
could not confuse the intransitivity

1891
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:29,040
argument so

1892
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,719
if we have already committed

1893
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:32,640
to the instrumental perspective

1894
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:34,080
so we're talking about our model not

1895
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,439
about the world

1896
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:36,319
then

1897
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:37,520
the difference between different

1898
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,359
modeling approaches is purely

1899
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:42,238
situational or operational

1900
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:43,279
and so

1901
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:45,920
all scientific models have roughly

1902
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,238
similar philosophical grounding or

1903
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:50,640
they're part of a broad category

1904
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,640
with respect to this intransitivity

1905
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:55,040
argument

1906
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:56,960
nice

1907
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:59,279
philosophy and

1908
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:02,480
interesting points

1909
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:03,679
okay

1910
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:05,600
column in the storm

1911
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,158
the indispensability of modularity and

1912
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:10,080
the indispensability of scientific

1913
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,839
models oh i wonder if there's going to

1914
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:13,920
be like a parallelism between

1915
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,799
models and modularity and here's like a

1916
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:18,238
person

1917
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:20,640
in their markov bubble

1918
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,279
in the storm

1919
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,759
this section focuses on a realist

1920
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:27,920
interpretation of dcm in terms of

1921
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,560
dynamical causal models

1922
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:31,600
so

1923
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,520
even instrumentalists

1924
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:35,439
can

1925
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:36,880
bat both ways

1926
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,040
you know we're not obliged to never talk

1927
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,960
about stances that in one certain

1928
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,439
situation we didn't prefer it's just

1929
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:44,719
really

1930
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:46,399
wide-ranging

1931
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:48,319
intellectual exploration that's being

1932
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:50,399
characterized here

1933
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:52,960
and here benny does play on a little bit

1934
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:56,400
of a acronym play which is that dcm

1935
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,239
applies to dynamic causal modeling as

1936
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:00,880
well as directed cyclic modeling

1937
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:03,280
so cyclic graphs or the dynamic causal

1938
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,880
graph

1939
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,719
and

1940
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:08,880
he'll argue through an example that

1941
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,719
we're going to discuss not today with

1942
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:12,159
alice and bob

1943
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:14,800
he argues that the modularity in the

1944
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,560
context of dcm

1945
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:19,199
it's not as strong as the fodorian

1946
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:22,159
isolationist concept but

1947
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:24,960
in interesting and important ways

1948
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:28,239
it's going to be enough

1949
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,320
and so a moderate form of modularity is

1950
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,480
retained

1951
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,400
and uh

1952
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,080
hippolyto and kirchoff argue that this

1953
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,080
weakened notion of modularity is

1954
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,640
explanatory vacuous it's empty and there

1955
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:45,280
would be no reason for keeping it

1956
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:46,400
and that's

1957
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,960
the bone of contention

1958
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:51,199
he's going to dissent

1959
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:53,040
and say that the benefit of this modest

1960
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,120
notion of modularity is

1961
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,480
remarkable

1962
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:57,199
so

1963
01:10:57,199 --> 01:11:00,080
that's the claim any comments on section

1964
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,320
seven

1965
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:03,440
what would happen if we couldn't

1966
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:06,080
categorize

1967
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,360
then it would be impossible to give a

1968
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:16,400
categorical response to that question

1969
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,199
and

1970
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:18,960
and a lot more right like that that's

1971
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,560
basically what this comes down to

1972
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,080
doesn't mean that things aren't

1973
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:25,760
arbitrary and not necessarily

1974
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:28,080
put into into the correct silos but but

1975
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,760
there is a great benefit i don't think

1976
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,719
it's dispensable our our capacity to

1977
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:35,760
categorize doesn't mean we always

1978
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,040
are

1979
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:40,320
obliged to do it but when we do do it is

1980
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:41,760
there a benefit

1981
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,159
yes is there a cost

1982
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:45,600
maybe

1983
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,080
but if we if we took it away

1984
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,000
what would what would then what would

1985
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,400
the world look like then

1986
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,400
a triangle is a triangle as a triangle

1987
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,600
right

1988
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:59,360
there would be no specificity then

1989
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,320
interesting we'll talk more about

1990
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:06,159
categorization models and the parable of

1991
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:09,840
alice and bob yeah section eight

1992
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:13,600
still knitting markov blankets

1993
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,040
so um

1994
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,800
here

1995
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,400
they return

1996
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,280
to

1997
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:21,440
this idea of the vertical

1998
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:24,800
insulation and the horizontal insulation

1999
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,080
like there's encapsulation laterally

2000
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,920
collective behavior and then

2001
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:32,480
encapsulation like an onion like a

2002
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,560
multi-scale system

2003
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:35,600
so

2004
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,679
that's very interesting and this is also

2005
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:39,520
where we get to this point about the

2006
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:43,360
scale-free or skill-friendly nature of

2007
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,440
markov blankets

2008
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,280
um

2009
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,920
the main reason that h and k resist this

2010
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,040
argument

2011
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:53,280
about the markov blankets

2012
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,040
is based on the fact that the

2013
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,440
regimentation of states into markov

2014
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,040
blankets is scale free

2015
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:02,000
so it can range across scales maybe even

2016
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,800
that is already scale friendly

2017
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:05,600
um

2018
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,280
because markow blankets are scale free

2019
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:09,679
they do not imply insulation and thus

2020
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:11,760
the modularity thesis does not receive

2021
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,320
support from them

2022
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,679
and so

2023
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:17,520
benny concedes yeah it's true mark-out

2024
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,600
blankets can be applied to basically a

2025
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,760
wide range of phenomena however this is

2026
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,760
overlooking a subtle point

2027
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,360
markov blankets

2028
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:27,679
in the abstraction in principle are

2029
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:29,600
scale-free there's no inherent

2030
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,600
constraint on their size and scope

2031
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,239
linear models are inherently

2032
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:35,920
a priori scale-free it could be

2033
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:39,520
centimeters versus the gdp it could be

2034
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,840
astronomical units versus temperature

2035
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:44,320
like it doesn't have a tie-in to a

2036
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:47,040
certain spatial temporal scale or any

2037
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,120
feature for a linear model or for a

2038
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,480
markov blanket

2039
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,320
however

2040
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:55,199
q dean from stage left or you know

2041
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:57,120
running in from the audience

2042
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,600
their application or imputation

2043
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,520
to various target systems will impose a

2044
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,080
definite scale on markov blankets to

2045
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,000
make a long story short

2046
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,480
in the context of their application

2047
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:09,679
under fep

2048
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:12,960
not in the context of fep

2049
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,800
markov blankets are not necessarily

2050
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:17,280
scale-free mathematical models because

2051
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,360
they're being used in models

2052
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,520
so even though the formal tools could be

2053
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:22,880
scale-free

2054
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:25,120
application mandates calibrating to a

2055
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,800
certain scale

2056
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:29,679
if that's the case and

2057
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:31,760
it seems like it is

2058
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:32,719
then

2059
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:34,239
counter arguments based upon the

2060
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:36,480
scale-free nature of markov blankets

2061
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,360
could not undermine arguments from

2062
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,920
markovian formalisms soundly so this is

2063
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:45,520
really nicely framed and placed

2064
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,280
in space and time dean what do you think

2065
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:49,440
about that

2066
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:52,560
well i'm still as i said i i did first

2067
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:54,239
of all i want to

2068
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:56,560
i want to make sure to disclaim this i

2069
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,800
never saw this paper until three days

2070
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,400
ago four days ago

2071
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:01,280
so

2072
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:04,800
my guess my what my wag about scale

2073
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,880
friendly and and sort of

2074
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,320
whether that was something we should

2075
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,800
consider it was nice to read this and

2076
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,719
have somebody else go maybe it's

2077
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:14,480
something we should consider i'm going

2078
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:15,920
to leave it at that because i don't know

2079
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:17,679
if somebody's going to come along and

2080
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:20,000
disprove that and and you know because

2081
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,199
if that's

2082
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:25,280
if it's if it's falsifiable that um

2083
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:27,760
calibrating doesn't matter and and

2084
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,000
categorizing doesn't matter i'm open to

2085
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,520
hearing that too

2086
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,360
but in the meantime i think it's

2087
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:36,239
something that if we don't

2088
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:37,760
recognize the difference between the

2089
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,199
abstraction

2090
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:40,560
and

2091
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:41,520
that

2092
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,520
thing that we're focusing on right now

2093
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:44,880
we can

2094
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:47,520
get lost in the idea that a triangle is

2095
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,120
a triangle is a triangle and nothing

2096
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:52,360
else matters

2097
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:54,800
blue anything you want to add on this

2098
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,640
section

2099
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:59,120
yeah i mean i really think that um

2100
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,480
i mean it just

2101
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,320
hits the nail on the head like we're the

2102
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:03,440
ones

2103
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:05,120
like putting the markov blanket on

2104
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,560
something and so like just because

2105
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,080
something can be

2106
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:10,640
you know modeled using a markov blanket

2107
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,080
doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't

2108
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:14,000
scale and and like

2109
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,239
things don't mark off blanket themselves

2110
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:18,080
right like so i mean even like my layer

2111
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:20,159
of skin like cells are popping off and

2112
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:21,920
new cells are adding on all the time and

2113
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,440
so like there's

2114
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:26,000
it's not a hard boundary it's not a

2115
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,480
solid boundary it's very fluid like what

2116
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:31,120
goes in and out of a markov blanket so i

2117
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,120
think like our imputation of a markov

2118
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,360
blanket on a system i mean yeah they're

2119
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,760
scale free means you can impute them on

2120
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,239
any system at any scale

2121
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:43,120
so so maybe scale friendly is is

2122
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:45,040
um the way to go but it's not like the

2123
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:47,600
blanket itself is scale free i mean all

2124
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,080
blankets are are composed of stitches

2125
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:52,000
right like so are you using big stitches

2126
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,760
or little stitches or like different

2127
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,760
layers of cloth or or what so i don't

2128
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,000
know it's it's uh i don't know i think

2129
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:58,960
it really

2130
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:01,280
drives it home

2131
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:02,719
yeah

2132
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:04,880
and uh the paper

2133
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:05,760
was

2134
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,440
i mean we can double check but it's from

2135
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:08,560
december

2136
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,640
21 so

2137
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,719
we have proof of live stream dean that

2138
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:15,120
you know

2139
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:16,480
you were there

2140
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:17,920
um

2141
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:19,440
can i just say one last because i

2142
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,360
completely agree with with what blue

2143
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,040
just said i was i was never of an

2144
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,199
opinion that that markov blanket isn't

2145
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:27,440
scale free of course it is

2146
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,440
and it's kind of like saying they're

2147
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:32,000
subject matter experts of course there

2148
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,120
are

2149
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:35,199
but as we had in the in the conversation

2150
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:37,520
with dr fristen

2151
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,280
you could also say that there's a

2152
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:42,080
prediction matter expert

2153
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:44,000
like all i'm asking is for people to

2154
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,159
consider that there could be both

2155
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:47,760
and they could be running in parallel

2156
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,840
that's i wasn't trying to push back in

2157
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:52,800
the sense that you know people are wrong

2158
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,800
what i was saying is what what else

2159
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,640
could we include to phil

2160
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,800
fill in the wholeness of what is

2161
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,800
happening here that's all i was

2162
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:04,560
trying to point out and i and again it

2163
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,880
we could take active inference and and

2164
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,520
focus it completely on the minimizing of

2165
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:10,960
free energy and getting what we're

2166
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,199
attending to or we can talk about the

2167
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:15,920
availability piece and what

2168
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:18,000
for example when we're having new people

2169
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,199
on board

2170
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:22,560
to our lab how how we make that that

2171
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:25,280
entry point so

2172
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:28,239
so relationship based we could do that

2173
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:29,520
we could make

2174
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,520
for them we could make them prediction

2175
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:33,600
that matter experts before they even

2176
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,440
realize it in themselves now whether we

2177
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:38,000
do that or not it's not up to me but we

2178
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,840
could so that's what i was trying to

2179
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,600
bring up and that's what i like about

2180
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,679
this paper

2181
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:44,640
great

2182
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:47,679
last section last content slide isn't it

2183
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:49,360
something they say like if the newspaper

2184
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:50,480
article

2185
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,960
ends with a question mark i forget which

2186
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,520
one is it the it's always yes or it's

2187
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:57,760
always no but

2188
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:00,719
the footsteps die out forever

2189
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:03,440
so this is a summary in the ninth

2190
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:05,839
section

2191
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
benny challenges the main points of

2192
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,320
hippolito and kirchoff

2193
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:12,239
hippolyta and kirchoff confuded the

2194
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:14,000
modularity thesis

2195
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,400
so benny is salvaging the modularity

2196
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,640
thesis from the pincer attack of

2197
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,719
hippolito and kirchoff

2198
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:22,480
to support the argumentation of the

2199
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:23,440
paper

2200
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:26,239
benny draws upon the indispensability of

2201
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:28,800
a model-based conception of modularity

2202
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,719
that's where that kind of science and

2203
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:33,280
society angle and philosophy angle came

2204
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,520
into play

2205
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:38,320
benny argues that dags and dcms are

2206
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,159
complementary models

2207
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:42,159
and the choice between them is

2208
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:44,560
operational it's pragmatic

2209
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:46,400
it's not

2210
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:49,120
um metaphysical per se

2211
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,600
so modeling is situational we can take a

2212
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,360
deflationary approach

2213
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:56,560
even to how we think about science

2214
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,719
benny argues that when

2215
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:01,360
we think about dynamic causal modeling

2216
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:02,840
there is

2217
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,880
modularity because of how the

2218
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:07,120
statistical model pulls out differential

2219
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:09,840
coupling between brain areas

2220
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,440
and that's not a statement about the

2221
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:13,920
brains the statement about the model

2222
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,600
benny also challenges

2223
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:18,639
hippolito and kirchhoff's answer to the

2224
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:22,000
argument from the markovian formalism

2225
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,920
by showing that although these models

2226
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,600
are in principle scale free in order to

2227
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,320
represent any specific target system

2228
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,600
they have to be associated with

2229
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:32,400
interpretations that do give definite

2230
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:35,040
scales so the markov blanket formalism

2231
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:37,520
is conceptually skill-free but any

2232
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,440
realization application is scale

2233
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:42,400
specific thus skill friendly tickles 21

2234
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:44,960
at best

2235
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:47,520
personal communication

2236
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:50,159
already and basically we're exciting the

2237
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:52,960
live stream soon yeah

2238
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,960
benny closes with just saying it doesn't

2239
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,880
undermine the claims

2240
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:58,880
and this isn't like a radical pro

2241
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,960
pro-modular thesis

2242
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:03,440
it's not the isolation of brain regions

2243
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:04,960
and they're each like virtual machines

2244
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,120
that are totally separated

2245
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,040
the only point that comes to light by

2246
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:11,440
our enterprise in this paper

2247
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:14,480
is that the debate over modularity needs

2248
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:16,239
to take the role of scientific models

2249
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:18,719
into account and a model relative

2250
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:20,960
conception of modularity cannot be waved

2251
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,000
away

2252
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,520
easily

2253
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:24,320
so

2254
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:27,199
it is a great service and an interesting

2255
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:30,560
paper in form and function

2256
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,080
we have an empty slide for the

2257
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:34,400
implications and questions we have the

2258
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:37,520
early slide where with um

2259
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:39,199
what we're going to discuss

2260
01:21:39,199 --> 01:21:43,040
in 35.1 and 35.2

2261
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,080
and

2262
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:46,960
it was an awesome discussion so

2263
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:49,440
if you have any final comments now would

2264
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:52,480
be a good time

2265
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,480
do you think that um

2266
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,560
when you get people who've worked

2267
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:01,199
together as this author and the person

2268
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:03,120
and the two people that he was kind of

2269
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:04,880
pushing back against

2270
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:06,400
do you think when they take it into this

2271
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,920
kind of a formal setting of paper

2272
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,920
writing that that changes their

2273
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:11,440
relationship

2274
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:13,040
fundamentally

2275
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:15,280
that's one i mean i i could i suppose we

2276
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:17,600
could only ask the authors themselves

2277
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,159
but does it have to be a debate

2278
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:22,000
necessarily does it have to be drama

2279
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,400
necessarily or is there is there kind of

2280
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,320
a moving forward hand-in-hand part to

2281
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,920
this i'm not

2282
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:30,239
seeing

2283
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:33,360
it's a really interesting question i'm

2284
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:34,320
sure

2285
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:35,679
scientists and

2286
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:36,960
all kinds of different people are going

2287
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:39,280
to have different answers but

2288
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:41,679
i think about the papers

2289
01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:44,320
in their exact phrasing as like

2290
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:45,600
pheromones

2291
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,360
digital stigma g in the literature

2292
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,679
corpus and then the person is like the

2293
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:52,320
nest mate who is weaving on so any

2294
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:54,560
artifact is going to be made by that

2295
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:57,520
person in the past so i could be like

2296
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:58,800
talking to blue

2297
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:01,360
and it's like oh yeah you know knight

2298
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:03,280
2018 said this

2299
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:04,159
or

2300
01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:06,320
you know but you just said this but but

2301
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:07,280
didn't

2302
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:09,040
night 2009

2303
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,080
say this

2304
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:12,800
it's not a contradiction

2305
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,440
it's just like the trajectory and the

2306
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,760
pheromone deposition of

2307
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:20,639
active and complex entities and so i

2308
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:23,360
think that that i hope is the best of

2309
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:26,159
both worlds which is we can humanize

2310
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:29,040
kirchoff and hippolyto and benny and

2311
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:31,679
all the humans involved and take like a

2312
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:35,760
compassionate and even friendly

2313
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,040
um tack

2314
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:40,159
while also being very scrutinizing

2315
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:42,639
of the specifics of the knowledge

2316
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:45,520
artifacts that people leave because a

2317
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,679
lot of times there is like a gray zone

2318
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:49,440
where it'll say something in text but

2319
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:51,360
then oh if you're in the club then you

2320
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:52,800
know that they actually meant something

2321
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,480
else or you got to read between the

2322
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,159
lines with the methods or you have to

2323
01:23:56,159 --> 01:23:57,199
read between the lines with the

2324
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:58,480
citations

2325
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:59,600
and um

2326
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:02,159
that's kind of a conflation of the

2327
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:04,320
person and the argument

2328
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:05,760
like when people give an overly

2329
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,600
charitable reading or even try to

2330
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,440
insinuate things that weren't there in

2331
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:11,679
the initial text because they want to

2332
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:13,760
uphold their legend

2333
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:15,120
of person

2334
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:17,120
and rather we can just kind of

2335
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:20,480
separate those two in how we model

2336
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:23,520
the generative process and the generated

2337
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,360
product

2338
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:26,719
i just think that there's so much you

2339
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:29,120
can learn when you're wrong

2340
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:30,239
and that doesn't mean you want to be a

2341
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:32,239
serial mistake maker but i don't think

2342
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:33,920
anybody that's publishing is looking to

2343
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,360
do that either

2344
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:36,880
but if you're comfortable if you're

2345
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,560
actually comfortable with putting wrong

2346
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:40,159
answers out there

2347
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:42,159
and having put people kind of prove that

2348
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:43,679
you're wrong but you're comfortable with

2349
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:44,480
that

2350
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,239
i think that makes a huge

2351
01:24:46,239 --> 01:24:47,920
a huge difference at least in terms of

2352
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:50,239
the culture that you're participating in

2353
01:24:50,239 --> 01:24:52,320
it's a lot safer if you can if you can

2354
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,679
throw stuff out

2355
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:55,760
at in in four weeks or five weeks time

2356
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:57,040
somebody can say

2357
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,960
no dean you were wrong we got to take

2358
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,800
that citation down

2359
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,400
i wouldn't take it down i would leave it

2360
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,639
up i would simply say no in that moment

2361
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:06,880
i i thought it was right and now

2362
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:10,560
i now i've updated my generative model

2363
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:12,880
yeah it's like showing your work like

2364
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:15,360
here's what i knew at this time and this

2365
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,600

then that updates

2372
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:29,760
the next round of pheromone deposition

2373
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:34,080
exactly blue any last comments

2374
01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:36,880

it's the two architectures 2022 second

2376
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:41,760
year of active lab

2377
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,679
two two two two two two two is coming up

2378
