"Unknown","00;00;22;27","00;00;53;26","Hello and welcome, everyone. It is January 12th, 2022 We are here in Acton, five live stream number 35.2 discussing the paper, a tale of two architectures free energy. Its models and modularity. Welcome to the Acton flap. We are an online participatory lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference You can find more information on this slide. This is a recorded in an archived live stream."
"Unknown","00;00;54;03","00;01;28;08","So please provide us with feedback so that we can improve our work If you're watching live, feel free to write questions in the live chat. If you're watching in replay, you can also add comments. All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and will be following good video etiquette for livestreams. All of our activities in the lab are participatory, so if you would like to contribute or get involved, go to Active Inference Dawg and see what is there today in Livestream 35.2."
"Unknown","00;01;28;08","00;01;54;09","We're going to be having our third discussion continuing on the paper. A Tale of two Architectures for Energy Its Models and Modularity. Written by Majid Bani, who we're really appreciative, is joining us today to talk and see where it goes. So we'll get to the introduction in a second, but basically we're going to just pick up on some of the threads that we opened in earlier discussions."
"Unknown","00;01;54;10","00;02;17;08","We have a few specific things written down, and I'm sure we'll go many different ways with people joining and ideas coming up and questions and the live chat and all of that. So we can kind of go any which way. But we'll just start with the introduction and warmup so we can each say hello, maybe blue, and I can just say what we're excited about for the dot too."
"Unknown","00;02;17;20","00;02;48;00","And then Majid, it'd be awesome to hear any context for the paper. So I'm Daniel, I'm a researcher in California, and I didn't expect the rabbit duck to appear and dot one, but I'm looking forward to continuing that and seeing how is this drawing like a scientific model? And then what does that philosophical or conceptual paradox or ambiguity say about scientific modeling?"
"Unknown","00;02;48;15","00;03;27;08","So blue and blue. I'm a researcher in New Mexico and I'm excited to probe deeper into the relationship between the agents and their environment and also the transitivity argument and modularity and how those kind of all fit together excellent judges you are muted and then please continue so. Hello? You can't hear me? No, it's so I'm Magid. I'm an assistant professor of philosophy at MIT."
"Unknown","00;03;27;08","00;03;51;05","To me, those technical university and I'm obsessed with models and instructors across science and perception and mind, and this is what it's for one that I'm engaged with this issue of model applying, model based approach to science, to free energy principle and predictive coding. And I'm very happy to be here thank you very much for inviting me. Great."
"Unknown","00;03;51;08","00;04;38;15","Well, maybe just for like background and context, what brought you to write this specific paper, like recognizing modularity as an important topic? And where does this fit into some of your other threads related to FFP and model based science? Oh, well, well, that's a very good question. I'm not quite sure why. So one reason for focusing on modularity in this paper is that most probably it has some sort of psychological explanation because it started to learn about philosophy of mind and philosophy of cognitive science by reading this language of thought."
"Unknown","00;04;38;15","00;05;05;21","And I think that even in the earlier stages, when I was when people were studying there, no one was thinking that the brain is actually a syntactical engine. No one was thinking that if you open up a brain or a cognitive system, you actually find things that are inside the brain in terms of propositional like entities, language like entities or syntactical engines or anything of that sort."
"Unknown","00;05;05;21","00;05;51;12","But at the same time, people were believing that that perspective on how the brain works have some sort of explanatory gain. There is something that we can learn by taking that perspective of the brain and collective system. Well, I think that the general idea behind beyond behind applying this model based approach to sciences is that it is the explanatory interest explanatory as well as practical interests of the model are of the people who are engaged with scientific enterprise that provides the handle on the target system, the things that we try to explore and understand and."
"Unknown","00;05;53;00","00;06;42;21","Well, I think that there I was reading the Target paper by, by himself and he pulled it of both of what what struck me as the they were taking it very much for granted through, of course, through very well article eight scientific and philosophical arguments that there is no such modularity inside the brain or cognitive system. And I just wanted to bring the point to attention that it would be a matter of, as I said earlier, practical and explanatory goals and interests of the model or whether there is modularity there or not."
"Unknown","00;06;42;21","00;07;32;00","So one thing that's I I'm going to emphasize underline in this session is that it doesn't need to lead. I mean, this model relativity doesn't need to lead to doing right on serialism about theories of brain and cognitive system. I mean, model relativity is not all about taking an unrealistic attitude toward brain science, but at the same time, so the whole goal, the whole project is to end up with some sort of subtler perspective on scientific realities of a world collective science and, and the brain science thank you for the context."
"Unknown","00;07;32;00","00;08;01;04","Welcome. Dean, if you'd like to say hello and if you have any opening shots to fire I don't really open shots fired. My name's Dean and the Calgary. I'm sorry for coming in late, but my link was sending me off into another corner of the universe. So glad I'm here. Thanks for. Thanks for being here, Majid. Really glad that you're here to talk about this paper."
"Unknown","00;08;01;09","00;08;06;01","I found a paper. Fantastic. Pleasure's all mine."
"Unknown","00;08;09;22","00;08;45;14","So modularity. I mean, it's in the title, modularity models, and then the free energy and then the Tale of two architectures, which was a little bit of a reference towards the tale of two densities. Another act of paper. So just how would you reframe the argument of Ippolito and Kirchhoff Majid, and where do you think? Like in 22?"
"Unknown","00;08;45;29","00;09;26;28","What can we say now that we couldn't have said in 2019 or. Well, what? Well, I do not think that we could say anything more than we were saying in 2019, because all of the actual stuff was there I think that this is something, this called philosophy, because no information has been added. As a matter of fact they just elaborated on the information that was there in terms of the argument from inter sensitivity and all of the discussion of causal modeling and dynamical modeling and all that."
"Unknown","00;09;26;28","00;10;03;28","So I don't think that any actual information has been that the only thing that has been elaborated on was the emphasis on the rule of the modularity, which is that if we insist on so as I was watching this in the previous discussion of of the same paper in Activity France Lab and I was Deane's discussion of the, in terms of the police method for the discussion of the perspective of the observer."
"Unknown","00;10;03;28","00;10;27;07","The observer that is watching both Bob and all this interested me very much. So if I want to rephrase the discussion of the model or in terms of information theory, because as we start to see this in terms of the observable, I think I think that the point is that technical the point is rather philosophical than scientific or formal in terms of information theory."
"Unknown","00;10;27;07","00;11;15;09","So no actual information has been added during these two years only. And I think that this approach is gaining momentum, this emphasis on the rule of modeler or interpreter is drawing even more. This is leading to even more discussions in the free energy principle literature I totally agree with that point. And then Bernardine, it made me think of Quantum and how the double slit experiment kind of kicking and screaming has taken 100 years in that one limited setting to consider the role of the observer, even though it's a really complex thing and we won't go into it."
"Unknown","00;11;15;09","00;11;58;07","But we'll talk about Quantum and FFP in a few weeks. But that was like the anomaly that signaled, yeah, you need to take the observer into account as part of the measuring apparatus. Very quantitative, empirical observation that there was a non-negotiable or irreducible role of the observer. And then on the qualitative side, the relational insight that scientists are human and science is a human activity, and that was not driven on empirical observations of wave and particle on a screen like the twin split was."
"Unknown","00;11;58;17","00;12;49;11","But it was just a sort of low level philosophical argument that there isn't a a fungible role for the observer or the modeler. And so it is very interesting to see how that has started to catch on. And then how does that change the way we do science when that is taken as like a starting point that there is an observer modeling the system so like that was in this diagram when we started with just talking about like the functional and the effective connectivity and then the mechanism, which is kind of not either those and then it wasn't until the very end when we're like, oh, but it's the scientist projecting in to this whole"
"Unknown","00;12;49;11","00;13;16;07","model that's another level of how we think about it. We can't just like all be sitting around just talking about Bob and Alice, but then now there's going to be us with multiple perspectives, looking at the scientists, taking multiple perspectives on Bob and Alice. So are we stuck in this sort of subjective infinite regress? How are we going to salvage cognitive realism?"
"Unknown","00;13;23;00","00;13;31;04","Are you asking me anyone or but if you have any thoughts, definitely go for it."
"Unknown","00;13;37;10","00;14;11;10","I have some ideas. What I, I mean, I prefer other how about your Dean and then Majid and Blue if you want to. Well, one of the things Majid, that I that I took away from reading your paper was this is this is funny, because typically when I when I pick something up, it's pretty foreign to me. It starts out being way on the other side of a mark blanket."
"Unknown","00;14;11;26","00;14;43;28","And then I guess I somehow I'm able to sort of get inside of it and relate it back to the things that I know. And eventually I get it a bit of a grip on it. And then next thing you know, there's four duck rabbits spinning madly out of control on a, on a on a gradient. But one of the things that I took away from this was and I think I mentioned it in the in the point one is, is are you 9:00 when we're taking these slices in time and we're building these models."
"Unknown","00;14;44;17","00;15;32;07","My question was what are the specifics of that? I mean, if if we take in half an hour, I image I know the that the machine itself that's taking those slices of time isn't necessarily conscious but it is carrying out some sort of an instantiation exercise. And so one of the things I wanted to kind of talk to you a little bit about not necessarily on a quantum level, but one of the sections of your paper, which was really, really influential to me, was a section on a golden thread I wanted to I was hoping that perhaps within that idea of partitioning, whether it's through Quanta Quantum methodology or Quantum series or whatever, if you"
"Unknown","00;15;32;07","00;15;57;10","could maybe talk a little bit about that, that idea of what you meant by a golden thread, not just metaphorically, but maybe materially and maybe influentially, if there is such a word, because that part of it really matter to me. And it actually got me writing a whole set of sub notes based on that section. So maybe, maybe you could expand on that a little bit because I think there's a lot there."
"Unknown","00;15;58;27","00;16;32;01","Thanks, Steve, for the great question. So yes, we'd love to learn more about the Golden Thread unmute and then continue to that. So very well so if I may do a Beatle advertisement, I have been discussing this specifically. Is this a specific issue, this dog rabbit thing in the paper which is published in the Philosophy Journal, it is named Cognitive Penetration and Cognitive Realism."
"Unknown","00;16;32;01","00;17;04;05","It is published in a in epistemic. It relates this issue to the issue of relatedness in philosophy of science, forms of Thomas schooling and all that. The so I can say, well, what I say here. So I'm also interested in the relation between Fipp and quantum theory. And I'm working on a project that relates to cubism in as one of the significant interpretations of quantum mechanics."
"Unknown","00;17;04;05","00;17;38;14","But in this context, I cannot. So the paper is not directly related or even indirectly to quantum mechanics and the rule of observer. I rather take some sort of so if I want to assess it in more technical terms, I would use Shannon's theory of information to, to articulate the role of the observer a bit clearer. So will the question, if I understand it correctly, what happens when the picture rotates?"
"Unknown","00;17;38;14","00;18;18;18","And there is a scanning, it's some sort of a scanning is taking place whether so our correct to understand that your question is about what happens when there is a rotation, but there is no observer to want to work on. So there is a dog or a rabbit, right? Is it and the whole business of so so when we're trying to encapsulate something and you you spoke clearly in the paper about we don't necessarily have to see this as a as a hard and fast edges kind of thing."
"Unknown","00;18;18;18","00;18;44;27","We can kind of appreciate that there's a certain amount of fuzziness that's actually enabling our conversation. And so that because the lines aren't abrupt and and when we do decide to put a mark or a blanket around something, it's us choosing to do that at a certain scale with a certain amount of specificity and Stephen Szilard in the one talked about, so what, what is available at a me.So scale."
"Unknown","00;18;45;12","00;19;20;05","So that golden thread business that what do we last SU what is that fMRI actually trying to entail? That's what I was hoping to maybe tease out for us a little bit. But so I can't be all clear about that because being a philosopher, I'm a bit naive about neuroimaging and that sort of stuff. But as some sort of general insights and trivial insight from philosophy of science, I would say that it would depend on what we are trying to trace by using a film or any other observational device or measurement."
"Unknown","00;19;20;05","00;19;45;10","So the fact that we could use this measurement devices in a number of ways and by by devices I do only refer to actual devices, but also towards the devices such as mark of blankets and that sort of stuff. So and applying that to different scales and different different levels doesn't need to mean that there is no objective fact of the matter to be represented by these devices."
"Unknown","00;19;45;11","00;20;21;19","So I might be able to use different theoretical mathematical devices to measure the space of my room. I may be able to use, for example, kilometers. I or I may be able to use with mobiles or something of that sort. And this doesn't mean that there is no effective method to be to be measure. After all, we can see this picture in terms of either rabbits or a dog, but not as a dog or a call for example."
"Unknown","00;20;22;00","00;20;45;14","And whether we see, says, the dog or a rabbit again is influenced. But so I would say this to some extent it will depend on the origin of vagueness of the picture, to what extent the subjectivity, to what extent can affect the perception. What we see is a matter of the target system itself, the properties of the target system itself."
"Unknown","00;20;45;15","00;21;10;01","So I mean, no matter how hard we try, we could hardly be able to see this dog or rabbit as a call or a dog or something else. But at the same time, to some extent, especially when the target system allows for some vague vagueness to some extent or presuppositions or goals and intentions being around the actual situation."
"Unknown","00;21;10;01","00;21;35;22","And so there is some sort of constrained or moderate amount of theory laid in this, to use a jargon by philosophy. Philosophers are saying this is taking place here, but it doesn't mean that there is no I mean it doesn't need to sweep the targets of all of its objective features."
"Unknown","00;21;38;17","00;22;04;28","I said, I'm still not sure whether I could address your worry curricula because I couldn't see the point about the ephemeral and neuro imaging techniques. So but all I was I guess I'm kind of I'm agreeing with the argument that you're putting forward, which is that any time we make an observation and then we draw up some kind of a representation, we call that a model."
"Unknown","00;22;05;14","00;22;29;00","Even in those even in those efforts, to try to be precise, we have to leave open a little bit of latitude, a little bit of wiggle room, because as you pointed out, you can have a dynamic causal model. And to get into an argument of whether or not that's the appropriate model, it should be in a cyclic one for example, that was what you were saying."
"Unknown","00;22;29;07","00;23;00;23","And that kind of gets you going down a path of arguing about which is the right tool as opposed to saying do tools leverage? Right. I think that's what maybe that's what I was reading into, what you were trying to say. That's all thanks, Dean Blue and then Majid. So I think this kind of goes into what Dean was saying about skill friendly versus skill free."
"Unknown","00;23;01;04","00;23;48;20","And so like with a Markov blanket and with like this, you know, the notation of a module, whether it's vertical or horizontal or horizontal or a vertical module, you know, we impute the Markov blanket on whatever scale we're trying to separate conditionally. So I just wanted to to bring that point back in. And also this idea of maybe like in incomplete partitioning so I mean, if there was a complete partition around each module, there would be like no ability to transfer information from module to module and in the brain."
"Unknown","00;23;48;20","00;24;15;03","I mean, we do know that that definitely some of the pieces have to communicate to make the entire brain or it wouldn't be considered an organ. You know, we wouldn't be able to markup it. You know, there's this idea of nested markup linkage. So I don't know about this information encapsulation or information leaking. This magilla would be nice if you maybe kind of unpacked that a little bit more for us."
"Unknown","00;24;17;04","00;25;05;00","Yes. The information encapsulation topic so the thing is this. I can't see for some reason I can't see you in this picture and I have to shift to the YouTube page in order to see if you can maybe go to on the bottom bar toggle tile view. There's like, well, I use that, but it's all right. It's for some reason I can see that there are pages of people, but I cannot just see your faces because it shows the initial the and the and B, it may have to do with what countries were all in, which is totally fine."
"Unknown","00;25;05;04","00;25;46;09","Or at least we have audio. Let me try it once more. Well, well, yes. At least we have all of you. So, so well, information encapsulation study expert try to explain this in terms of that. But all this metaphor great yeah. Information encapsulation as applied to the Bob Ellis parable or a gerbil. So for one thing this information encapsulation is one of the features of Jerry Ford or the original statement of the tissue."
"Unknown","00;25;46;09","00;26;16;25","So modularity and so which which is quite flexible. A flexible test is had models. So for me in the way that I see that model relativity entails this kind of modularity information encapsulation because in order to have model again, it can be assessed in terms of brackets and whether the Markov blankets are embodied or nested or not is itself another issue."
"Unknown","00;26;16;25","00;26;53;06","But the very fact that we can use Markov blanket or Markov models if indicates that we we are able to set some sort of in the barrier of conditional independence between internal and external spaces. So in order to state this very rigid principle three so there's interpret these spaces in terms of active spaces and sensory spaces, but at the same time it indicates that there is some sort of barrier, even if the barrier is conditional and probably a good thing, good for information."
"Unknown","00;26;53;06","00;27;25;08","Encapsulation with anything is stronger. The this kind of flexible condition barrier between inside and outside or between different spaces. And this is the point that so when I was watching your discussion in the previous session, 035.4, I saw that this metaphor of all these came out and there was the question of whether there is any sort of causal relation between the and whether the relation between them is a correlated."
"Unknown","00;27;25;08","00;27;53;23","So they argued in the paper they may be some sort of causal relation or correlation which can be stated in terms of internal interventions. The approaches which are of course liable to their own to other sorts of criticism that we need to discuss. Right. So but I think that information encapsulation doesn't need anything that is stronger than the general model relativity."
"Unknown","00;27;53;23","00;28;32;10","That's why I try to advertise advocate in this paper. So the main point is that regardless of whether or not there is any kind of causal relation, actual relationship between the actions of Bob and the actions of all this, or perhaps I have to call them a chance have do so in order to be more loyal to the rule, to the soul of the tale of two cities the thing is that to the extent that the information in each unit is not available, accessible to the other units, we can speak of information in copulation and then we are making models."
"Unknown","00;28;32;10","00;29;07;22","I mean, if we can set any kind of distinction between internal and external spaces and if we tense in the same way that you may not be able to set the distinction between models and their targets, there wouldn't be any modeling practice, there wouldn't be any scientific activity. On the other hand, if we are able to set a distinction between enterprise, Excel or any kind of distinction between models and their target, we would be able to to state some sort of conditional barrier."
"Unknown","00;29;08;11","00;29;43;16","It is still doesn't indicate that there is no kind of information so setting the barrier itself doesn't show that the information in one block is not available to the other block. But the they can see the yeah, I was fascinated by this picture when I was watching your discussion in the previous version. So in terms of the relationship between above and all these, the action of broaching the tease is correlated with what all this does in the other unit."
"Unknown","00;29;43;16","00;30;17;15","But it has been assumed that the information in the unit is not available. The information in Bob unit is not available to all and vice versa, even though the information may be available to us as observers or if the control observer, a third person, the information might be available to her, to the observer, but to the extent that the information in each unit is not available to the person in the other units, I think that becomes because some source of partial information encapsulation yeah."
"Unknown","00;30;18;22","00;30;54;29","Thanks very interesting. If we couldn't, I just really like calling that part about how if we could make a distinction between the target system in the model between the territory and the map, then it's not modeling. So it's kind of like when you kick a football, does it model a parabola? Well, it doesn't have the modeling, the self model, the integrated world model, whatever one wants to call it, such that it is just the actual causal relationships that it's engaging in the world and no more."
"Unknown","00;30;55;19","00;31;49;11","Whereas cognitive entities like scientists are engaging in modeling, and then that means that they are able to engage in counterfactuals, in thinking through other minds. They are reducing their uncertainty from a partial information encapsulation view. And sometimes you get more information than the system has available but other times it's radically less and so it's kind of like an application of a Markov blanket partitioning with some non Markov concepts, from philosophy of science to the scientist investigating target systems, getting partial measurements."
"Unknown","00;31;49;11","00;32;43;18","That's their observations coming in and then they're updating their hidden state inference about what they think is happening, the likelihood of different hypotheses just like any active entity would Well, if I may elaborate a bit more on this, and it returns to the question of cognitive realism. I think that despite the speaking of all of this model, relativity doesn't need to lead to some sort of global or general form of entre realism because, well, part of my activity in the past year was dedicated to developing some sort of cognitive realism that is based on fact, assuming that the practice of scientific model making is underpinned by the dynamical interaction between scientists or groups of scientists"
"Unknown","00;32;43;18","00;33;07;13","and their environments. So this kind of model relativity, I mean, the relation between free energy principle and model based science is very complicated. And it is not something that is directly related to this aspect of the, of this paper, but this paper is a piece of a larger project that has been finding its own shape in the past few years."
"Unknown","00;33;07;13","00;33;45;14","And it is about the as I say, the general idea here is that in the same even though the free energy principle, the total framework, experimental activity that is embodied in the research stream that leads to the world mental free energy principle is basically some sort of model based scientific activity. On the other hand, if we are interested in explaining scientific activity in scientific model making, and if we are naturally we are interested in finding good natural explanations for that, we have to look into the underpinning natural mechanisms that make scientific model making possible."
"Unknown","00;33;46;13","00;34;15;02","And a good place to look for this is these scientific accounts of the interaction between the age and the organism and the environment. Then, because free energy principle provides a valuable account of the relation between agents or as I discussed in my more recent work, a group of agents, which is the Committee of Scientists and their environment, both social environment and biological environment, we can as well broad scientific model making in the mechanisms of free energy principles."
"Unknown","00;34;15;02","00;34;42;22","So the situation is quite complicated and runs in both direction we like running in both directions. This so I guess that's OK. So we have a few different ways we could go down or blue. Do you want to ask a question? Or we can go to one that we've previously written down can I ask a quick question, Daniel?"
"Unknown","00;34;43;02","00;35;25;15","Yes. Yeah. So in in the point, one blue brought up something that I'm still sort of trying to untangle, and she talked to she was asking about genes in particular, and how we might relate to what this paper was potentially pointing to. It is that it raised the specter around the idea of so information encapsulation, do we need time in order for us to be able to take a measure or put a boundary around or encapsulate or somehow mark in a Mark Colvin way, decide where the partition is."
"Unknown","00;35;26;00","00;35;54;03","And so I'm still trying to figure out whether or not we are talking about a world where because I think a world exists where there are two things going into not necessarily the same direction. We got one thing where we look at the world and we ask ourselves whether something was completed. We do a completion analysis, we take an account, and I think models fit nicely into that world."
"Unknown","00;35;54;15","00;36;22;16","What I thought this paper raised. So some ideas around was is that half of the is that half of the whole picture is the other half? Do models and being modular allow us to include or make sure that we have included everything that we need in order to be able to get to the best sense of what's on the other side of that divide."
"Unknown","00;36;22;21","00;36;49;21","So when we're making these inferences, we can use models as a way to account for things, but are we also able to project off of that and sort of make better guesses better inferences? I've used that. I've used the expression prediction matter expert. And so I was wondering again if those words weren't exactly used in this paper, but was that part of what we were trying to sort of dig down to?"
"Unknown","00;36;49;21","00;37;17;17","Is it is it is it just a matter of people use models? People people's models account for things in in certain ways, but they also if we don't get too hung up on the precision of that account, they can also be sort of fuzzy and left semi-open and give us a net an opportunity to also be creative and decide essentially whether or not we have enough information to make that next best guess."
"Unknown","00;37;17;26","00;37;57;06","So just kind of wondering about that Mary. Yes, please. All right. Well, that's a that's a very brilliant point. So it it comes back to the issue of completeness of models there, accuracy and certainty and that sort of itself. And I completely agree. So it's a it has been taken for granted. And I think that part of it's part of this interest has been raised by Richard Levine's paper, the strategy of model based science in population biology, that we are making models."
"Unknown","00;37;57;06","00;38;24;10","But the accuracy of models is very important. So the models have to be accurate enough to represent to do the representational test well. And they have to be competent in the sense that they have to be detailed. You know, I think that this is a very good point. But look, how much accuracy is enough. I mean, we can speak of completeness of models, but absolutely competent models."
"Unknown","00;38;24;10","00;38;49;09","I think the I've been reading a short story from a North American writer on the expected to of science or something like that, which is the story of people in an empire who are trying models, mapmakers, cartographer, experts trying to make maps of the empire. And they are very obsessive. They want to have conflict maps, but they end up with having maps that are all are all right."
"Unknown","00;38;49;10","00;39;26;26","Perfect, perhaps. Yes. Yes, precisely. So they end up having maps that are as big as the empire itself. So, yes, so and it's completely true that living's to speak of accuracy and detailed lots of models. But then again, of a completeness and it's so details I mean, more details are not this. So this really leading to better models because accuracy works only in combination with some other virtues, such as generality and precision of prediction."
"Unknown","00;39;26;26","00;40;02;28","So even though the other question is that home how to find how to strike the right balance between generating the accuracy and precision of models. On the other hand, and I'm tempted to say this, I understand this, I'm just trying to point in the same direction to speaking of the rule of model scientific models and model making. But then again, how much precision and accuracy have to be taken into account, have to be related to have to put in harmony with generality?"
"Unknown","00;40;02;29","00;40;14;00","Again, I would I'm tempted to say that it is again a matter of interest and explanatory and predictive goals of the model. Make your hmm."
"Unknown","00;40;18;00","00;40;52;25","So I will ask a question from the live chat from Steven So Steven Majid was curious about your understanding of the relationship in which practitioners seek to apply low dimensional computational modeling with other scales of knowing in uncertain and dynamic environments. So for example, there's the awareness and the perception of the dark rabbit, and then there are the affordances in our niche that go beyond just sort of a visual toy example."
"Unknown","00;40;53;22","00;41;37;07","So open ended question about what you might think about that kind of application of modeling, perhaps in a social setting do the models in the social setting need to be dimensions or what if I see that in terms of the relation between dynamical causal models and values? So for example, I assume that the age use could provide some sort of low dimensional model that is capable of representing the network aspects or something like that."
"Unknown","00;41;40;06","00;42;16;19","Yeah, I think that's a good question. I mean, continue with that. Not right. Some things don't always work well, so OK. So I'd like to I'm tempted to repeat this. Well, I think that it provides a good example. So take the variable of social relation or social events that we may want to model. So this provides actually a good nice example of multi of scale or multi scale nature of target phenomena."
"Unknown","00;42;16;22","00;43;15;19","So this the social awareness is constituted by the relationship between people and events and environment. And look, people are actual human being, they are biological entities constituted of people who are still organizing system. And we are able to explain people and their behavior at some level on the basis of biological fact. So we may be able to use some sort of modeling system that are applicable in biology or that's also the support at the larger scale when we try to model the relation between different people as nodes in networks and that sort of stuff, we may need to change or modeling device to, I don't know, devices that argue that through presenting a small reward"
"Unknown","00;43;15;19","00;43;42;05","networks or that sort of stuff. If that does make any sense, I think that I just get confused by the point about the low dimensionality of models in social systems. But it could be a Steven ism, or one way at least that I would read that would be like the maps that we make are lower dimensional than the territories."
"Unknown","00;43;42;17","00;44;39;07","They have a different resolution, but also they don't consider they're not trying to be a full inventory of every variable in the system. Like there might be a thousand chemicals circulating in our blood, but then somebody might make a lower dimensional model with just blood sugar or a two dimensional model with just you know, cortisol and blood sugar. And I think it's an active inference, open question when we make lower dimensional models of complex multi scale target phenomena like you addressed it I mean, I don't want to jump to an answer, but it seems clear like that the philosophical implications of a lower dimensional map shouldn't be confused with a systems accounting of the territory because"
"Unknown","00;44;39;23","00;45;04;00","it's not the same thing and yet Steven just followed up in the chat. He just said, generally, how does Majid see the informational or physical sense of systems like some people talk about systems in the more ontological sense about the parts and how they're connected. Other times we're talking about systems informationally like our analysis of the measurement data."
"Unknown","00;45;04;00","00;45;38;23","And so the system, like the default mode network, is a connectivity pattern that isn't necessarily the anatomical connection. So how do we think about these different kinds of systems and maybe where does the FFP come into play with that? Or is there a that's a very good question. So I'm a tag. You're a structure, really. So I'm committed to some sort of information theoretic ontology, other things of well, and I say that I'm defending some source of embodied information, all the structure realism."
"Unknown","00;45;38;23","00;46;04;17","So then I say that I was advocating cognitive realism. It would have been more precise to say that I'm advocating cognitive social realism, which is actually the title of the book that I wrote about this topic. So what rule free energy principle plays in this context is a very complex rule. So let's assume that we have this structure of scientific theories or scientific models on the one hand."
"Unknown","00;46;04;17","00;46;33;12","So let's assume that we have a class of models or scientific models on the, on the one hand and on the other hand, we have or causal structure of the world, which is our target system, something that we are trying to represent by or scientific model. So when I speak about a structural realism, I think that it has been the official wisdom of philosophy of science for the past of 15 years or so."
"Unknown","00;46;33;12","00;47;15;19","And people were trying to use different kind of formal vehicles such as set theory, model theory, category theory to speak of this representation of relation between the class of models and the causal structure of the world. Right. But so my beef with that was that the formal relations such as Isomorphism do not contribute to a strengthening realism because these formal models such as Isomorphism are not important to I mean, you can use Isomorphism to relate any two sets together, provided that there are enough number of set members."
"Unknown","00;47;15;19","00;47;43;16","So it doesn't contribute to realism much. So what I was trying to do was to use Fipp free energy principle to account for the class of models and their target system in the world, assuming the sciences so self-organizing system that's aimed at minimizing the discrepancy between their models and their target system in the real world. So it is my take."
"Unknown","00;47;43;16","00;48;19;03","I mean, it is something that I'm trying to develop. I don't say that this is the this is a very well, this is not the orthodox view either in the philosophy of science community or in the first community. But I think that when we speak of representation in terms of the representational capacity of the model of models, in terms of the relation between class of models, and close of the structure in the world, free energy principle can play a very subtle and specific role."
"Unknown","00;48;19;03","00;48;52;01","There maybe we're in the little strange neck of the woods, but I think having scientists as real entities doing something seems at home here, blue so I think you presented us with a lot of things that that don't contribute to realism. But is there anything that you think does contribute to realism?"
"Unknown","00;48;55;12","00;49;29;26","Of well, of could you elaborate bit of because of the model relativity or because of free energy principle? Well, so like in terms of cognitive structural realism, like what what does provide evidence for the cognitive structural realist argument? I mean, like you've given us a lot of things that you've deconstructed that, but is there can you take the opposite side and provide evidence for cognitive structural realism or."
"Unknown","00;49;31;08","00;50;13;04","Fair enough. Look, the general, I think that the general arguments for scientific realism in general have been always stated in some sort of numerical arguments, assuming that if science was not representing the structure of reality, it would be a matter of cosmic co, the empirical adequacy of science has been a matter of cosmic coincidence. So there are some sorts of arguments, usual arguments in the philosophy of science that try to relate empirical adequacy of scientific theories to approximate truths of scientific theories."
"Unknown","00;50;13;04","00;50;40;25","Right. And a sort of realism just tries to model misrepresentation of a relation. The veracity of or variety very we call representational relations in terms of sectarian modal theory. So in my view, it would be more realistic to consider scientists as actual human beings constituted by flesh and blood, who aim at minimizing the discrepancy between their models. And the world."
"Unknown","00;50;41;03","00;51;21;00","I would say that the evidence that I could provide for the sake of realism could be has its roots in evolutionary biology. Because if we if we had not been successful in minimizing the discrepancy between our models of reality, we would also fail to maximize or survival. So I think that I can as a as a visual evidence or argument, I can try to grown the argument, the usual scientific realist arguments that aim to relate the empirical adequacy of science, the truth of theories."
"Unknown","00;51;21;17","00;52;01;18","I can try to relate the sexes to maximizing or survival as an evidence of or success in minimizing the discrepancy between our scientific models and their target system because of the structure of reality thinks that also plays into some other discussions we've been having about like the objective function of science and the sort of multi-skilled nature that scientific fields, research labs and organizations and individuals are engaged in pragmatic and epistemic actions."
"Unknown","00;52;01;28","00;52;29;08","And so in act of inference, we have this scale friendly approach which a priori doesn't require a specific scale of analysis, which is what you brought up with Mark on blankets. And any specific application will entail a specific scale of analysis because it's empirical. And so it's this one foot in both world, just like linear models are the model doesn't have a priori scale."
"Unknown","00;52;29;17","00;53;00;08","But then when we specify it, we do make it specific. And what's interesting about Octave is that we could think about this action of perception loop of different kinds of nested entities. Now, definitely it's going to get complex for any nested entity and then it brings a whole nother level with the strange loop and the meta modeling and the cognize are and the thinking about oneself, that's like a whole nother level, but just a way to talk about vertically and horizontally."
"Unknown","00;53;00;08","00;53;26;02","Interacting systems is an awesome start. So blue. And then either machine you could respond to a blue says or Dave, feel free to say hello. I just wanted to compliment you on that. Awesome like prelude to like next week's discussion about modeling ourselves, right? So like it's a very interesting perspective when when the model is the model is the model is the model."
"Unknown","00;53;26;02","00;53;57;11","It's a loop cool. Dave, would you like to say hello or ask anything more? Hi, nothing particular. Ask. Sorry to be late. I've been in marinating myself in neuro psychoanalysis for the last week and a half, so that's my post. I've got an excuse for being late fair enough. So let's go to a few of the other topics that we had written down."
"Unknown","00;53;57;26","00;54;31;02","So I think before we get to this more the the lift off on the postdoc to let's talk a little bit about in Transitivity because in our discussions we had looked at in Transitivity in a preference framework where in Transitivity of preferences has been transformational in microeconomics, for example. And then there's in Transitivity from a game theoretic perspective like the rock, paper, scissors and just strategic in transitivity, which also brings us back to the population biology modeling."
"Unknown","00;54;31;13","00;54;52;23","But you were discussing in Transitivity in a specific context which is about the predictive processing architectures and models of cognitive architectures. So could you maybe unpack a little bit what is entrenched in Transitivity mean in that context? Who disagrees? What would be different if it weren't that way?"
"Unknown","00;54;55;15","00;55;47;17","Yeah, sure. So I think that the so the the thing is the if we assume that there is transitivity information could be transferred from one unit to another we would have a serious problem in defending. I was thinking of saying something more about active inference and objective inferences because I've you've put this in the background for the time being, but the thing is the, the point that I was trying to make in the paper was that this all of this talk about the distinction between Transitivity and in Transitivity only works with regard to invoking a specific kind of modals, which is no wonder because the paper is about the significance of scientific modal."
"Unknown","00;55;47;17","00;56;23;26","So we can define transitivity or in transitivity of the to the structure depending on the kind of building that we summon. So if we assume that the only kind of models that are allowable in the context of three energy principle are dynamical causal models, we will end up by a straightforward rejection of modularity. But this doesn't need to be the case because energy principle is not all about representing the actual causal mechanisms, neurophysiological mechanisms of the brain."
"Unknown","00;56;24;05","00;56;55;05","So this is as much about representing these neurophysiological structures as the general properties of the it is as much about representing the local significant neurophysiology of the mechanism as it is about explaining the relation between different units and different component counterparts that are implemented in the brain. So it is supposed to be a theory, a unifying theory of the brain."
"Unknown","00;56;55;05","00;57;33;13","And in some sense it may indicate that we do not need modularity enough because if we want to defend some source of unity between different components, between different parts of this structure, we do not need to be able to modulate the brain and the paper tries to argue the reverse. That is, speaking of the connection between different parts in terms of mainly in terms of and again, it comes back to the distinction between effective functionality and functional connectivity that you discussed very well, most probably better than I would be able to in the previous session."
"Unknown","00;57;34;00","00;58;01;22","Would be a matter of the kind of properties of the cognitive system that we aim to model by invoking three energy principle, whether there are local properties of the brain or the global unifying properties of the brain. And if you want to model the brain in its unity, we also need to be able to speak about the connection between different parts and from the very fact that you assume that there are different parts."
"Unknown","00;58;02;28","00;58;44;17","It follows that we have to assume that there is some sort of encapsulation or a weak point and moderate form of modularity very interesting. Thank you. Any other thoughts on that? Well, then I'm going to go to a hard question, which is what makes a model active inference is that a in the in the circle or out of the circles that a binary classifier, is it a zero to one scale what will happen when people disagree?"
"Unknown","00;58;44;25","00;58;51;14","Does simply any model involving action and inference qualify as active inference?"
"Unknown","00;58;55;18","00;59;09;07","We have asked it on a few previous discussions, and I think we have gotten a range of answers, but it's definitely an important one to revisit from this model based science perspective."
"Unknown","00;59;15;14","00;59;49;02","Well, I mean, I have been defending some sort of Penn State because I have been marshaling free energy principle in the sense of virgins of time seekers. And so I'm tempted to say that any kind of self-organizing system that can minimize the discrepancy between internal models and the environment is capable of forming active inferences but it is not directly to I mean, it is not specifically related to this issue of model relativity."
"Unknown","00;59;49;02","01;00;10;04","On this. We assume that model relativity is quite obvious. It is everywhere in scientific activity. I cannot find any specific relation between that kind of painstaking account of active inference and a specific discussion of model relativity."
"Unknown","01;00;15;05","01;00;37;17","Don't you can ask a question yet, Dean again. Sorry, Blue. Maybe you want to go first you put your hand up and I just blurted out, Go ahead there. OK, sorry about that. Thanks. So at the end of the last of the last livestream, there was a question posted in the live chat about so exact active and maybe this ties in with what you were just asking."
"Unknown","01;00;37;17","01;01;11;05","Daniel, does active inference, what does active inference tell us about the model of the person trying to kick the ball? And I'm I'm curious about this, Majid, because you wrote another paper with you you coauthored a paper on Active Inference and abduction with somebody by if I pronounce their last name incorrectly, I apologize. Pattaramon and and I'm kind of curious because I think what active inference enacting and active inference within model building and modularity is it did it."
"Unknown","01;01;12;05","01;01;38;28","It gets us asking a question, much like Charles Saunders Peirce would ask if you walked in late on Bob and Alice OK, it's 9:00, but you're not really paying attention to the clock right now. You just walked into a room and there's on the other side of the one way mirror is a is this subdivided to two cubes, one with bob in it and one with Alice and it but you've, you've walked in and you don't have a model yet."
"Unknown","01;01;38;28","01;02;08;16","Other than the fact that you're on the other side of the curtain. You don't have a smiley face or a frowny face. What you have is a moment where you have to ask if you're actively inferring and you're enacting this is what should I be surprised if and what should I not be surprised if, as the as the as the stuff that's carrying out in Bob's room somehow is appears to not being carried out in Alice's room."
"Unknown","01;02;09;08","01;02;46;18","So I don't know that that modeling can can sort of segregate itself out scale free from the idea of of the specifics like Pierce would say if you walked in and into a room and somebody opposite of you had a bunch of white beans in their left hand and a bag of beans in the right hand and asked you as the person walking to the room, did these beans in this one hand come from this bag, you wouldn't have enough information to be able to give a specific and clear answer to that."
"Unknown","01;02;46;18","01;03;23;04","But you could start a process of modeling. You could start a modularity exercise to try and gather from an objective sense what what what led up to this moment. And so I'm just kind of wondering how do you how you take this paper and and and that example and sort of tied in with some of the other work that you've been because I'm hoping maybe I'll talk to you after this that maybe I would like to be able to review your active inference and abduction paper as well, if you have time."
"Unknown","01;03;24;12","01;03;50;18","Anyway, I'm just wondering, because I think if we're looking at this from active inference and enacting sometimes we walk in and we walk in and we have to infer based on a limited amount of information. And so I think that's what we're trying to do with we're we're basically saying when we walk in, do or don't be surprised if and then whatever plays out approximately on the on those time scales next do you agree?"
"Unknown","01;03;51;05","01;04;24;28","Oh, yes, I do agree. And well, I'm very happy that you mentioned that paper because I wanted to speak a little bit to earlier. So the thing is that, as I say, there are two phases of the same project. So in this project, I mean, the project that has been stated in this, a tale of two architectures and their paper, a critical piece of work, Korean modernism I was emphasizing the model based model relative nature of active inference as an activity."
"Unknown","01;04;26;03","01;04;53;04","But the main reason why I was getting interested in this because of the Markov blank is because I think that Markov blank is also very strong and reliable modeling tools also for the general scientific modeling. And so it is the other side of my project when I'm trying to grow and scientific realism and scientific model making in active inference and free energy principles."
"Unknown","01;04;53;04","01;05;40;22","So this is the other side of going back to the general arguments for scientific realism, again, a strong defense of scientific realism is reliant on invoking infra explanatory inferences by developing something that is called inference to the best explanation. And this project that you mentioned, the paper that has been written by me and others and there is another paper we were collaborating on other paper on the same subject aims to show that how the general explanatory inferences hold the journal abduction is grounded in the process of active inferences right."
"Unknown","01;05;40;22","01;06;09;28","So I think that there are two sides of the same coin, and there are two intertwined, two interrelated projects, both as I say, I do not see. So I do want to also explore the implications of that for the metaphor of Bob and Alice. I mean, do you think that it has any specific ramifications for this Bob and Alice metaphor yeah."
"Unknown","01;06;10;00","01;06;36;16","That's that was that's exactly what I think it does. And again, it's a separate paper and there's another excellent, excellent insight if you if you had a chance to read it. But I think when we're trying to figure out what's effective and functional we we come in to a situation of looking at Bob and Alice, and over time, our model grows as well."
"Unknown","01;06;36;16","01;07;03;13","Right. And I think that's part of where my question about what is what is scale free? Yes. Bob and Alice are in their cubicles and those cubes are of the same dimensions. And then there's a scale friendly part that kind of grows over those slices of time. So yes, I, I actually do think that it would be interesting to sort of say when, when did we walk in on this Bob and Alice observation?"
"Unknown","01;07;04;21","01;07;42;16","Well, so I would say that for the moderate, weak sense of encapsulation that is at issue in this specific paper, the tale of two cities it would be the necessary condition is that the information in each unit is not available to them, to the person in the other units or in the other book. So to the extent that the information about, for example, Bob brushing his teeth is not available to all, is there is some sort of encapsulation and I think that it is for establishing some sort of moderate modulation."
"Unknown","01;07;42;16","01;08;16;00","But the other part, the more fundamental the more fundamental question about the scale relativity and to what extent. So it is some sort of scientific fact that we can choose the scale that we need on the basis of our explanatory interest. So at this specific setting, my explanatory interest, my scientific interest was to call to, to set the limits of the scale at the level of the rooms of Bob and Alice, because I wanted to explain encapsulation."
"Unknown","01;08;16;07","01;08;46;11","So in other situations, so assume that you are an information theorist and you want to develop a general theory of communication between these two units. So you it is natural for you to take the point of view of the third person of the observer, and then there might be another person who wants to speak about the relation between this third person and the target system it takes or so it may it might go observer, observer all the way up, an observer all the way down."
"Unknown","01;08;46;11","01;09;18;20","And it would be a matter of what you are trying to do with changing this game. What what goal do you aim to achieve so again, at some papers I was trying to say limited to the level of individual. So for example, when I wanted to model the activity of a scientist specific, an individual scientist, I was focusing on the processes of minimization of predictive predictions at the level of individuals."
"Unknown","01;09;18;20","01;09;41;00","But at points I wanted to model the behavior or speak about the behavior of all scientific community, assuming the scientific practice is a social act. And I evolved for that reason, I was trying to expand the limits of this scale and apply that to the old quality of scientists or a specific group of scientists rather than individual scientists."
"Unknown","01;09;41;11","01;10;36;25","What was important for me and what I think is important is to have good and satisfactory justifications for changing the level, to be able to explain clearly what was the purpose of changing the level, taking it to an upper level or a lower level. And I think that to the extent that we are speaking about encapsulation and modulation, it is justifiable to limit the module to the specific cells in which Bob and Alice are dwelling so just wrote a few things down and maybe this captures it, but the free energy principle, especially as you're applying it in this embodied informational and cognitive structural realism perspective, the FIP as a theory of things is providing the"
"Unknown","01;10;36;25","01;11;20;06","conceptual continuity for modeling different complex systems, including scientists in the world and other processes as they engage in their niche. And then the active inference framework we can say is operationalizing this imperative for persistence of different systems and then connecting that apriori process ontology to a whole host of other patterns, motifs that we must explain in the world, like abduction in the social and communication case and narrative information inference on one end of us."
"Unknown","01;11;20;13","01;11;49;22","But then on the other end, we also want to have active really dial in and get at exact inference in certain cases where it's like we made the fMRI measurements and we kind of want to like leave philosophy in the lab and just plug in, chug this pipeline. And we don't want that to be a pipeline to nowhere, or we don't want the output of the pipeline to be interpreted in a fallacious philosophical milieu."
"Unknown","01;11;50;13","01;12;21;07","But at the same time, if we try to take that philosophical baggage through every step of the processor and the RAM and the GPU, we get into these little nano debates which you highlighted, which is like people arguing whether cyclic or directed cyclic graphical models have philosophical impact when they're both just models that scientists chose for different reasons."
"Unknown","01;12;24;21","01;12;56;11","I have to say that you have the knack of explaining my ideas far more clearly than I can. So here is my everybody. Majidi is a brilliant young man. Here's my next question for you, because there's multiple FFP frontiers here. You have the book, then there's the Markovich and Modernism that we had earlier discussed. The abduction, one which we haven't gotten a chance to discuss this paper, obviously."
"Unknown","01;12;57;07","01;13;00;29","So how do you keep the information."
