"Unknown","00;00;28;24","00;00;56;15","All right. Hello and welcome, everyone. This is Active Labs, live stream number 35.1. It's January 5th, 2022. Welcome to the Active Inference Lab. We are a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at the links here on this slide. This is a recorded and an archived live stream. So please provide us with feedback so that we can improve our work."
"Unknown","00;00;57;09","00;01;10;10","All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here, and we'll be following good video etiquette for live streams, plus playing with our new affordance thanks to our Jessie repair person. And that'll be fun."
"Unknown","00;01;12;14","00;01;33;24","Go to Active Inference dot org if you want to learn more about how to participate or get involved. If you're listening to this live stream live or in replay Allocating your regime of attention this way, then maybe you'd like to get involved a little bit more actively with projects, including Planning Livestream. So today we are in Active Stream 35.1."
"Unknown","00;01;34;00","00;02;14;13","We are discussing the paper that Dean and Blue and I did 35.0 on yesterday and that paper is a tale of two architectures Free Energy, its models and modularity. By Majid Bene in December 2021 and we're going to be talking modifying slides asking questions going into some things that we brought up in the dot zero connecting a few dots and also preparing for hopefully Majid to join in the to video we're going to be discussing this again next week at the same time so let's begin with some introduction and warmup."
"Unknown","00;02;14;23","00;02;59;19","We will each go around and just say hello and introduce ourself as well as maybe just add something that we're curious about. What got us really excited to discuss this paper and what are we looking forward to reducing our uncertainty about in the coming days and weeks? So I'll start. I'm Daniel. I'm a researcher in California and I think I'm excited to talk about the information encapsulation and what that means, as well as to go into that parable of Alison, Bob and see who here wants to relay that story to us and shine some light on narrative based understandings of free energy principle."
"Unknown","00;03;00;04","00;03;36;03","And I'll pass it to Steven thank you. Yeah, I'm Steven. I'm here in Toronto. I'm really interested in this ability to step back and look at some of the underlying processes of actually modeling that this talks about and the philosophies of that in quite a practical way. So I I'm I'm excited by that potential from this paper. So and also what the group here is making of that, because I think it's a it's challenging us to start to think about some foundational stuff in our work."
"Unknown","00;03;36;03","00;03;45;20","So I'm going to pass this over to Dave. We're going to just skip Dave for some audio our dean is Dean around? Yep. Yeah."
"Unknown","00;03;48;03","00;04;13;09","But I'm dean of in Calgary. So for me it's always trying to be will hold up two things at once. And so for those two things in this paper or the moment of instantiation or the sort of the model slice aspect of what we're looking at. And then also to instantiate or to modulate. And so those two things together, what does that imply?"
"Unknown","00;04;13;16","00;04;53;08","And that's what I want to talk about a little bit today with Bob and Allison. I'll ask the blue I am blue. I'm a research consultant in New Mexico and something I'm excited to talk about today is or maybe next week is the idea of modularity in the free energy principle and how that might work in the absence of a brain where the FFP still applies to brainless systems and how how that might be also modular or not OK, so there's so many places to jump in, but thankfully we have some questions in the live chat, which we'll begin with."
"Unknown","00;04;53;20","00;05;17;20","And then as per usual, we will modify our slides and just keep on adding more slides, adding more questions. So if you're watching live, thanks again for all these great questions and I'll first bring them in to this slide. So Joseph Clark asks, this is a little bit of a general question, and then we'll move to a question that's a bit more specific to the paper."
"Unknown","00;05;17;28","00;05;32;04","So the general question, is there a space space on either the Dischord or live streams to discuss active inference in reference to more traditional philosophical, psychological, linguistic or social science questions? What would anyone say on that?"
"Unknown","00;05;36;16","00;06;05;00","Well, I suppose that that that we do have some of those conversations as part of the active inference lab, some of the social science questions. It can get in the weeds with too many different assumptions in the background, which they themselves could be contentious. So I think it's helpful to do some of the type of work that we're doing now to sort of think about, well, what does it actually mean to model something?"
"Unknown","00;06;05;00","00;06;49;06","What are the sort of assumptions that are even going on before we start to dove into broad sort of popular theoretical frameworks? Because are we going to come at this from the position of a very low dimensional modeling approach, which is shed light on to things like autism things like schizophrenia, things like types of behavior? Or are we going to come at this more from a structured principle approach where we have an ecological niche relating to an agent and a generative model?"
"Unknown","00;06;49;21","00;07;37;00","Some of those things I think are more helpful to start to pass so that we know how we're locating the discussion but I'm not sure if others agree with that because it's very easy to get caught up in a discussion which is essentially located in say, the social sciences and trying to work from there with all the implicit assumptions and get back to active inference and it can get quite heady and kind of confusing, maybe better working the other way, addressing something from, Okay, how do we take a type of modeling approach used around RFP, active inference in relation to something, what's useful from that?"
"Unknown","00;07;37;03","00;08;11;22","But that's, that's my that's my feeling. And I also believe it's nice to do stuff where you're doing interactive dialog and working with documents in real time as much as it is to a text chat. Because I think that also can start to get a can't quite handle the level of complexity at play. Thanks, Stephen Blue so I would push back on Joseph for a specific example of a question that that might fall into this category."
"Unknown","00;08;12;03","00;08;38;23","And also, is there a particular paper that might be related to active inference in this field? Because I do feel like we do discuss a lot of philosophical and social science questions. I'm not sure I guess there's some linguistics also I can't remember like a stream. It's just not like linking in my brain. But I mean, we just did thinking like a state, which is very social science based, I think."
"Unknown","00;08;38;23","00;08;59;24","And so yeah, I would just love to see what particular questions you would like to see addressed and if you can find the paper and recommend it that we discussed on the livestream, more than happy to accommodate that yeah. Yep. The linguistics guest stream was Elliott Murphy. So all respond in terms of affordances. I think there are probably more."
"Unknown","00;08;59;25","00;09;26;03","So create your own affordance, modify the act and flag as your niche as you see fit, but there's always the informal discord affordance just post in general and say Hey everyone, I'm going to be curious about these ideas. I don't even know what to know, but I'm going to be curious about these different things, these topics these three questions, and in 2 hours I'll be doing it or in two weeks at this time."
"Unknown","00;09;26;03","00;09;48;21","So you can always just say when you're going to be in the voice chat on Discord and maybe some people will drop in. Or you can invite some friends specifically. And then a little bit more formal of an Affordance is we can host a guest stream or a panel. So that would be done through the dot coms organizational unit and we would work to plan the timing."
"Unknown","00;09;49;02","00;10;09;28","And then also set up the discussion. So it's not just like we show up and say, OK, well who is going to prepare like we can just to whatever extent is required, get a jam board ready get some slides ready, some questions that will spark the conversation, and that can also invite people outside of the active community so it can be whatever you like."
"Unknown","00;10;10;01","00;10;42;06","So by asking the question, you've signaled that you understand that such a affordance could be important and so looking forward to seeing how you follow through. So let's go to Joseph. Second question, which brings us, I think a little bit closer towards the paper. It will zoom in towards it. So how do you stop overfitting on one layer of the model, for example, leg movements to avoid compromising the larger goal that an agent or person wants to do, like kicking a football?"
"Unknown","00;10;43;11","00;11;38;19","I feel this question may also help put some of the debates around modularity versus hierarchical information segregation in an analogous context. So it's a great question. We talked a lot about hierarchical modeling and about that lateral modularity, kind of the collective behavior element and then the nested modularity which is the multi scale systems perspective and inactive inference as we explored with the mental action paper and deep active inference we sometimes have these nested models that are expanding over multiple time scales so that the action at one time step isn't just greedily pursuing the overall preference, but rather the preference can be realized or uncertainty about realizing the preference can be achieved."
"Unknown","00;11;38;29","00;12;15;11","Through policy selection over a given time horizon, even when the micro movements might not be intuitive. So sort of taking one step back so that you can go a better path, what would anybody add to that? Or we can start to diagram some pieces out here I would just say don't don't drop one or the other. Don't drop the idea of the moment of instantiation or that model slice, and don't drop the chance to instantiate or to modulate."
"Unknown","00;12;15;29","00;12;46;19","Make sure that I've used the expression when it does zoom in, zoom out and you're zooming out, you're actually trying to incorporate longer time frames versus a moment in time. And that's how I would that's how I would mitigate some. I don't know that you can wipe out the overfitting problem. There's always a potential for that, but you can mitigate it somewhat by making sure that you keep the two ideas up at the same time without one blending into the other or total focus on one or the other."
"Unknown","00;12;51;03","00;13;18;09","Right. I throw up a image from Paper 25, which was the mental action paper of Sanford Smith, and this is kind of one way to address it. So let's just say that the overall goal were to kick the football. It's a good example. You know, it works for whichever side of the pond you're on with kicking the football."
"Unknown","00;13;19;20","00;13;49;07","The overall preference would be for, for example, the sensory observation of seeing the football far away or of observing the foot, making contact with the football at high velocity and the foot is starting in a neutral position. So just sort of like standing and the greedy gradient descender would just go from the neutral position to just kick forward."
"Unknown","00;13;49;26","00;14;12;28","But maybe it's possible there's like a three step movement. For example, in the first time step, you pull the leg back and then you move it forward two times. So over three clicks of time in the model, that is going to be the outcome that ultimately best realizes your preferences of making contact with your foot on the ball at the maximum possible velocity."
"Unknown","00;14;13;24","00;14;45;17","And so the policy selection is happening at the motor level. So the policy here is a parameter that's describing like the angle of the hip that is the state that's being inferred. So we don't go too deep into this skilled performance angle or the interaction ism angle, but 23, check it out. And two policies can be compared or a whole family of policies can be compared with one another."
"Unknown","00;14;45;27","00;15;09;22","One policy is just moved like forward. The other policy is move like backwards than forward twice. Another policy would be like move it backwards and forwards and backwards and forwards and never kick the ball. Then over a given time horizon, like the time that the organism has to make this kick different, expectations can be calculated for different policy sequences."
"Unknown","00;15;10;15","00;15;45;15","And again, if it turns out that moving the leg back one step and then forward two steps makes contact with the ball at higher velocity, then at the level of deep policy selection that three step sequence will be selected over the just moves like forward sequence or the back and forth, not kicking sequence. So that's a mechanical version and it's also the kind of model structure that applies to not just motor actions but mental action."
"Unknown","00;15;46;08","00;16;35;11","So I hope that gets a little bit towards it and also starts us towards this discussion of modularity because where is the modularity in what we just described? So Stephen, and then anyone else who raises their hand or throws out a string of emojis yeah, this is a very useful example. I because you see it's about phenomenology and it's interesting because traditionally philosophical, psychological perspective or type approaches averaging out over social approaches aren't phenomenological and phenomenological ties in more with our best guess approach of how an agent is experiencing things."
"Unknown","00;16;35;16","00;16;53;26","So what you just mentioned here, I think this is quite good. The kick in the football is I'm trying to work out where to keep the football. What am I trying to do? As it say in policy selection, I'm trying to work out the best way to do it. And I may be unaware of what I'm paying attention to in trying to help do that."
"Unknown","00;16;53;26","00;17;19;08","There might be some subconscious processes which are helping to calibrate it. However, once I've actually mastered that performance, what I'm paying attention to may not be how to do it. I might be in the flow. It now might. What am I paying attention to is how do I look up and just kick the ball towards another player? So I think that I'm wondering what people's thoughts are there in terms of how that changes things too."
"Unknown","00;17;19;08","00;17;58;14","Now, being an agent base mode good question. I think it also relates to the event based cognition. For example, Marten Boots and what he talked about the micro level is indeed the policy of each muscle and joint being selected to write something. However, there's a modularity that arises from cognitive chunking of complex motor actions, for example, into broader, more handle able units."
"Unknown","00;17;58;28","00;18;51;22","So like writing a letter is like a unit of motor actions. It's actually a really complex sequence of motor actions. And then writing a word is a given event that subsumes or entails or requires or is supervising upon lower level policy selections like which way to move a muscle of a thumb. However, it's the increasing chunked and modular perhaps even semantic levels that appear to arise more to our phenomenology, which is why we, for example, reach for something and a whole host of processes play out without us needing to micromanage the motor actions yes."
"Unknown","00;18;52;06","00;19;27;06","Dean Oh. Oh, well, look, I was just kind of, I think what to Stephen's point, I think what we are asking here is does the mind or can the mind go in two directions? Namely, do we start with a frame we're an architectural scaffold or a model or just the process of of what we're watching, i.e. kicking a ball, spectral eyes, the relativity, i.e., does it confirm what the edges are."
"Unknown","00;19;27;28","00;19;53;19","So those are those are different completely opposite views of things over a over a timescale. So then I guess where we have to ask ourselves is, does the representation act as the take off point, meaning do we start with the model? Do we start with that scientific view or and or does the representation evolve as the result sort of more of the creative view?"
"Unknown","00;19;53;19","00;20;26;11","I think we're capable of doing both. In fact, there's lots of evidence that we do do both. So I would come back to do we modulate? Yes. Is that a process? Yes. Do we can we take slices of a modulation exercise and see them as representational and modeling? Yes. So that's all I would point to it. I don't know when the transition is, Stephen, when it's kicking a ball thanks, Stephen."
"Unknown","00;20;26;11","00;20;50;26","And then anything else? Yeah, well, this transition and this may be part of what changes, I suppose this is one of the interesting things is it depends on the nature of the situation and everything at some level, which is interesting is is is hidden in active inference and we're trying to get some purchase on that, which is interesting as opposed to it being out there as knowledge."
"Unknown","00;20;51;13","00;21;15;14","And, and we somehow know it, it's like, OK, what am I perceiving will always be more hidden state it's than I can never really know what am I trying to do. There were more hidden states why am I paying attention to? And I think what's quite interesting is what is at the the realm of being available to us in our consciousness."
"Unknown","00;21;15;22","00;21;38;20","OK, so the sort of thing that Daniel was talking about, the sort of process, the sense making process which is present when it's not immediately obvious how to kick a ball because Messy doesn't do that. Messy knows he just he feels it. Right. But there is a there's something really interesting about the scale. And I think my my feeling is we have a means, a middle scale."
"Unknown","00;21;38;28","00;22;09;21","There's things which come out of our awareness or are harder to purchase or get a grip on as they become faster and as they becomes low, slower so, you know, what am I paying attention to? There may be something that's my unconscious is sort of aware of that phenomenological feeling about how the events is going and how my stomach is feeling waiting for the next meal, which is sort of too slow for me to really notice."
"Unknown","00;22;10;03","00;22;25;26","And there's other things like we're saying we should just biologically at speeds faster than the rate at which conscious awareness operates. And we've sort of got both of these. And that moves a little bit depending on how I take my attention in the world."
"Unknown","00;22;28;23","00;23;02;10","Thanks, Stephen. Yes. So we have a few different axes or continuum here there's the phenomenological or what is experienced, and then there's sort of the third person impersonal where it's more just about what's happening in the model. And we don't even associate it with a conscious experience in this mental action paper. It threads the line because it is talking about computational phenomenology."
"Unknown","00;23;02;18","00;23;40;25","However, this is the structure of deep active inference policy selection models which don't need to require any kind of phenomenological experience. So blue, then we will continue to the next slide so just in thinking about agent systems and information encapsulation, it seems like to be part of the same system. There must be partial information encapsulation. Like you can't play a basketball game with a bunch of other people without sharing information such as the possession of the ball, right?"
"Unknown","00;23;41;04","00;24;08;05","So there's, you know, and the rules of the game, et cetera. So the partial information encapsulation, I mean, how to what degree like what percentage is information encapsulated between individuals, between modules of the individual tissues of an individual and so forth? I really wonder about that. I mean, even like you think about the butterfly effects, like we're all sharing, I mean, globally information such as climate change or this type of thing."
"Unknown","00;24;08;11","00;24;49;00","So there's there's information at a global level that affects every single one of us because we're all part of the same global system. And so there's got to be some kind of partial encapsulation, I think, just to be connected in a system right. Stephen? That's a good point. Blue. Blue makes that because there's only certain things available at certain temporal scales to meet some of these the temporal depth of being aware of the ball in a in a practical sense is a certain."
"Unknown","00;24;49;00","00;25;13;07","There's a certain at some point, it just becomes noise. It's too fast to sequence, and there's no point getting outside of actually processing sensory information itself at these faster levels. And as happens with all the uncertainty and every prediction that goes up the chain, there's a certain Goldilocks zone right for knowing how the ball is going in the game."
"Unknown","00;25;13;07","00;25;32;07","And if I'm standing, I'm watching the game. This is sort of a Goldilocks speed, which is probably relatively slow, just like in a soccer game if I'm sort of running down the wing and not getting the ball a lot. And but when the ball's actually kick to me, I've got a player coming in to tackle me I've got another player running, and we've got to do something with it now."
"Unknown","00;25;32;07","00;25;56;11","Bang, I've got a window that's got to happen in that short period of time. You know, the the regime of attention and the action policy selection is, is in in this in the terms of like half a second, maybe milliseconds, of which some then are not even available in our conscious awareness, unlike maybe the tracking of the game, which might be of a window of five, ten, 15 seconds, maybe longer."
"Unknown","00;25;56;21","00;26;31;14","I think that in itself would that not itself create some sort of modularity great question. So we explored several different senses of modularity in the DART zero. So there is the physical connectedness like the anatomical connectivity, anatomical modularity. And then we talked about the effective and functional, which are two statistically different. They're not interchangeable, but they're two different ways to talk about modularity."
"Unknown","00;26;33;11","00;27;01;27","So now we're exploring how these notions of modularity line up with potentially the nesting of multi scale systems through space and time. So I'm pulling up one of the figures from Ramstad at all 2018 answering Schrodinger's question if I can just resize it properly. And so here on the x axis is time and on the y axis is spatial scale."
"Unknown","00;27;02;19","00;27;31;25","And what this graph is laying out loosely and it's been described in other papers in discussion since is that things are kind of existing on the line where we're seeing that smaller things are happening faster and larger things are happening slower. Things that happen over continents are happening over longer time scales and things that can happen at a sub cellular scale."
"Unknown","00;27;32;15","00;28;10;12","So there is kind of this natural relationship between the spatial and temporal scale of processes and how does that relate to the modularity that Blue was describing? If there's complete encapsulation of a given module if such a thing could even exist in reality is one question. Now, if something could exist in our model of course it's true. We can develop a model that has that connectivity among variables doesn't mean it's the best model or it's the one that is the perfect territory description itself."
"Unknown","00;28;10;12","00;28;39;03","But it's not. It's a map. And then if we had no integration, that's kind of like saying that it's just encapsulated at the next scale up. I'm sorry. No encapsulation within a level is kind of like saying it's just perfectly encapsulated at the next level. So in a way, the partial information encapsulation is the gray zone that everything is going to be existing within Stephen and then anywhere else."
"Unknown","00;28;40;24","00;29;18;02","Yeah. And actually because they have they've sort of gone back on this on this particular diagram to some extent after feedback from Casper has, I think this is really where there is a there's this continuum, this idea of a continuum going out is what I think active inference sort of changes how we see that. And it's hard because when we try and map things like what Maxwell was doing here, he was taking stuff from the social sciences and the different approaches that are mainstream, and this is how it pans out."
"Unknown","00;29;18;17","00;30;16;20","But if this is often because this is what we think of something from the outside, we see from the outside group behavioral patterns, we see an organism, we categorize it, we make models of it, and they sort of stack up in this way over time and in time and temporal and physical scales. However, from the perspective of the dynamics, are we having a different Goldilocks zone within the smaller and faster tempo dynamics in terms of what's actually happening and when that means something's out in the niche we may see stuff dropping out from there, but there's no reason, for instance, where niche construction is not being under guard or by rapid decision making at real"
"Unknown","00;30;16;20","00;30;49;13","time, just like the soccer players are all making choices on the pitch around where they run. It changes the way the grass is going to get worn down. OK, so this is interesting, actually, now looking at well, so what is the replacement to this diagram? Has there been one that doesn't have this kind of micro macro and actually is able to have an action orientated me so that can meet the requirements of what we're talking about?"
"Unknown","00;30;49;13","00;30;58;07","Pluralist ontologies and ontological pluralism. Well, where is that? Where is that being described? And I think that's a missing link at the moment."
"Unknown","00;31;00;20","00;32;06;07","Great. I think that this takes us to a good return on the mark of blanket scale free or scale friendly debate because just like you said, Stephen, somebody's talking about a cellular scale and the kinds of perception, cognition action happening at a cellular or an organismal scale. They're not saying that need construction doesn't exist. Ecological scale needs construction because we could also think about tissue level construction rather that the regime of attention of the scientific modeler is being directed towards a given kind of modeling and so that's sort of how we take something that is a unifying theory like free energy principle or a scale free or a scale a priori model, whether it's markhor"
"Unknown","00;32;06;07","00;32;41;22","blankets or linear regression. But in any application to a given system, there are going to be time scales of analysis that just do and don't make sense. And that's where we operationalize the markup. Like it, or as Penny wrote, although markup blankets are in principle scale free, meaning there are no inherent constraints on their size and scope, their application or imputation to various target systems will impose a definite scale on markup, like it's the yeah."
"Unknown","00;32;41;22","00;33;20;03","And I think, again, that's why I want to talk a little bit about the instantiation moment and sort of piggybacking on yours and Steven's comment when we apply a markup blanket, we can ask the question from an encapsulation perspective, Did you see what I saw it's a question. We're both behind a blanket. We're both wondering if there's some agreement that we've gained some sort of a contextual alignment I could also say to you, did you see that, which is it may sound like almost the same question, but it's not the same question."
"Unknown","00;33;20;03","00;33;55;18","It's not even the radically different questions because one says, are we in agreement on what's being encapsulated? Meaning are we are we forming a co contextualization? Or the other one says, I'm not sure right. I'm not sure what you're seeing. So two, this question of scale, it's it free energy is moving us I think, to that place of of coexisting contexts."
"Unknown","00;33;56;01","00;34;25;20","But I think the critical thing is we've talked about this so many times don't don't confuse the two something or other than that with the field or whatever. I just get I get lost in it all. But but the bottom line is can we do two things at once? I know we can. Our brains can realize that applying a partition verses or with in conjunction with what is that slice of time as a relativity question."
"Unknown","00;34;25;28","00;35;10;09","And then when does that relativity question to appear at the beginning? Is that our take off point or is that our conclusion? That's all that this paper to me does is it says at what moment do we employ categorization interesting. Dean. Thank you, Dave. Then anyone else there? Yeah. You know, to Dean's comment when I asked, did you see what I saw, the proximal pole of your attention is being invited to be projected into me."
"Unknown","00;35;11;27","00;35;14;20","So you're seeing it through me."
"Unknown","00;35;16;24","00;35;43;04","You might compare that to what some crazy Russians were doing 100 years ago. They were trying to get the notion across that very few people are conscious more than a few times a year. And they said, Well, look, I can explain away your impression that you're conscious a whole lot here's what I can say. I can say, Hey, are you conscious?"
"Unknown","00;35;44;11","00;36;18;09","The very fact that I asked you, are you conscious causes you to be conscious what it shocked you into consciousness. And you wake up and you say, Well, yes, I am, of course, one, because I force that on right even and this takes in the idea of what is the adjacent possible, what is available in that ecosystem for awareness that we're talking about."
"Unknown","00;36;18;09","00;36;53;10","So just like you said there, if someone says, did you see that? That can take someone into a sense of like, I'm trying to work out often, particularly if there's a power difference between people, what that other person's now wanting me to see. And I've seen this a lot actually when we were doing work in South Africa and with communities, one of the first things just to let people and you ask some questions are getting to a point where they're actually telling you what they think, not what they think."
"Unknown","00;36;53;10","00;37;25;04","You are thinking about what they should be saying. Right? So where is that attention? Just should I say it? Where is it in terms of being conscious as an awareness? And how much of this scale is will what's available and what's going to be an impact in terms of the adjacencies? So a cell has some awareness potentially and maybe even some adaptive influence at the kind of at the actual organ level potentially."
"Unknown","00;37;25;04","00;38;02;03","And maybe further, it will have an impact maybe in terms of the way cells divide on the nature of speciation yes. There's it's but it hasn't necessarily got any trajectory to adaptively it's not in its adjacent possibles. And I think that is quite useful in terms of it starts to open up in terms of the information either temporally, how much is something separated by time, spatially, how much by space, by suppose also by statistical contingencies."
"Unknown","00;38;02;23","00;38;44;15","And the ability to adapt and interact, those types of things. What is either within or adjacent and what becomes outside of that? I think that starts to give some of these these scale in modularity questions just maybe an applied direction to come out. Thank you. Stephen Blue, there is a huge fundamental difference between asking someone, what do you see and do you see that even if you don't give them that, you're still looking in a direction of that, right?"
"Unknown","00;38;44;15","00;39;09;24","So the what do you see? Like, let's someone look at their surroundings, take stock in what they see and give their independent observations versus just even like, do you see that? And like you look over in the direction at least like you're directing someone's attention with your question. So asking an open question versus a directed question can give very different answers?"
"Unknown","00;39;10;04","00;39;35;11","And I wonder what the impact of that would be on modularity like or even just an information sharing like there's more shared information in. Do you see that or do you see what I see? That's like like an intention to share your generative model at that point versus what do you see as actually trying to take stock in someone else's model?"
"Unknown","00;39;35;20","00;40;11;12","It's just an interesting thought yeah. These all points, using the example of communication and visual perception to where we have partial information encapsulation, if the two entities were totally encapsulated, they couldn't communicate. If there was no encapsulation such a question wouldn't be required to be asked. But there's a specific type of edge in this network. We could almost think of these like two modules as like maybe the two generative models of the individuals."
"Unknown","00;40;11;12","00;40;40;09","And there's this connection when some of the modules are connected and it is a nice how we're kind of exploring these suddenly different questions, I think. Did you see that is that is corresponding to an external state like an observation? Did you see that? That red blur in the sky? I don't know what it was could have been a comment, but did you see that versus what I saw?"
"Unknown","00;40;41;14","00;41;11;16","Well, we know that you see with your mind's generative model of vision and whatnot. And so especially when we're outside of the signal processing paradigm of vision, did you see what I saw is like quite literally asking, is your internal hidden state related to mine? Are we seeing the same thing? That doesn't mean are the photons hitting both of our retina means do we have a shared generative model of visual objects?"
"Unknown","00;41;12;17","00;41;49;29","So, Dean and then Dave, just one last thing. That's a great summary. First of all. Secondly, when we're talking about what is the nature of the partition where we're I think as a group we're still trying to define what we hope is is is not completely definable yet. You want to understand with that partial encapsulation, not saying it's undefined, I'm not saying it's zero, although down the road, I might say we're passing through zero because that's what I I'm kind of moving towards."
"Unknown","00;41;49;29","00;41;55;28","But I think when we partition that partition, it."
