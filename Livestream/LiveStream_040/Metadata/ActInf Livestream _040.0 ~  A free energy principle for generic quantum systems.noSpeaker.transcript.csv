"Unknown","00;00;28;27","00;00;56;04","All right. Hello and welcome. This is Active Lab Livestream number 40.0, March 10th, 2022 welcome to the Active Lab. We're a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at the links here on the slide. This is recorded in an archived live stream, so please provide us with feedback so that we can improve our work."
"Unknown","00;00;57;01","00;01;34;14","All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome and will be following video etiquette for live streams. Check out active inference. Talk to learn more about the live All right. In today's number 40.0, the goal is to learn and discuss this very cool paper that was published on archive on December 30th. 2021. A Free Energy Principle for generic quantum systems by Chris Fields, Carl Forrest and James F Glazebrook and Michael Levin."
"Unknown","00;01;35;08","00;02;00;21","And just like every video it's going to be just a conversation going over some parts of the paper. It's not a review or a final word. And if anything, it's a cry for help or at least a cry for participation, because there's so many areas where somebody with different experience or more knowledge about any of these domains could connect some dots or give some useful comments or critiques."
"Unknown","00;02;00;21","00;02;36;01","So especially with this video, The Blue and I had help from our colleague Jason Larkin with many of the details. There's just so much to unpack. So we'll try to make this a useful dot zero and then we're really looking forward to the Dart one and dart to and so on when we'll be able to really go into some of these directions so I hope if you're watching live or between now and The Dark One, check out the paper and listen to this discussion that we'll have now."
"Unknown","00;02;36;11","00;03;08;27","And ask some questions because this is just the beginning of a few new threads, probably more than the answering of questions, especially to any desired level of like completeness or applicability. So it's just the beginning. That's what the dot zero is about. It's a new decade, 40.0. So we'll just introduce yourself and then go through a bunch of the paper and yeah, thanks again to Jason for a lot of help and blue for awesome work on the slides too."
"Unknown","00;03;09;06","00;03;31;09","OK, so I'm Daniel, I'm a researcher in California and I'll pass to Blue as facilitator. I'm Blue Knight, I'm a researcher in New Mexico, and I have to shout out to Daniel to say thank you to me. But, you know, we all have to say thank you to you for providing the affordances to be here and discuss these awesome questions in paper."
"Unknown","00;03;31;19","00;03;55;17","I am excited to delve into this. I think it will start a lot of new trails. So I think and also to bring back Mike Levin and to bring back Chris Fields and to bring back Carl Preston back to the Active Lab to discuss that with us. Hopefully. OK, so is there anything particular that you are excited about, Samuel, or do you want to just powered through it?"
"Unknown","00;03;56;01","00;04;22;26","Let's get started. All right. So this paper really was trying to unite the quantum principles and the free energy principle. So quantum mechanics and just kind of delving into that. And we will see some threads carry over from the lesson that we had Pressfield on here maybe the last time we had Mike Levin on here also. So how is the free energy principle related to quantum mechanics?"
"Unknown","00;04;23;07","00;04;50;26","What does the gain from quantum? What is quantum gain from the FPP? Are we using the FP now to model quantum systems? And why are we pursuing this intersection and so this is kind of like the big questions kind of maybe we can start to answer with this paper so we are here. Daniel, what's this map about? It's a question we're going to probably ask ourself multiple times."
"Unknown","00;04;50;26","00;05;27;12","So we can insert it like a little emoji, but we can think of among the axes of variation or variability that we're going to explore or where we're going to tune our regime of attention or what perspectives we're going to take. It's going to be like along two axes ranging from on the right side, FIP, active, like to the left side, which is like pre or non active slash, fip, it's the x axis and then the y axis is the continuum between quantum, which we'll probably nuance and here many perspectives on what isn't isn't quantum."
"Unknown","00;05;27;12","00;05;58;10","But just to summarize it by saying quantum and not quantum like pre or non quantum approaches. And so quantum fip is in the upper right corner and we can think of it as being like connected in different ways to quantum non FFP in the top left the blue and then FFP, but from a non quantum perspective like all pre now fip active in green and then what are all the other connections."
"Unknown","00;05;58;25","00;06;26;06","And so who's right, who's wrong, who's useful, where's their pragmatic value? Where is their epistemic value? What are we really talking about? Do we agree on the phenomena where where is there agreement or disagreement? Where are we in this complex landscape? So I think in mechanics we refer to it as classical mechanics and quantum mechanics. So now we will be this is like the dividing point."
"Unknown","00;06;26;07","00;07;15;01","Maybe between classical and quantum perhaps. Let's see, where does so the aims and claims of the paper, there are pretty much three and we'll revisit these at the summary because we're going to just give you a broad overview of the summary of results right now. Given the standard free choice assumption, the intuitive ideas of an agent or information gathering and using system, I guess can be fully formulated within background, independent scale, free quantum information theory the second claim is that FP can be a quantum theoretic formulation that renders it applicable to generic quantum systems and do you want to read the last one then?"
"Unknown","00;07;15;25","00;07;49;21","Three, When formulated as a generic principle of quantum information theory, the FP is asymptotically equivalent to the principle of unitary cool. So you want to read the first section of the abstracts? All right. The Free Energy Principle or MVP states that under suitable conditions of weak coupling, random dynamical systems with sufficient degrees of freedom will behave so as to minimize an upper bound, formalized as a variation on free energy and surprisingly also known as self information."
"Unknown","00;07;50;06","00;08;31;27","This upper bound can be read as a Bayesian prediction error. Equivalently it negative is a lower bound on Bayesian model evidence also known as marginal likelihood. In short, certain random dynamical systems evince a certain kind of self evidencing so here we reformulate the FP in the formal setting of spacetime. Background Free scale free quantum information theory we show how generic quantum systems can be regarded as observers, which, with the standard freedom of choice assumptions, become agents capable of assigning semantic X to observational outcomes."
"Unknown","00;08;32;14","00;09;17;28","We show how such agents minimize Bayesian prediction error in environments characterized by uncertainty, insufficient learning and quantum contextualizing. We show that in its quantum theoretic formulation, the FP is asymptotically equivalent to the principle of unitary based on these results, we suggest that biological systems employ quantum coherence as a computational resource and implicitly as a communication resource. We summarize a number of problems for future research, particularly involving the resources required for classical communication and for detecting and responding to quantum context, such as it's like, OK, cool, what does it mean?"
"Unknown","00;09;18;21","00;09;42;23","How will it be useful yeah. So we're going to unpack a lot of this and hopefully give everyone a good framework with which to kind of go forward into the dark one and dot to maybe a little bit of background understanding. The paper is very busy, so we'll do our best to kind of late lay the framework down they give us a good roadmap."
"Unknown","00;09;42;23","00;10;07;03","So there's five sections, the introduction, physical interaction as information exchange and several subsections within that repeated measurements and system IDs and subsections, the FFP for generic quantum systems and the discussion and I think that they actually outline what's in each section. So we'll give you that outline overview as we go through the paper as well."
"Unknown","00;10;11;03","00;10;44;13","So just we're going to use we're going to actually reuse some slides from active stream number 17 that was when we had Chris Fields presenting information flow and context dependent hierarchical Bayesian inference. I think contextual ity is like an underlying thread that's pretty important here today. So Chris kind of lays that out in the, in that paper. And so if you want to get into that and dove deeper into two spaces and channel theory, which we'll talk about a little bit, but yeah, that's there."
"Unknown","00;10;44;20","00;11;17;27","So that for resource, just one foreshadowing here, the two pieces that they claims in this paper as their goals was to connect contextual to category theory and choose spaces and then connect that yellow formulation to hierarchical Bayesian inference more looking like the statistical models. And so this paper is kind of building a category theory bridge with Bayesian graphs and statistics and category theory."
"Unknown","00;11;17;27","00;11;40;05","And then that's probably going to hinge over to a few other areas so we can jump right into the introduction here. And we're just going to highlight some key words as we go through. The authors didn't really give keywords for the paper, which I'm kind of grateful for because there's so much so many other things to unpack here."
"Unknown","00;11;40;14","00;12;33;27","So they highlight some things about the MVP, in the words of the authors, since its introduction is a theory of transformation, the variational strategy principle that has been extended into an explanatory framework for systems at all scales. The FIP is a statement that any measurable, bounded and macroscopic system will behave to satisfy these requirements. Requirements. What else then it was just cool how they brought in the AP as being the overarching level as describing how these particles do two things, which is possess internal dynamics that are conditionally independent from the environments and performing this self evidencing feature by returning to some non equilibrium steady state."
"Unknown","00;12;34;10","00;13;09;29","And so just which parts of the FFP they entered into or emphasized, which we can assume are setting the stage up in their mind best for the interfacing or the on ramping into quantum where somebody's interested in like a system or integration other than quantum might take a different approach I think that they borrow also from a particular physics and we're going to talk about particles and they talk more about particles in the discussion and maybe we can have a deeper conversation about those in the one, about two."
"Unknown","00;13;09;29","00;13;34;23","But they say the markup boundary of any particle, that's an open exchange with external states via its markup boundary underwrites conditional independence between its internal states and the external states of its environment by localizing and thereby restricting information exchange. So the markup boundary separates internal and external states by mediating their exchange. We've seen that before."
"Unknown","00;13;38;03","00;14;14;24","Cool. So what does that have inference? Danielle, can you break it down for us to sentence overview? Blanket that blue I've just described with the insulation incoming statistical dependencies can be interpreted as perception, and outgoing statistical dependencies can be interpreted as control and depending on the situation and what's zero and what's not zero, that can have a lot of dynamics that are similar to some other classic settings in decision making, gambling, experimentation, quantum measurement."
"Unknown","00;14;15;18","00;14;48;23","In this paper, Engle Swiss Quantum Theory This is cool. Just some pictures and it's connected in to many, many different fields. So there's a cool kind of concept map of where quantum theory intersects. But you know, the quantum theory here is the idea that that all physical systems can including the environment can be considered observers that act on their surroundings to prepare them for subsequent observations."
"Unknown","00;14;49;10","00;15;30;28","That's become common in quantum theory, replacing the wave function collapse postulate of traditional quantum mechanics with interaction induced decoherence, which is like the dissipation of quantum coherence this is the thing that generates classical information. And they say indeed what quantum theory was originally developed, and it's still widely regarded as a theory simply applicable at the atomic scale and below, since the work of Wheeler, Feynman and students, that's the use of it has over the past few decades been reformulated as a scale of great information theory, and it's increasingly viewed as a theory of the process of observation itself."
"Unknown","00;15;31;15","00;16;10;15","So yeah, I think when we think about quantum, we think about the observer, at least I do. I think about the observer phenomena. Just the act of observing a system changes the system so that's kind of a fundamental thing that comes to my mind. What comes to your mind, Daniel, when you think about quantum theory, it reading that leaves me uncertain to whether we're talking about like organic chemistry and the PI orbitals and covalent bonding and emission and all of those things that particles do, which is what it sounds like they're talking about in this orange part, a theory specifically applicable to the atomic scale and below."
"Unknown","00;16;11;12","00;16;35;04","And then this blue part makes it sound like they're opening it up into a much larger space. So I think we'll probably learn a lot about that. What does Quantum mean here? Are we talking about electrons and protons, or is this something that is like Bayesian inference in that it's scale free or scale a priori or scale friendly or something like that?"
"Unknown","00;16;38;03","00;17;01;22","Next scale independence. So we're going to jump right in. So Section two, they talk a lot about physical interaction as information exchange. And that's something I wonder also like is way we have the classical mechanics. And do the laws of quantum always apply or at some scale, are they not applicable or can we extend them into quantum theory of everything?"
"Unknown","00;17;01;22","00;17;32;04","Like are we getting there? Maybe. But here in this section, they say that they use the category theoretic formalism of channel theory to formalize the operational semantics of natural links. So they develop a generic form over representation of quantum reference frames and show how the non commute activity of quantum reference frames. And this is quantum contextually and I had fun really digging into this at a level that I felt comfortable explaining it."
"Unknown","00;17;32;18","00;18;00;11","So I'm excited to see if I, if I bungle it or how it goes. Let's see. OK, what is quantum when physical interaction is used? Information Exchange. Why is it quantum becomes obvious? The fundamental quantum quantum of information is one bit one unit of entropy, that one system exchanges for another. So one bit one quantum of information is the answer to one yes or no question."
"Unknown","00;18;00;26","00;18;05;26","That is quantum do you want to add anything here, Daniel?"
"Unknown","00;18;08;07","00;18;57;01","This is the block text is from the paper in just one piece that will be interesting to explore is just how does time and temperature come together like I had just heard or thought more about the space required for storage and not really seen as much connected to the speed of obtaining that yes or no answer at different temperatures and what that might mean for biological or for digital systems but I'm sure it's very foregone conclusion may be working with a quantum device."
"Unknown","00;18;57;01","00;19;16;25","But new to me and Jason was like, oh yeah, of course that's the case. And they talk a lot. So foreshadowing they're going to, you know, really present this within like a space time independent context, which is kind of cool and then like link it back to time, which that kind of gets a little interesting. All right."
"Unknown","00;19;19;08","00;19;52;17","So moving on, Hilbert Spaces so Daniel, do you want to say a bunch about this or what do you want to say about this? And then I'm going to highlight some stuff I'll just read what they wrote well, here's the read part is bizarre comments on what they wrote. People compositor read what they wrote. The Hilbert spaces contain all states described as a vector."
"Unknown","00;19;53;28","00;20;55;04","And this is one way that qubits are constructed by relating to levels of a system like electrons in a ground or excited superposition. And then the collapse into one or those other bands. And so that's more of like a uncertainty to discrete transition but then in the limit of high temperature, there's a lot of blur or experimental factors that can be modeled as blur that results in a smoother distribution of outcomes and here this Hilbert space is describing how the experiment is set up and the information that's being modeled at a given time sort of state of that this space consists of the options for is like the just the experiments space, including the total"
"Unknown","00;20;55;04","00;21;26;05","target system and the observer maybe so I like this quote at the end that if you put it infinite dimensional, Hilbert spaces are from an information perspective, merely a useful artifice permitting computation with differential equations, and they contain all the possible states in an experiment as vectors. So there's more to read about that and also the mathematical notation."
"Unknown","00;21;26;05","00;21;55;00","If you're curious about cats and bars and some of these brackets that we had to to dig through to find solid grounds yeah. OK. So the principle of unitary is the principle that observable information like energy is neither created nor destroyed by physical processes. And I thought that this was interesting. So time reversal symmetry is essential for the conservation of information."
"Unknown","00;21;55;15","00;22;16;07","So the system is time reversal symmetric if its equations of motion allow perfect prediction of the starting point based on knowing the state of the system at any given time. So like if you know that time, whatever X type stops, you can still say something about the starting system because you can run it forward and backwards in time."
"Unknown","00;22;16;18","00;22;34;23","I mean, there were simple things like about if you pulled up a mirror, that's, that's like enables the time reversal. So some things go forward, but like the spin of an electron is spun backwards in time, right? So it's like those kinds of things like are some things are parallel and some things are opposite in time reversal symmetry."
"Unknown","00;22;34;23","00;22;59;22","But anyway, I thought that was interesting and fundamental is kind of the principle integrity and also because we're going to talk about time in a cool way. I think OK, so yeah, unitary, what do you want to say about unitary digital? I said a little bit, so let me pick out some things here that you want to talk about."
"Unknown","00;23;00;27","00;23;27;07","OK, this was all with just Jason helping us. And again, it's like an opportunity for anyone who's familiar with these to Formalisms to help us a little bit more through. But just to pick up on one point, just as you mentioned, like we're doing experiments where it doesn't matter what time we started at, in a sense, like it may matter in the sense that the different times lead to different results."
"Unknown","00;23;27;07","00;24;11;29","But a statistical framework for observation that can cut through some of the parts of the experimental context that are not relevant to compare different events that happen at different time in a unified statistical framework. And so that was what led to this principle of integrity, that the total probability distribution is preserved with like a mass of one so that there can be information evolution but it's happening in a certain space where there are certain invariants that allows useful computation to happen oh yeah, conservation of probability."
"Unknown","00;24;12;09","00;24;32;28","So that's something that maybe came up like the probability that a particle is somewhere like it's somewhere there's 100% probability that the particle is somewhere. So it didn't disappear. So that was another kind of interesting question. We were talking before this I mean, that's kind of what how you get the conservation of observable information as well."
"Unknown","00;24;36;16","00;25;10;08","Like severability and holographic coding OK, this one, just to briefly look at a previous slide, I think this was from 32. We were looking at sparsely coupled systems from a matrix perspective. And so the dense coupling of like subunits one through six with each other was mainly like within the click of the red or the blue. But then there's these off diagonals that reflect the sparse coupling of denser clicks."
"Unknown","00;25;10;23","00;25;38;08","And so in section 2.3 of this paper, they're also talking about coupling patterns in systems, specifically ones that have a separate ability. So like one of those blocks could be the experimental system, the quantum computer, and the other one of the blocks could be the experiments or at the end there could be sparse connectivity reflecting the experimental apparatus."
"Unknown","00;25;38;29","00;26;12;12","But that was being approached from a quantum holographic angle, also setting up for a Markov blanket. Take cool. So one sentence on this page that I think is important as underlined here, the entanglement entropy is a mutual information measure that detects quantum correlation of coherence between A and B, and so that defines severability and either a system is separable or it's entangled."
"Unknown","00;26;12;12","00;26;32;21","So separable states are also called decoherence, and entangled states are also called coherence. So just just point out as we go forward and kind of dove a little bit deeper into the math, it's kind of like if it was parametric classical statistics, we would say uncorrelated or correlated. If it was information theory, we'd say no information or yes, it gives information."
"Unknown","00;26;33;02","00;27;00;05","Bayesian graph, yes, it has causal influence or no, it doesn't. And this is the quantum take. Yes, it's entangled or no, it's not entangled. Also, don't forget conditional dependance or conditional independence, but where where is it conditionally dependent and we know that like the Markov link is it can help to define conditional dependance. When we've looked at active in France in that yeah."
"Unknown","00;27;03;13","00;27;24;17","OK, cool. So where do you want to talk about the Hamiltonian or not? Do you want to say. Not at all. OK, so the so there's one cool thing that I want to point out here. We talk about what we call an option, strong interaction, different time frames and how these are going to vary as we go forward."
"Unknown","00;27;25;06","00;27;48;04","But but here I really just wanted to point out that that this H of a V is like the Hamiltonian. So we're talking about matrices is separate ability interacting matrices, conditional dependance, just on the last slide. And so the interaction between the Hamiltonian of the matrix can be decomposed into this Achebe where this is like the interaction between A and B."
"Unknown","00;27;48;16","00;28;13;05","So HIV can be looked at as we go forward as energetic interaction between matrix AA and matrix B state A, state B, position A, position B or they give it to us in a very generic form. So I didn't really know how to apply that going forward. But maybe if the authors were listening, they'll come in and rescue us that's the only thing I really wanted to point out from from that side."
"Unknown","00;28;14;24","00;28;44;25","And then this is kind of cool. So this, this equation six which we just looked at, which is that energetic interaction between A and B, this is physical interaction, which I guess is that's a physical interaction between you that forms the energy white matter equals and C squared physical interaction equals thermodynamics times yes or no questions. So as for the other, say, this formulation emphasizes what quantum theory is about the process of obtaining information."
"Unknown","00;28;45;04","00;29;01;02","Obtaining information from B requires in particular that A exon B by asking questions, as Wheeler puts it, no question, no answer. All inference in this framework is act of inference. Equation sits does not allow passive perception to be a physical process."
"Unknown","00;29;03;12","00;29;37;01","Super interesting agreed from a lot of angles. It almost takes it to a level we haven't seen from just saying, well, perceptual inference, even the generative type. So not just the signal processing, but even a predictive processing generative framework for perception that doesn't take action into account is incomplete. Hence the motivation for active inference. And this is somehow escalating that into saying that all inference in this framework is act of inference."
"Unknown","00;29;37;14","00;30;06;11","And I wonder if that's because like a frame is always needed, some kind of generative models always needed as a recognition model dual for any observation. So if you're in the business of making observations, you're in the business of generative model modification one way or another, or you're not the kind of thing that does either of those, but they might come into play in the minimal active entity or the thing that can be models, minimal active entity."
"Unknown","00;30;07;00","00;30;36;01","And so there's a lot of interesting areas, and I think it's also quite interesting with the natural language equation. So how should we read that thought? Thermodynamics. What? Yes, no questions. And then times or what does it mean yeah. There's the category theory. You like that? The dot operator. I forget how to read it. So hopefully be rescued but yeah, I read it this times because I'm old school."
"Unknown","00;30;37;17","00;31;04;01","So going back to that same question, so I thought that this was important. It involves no assumptions about space, time, objects or emotions. It is strictly topological given severability. It identifies a boundary fancy B between A and B at which the energy interaction, physical interaction between A and B is defined. So I guess that would be like a space well, I guess it's not space subspace, it's not time."
"Unknown","00;31;04;01","00;31;39;19","It's a physical, it's an energy interaction. HIV, right? Yeah. And this is the mark of blanket fancy B holography connection, which is that all the information that is making the sparse connectivity of A and B, we're talking about systems that have like this screen slash blanket slash experimental apparatus, fancy B and the properties of it for a system that might be making classical like measurements or maybe it's making quantum measurements."
"Unknown","00;31;39;19","00;32;10;03","So implicitly the prior work had been thinking about what was on the other side of that experimental apparatus from a classical or from a non quantum perspective. We'll see. And this is taking it more into asking what kind of mathematics would be needed to look at it if it were a quantum system that were being investigated or and I think that takes us into a bigger one."
"Unknown","00;32;10;21","00;32;43;06","So here Daniel was foreshadowing to doing a great job of the holographic screen. So this is a holographic screen fancy B separating systems A and B with an interaction be given by Equation six. And so this says that this this screen can be realized by an ancillary array of non interacting qubits that are alternately prepared by AA and then measured by B qubits are depicted as the spheres here."
"Unknown","00;32;44;03","00;33;08;24","And there's no requirement that A and B share preparation and measure measurement basis. So these are quantum reading or quantum reference frames. So this is like they share the ability to prepare or measure that would be like not reference. And we're going to get into the quantum reference space just here in a couple of slides. And I think with a pretty good example cool."
"Unknown","00;33;09;10","00;33;36;03","Anything to add or do you want to unpack it with the next couple of slides? Just thinking about this is like a quantum holograph is sort of the generalization maybe of thinking about this in the classical information. What if this were the chat between Blue and I? So we could have different perspectives, different reference frames, different semantics, but if we're not in the same chat room, then we're not in the same chat room."
"Unknown","00;33;36;03","00;34;27;04","That's like the holographic screen or the observable that's getting passed between these two systems, A and B, and they don't have to be two people. It could be like a person and some other system on the other side of the holograph slash information channel. And the whole question is what kind of math describes that classical information channel case and how is that similar or different or compatible or whatever with thinking about it not as an information bit from a standard probability distribution, but like a quantum information bit with a complex statistical distribution it's so they describe the holographic screen actually, as they say, the holographic screen Fancy V has an obvious interpretation in the language"
"Unknown","00;34;27;04","00;35;10;04","of the three energy principle and active infants implements the Markov blanket that separates from B. So we've seen the markup at four and you mentioned it here, but I think that they are going to implement this holographic screen as this markup like it. Yeah. OK, cool. Oh, and then the quantum reference frame fun. So here they say we show in particular that the FP and we're just naturally in any setting in which an agent or particle deploys quantum reference frames, namely physical systems that give observational outcomes and operational semantics to identify and characterize the states of other systems in this environment."
"Unknown","00;35;10;23","00;35;32;18","And so this was kind of a cool figure that I that I pulled down so it's like a man on a train to the man, the train is moving and to the person on the train, the man is moving. Right. And so it depends on your perspective. And this is this is kind of what a quantum reference string is getting at here."
"Unknown","00;35;32;24","00;36;02;03","So this has quantum features such as quantum superposition are only defined relative to an observer. When we look at the train from the point of view of an observer standing on the platform, the train looks in a quantum superposition of different positions. However, an observer sitting on the train sees the observer on the platform, and the ball in a quantum superposition says a cool illustration of just kind of how things look differently depending where you're standing OK, this is awesome."
"Unknown","00;36;02;03","00;36;45;27","I like how you brought in the art, and the images are a little subtly different, but then in a way that really makes one think. And the classical case would be what if both of them were moving or still? And then they only got to get a frame update once every 2 seconds or once every 5 seconds. So then there would be like still in uncertainty distribution, but it'd be a classical parametric statistics or information theory, uncertainty about location and that's going to be the big question how is that variance estimation that we've already been exploring and that type of inference related to quantum information, where there's something a little bit bigger and more complex or different"
"Unknown","00;36;46;10","00;36;55;02","than just simply low sampling rate leading to positional uncertainty of a massive train that's not subject to so-called quantum effects."
"Unknown","00;36;58;20","00;37;22;03","Or did you want to what? So this is kind of cool. Do you want to unpack this slide here, Daniel? I'm just looking forward to what the free choice assumption means in some setting. But we just highlighted what is this all going to say about free choice, this specific slide, but also the broader discussion so I agree, too."
"Unknown","00;37;22;03","00;37;44;21","I think the free choice aspect is poor here. The authors say provided A and B are separable, assuming that there are no super deterministic apriori correlations, xea and Z be just the Z, I'm not sure what the Z is. Oh, choices of Z so the Z is the choice. The choice of A and the choice of B are uncorrelated."
"Unknown","00;37;45;03","00;38;14;24","This is the free choice assumption. Free choice is often claimed to be essential to science as a practice if it characterizes any bounded system. Consistency with theory and special relative relativity together requires that it must characterize all systems. So free choice of a basis introduces quantum noise that is indistinguishable observationally from classical noise and noise is going to become important here as we move toward the end of the day and zero."
"Unknown","00;38;15;09","00;38;46;16","So yeah. Anyway, that's cool. OK, next so here they talk about the Z axis in Fig. one. I showed a piece of figure one and here they say that the Z axis is the reference frame three choice of the axis generalized the free choice of the reference frame encoding each qubit on the plug of screen fancy b, right."
"Unknown","00;38;47;16","00;39;22;25","So yeah. And the part in red. Looking forward to unpacking a cure F cannot therefore be fully specified by any finite bit string. It is non fungible in the terminology of citation 40. It's the quantum active nifty crossover that we all needed. We have it, but we need to explore it and find out what it means. Super Bowl and they say that they consider A and B to be isolated during the time interval between preparation and measurement steps."
"Unknown","00;39;23;04","00;40;03;21","And I think that we'll get into that in a little bit more like preparation and measurements as we talk about time and memory encoding yeah. And that's what this nine formalism is roughly describing something like that. There's yes. Yeah. What is happening with it. So it says the idea of a computation is this. So you have bits that at one time stuff going to bits at another time stuff, and then you have the markup blanket of one type stuff going to another markup linked at T plus one."
"Unknown","00;40;04;09","00;40;24;26","And then this is it Z, is that free choice that's in there? Oh no, it's I f so I'm not sure what that one is, but yeah, we can, we can unpack that more. I, I will impact some of the later math, but this, I think it's just important to establish the quantum reference frame anyway. Yeah, OK."
"Unknown","00;40;27;05","00;40;50;00","Next very up. Here we go. See, I'm going to start to unpack something when I, when I start to roll out the variables. Here we go. OK, so we'll be interested in what follows and quantum systems considered to be observers that deploy one or more distinct quantum reference frames to measure particular subsets of the bits encoded on their boundaries."
"Unknown","00;40;50;02","00;41;18;25","Slash markup buckets. And these will effectively decompose the holographic screen fancy B and disjoint sectors that we will label E for the observed environment, F for the unobserved environments and Y for the memory sector respectively. So yeah, we're going to we're going to break that out I think. Yeah, attention also so that they really talk about the sectors as a sense, right?"
"Unknown","00;41;18;29","00;41;41;25","So I have like my vision sector, my hearing sector, my taste sector, right? So like I'm making observations of my environment with all these like high temperature sensing sector so there's all of these different ways to observe the environment with different sectors. So yeah, cool. It's kind of like saying you win some, you lose some you don't play every game."
"Unknown","00;41;42;19","00;42;03;17","It's kind of like whatever space we're talking about here, which happens to be this boundary that has all these interesting properties, there's some that are being observed, some that are being unobserved, and the special sector that gives continuity of information in some way through time yeah."
"Unknown","00;42;05;26","00;42;44;20","So this is cool here. Free choice of a decomposition of holographic screen fancy B into sectors with different quantum reference frame induced semantics is indicative of agency. So I like that. And I'm curious to unpack that maybe a little bit more something for to ask the authors about in the dark one. Yeah. Or also all non trivial agents are cognitive systems that engage in active inference what is non trivial to who like how do we escape or how do we escape this infinite multi perspective multi scenario universe?"
"Unknown","00;42;44;20","00;43;05;09","Or do we just have a way of working with that I do think that they get into non-trivial here in the little while, but yeah, they say a non for real agent is a system with internal dynamics that breaks the swap symmetry of its boundary markup. Like a holographic screen. However, they're going to start to use these things interchangeably."
"Unknown","00;43;05;16","00;43;37;04","So I'm just going to keep saying holographic spring fancy be but but I guess if your internal dynamics don't break the swap symmetry or right like if your internal dynamics are trivial or not relevant or if you don't if they don't have an effect on the boundary, maybe that stuff becomes trivial. Yeah. Wondering if that's the mere versus adaptive active inference boundary that we've discussed or what this maps to where does this kick in or not?"
"Unknown","00;43;37;04","00;44;06;24","So we'll explore it it totally seems like it's definitely the mirror versus active inference. That's how I interpreted it as I was reading it. So sounds like that to me. And OK, now we're going to head into some 17 related information because they're going to turn this discussion from refs as reference frames to channel theory, which is going to enable this context switching discussion."
"Unknown","00;44;06;24","00;44;50;14","That's important later. So this is brought up in number 17 and 17.1. That's where we had Chris Fields and great discussion there. So continually cool. Yeah. So channel theory of quantum reference frames. So I think we've said channel theory is an application of category theory to two spaces and I'm not going to read the paper here, but I'm going to go back to some of the slides that we used from 17 because I think that we kind of unraveled it there in a way that was maybe digestible, more so than reading equations off of so this is the toothpaste, Daniel, with the toothpaste."
"Unknown","00;44;50;14","00;45;49;11","So K is a set air objects, extra attributes, a toothpaste, fancy k over the set. K is the relationship between the objects A and their attributes. X I thought of it just like a computer function, like in Python or any language that's just taking in three kinds of data the set, the objects and the attributes. So describing a large variety of things, but it's just kind of integrating those three types of data in a principled way and enabling transformations between different representations that might look very different or allow for different implementations, but also commonly use like all of this information or even just a subset of the information, because that just throws out information which"
"Unknown","00;45;49;11","00;46;13;15","you can always do. I really like the Python example. So like if K is the Python dictionary, A are the keys and X are the values, like you can describe the relationship between the keys and the values with a true space like that, is that what the toothpaste does? So like you could say, you know, give your keys our apple, orange, banana, and our values are red, orange, yellow."
"Unknown","00;46;13;23","00;46;46;23","And so then the two spaces how do you describe that relationship color if it's something like that? Cool. OK, so going into channel theory and how two spaces work, how channel theory works. So this is the channel theory to transform, to become isomorphism, which are natural maps between classifiers. So classifiers link tokens to types that encompass them. Like for a stoplight, a set of tokens would be red green and yellow."
"Unknown","00;46;47;06","00;47;17;04","So that is the set of tokens I think this just builds one level on what you described, which is instead of just the data structure of just saying this is what the function is requesting or this is what is being stored memory, this is like saying we're going to interpret some of these edges in relationships as classifier mappings or info morph isms like information sharing or statistical dependencies or some other type of informational edge."
"Unknown","00;47;18;02","00;47;43;17","But on that space that we've been discussing. Yes, so so they take it to a diagrammatic level where at the center it's almost looks like a pyramid. So there's this C and this this course is the information channel. This is the info wisdom that allows semantic information. And this I thought was very cool. That's very different from Shannon information."
"Unknown","00;47;43;17","00;48;05;18","It's not just bits. It's like the meaning behind the bits. Like you can say, you know, you can see the word bank and are they talking about a river bank, the bank that holds your money or like a bank shot in pool, like there's some underlying I would say context that is important or not just the, the letters V and K in that order."
"Unknown","00;48;05;25","00;48;30;07","So it's not just the tokens in a particular order, but it's like the semantic context that allows transmission between classifiers. So I look at this like a shared memory. So like if we look at the classifier or A1 here, which would be stoplight, the tokens are red, green and yellow classifier A2 would be motorist actions, the tokens would be stop, go forward or I say proceed slowly."
"Unknown","00;48;30;07","00;48;50;29","That's really get out of the intersection. I think that's a key element. And then there's other classifier types could be like pedestrian actions, child game actions like we keep saying red like like do you run these? Do you stop like freeze so or do you OK, right. So there's all these different classifiers that can then map via a core information."
"Unknown","00;48;50;29","00;49;27;21","Chelsie shared memory semantic information between those classifiers cool. OK, so going on, they build from this pyramid, they invert the pyramid to form this cone cone diagram. So they say that a computing finite concrete diagram is made of a cone, which is the upright pyramid, and a cone which is the inverted pyramid on a finite set of classifiers."
"Unknown","00;49;29;14","00;50;12;01","It illustrates community tivity. So specifically these operators g 12 D23 Like you can go all the way up to the set like there's a commuter tivity air like on superimpose ability creativity between with a shared info Mormonism, if that makes sense. It also captures a more subtle duality between processes. It enables objects, files, tokens and histories to be viewed not as tokens but as types that organize respectively introductory components, features and feature based singular categories and and make them mutually consistent collections."
"Unknown","00;50;12;12","00;50;38;29","So we have all of those classifiers there. They're consistent across the board. So you can use them to map and unmapped. Right? If I can just give a take on this so g 12 is saying that there's a relationship between a one and a two. It could be like appending by one row or maybe changing one little bit through time or having some ability to translate like a state machine or something like that."
"Unknown","00;50;39;27","00;51;20;06","Let's just say that there's some relationship. And then there's also these F functions that allow the A's to be part of a shared context like the pedestrian scene that makes sense. And then that is shaped like a cone and then that is kind of like sense. Making that semantics is making sense. And then this cone or the diamond shape is where there's C and D who are both like cognitive sense making frames and then now they're having a shared holograph A or a shared access."
"Unknown","00;51;20;26","00;51;46;01","And then it's that is a different object with a different geometry yeah. That would be like I'm looking at the same set of classifiers that you're looking at. And we both see we both know what they mean. We both know that red means stop and green means go semantically. Exactly right. Or it could be an apple depending on depending on where you're going with that."
"Unknown","00;51;46;01","00;51;49;01","Right? So it could be it could be an inside joke. Yeah."
"Unknown","00;51;51;05","00;52;31;05","OK, cool. So there's the cone cone. Hopefully that was unpacked with some level of intelligibility. So now we can move into figure two where they attach this concrete diagram to measurement operators. Any set of measurement operators that are used to measure the states on the boundary that defines the relationship between A and B, this HIV between systems were the scientists we cared about."
"Unknown","00;52;31;05","00;52;57;01","Our context see were system A, we're making measurements from our perspective of a screen and we're setting the context of interpreting those observations in this situation. Totally. I could definitely be standing on the other side of that holographic screen, making my measurements from D from the inverted upside down pyramid. But they would be left and right pointing, measuring on to the same screen."
"Unknown","00;52;57;01","00;53;23;12","If I was System B and you were to me in that kind of context, cool. Anything else to know? Awesome. OK, so this is just some more. I think this slide talking about the cone cone diagram. But, but something that's to point out that there's the dual construction. That is when it commutes. I think I did say that already."
"Unknown","00;53;23;20","00;53;50;16","So when the info morph isn't on the same classifiers where all the arrows are reversed when it's reversible, then that's a commuting cone diagram. So non is the opposite of that. Right? So we're going to talk about non commutative as we go forward. And here what's one thing that I think is happening hopefully is like we have been discussing this in the context of two different observers having the same semantics from the same screen CND."
"Unknown","00;53;50;29","00;54;20;29","And then they say if C equals D or C prime equals D prime, then you can sort of draw another consistent world and this is sort of like a recognition semantics. And then the altcoin is like an operational or a generative semantics in a different way because it's like generating the observations or something like that. But there's going to be like a duel between the diamond and the hourglass nice."
"Unknown","00;54;21;19","00;54;57;18","Cool. OK, so all right, here we go. More of this commutative city. So so here they talk about commutative 80 as Bayesian coherence. And we talked a little bit about quantum coherence earlier. But there's this they're bringing this notion of Bayesian coherence up. So if you in commutative ity and Bayesian coherence as fundamental to the definition of measurements, like if I measure the length of the salamander and Daniel measures the length of the cell on the salamander we could get the same answer or not."
"Unknown","00;54;58;20","00;55;24;07","So and hence also to the definition of preparation or action on the environment so this suggests the spawn rule, which is that's what you blew up. I don't know what it is. Let's talk about it. Yeah, OK. Yeah, that was that was right. Let's go to the let's like let's let's let the authors unpack that one for us."
"Unknown","00;55;24;21","00;55;34;14","Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's the rule. So plot up again for me. I'll actually miss some so that's too far."
"Unknown","00;55;38;20","00;55;56;15","So they say the probability of obtaining X, the state X is sum of observations over states. It's observations of states. I should just buy this then the probability of obtaining a measurement. Is it a measurement as an observational outcome?"
"Unknown","00;55;58;22","00;56;34;01","In the description for coherently assigning amplitudes to components? OK, so anyway, we can let authors unpack on trust. I can't. I can't do it. Yeah. All right. Repeated measurements and system identification. So this is the section moving on. We develop in section three a generic formal description of how one quantum system identifies another quantum system as a persistent entity, a thing so here they're going to talk about thickness and measured records and compare that states by deploying deploying specific sequences of quantum reference frames."
"Unknown","00;56;34;11","00;56;59;15","And so, like, how do I know that Daniel is a different thing than me, right? Yeah, that's cool. Sometimes I think we're the same thing. We're doing the same thing at the same time. Is there a is a group thing? That's a group thing that is we're having a thing at my house that's it. All right. So they break this section."
"Unknown","00;56;59;19","00;57;28;26","So these sections get really awesome. So memory time and course creating the idea that a system must possess a quasi non equilibrium steady state solution to its density dynamics and hence be restricted to trajectories and a classical configuration of space that do not diverge exponentially over time in order to be observable as a thing immediately raises the issues of time as the measurable duration and the memory as persistent over measurable time."
"Unknown","00;57;30;01","00;57;59;17","And so that thing. So in this figure, the agent A can only detect changes in the mass density and employ them as basis for inference. If actions and actions, if a can write time ordered records to subsequently read from the memory sector, why so here the memory centers why the environment is E and this guy de here. I think it's better done in the next one."
"Unknown","00;57;59;18","00;58;34;09","Yeah, perfect. Move the next screen right here. Is this a time clock? A timestamp from one memory. That's the dynamics of internal time internal clock. That's what this of the agent we talked to already about the different parts of the screen and how some are being observed, some are unobserved. And then there's the memory sector and here, like the unobserved environment is the biggest set."
"Unknown","00;58;34;09","00;58;55;05","I think it's like mostly at least in this image. And so one question is just what does this represent in terms of our computers or our sensory apparatus? And how is it related to some of the work that they like sighted and some related work about attention and Bayesian graphs?"
"Unknown","00;58;57;29","00;59;30;17","This is a good representation. Also, like notice that your observations are different and not overlapping, but from your memory. Like if you're all memory, the new information isn't coming in. If you're not paying attention to anything, it can't have an effect like that type of thing. Right? And so this is an illustration of quantum reference frames required to write a readable memory of an observed environmental state so in Y, read the state from E and write it to Y respectively."
"Unknown","00;59;31;06","01;00;05;15","And the clock is a time quantum reference frame that defines the time coordinate. So at the time step you read the environment and then you write it to memory Y. There's papers, little perception, action, loop with memory, yeah. OK, in a loop. Sorry. Cool, awesome. The figure for it's a memory read write cycle defining one tick, but it's a g of the environment."
"Unknown","01;00;06;09","01;00;38;14","So here it's like you read from the environment measure a read measure and then write prepare. So like you prepare for the next time step. All quantum reference frames and the comparison functions are implemented by the quantum dynamic state, which is the big block arrow so if this were like an EEG headset that was measuring at 100 hertz 100 times per second, that would be like 100 classical information reads per second."
"Unknown","01;00;38;23","01;01;19;26","And then you could do signal processing. I think this is kind of like the time step is the sampling frequency of the experimental apparatus that's defined by this partitioning of the blanket fancy B slash holograph and then subsectors with these different interpretations of being like observed on observed or memory components. And the others say here they say finally we think of this pay as the weighted sum of all possible parts from the boundless boundary, from the boundary the fancy B at one state to the boundary, the fancy B at the next state."
"Unknown","01;01;20;06","01;01;46;13","So that is the internal dynamics are how the holographic screen is shifted from T to T plus one. And also this is where there's the cone. So the B are like those that line of A's that are all lined up. And then now it's bottlenecking this is the hourglass, then going back out. Yes, yes. Superimpose those figures for next time."
"Unknown","01;01;46;23","01;01;47;02","Yep."
"Unknown","01;01;49;08","01;02;18;22","Yeah. All right then memory time and of course, grading. So the internal dynamics that operate on those states to maintain a non equilibrium steady state since they are spatially localized inside of the boundary. And the boundary represents a Hilbert space where we talked earlier and it's not a physical space time decomposition. So the boundary is all those little spheres yeah."
"Unknown","01;02;19;29","01;02;42;28","Still, what is memory? Well, I said, yeah. And importantly, they say Figure four illustrates an important distinguishing distinction between classical and quantum representations of dynamics. Classical physics assumes a space time embedding and the quantum does not Hmm."
"Unknown","01;02;45;18","01;03;01;19","Interesting. Yeah. I'm curious about the self-evident thing that they mention here. Also love to ask them about that. OK, ok, cool learning and generative models. I'll let you take this one away."
"Unknown","01;03;03;26","01;03;26;20","This kind of took us almost briefly out of the quantum, but just to give an example of a simpler thing that this is like an elaboration or a generalization of a Bayesian approach like common filtering, which is just taking it's like a dragging an estimate through time as new information comes in and so that's what's happening in a sense here with formalism."
"Unknown","01;03;26;20","01;03;59;00","27, there's a prior and a posterior, and that's moving forward. So it's kind of like using this dragging filter through time, if that were classical information. And then there's something different happening with quantum and that's that that piece that we're going to keep on returning to. But this is like a Bayesian analog, and now the math is being used to describe these quantum systems yes."
"Unknown","01;03;59;10","01;04;26;14","OK, moving on to section 3.3, identifying and measuring systems embedded in so we have so far considered only observers a that measure the status of the observed environments E without decomposing E into systems that have their own specifics states. And the question of how an observer distinguishes a system from the environment in which s is embedded is central to classical cybernetics."
"Unknown","01;04;26;22","01;04;50;20","So I think that that's important. Like, are the other agents, do they matter? Are they just part of the environments? Like there's always that question of of you know, is is it its own thing, that other person over there? Or it's just my perception of my environment. And the second part there is like it's that sort of entity niche differentiation or delineation."
"Unknown","01;04;50;20","01;05;19;20","And then under the rubric of object persistence, the conceptual ity of thinness to cognitive and developmental psychology. So that's like children with peekaboo. And so it's like what connects the child playing peekaboo to the cybernetic entity differentiating causes? And how does Quantum with its observer based Relationality connect those areas?"
"Unknown","01;05;22;05","01;05;57;27","So here they use a special delineation for an environment that indicates the remainder of E when other systems in the environment are removed. And the question of how an observer distinguishes an external system from its surrounding environment prior to and as a precondition for measuring some state of interest is not something that people traditionally address because it is thermodynamically and computationally difficult, demanding special requirements on the observers which is cool."
"Unknown","01;05;58;26","01;06;29;11","All right, so figure five shows us a system. I think it just shows us like pretty much where we are systems s, you know, here you have A and B identified requires identifying some proper component. Ah, that maintains a constant state or density of time average samples as the pointer state of pi, right? So you need a pointer to point to the system or density of time."
"Unknown","01;06;29;11","01;06;50;08","Average samples of interest varies also like as this goes to attention, right? So what is your what are you pointing to? Well, oh, one other way. I was kind of seeing this one. Was this the it's like a clock hand. So this could be like a time scenario or it could be quantum with like the spin or with the angle in a complex field or something like that."
"Unknown","01;06;50;22","01;07;13;02","But you can decompose the total system s into the time invariant part, which is like your Python data structure and that's like saying here's the, the structure of the variables. And then just like the variables themself that are time variance, which is like the clock hands. So there'd be like the body of the clock, that's time invariant. And then there's the parts that are time varying."
"Unknown","01;07;14;11","01;07;41;05","I don't know how that R and P and s partitioning connects back, but that's what this kind of looks like. Yeah. I'm also kind of unsure about the pointer states, but I think it's the interest varies. So yeah, I think that, I think that points to attention like as your interest, as your point of focus shifts, like what are you pointing to?"
"Unknown","01;07;41;05","01;08;01;01","Because like as you look here in one direction, there is a set of variables that are there in that direction, like this wall, that corner, this frigerator or whatever. And then as you shift here, your interest or attention is shifting to a new set of variables, but you still know that that other set of variables is there. That goes to the object permanence that we were just talking about before."
"Unknown","01;08;01;07","01;08;15;21","So like I know that the Frigerator was my first point of view, but it's not and my second point of view, but I know that it's still there. That to me kind of is how I think about this. The pointer well, it'll be for the authors to maybe unpack this thing a little bit more for us."
"Unknown","01;08;18;03","01;09;03;26","Oh, OK. We did talk about the markup kernel versus the markup. Like Daniel, you so eloquently just one possibility is the blanket is the set of states that insulate the internal and the external, making them conditionally independent. And then the Markov kernel could be like that applied through time. And it's kind of like a Rama model. You could have like a temporal depth of an auto regression and then the temporal depth of the Markov kernel through time would be like what time steps are able to carry forward but let's discuss that with people who know better yes."
"Unknown","01;09;04;12","01;09;05;09","Cool. OK, good."
"Unknown","01;09;07;27","01;09;37;29","All right. So Non-committed tivity context switching. So we talked about non commutative ity. We talked about what commutative ity means and so not commutative, it would be the opposite of that. So here they say as emphasized by 400 years ago, a finite quantum of action partitions the set of all possible quantum measurement operators into a set of complementary non commuting pairs, the most well known being position and momentum."
"Unknown","01;09;37;29","01;10;11;21","So if you're trying to measure position of a particle, you can't simultaneously measure the momentum of the particle at the same time. So that's not commutative. Yes. And so why does context switching matter? They say an observer, an observer a cable switching between non commuting quantum reference frames must to maintain an operable memory, implement a clock that is invariant and the basis variations on the energy between A and B are the physical interaction between any of these."
"Unknown","01;10;12;05","01;10;41;16","If measurements made at clock ticks, I and J do not commute. However, the corresponding clock operations will not commute so non commuter tivity forces to which is time or the time step that it takes to record a memory to be unidirectional and have memory records to be encoded irreversibly with an accompanying expenditure so the internal clock thus defines t as entropic time."
"Unknown","01;10;41;23","01;11;04;16","I thought that was super interesting. So it's not like actual time, but it's like time that you paid entropy for like time that entropy was expended or time on the clock, that time requiring work. Right. Or over time that over time. OK, something to that end. All right."
"Unknown","01;11;07;08","01;11;56;15","Cool. So context switching between non commuting, quantum reference, things like position and momentum while holding the other quantum reference frame constant. So that's the one that's constant is here, the one that's rough in this figure 34 or equation let's just think it's a diagram that's sort of so in this diagram number 30 for these different pointer sectors you and V could be like the difference not moving and then you have overlapping but mutually communicating operators in the kinetic canonical context switched so that's like someone could be standing not at the train platform or on the train and be observing both of those people."
"Unknown","01;11;57;01","01;12;24;15","I suppose look different frame a bigger a bigger context. They each have their own local coherence, but it's interoperable. So it's part of a bigger umbrella, which is like the big C at the top cool. OK, OK, good. So that's diagram 34. If it fails to commute then the observables are non co deployable. So that's like position and momentum."
"Unknown","01;12;24;15","01;13;02;02","Those are non co deployable observables. So Non-committed tivity in the diagram. 34 has been specified in terms of nonexistence of a consistently definable joint probability distribution of conditionals. So that's like the conditional independence, right? This non could deployable code of probability of observables amounts to the occurrence of intrinsic quantum context reality in relationship to that diagram. So this goes really back it speaks a lot to what Chris talked to us about when we did number 17."
"Unknown","01;13;03;02","01;13;36;03","So let's get notes on this stuff yeah for sure. So they say in 4.2 below that context switching increases variation of three energy by generating prediction errors. And like if you're in one context and you have a prediction and then you move to another context that the same prediction your outcome's going to be different. So it increases variable variation of energy which makes minimizing very, very optimal energy and complying with the more difficult."
"Unknown","01;13;36;13","01;14;04;25","So like going by my same generative model from one context to another context to another context makes it hard, but can lead to radically better generative models. So you're always updating your model becomes more generalized, generalized or under different contexts. So yes, once context switching poses a fundamental challenge to any classical formulation of the FP and a fundamental exponent, I've not heard that before."
"Unknown","01;14;04;25","01;14;36;03","For a quantum formulation I wonder if this provides some evidence for us having a shared reality. And I've brought that up a couple of different times to here well, it's the fact thing or expression, which is to be explained or explicated next. OK, now let's get to the paper. What do you think? We're finally here. We made it this is the best part."
"Unknown","01;14;37;08","01;15;04;17","Yeah, the key for generic quantum systems. So all that background was to lead you here to the, to the place where we are now. So how the FP emerges in this setting and we're going to look at its asymptotic behavior considering how it addresses the fundamental problem that's posed by quantum context, such as, oh, all right, we're getting that all right."
"Unknown","01;15;05;06","01;15;32;22","We want to take this one we're going to go into more detail so that we can get a lot more into this start zero. But we've seen the variation of free energy in the context of perceptual inference where there's a surprise or and a divergence term that gets bounded. So this is kind of like the snapshot question given the incoming sensory observations, how should I update my generative model?"
"Unknown","01;15;32;26","01;15;41;15","It's learning. It's like a perceptual common filter yes. It doesn't have action involved."
"Unknown","01;15;43;23","01;16;39;01","Yes, they have this formulation of prediction error. And this is actually from Section 3.2. It's a representation of the prediction error of system error. Agent A, So this is our e k so OK, let's go to this black one first. So K is that internal time clock. So agent is internal time clock to account set the set up so fancy B is a holograph, it's being PB is the dynamics of the interaction partner B and then this M sub E with respect to K is the observable behavior of the holographic stream fancy be localized to the sector E up to time t a equals K so up to a leading up to this point is"
"Unknown","01;16;39;01","01;17;05;27","the observed environment just connect connected to the previous formalism e is the observed diamond that is it. So here this m a e this is the Agent A's generative model of the action of the under known dynamics. PB With respect to time, I think yeah. On the Markov or the Markov boundary hug of spring fancy B in sector E, the environment that we looked at."
"Unknown","01;17;06;06","01;17;48;27","OK, which is kind of like saying you only need to have a generative model on where your expecting to find observations if you're going to measure just the thermometer, you make a generative model with just a thermometer and that's how you get the cone co cone diamond hourglass that isn't like with extraneous or redundant or incompatible elements so here this equation prediction error, it's like e r city vertices K this agent's agent A's total reducible uncertainty about agent or system B at time to equals K."
"Unknown","01;17;49;16","01;18;10;23","So so this is like the uncertainty about another system within the environments. That's why the system separation that we saw in figure five was important. So if we're going to define a system, we're going to look at how other systems interact on the holographic screen. And then we're going to think about what can we predict what that system is doing or not like the environment is not doing anything because it's just sitting there, it's environment."
"Unknown","01;18;10;23","01;18;37;14","But that's at any given time set snapshot. So it is therefore an upper bound occupies a proposal analogous to F of Pi that we just looked at earlier that Daniel mentions the upper bound surprise. Cool. OK, here we go. Getting into how the quantum does the everything. All right. So a generic quantum system a will act so as to minimize e.r."
"Unknown","01;18;37;14","01;19;22;00","SIEV-X for each deployable quantum reference frame. So a system has different deployable quantum reference frames. That's analogous to a sense of hearing, vision, taste, smell, temperature, sensing, etc. many different deployable quantum reference frames. And I will minimize my total reducible uncertainty at each timestamp for each quantum reference frame. Yes. So they're quote. OK, so a trivial agent can be viewed as executing a trivial quantum reference frame as only exercising choice of basis for writing to and reading from the holographic experience as a whole."
"Unknown","01;19;22;06","01;19;28;10","And so satisfies the FP trivially ok."
"Unknown","01;19;30;18","01;20;19;26","Let's have a round table on what that means. We should do it yeah. 4.2. That's it. Or 40.1. There's your equation. 40. Nice there it is. All right. So the authors say uncertainty and prediction error and hence variation of be energy is generated in the correct formalism by systems in principle, ignorance of both the state of B and the dynamics of B of its interaction partner B as the bits A reads from the boundary fancy b r written by p b this is like the agent or system B is writing to the boundary."
"Unknown","01;20;20;25","01;20;45;14","So A's ability to predict the future states of its observable sectors and hence to minimize that e r. So that's for each quantum reference frame x through equation 40, which we just looked at, and we're going to look at it again depends on its ability to predict the behavior of PB locally on each observable sector. So I have to be able to predict how Daniel's going to smell, how he's going to look."
"Unknown","01;20;45;21","01;21;07;22","So so my ability of looking at my other agents in the environment over each, what temperature he's going to be, is he going to have cold hands or both Z or something like that? My ability to minimize my Variational three energy over another system in the environment depends on my ability to predict their behavior right into the environments on all of those quantum preference sectors."
"Unknown","01;21;09;01","01;21;21;06","And that's good enough. OK, an animal, for example, must employ its available senses, hence its observable sectors to predict the nutritional value of food. OK, here we go."
"Unknown","01;21;25;19","01;22;00;27","So this is where I go. It gets a little fuzzy for me. So I was going up until this point. They say the weak interaction that allows severability between A and B is significant. So HIV, which is the physical interaction between A and B, and hence the boundary between A and B, must have significantly lower dimension than the physical location of B, and hence the observable dynamics of B."
"Unknown","01;22;01;09","01;22;29;16","If the weak interaction limit is to hold true, my brain is melting now all the way down. So anyway, what do you think? Do you have any thoughts on that then? I'm not sure if it means that the sparse coupling has to be sufficiently sparse. It has to be a lot lower dimension than the system. Otherwise is it's not appropriately bottlenecked."
"Unknown","01;22;30;06","01;22;54;25","So there's a lower dimensional interface that's like sparse coupling. It's physical interaction in the H frame, and it's the holograph slash mark off blanket with the fancy B but it's the interaction is with the H, and that's kind of what we'll discuss. Like are we talking about physical interactions of quantum systems or we're talking about any mechanistic interaction between any mechanistic system?"
"Unknown","01;22;55;07","01;23;20;00","Or are we talking about statistical edges, statistical interactions like an interaction term between two different systems? Yeah. And so just what I've written down here kind of paraphrases what they said up there. So the ability for a system to predict the dynamics of System B depends on the dynamic complexity of the interaction between System B, which is PBE on the holographic screen."
"Unknown","01;23;20;00","01;23;43;23","So what is B writing to the holographic screen like? What is my refrigerator writing to the holographic screen? I would say that's a trivial system, right? It's like outputting a little bit of heat it keeps my food a little bit cold most of the time. So I can, with pretty good reliability, predict the dynamics of my refrigerator. I have less ability to predict the dynamics of Daniel or my children who are like total agents of chaos."
"Unknown","01;23;43;25","01;24;19;00","Right? So but but I want to minimize my uncertainty. I'm pretty certain about what my refrigerator is doing. I don't know what my kids are doing when I leave the room. Yeah. So that that kind of made sense to me. But that Schrodinger's cat to Blue's children, pipeline we just got there. Anything else now let's moving forward. OK, so here is a little diagram of what it looks like for me to predict the dynamics of my refrigerator."
"Unknown","01;24;19;22","01;24;42;15","So so this is six a it says the trivial agents in figure 16. They look like a noise source say yes my refrigerator is a source of noise. It just like it actually literally makes noise and puts out a little bit of heat. So it says emission of fucking radiation from a black hole provides perhaps the most accurate example of such a noise source."
"Unknown","01;24;42;26","01;25;00;09","While the dimension inside the black hole can be arbitrarily large, the internal dynamics are uncouple odd from the classical information encoded on the horizon and hence have no classical computational power. Yes. OK, maybe my refrigerator has more computational power than a black hole. I don't know."
"Unknown","01;25;04;17","01;25;36;27","OK, ok, we'll move on. Here we go forward. So the more interesting parts of A's options space for prediction are shown in panel B, C, and D where B is non-trivial. If B is non-trivial, it displays at least one quantum reference frame X of B like. So that's sector x of B acting on sector B as discussed in section 2.5, B sectors must be mutually D coherent."
"Unknown","01;25;37;12","01;26;05;09","So the action of the dynamics on the sector of B is independent of action elsewhere is this independence that makes prediction possible. If X, A, B does not overlap any sector for A, B will appear trivial. So like if the green cone is totally removed from the red cone, it's like it's a trivial thing like if my kids are here right now, they're not immediately acting on my environment."
"Unknown","01;26;06;27","01;26;44;21","So they're trivial, I guess, or this made me think about like if someone was speaking a language that you didn't understand semantically, not even in the Qs and in the metadata, like there's kind of speaking past each other even though you're sharing a screen. But that's like an intentional informational interpretation. And this is in a quantum interpretation about the shared semantic frame ranging from identical to overlapping to disjoint so in a disjoint where I'm trying to think of what else would be there."
"Unknown","01;26;44;21","01;27;06;28","So like a different language is good, but like what about something like radiation emission right? Like so something's emitting radiation, but I can't perceive that radiation. So like the thing emitting radiation doesn't appear like it's impacting my environment at all. So maybe something like that and I'm like maybe unobserved the part of B, the holograph that's not in the observed or memory sector."
"Unknown","01;27;07;20","01;27;38;04","Yeah, like that. OK, well, so the interesting cases are the ones in which and these observable sectors overlap. In this case intuitively in which A and B can see each other and hence interact in the ordinary non typical sense of that term in panel B, sector X be fully contains X A Yeah. OK, so let's, let's look at the, at the full figure now."
"Unknown","01;27;38;04","01;27;58;18","So we saw all the ones from trivial and non-trivial. OK, so a is a trivial agent, so they're not putting out any B encodes A sector that contains X A but is bigger. So I like to think about this as like a teacher. So we're going to get into like teaching and learning. So this is like a teacher that knows more than the student can pick up."
"Unknown","01;27;58;18","01;28;31;22","Maybe in that kind of way. So the bits on SB but outside say encode non-local hidden variables and then in diagrams see the sectors of X, A and B overlap. The areas of non overlap become noise sources. So here it's like you know, I can understand you when you speak English, but not when you speak Chinese. So like when you're speaking saying is this non-overlapping frame anyway, how do you think about them?"
"Unknown","01;28;33;13","01;29;02;29","This is just speculative. But in the case of B, so we're the observer investigator, eh? So in the case of of Frame B, there's so much information like in the linear regression data set by Quantum that there's basically anywhere we look we can totally get all the information. So it looks like there's non-local hidden variables because it's like super determines in the case of C, the regression has like an R squared of point five or something or point six."
"Unknown","01;29;03;17","01;29;45;14","And so some of it lines up semantically. But if we of course had the perfect attention or the perfect observation, we would be able to make a better regression but then I'm just trying to take the linear regression, normal information framework. And then that's where having people familiar with quantum will be really helpful. And I hope they find this discussion and the upcoming dot one and two as like just the introduction of hopefully some bidirectional exchange because this may be something where active inference is complimentary."
"Unknown","01;29;45;23","01;30;18;19","Isomorphic incompatible, like let's not lose touch with the active inference rather than also how is this relating to quantum and that's how we're going to get up in that quadrant where they're both are yeah. So in D where the sector of X is equal to the sector of IRBs, so the sector X of A is equal to the center of B, so that means that the quantum reference frame is identical."
"Unknown","01;30;18;19","01;30;38;20","It's an identical frame like we are sharing a quantum reference. We're both standing on the platform or both on the train. And so that sector is equal to Sector B, any variation of free energy. There between A, B is generated by insufficient learning. It's not like we both can't see the train or we both can't see the platform because we're in the same place."
"Unknown","01;30;38;20","01;31;18;00","But so there's somebody there is doing some insufficient planning. If this is the case, then you just simply need to sample more. But you already have the right scope and you're not at risk of oversampling but it's a little bit more quantum cool. And that brings us to this beautiful formulation in equation. 41 variation of the energy equals noise us insufficient learning so noise is capturing that bottom left part that we just discussed and insufficient is capturing the darkness."
"Unknown","01;31;18;23","01;31;55;24","And so if it was more and more overlapping, then you want more and more sampling, but less and less overlapping is going to require less and less learning or learning will be less and less helpful. So how is this compatible, incompatible with the active framings that we've seen for V and EFI? And then how is this compatible or similar to some of the Formalisms and the framings that are really familiar to statisticians and to quantum information scientists?"
"Unknown","01;31;59;17","01;32;30;05","And I would also like to know what teachers think. So if you're a teacher and you're watching this like like what is your take on that? Do you minimize energy by minimizing line noise and, you know, maximizing learning or or like that? OK, cool. So asymptotic behavior of that feedback. So we have these two formulations surprising the divergence which we've seen before in a similar way many times and then noise plus insufficient."
"Unknown","01;32;30;05","01;33;05;04","Right? So now we want to say how is it minimized? How does an agent act in accordance with that what do you want to add here? Yeah, just the road and comparing equations 35 and 41, it becomes clear what this amounts to. A system so evidence is by behaving in a way that minimizes noise while improving learning. And so here they're juxtaposing the F of pi on surprising divergence, decomposition of variation or free energy with this noise."
"Unknown","01;33;05;04","01;33;35;25","Plus insofar isn't learning framing. So we'll have time to unpack that and hopefully connect it to some systems. But it's just a very interesting way that they have reached this trade off. Learning requires seeking like and how do we get there? Well, that goes back to the to the context switching like if you're always in the same context, like if you're always, you know, listening to the same music, you're never going to learn any new music."
"Unknown","01;33;35;25","01;34;05;18","That someone else might like. Or so you have to kind of change, change your context, maybe take it to someone else perspective. But, you know, seeking what but we'll get there yes. OK, so let's save this. Let's save this for that one. But the asymptotic behavior of the FPP, let's just say, why does it matter? Why are we studying asymptotic systems?"
"Unknown","01;34;06;18","01;34;41;17","What is happening with the EPI? Asymptotically, asymptotically meaning what? But I think that that's a large discussion about entanglement and where everything's going and how it relates to the principle of unitary yes. OK, cool. Just think we'll get there in one year. OK, awesome. Taught us entirely free yeah. That's a good answer. Yeah. There's only one more slide as the how FPP drives is it becomes the principle of unity."
"Unknown","01;34;41;24","01;35;09;02","So we can we can discuss that and balance better. How does it does it. Why does it matter? Why would it matter? Cool. OK, discussion Travis some place. OK, we're just going to we're not going to discuss any of the discussion here. We're going to look at the summary of the results as they give it. And then we're going to have a bunch of slides."
"Unknown","01;35;09;02","01;35;36;21","We'll just be like a topic and then with the dart one and the dart two, we're just going to go to that topic and probably start with just reading a quote from that paragraph or hearing the authors or the participants perspective on each of those topics. Cool. OK, joining you can go for the summary come on, help me."
"Unknown","01;35;36;21","01;36;09;10","OK, yeah. Do you read the three? Just the three. The big text at the very beginning but the first summary of the results that the authors say is that they can formulate this agents or information gathering and using system, not just within the classical information theory context that we've been talking about informational and strategic agents, but in the context of quantum information theory."
"Unknown","01;36;10;25","01;36;55;29","Point two is not just using a generic agent or information gathering using system, but specifically connecting the FSP to its quantum theoretic formulation for generic quantum systems. Insert all the asterisks and other symbols about what that really means and about how active inference plays in, et cetera, and then three, the part that we didn't really go into in this discussion when formulated as the generic principle of quantum information theory, the FSP is asymptotically equivalent to the principle of unitary and under asked in the asymptotically in what parameter just exactly to what ends in what parameter."
"Unknown","01;36;56;20","01;37;26;26","So that's the summary of the results. But the authors then embark on an awesome series of kind of like standalone paragraph vignettes related to a wide set of other ideas. So for each of these ideas, all ask the question on the top and then if you want to give a thought on that topic or not. OK, so the first time we let them answer the question."
"Unknown","01;37;26;26","01;38;45;23","So it says actually anatomically perfect learning. So that's the asymptotically perfect finding, the drive to unitary on what axis? So anyway, OK, but what is observation that's deep several paragraphs they wrote about that and this quote, the idea of a metaphysically solipsistic or solipsistic theory of observation is self-contradictory what we'll discuss? OK, what is an agent? And again, we'll keep in mind classical physics, classical fip, non-classical, fip, that where are we bigger from earlier all copy that one back in because this is definitely like a where are we like what are the similarities and differences in the agent model for FIP and not and for quantum and not any thoughts are like things that you'll"
"Unknown","01;38;45;23","01;38;52;00","want to ask about this. What is free choice? I think that's so that was cool."
"Unknown","01;38;54;28","01;39;38;27","Yeah, and like do you get degrees of freedom or free choice over cognitive parameters? Action parameters? Which one do you want choice over or all them preferences? OK, what is self evidencing? So we've talked in several other discussions about classical or Bayesian inference as self evidencing, like finding oneself in likely states expected and preferred states how is that different in active than other physics?"
"Unknown","01;39;39;27","01;40;21;22","That's like going from the bottom left to the bottom right and then how is this different within active inference with this quantum integration and boost yes. OK, what of asymptotic behavior yes. So I think here it's the asymptotically perfect learning what is a gauge theoretic perspective? I don't even want to open that can of worms at all. So yeah, also this is like the quantum formulation."
"Unknown","01;40;21;27","01;40;51;17","The quantum formalism is background free space is simply an observable represented by a cure. If that a system may or may not deploy, it can therefore play no on tic role in maintaining distinctions between systems this reflects the general role of physical 3D space in quantum field theories space is there to enforce super ability C60 eight for general discussion from a cage theoretical perspective."
"Unknown","01;40;52;24","01;41;26;06","So like the space between is what I'm going to also copy in a comment that I wrote in the lecture, just anyone who asks questions, you know, just put it in live chat or put as a comment under the video or email us, but it helps us and it's awesome questions that people ask. OK, we will definitely look at this before we do the one."
"Unknown","01;41;26;07","01;41;51;11","And so if you. You're welcome. To join us, get in touch if you want to participate live. But also we will ask these questions and we leave them in the chat. Yeah, OK, let's go to close out almost kind of again their applications to biological cognition. And then they wrote in this paper in addition to the results listed above, the current framework."
"Unknown","01;41;52;03","01;42;22;14","So the paper we've been discussing has a variety of more specifically biological consequences, some of which have been discussed already in citation 13. And here's citation 13 fields Glazebrook 11 minimal physical ism as a skill free substrate for cognition and consciousness. And here's the sections of that paper. And so yeah, it's just kind of cool to connect back to the basal cognition computational boundaries of a self discussion that we've been having last year number 39 just today."
"Unknown","01;42;25;00","01;42;55;26","And we also have neurons as hierarchies of quantum reference patterns which I haven't read yet that this was just published in January of 22. I think that was released with this paper. So I'm excited to read that work also. Awesome. So yeah, what are the biological implications? OK, quantum frames for foraging. So unique explanations and predictions. It predicts, for example, that moving in ordinary 3D space does not require a cure."
"Unknown","01;42;56;00","01;43;18;13","For Euclidean space and hence does not require an experience of space. So like the fish could swim without knowing 3D and then from a classical perspective. OK, so I guess that means non pure and or non quantum. This is certainly true. Evidenced by place in grid cells, in mammalian brains, et cetera."
"Unknown","01;43;20;14","01;44;00;24","And then what happens when we integrate FFP in the classical well, the course screening which would be mandated by et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, we'll explore, OK, then what happens if we go from classical to classical FP and then now go from FFP to quantum FFP? Still thinking about like foraging or information seeking and processing OK, and actuality, we talked about that a lot in 17 one but just what is context environment surrounding?"
"Unknown","01;44;01;16","01;44;35;24","Is this what people mean when they say set the context for the dinner party or give context for a video that they sent? What is that everyday sense of context and what is this sense of context OK, next steps. So these are the last two lines of the paper and they wrote in closing, we hope that we have shown to readers familiar with the FFP and Oxygen Inference Framework that quantum effects are worth considering, both theoretically and in experimental design."
"Unknown","01;44;36;12","01;45;17;02","For readers not familiar with the classical FFP, but literate in quantum theory or vice versa, we hope this paper has gone some way to contextualize your cure in sense, making via Markov blankets and their underlying holographic screens. So this is like saying if you were familiar with either quantum, not FP, upper left or classical FFP bottom right, or maybe bottom left neither, then this paper hopefully brought you towards that upper right corner of quantum FFP."
"Unknown","01;45;17;22","01;46;03;29","And just like the classical classical way to end an FFP paper was like we expected and prefer that this reduces your uncertainty. This is like the classical quantum way to end the paper by saying We hope it's context realized your cure. F dog clever ending to a very complex paper and it was really fun to work on this for a couple of weeks leading up to these discussions and what else would you say as we now head into that art one and two?"
"Unknown","01;46;05;05","01;46;38;15","So thanks for putting up with our rough interpretation of this paper. And we hope you didn't suffer too badly. Yeah, we tried. Yeah. If, if you know more or would like to contribute to helping others know more about these topics, that's what we're working on all the time in acronym flop. So if you've made it this far and you're riled up or curious about something, then get in touch and let's try to make all of this more hands global and able to be translated and learned and applied."
"Unknown","01;46;39;11","01;46;59;29","Let's try to align our quantum reference frames with respect to active, what else can we say? All right, so see you all so thanks a lot, Blue. Thanks also, Jason, and thanks everybody who will participate in the upcoming ones too. So later by."
