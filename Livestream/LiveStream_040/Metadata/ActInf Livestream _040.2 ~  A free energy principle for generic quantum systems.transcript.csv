"Speaker 1","00;00;28;12","00;00;57;27","Hello, everyone. This is Active Labs, live stream number 40.2 on March 24th. 20, 22. Welcome to the Acton Flop. We're a participatory online lab that is communicating learning and practicing applied active inference. This is a recorded in an archived livestream. So please provide us with feedback so we can improve our work hear about your cue RF All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome."
"Speaker 1","00;00;58;03","00;01;10;29","We may actually have to change this to all. Cure F a welcome. And we'll follow video etiquette for livestreams. Check out active inference dot org to learn more about the activities in the lab."
"Speaker 1","00;01;13;03","00;01;46;27","Today in 40.2. We are continuing to learn and discuss this awesome paper. A Free Energy Principle for generic quantum systems by Fields First in Glazebrook and 11. And we're really appreciative to have several of the authors joining us today. And in this data, we're just going to have introductions and then jump right in to several of the notes that we left for ourself from last time and see where else it goes."
"Speaker 1","00;01;46;27","00;02;17;17","And anyone can write a comment in the live chat and we'll just say hello again, pick up with some threads that were left unspooled in the dot one and see where we get in the dot too and how we continue going forward. So I'm Daniel, I'm a researcher in California, and I will pass it to Dean Morning."
"Speaker 2","00;02;17;17","00;02;31;06","My name's Dean. I'm in Calgary in Canada. My emphasis, I think, is on the practice part of active inference and seeing how it gets applied in in different contexts situations. I'll pass it to Blue."
"Speaker 3","00;02;33;20","00;02;57;17","And Blue tonight. I'm an independent researcher in New Mexico, and I will be facilitating the discussion today. But let me pass it off to Stephen if he's still here. Stephen, I'm here your muted. Stephen we still don't hear you."
"Speaker 1","00;02;58;03","00;03;00;22","Okay. Thanks, Steve. Continue on to."
"Speaker 3","00;03;05;26","00;03;06;05","Dave."
"Speaker 1","00;03;06;05","00;03;08;23","I don't see also left. Okay. Okay."
"Speaker 3","00;03;09;02","00;03;16;20","Let's continue. Let's go to the others. We go so let's pass it to Mike first since we have audio this time."
"Speaker 4","00;03;21;06","00;03;42;12","Yes, I yeah. This is Mike Levin. I do biology at Tufts trying to understand what what living systems are doing at all scales and how intelligence manifests in various unconventional embodiments across them. And they compete in and cooperate across scales to give us the amazing phenomena we see in biology."
"Speaker 3","00;03;44;19","00;04;00;16","Awesome. Thank you. Dave, would you like to say hello? Introduce yourself maybe no audio also. Okay. How about Carl? Would you like to say hello?"
"Speaker 5","00;04;02;09","00;04;20;25","Yes, I would. Hello. I'm Carl. I'm one of the coauthors on the paper. I'm a neuroscientist from London. I have to confess, I'm a bit of a passenger and admirer of this paper, so I'm here to learn as much to as trans the questions. So I'll pass it on to Chris who."
"Speaker 6","00;04;27;00","00;04;27;23","Hi, I'm."
"Speaker 7","00;04;27;23","00;04;30;29","Chris Fields. I'm also an independent researcher."
"Speaker 6","00;04;32;07","00;04;32;25","Working."
"Speaker 7","00;04;32;25","00;04;33;07","Sort of."
"Speaker 6","00;04;33;07","00;04;33;17","On the."
"Speaker 7","00;04;33;17","00;04;50;14","Boundaries between physics and biology. And information science and sort of convinced that those are all three the same actual discipline. So this is a paper that expands on that theme a little bit."
"Speaker 3","00;04;52;25","00;05;19;26","Great. Thank you. So I think where we left off last time was talking about how the FP is asymptotically the principle of unitary. And maybe, Chris, would you mind leaving this off here? And if you want to point out a specific maybe formalism or place where we should start, I think it was the very last formalism in the in the paper actually."
"Speaker 3","00;05;20;24","00;05;24;11","But maybe if you would talk us through that, that would be super appreciated."
"Speaker 6","00;05;29;16","00;05;34;14","Okay. Oh, well, let's let's talk first informally."
"Speaker 7","00;05;35;08","00;05;36;08","Just about."
"Speaker 6","00;05;37;25","00;05;38;20","The motivation."
"Speaker 7","00;05;38;20","00;05;42;09","For this idea and how it might make sense."
"Speaker 6","00;05;42;15","00;05;46;12","Intuitively. And again, I'll go."
"Speaker 7","00;05;46;12","00;05;54;04","Back to calls paper from 2019 the free energy principle for a particular physics."
"Speaker 6","00;05;55;01","00;05;56;04","Which, which."
"Speaker 7","00;05;56;07","00;05;57;29","The current paper is obviously."
"Speaker 6","00;05;57;29","00;05;58;16","Modeled."
"Speaker 7","00;05;58;16","00;06;04;23","After in a certain way. And as we discussed last time I think."
"Speaker 6","00;06;05;04","00;06;06;10","Of what."
"Speaker 7","00;06;06;23","00;06;09;24","Carl was able to show in particular physics."
"Speaker 6","00;06;10;24","00;06;18;20","Was that the idea of the very intuitive idea of a thing of."
"Speaker 7","00;06;18;24","00;06;19;22","Something."
"Speaker 6","00;06;19;22","00;06;26;11","That exists and importantly maintains."
"Speaker 7","00;06;26;11","00;06;32;15","Its identity as a single system over time."
"Speaker 6","00;06;33;13","00;06;35;02","And what that means."
"Speaker 7","00;06;35;02","00;06;38;22","Is that it's it can be measured by some other system."
"Speaker 6","00;06;40;06","00;06;42;22","Of and it can be."
"Speaker 7","00;06;42;22","00;06;45;07","Measured repeatedly and reliably."
"Speaker 6","00;06;47;09","00;06;48;13","Over time by."
"Speaker 7","00;06;48;13","00;06;53;22","Some other system. So something this is associated with repeated measure of building."
"Speaker 6","00;06;55;19","00;06;59;03","And what code is able to show and."
"Speaker 7","00;06;59;13","00;07;00;29","In particular physics was."
"Speaker 6","00;07;00;29","00;07;01;16","That if."
"Speaker 7","00;07;01;16","00;07;03;26","We assume that something is a thing."
"Speaker 6","00;07;04;14","00;07;05;29","That then we're."
"Speaker 7","00;07;05;29","00;07;17;13","Effectively assuming that it has a stable, non-equilibrium, steady state density and therefore we're assuming that it has a Markov block, and therefore we can."
"Speaker 6","00;07;17;13","00;07;20;23","Treat it as implementing."
"Speaker 7","00;07;20;23","00;07;22;23","Active inference as."
"Speaker 6","00;07;23;02","00;07;23;13","Of."
"Speaker 7","00;07;24;05","00;07;34;01","Constantly predicting its own future existence and behaving so as to make that prediction come true to the extent."
"Speaker 6","00;07;34;01","00;07;37;05","That it can and how."
"Speaker 7","00;07;37;26","00;07;38;09","Such."
"Speaker 6","00;07;38;09","00;07;42;13","Behavior may be prevented or overcome."
"Speaker 7","00;07;42;13","00;07;51;16","By its environment so the environment of some thing may cause it to cease to exist."
"Speaker 6","00;07;53;01","00;07;55;13","Oh, you know, the thing could be a."
"Speaker 7","00;07;55;13","00;07;58;02","Marble sitting on a table, and its."
"Speaker 6","00;07;58;02","00;07;59;10","Environment could."
"Speaker 7","00;07;59;10","00;08;05;20","Include a sledgehammer that's about to come down on top of it. And had destroy its thing."
"Speaker 6","00;08;05;20","00;08;15;02","This But as long as the environment doesn't do the out of the."
"Speaker 7","00;08;15;02","00;08;17;29","The object can continue."
"Speaker 6","00;08;18;22","00;08;19;04","To."
"Speaker 7","00;08;20;05","00;08;27;04","To execute active inference and maintain its mark of blanket by so do it. And of course its Markov."
"Speaker 6","00;08;27;04","00;08;28;11","Blanket is what."
"Speaker 7","00;08;28;11","00;08;32;09","Defines it as a separate entity, as a."
"Speaker 6","00;08;32;09","00;08;32;25","Thing."
"Speaker 7","00;08;33;11","00;08;38;07","That's distinct from its environment. So let's translate."
"Speaker 6","00;08;38;07","00;08;38;18","All of."
"Speaker 7","00;08;38;18","00;08;39;16","That into quantum."
"Speaker 6","00;08;39;16","00;08;47;15","Theory of in quantum theory we have this notion."
"Speaker 7","00;08;47;15","00;08;49;23","Of interaction as measurement."
"Speaker 6","00;08;49;24","00;08;50;13","Already."
"Speaker 7","00;08;50;28","00;09;11;08","And we have a notion of interaction. There's information exchange on Reddit. So it's very natural to take this whole picture and, and, and make the notion of measurement over time. Precise in this using this quantum theoretic formalism."
"Speaker 6","00;09;12;24","00;09;13;24","And quantum theory."
"Speaker 7","00;09;13;24","00;09;15;14","Also gives us a."
"Speaker 6","00;09;15;23","00;09;17;00","A very natural."
"Speaker 7","00;09;17;00","00;09;18;15","Implementation of a more called."
"Speaker 6","00;09;18;15","00;09;21;18","Blanket of which in."
"Speaker 7","00;09;21;20","00;09;22;17","Physics is called."
"Speaker 6","00;09;22;23","00;09;23;14","Holographic."
"Speaker 7","00;09;23;14","00;09;24;01","Screen."
"Speaker 6","00;09;25;03","00;09;26;00","And holographic."
"Speaker 7","00;09;26;00","00;09;30;24","Screens were introduced back in the seventies to talk about."
"Speaker 6","00;09;30;24","00;09;34;17","Black holes. Well, but a holographic screen."
"Speaker 7","00;09;35;01","00;09;40;13","Is is just a reformulation of the concept of a more called blanket. It's it's."
"Speaker 6","00;09;40;17","00;09;41;24","A boundary."
"Speaker 7","00;09;42;02","00;10;18;07","That encodes information and specifically it's a boundary between two systems that encodes all of the information that one system can have about the other. So it does just whatever work it does, it provides an information encoding boundary that gives the systems on the two sides identities for each other by distinguishing them. And this notion of identity and quantum theory corresponds to severability."
"Speaker 7","00;10;19;01","00;10;23;09","Severability just means lack of entanglement. So if the."
"Speaker 6","00;10;23;09","00;10;29;06","Joint if you have a two things or a thing."
"Speaker 7","00;10;29;06","00;10;30;06","In its environment."
"Speaker 6","00;10;31;18","00;10;34;19","Then if they're not entangled."
"Speaker 7","00;10;35;14","00;10;46;19","You can talk about their states independently. If they are entangled, then you can't talk about their states independently. And so the idea of fighting those goes away since thing this."
"Speaker 6","00;10;47;22","00;10;48;11","Implies."
"Speaker 7","00;10;48;11","00;10;55;05","Having some sort of conditionally independent state right now since that can actually be written down."
"Speaker 6","00;10;56;20","00;10;57;20","So all of."
"Speaker 7","00;10;57;20","00;10;59;12","This fits together rather nicely."
"Speaker 6","00;11;00;28","00;11;04;02","And so if we go back to."
"Speaker 7","00;11;04;16","00;11;05;25","Particular the physics."
"Speaker 6","00;11;06;29","00;11;12;21","Of the idea of active."
"Speaker 7","00;11;12;21","00;11;13;10","Inference."
"Speaker 6","00;11;15;21","00;11;18;16","How emerges from that."
"Speaker 7","00;11;18;16","00;11;19;20","Paper as a."
"Speaker 6","00;11;19;28","00;11;22;13","Fundamental underlying."
"Speaker 7","00;11;22;15","00;11;23;27","Principle of physics."
"Speaker 6","00;11;25;15","00;11;34;13","That that tells us what we mean by that or system."
"Speaker 7","00;11;35;07","00;11;41;00","That's identifiable over time So this is this becomes."
"Speaker 6","00;11;41;00","00;11;46;23","A very deep principle of deeper than Newton's."
"Speaker 7","00;11;46;23","00;11;53;01","Laws, because Newton's laws actually talk about objects that are identifiable over time."
"Speaker 6","00;11;53;11","00;11;55;17","And the the."
"Speaker 7","00;11;56;00","00;12;01;11","The the free energy principle and the idea of active inference tells us what we."
"Speaker 6","00;12;01;15","00;12;02;00","Mean."
"Speaker 7","00;12;02;29","00;12;05;24","When we talk about something being identifiable over time."
"Speaker 6","00;12;07;14","00;12;09;00","So if this is a if this."
"Speaker 7","00;12;09;00","00;12;11;16","Is a fundamental principle of physics, then."
"Speaker 6","00;12;11;21","00;12;13;06","One would expect."
"Speaker 7","00;12;14;02","00;12;17;09","There would have some relationship to the principle of utility."
"Speaker 6","00;12;18;07","00;12;18;23","Which is the."
"Speaker 7","00;12;18;23","00;12;26;20","Most fundamental principle of quantum theory. It is it's typically axiom one, which one writes down the axioms of quantum theory."
"Speaker 6","00;12;27;11","00;12;29;18","Oh, was was Axiom one."
"Speaker 7","00;12;29;21","00;13;09;12","By Norman's formulation back in the thirties or forties? I can't remember which. So it's the principle of unitary. The principle of unitary is just the principle that in a closed system information is conserved. So information is neither created or destroyed in a closed system. So it's a fundamental conservation law, and it's exactly analogous to the principle of conservation of energy by the conservation of energy says in a closed system, energy is neither created nor destroyed."
"Speaker 7","00;13;09;15","00;13;16;08","It's conserved. So the principle of unitary just says this for information as well as energy."
"Speaker 6","00;13;16;24","00;13;18;00","And we know that information."
"Speaker 7","00;13;18;00","00;13;19;24","And energy are very closely."
"Speaker 6","00;13;19;24","00;13;24;05","Linked. Oh, bye bye. Land ours."
"Speaker 7","00;13;24;07","00;13;25;04","Principle or."
"Speaker 6","00;13;25;04","00;13;25;18","By."
"Speaker 7","00;13;26;21","00;13;29;24","Boltzmann a definition of entropy."
"Speaker 6","00;13;30;10","00;13;30;28","Or all of."
"Speaker 7","00;13;30;28","00;13;35;03","These other connections that make physics informational."
"Speaker 6","00;13;38;21","00;13;40;21","So how does."
"Speaker 7","00;13;41;04","00;13;45;29","The principle of active inference relate to the principle of unitary? What does it say."
"Speaker 6","00;13;46;15","00;13;48;08","About all of."
"Speaker 7","00;13;49;14","00;13;55;15","The conservation of information, or what does the conservation of information tell us about the principle."
"Speaker 6","00;13;55;15","00;13;55;24","Of."
"Speaker 7","00;13;56;06","00;13;58;13","The principle of active interest free energy?"
"Speaker 6","00;14;00;04","00;14;01;19","Well, the first thing is that."
"Speaker 7","00;14;01;22","00;14;06;09","You know, charity applies to closed systems. So so."
"Speaker 6","00;14;06;14","00;14;15;16","The environment pairs and active."
"Speaker 7","00;14;15;16","00;14;27;00","Interests characterizes what the thing is doing in response to its environment. And of course, it also characterizes what the environment is doing in response to the thing."
"Speaker 6","00;14;28;25","00;14;29;29","And another benefit."
"Speaker 7","00;14;29;29","00;14;35;15","Of quantum theory is that it makes the symmetry between any system in its environment."
"Speaker 6","00;14;35;27","00;14;37;28","All manifest."
"Speaker 7","00;14;38;28","00;14;49;12","Makes it very explicit of that. It's already explicit in the free energy principle. And in the mark all black, it has two sides and."
"Speaker 6","00;14;49;28","00;14;52;15","Of the."
"Speaker 7","00;14;52;24","00;14;59;24","The system acting on its environment is the same as the environment. Sensing the system."
"Speaker 6","00;15;01;00","00;15;01;15","And."
"Speaker 7","00;15;01;25","00;15;08;14","In the same way that the environment, acting on the system is the same as the system sense in its environment."
"Speaker 6","00;15;09;10","00;15;10;16","So interaction."
"Speaker 7","00;15;10;16","00;15;21;29","Physical interaction is information exchange in both frameworks and that it's perfectly symmetrical. If the system remains identifiable over time, so does its environment."
"Speaker 5","00;15;24;25","00;15;25;26","To test."
"Speaker 6","00;15;26;04","00;15;26;27","Its environment."
"Speaker 7","00;15;26;27","00;15;35;11","Ceases to exist because its environment is defined with respect to it. That's why we call it its environment."
"Speaker 6","00;15;36;12","00;15;41;09","Oh, so. So all of these."
"Speaker 7","00;15;41;09","00;15;44;15","All of these symmetries are built into both frameworks."
"Speaker 6","00;15;45;25","00;15;47;13","So of the free."
"Speaker 7","00;15;47;13","00;15;48;15","Energy principle is."
"Speaker 6","00;15;48;15","00;15;52;00","Fundamentally about prediction, right?"
"Speaker 7","00;15;52;10","00;16;07;16","Very variational free energy can be thought of as prediction error or potential prediction of So the free energy principle is about the system being."
"Speaker 6","00;16;07;16","00;16;07;25","Able."
"Speaker 7","00;16;07;25","00;16;08;18","To predict."
"Speaker 6","00;16;09;23","00;16;15;23","Next state of its own. Markov Blanket and if it."
"Speaker 7","00;16;15;23","00;16;41;20","Predicts the next state of it to Markov work it perfectly, then VFI is minimized to zero and that's the asymptotic case. Perfect prediction. There was a question last time about what's asymptotic in the in the claim that the free energy principle is acid tolerant with the principle of the return and the asymptotic state, as I think Blue pointed out last time."
"Speaker 7","00;16;42;03","00;16;43;05","Yes, perfect prediction."
"Speaker 6","00;16;45;07","00;16;46;22","So now let's."
"Speaker 7","00;16;46;22","00;16;58;18","Translate all those to quantum theory. And this is where the figure in the paper that shows the disk with the various triangles comes into play. I think that's figure six, but I've actually forgotten."
"Speaker 6","00;17;00;13","00;17;01;01","Yeah."
"Speaker 7","00;17;01;10","00;17;02;26","It's, it's that one."
"Speaker 6","00;17;04;04","00;17;08;15","So let's now introduce."
"Speaker 7","00;17;08;15","00;17;09;28","This idea of a cure earth."
"Speaker 6","00;17;10;00","00;17;15;19","Which is just a little package of predictive capability of cure."
"Speaker 7","00;17;15;19","00;17;22;08","It means quantum reference. Rea, as we discussed last time, a reference rate is."
"Speaker 6","00;17;26;00","00;17;28;01","Implemented computation."
"Speaker 7","00;17;28;25","00;17;30;13","That makes a measurement."
"Speaker 6","00;17;30;18","00;17;33;28","Comparable across time So."
"Speaker 7","00;17;35;21","00;17;39;25","The meter stick, for example, implements a computation."
"Speaker 6","00;17;39;25","00;17;41;21","Of length and it."
"Speaker 7","00;17;41;22","00;18;19;16","Allows us to compare measurements of length across time because we assume that it's fixed. And of course, we could use a meter stick because each of us has embedded in our brains a representation of life. In fact, we have a representation of the three D coordinate system oh, without which states would be useless. So we can use external reference frames or meter sticks because we have internal reference frames like our representation in 3D space, in our intuitive understanding length."
"Speaker 6","00;18;20;13","00;18;20;26","Oh."
"Speaker 7","00;18;21;06","00;18;28;23","That we assume stays fixed over time and that allows our measurements of works to be comparable across time for us."
"Speaker 6","00;18;31;01","00;18;37;15","So now let's think about a cure of as a way of of."
"Speaker 7","00;18;38;18","00;18;53;24","Something that implements activity rates or that enables a system to implement active inference by allowing it to compare its measurements over time. Right. Prediction is meaningless. If you can't compare your measurements over time."
"Speaker 6","00;18;55;08","00;19;01;22","Of so much to ask, what what would it be like."
"Speaker 7","00;19;02;06","00;19;14;15","For a system to be able to perfectly predict the next stage of its butterfly blanket? The next state of its Markov blanket is a state that its environment has written."
"Speaker 6","00;19;14;15","00;19;18;27","By acting on So of."
"Speaker 7","00;19;19;29","00;19;39;26","Our question of perfect prediction is what would it be like for a system to be able to perfectly predict the next actions of its environment and notice that the system isn't predicting the next state of its environment? It doesn't know the state of its environment, state of its environment. So on the other side of our way, let's try to predict as the action of its environment."
"Speaker 6","00;19;40;04","00;19;40;12","On."
"Speaker 7","00;19;40;12","00;19;52;01","It, which is the only action of its environment as well, and the only action of the environments that's detected so."
"Speaker 6","00;19;52;17","00;19;55;16","Of its environment like it."
"Speaker 7","00;19;55;24","00;20;04;26","Is characterized by a curious rate. The situation is perfectly symmetrical between the system and its environment of."
"Speaker 6","00;20;05;10","00;20;06;27","So the question of."
"Speaker 7","00;20;11;09","00;20;17;07","The environment and the system could predict its environments actions."
"Speaker 6","00;20;17;10","00;20;22;07","Perfectly only if it in the environment exactly."
"Speaker 7","00;20;22;07","00;20;26;16","Share their they're curious because the cure."
"Speaker 6","00;20;26;16","00;20;28;03","Of not only."
"Speaker 7","00;20;28;21","00;20;34;14","Interprets sensation, it gives meaning to action so it says."
"Speaker 6","00;20;34;21","00;20;35;06","What your."
"Speaker 7","00;20;35;06","00;20;44;27","Action is going to be. So if I use my meter stick to cut a two by four, my cue or if the meter stick is guiding."
"Speaker 6","00;20;44;27","00;20;47;12","My action, it's giving it meaning."
"Speaker 7","00;20;47;12","00;20;53;13","It's making it repeatable in the same way that it makes my perceptions repeatable."
"Speaker 6","00;20;53;26","00;20;54;10","And again."
"Speaker 7","00;20;54;11","00;21;01;00","That's, that's why we use this that so we want to be able to act in repeatable ways as well as perceived repeatable ways."
"Speaker 6","00;21;01;23","00;21;02;12","And if we can't."
"Speaker 7","00;21;02;12","00;21;07;02","Act in repeatable ways, then again, the notion of prediction becomes meaningless."
"Speaker 6","00;21;09;05","00;21;11;05","So a perfect."
"Speaker 7","00;21;11;05","00;21;16;03","Prediction corresponds to perfect cure of alignment. So the question."
"Speaker 6","00;21;16;03","00;21;19;20","Becomes, well, what is perfect cure of alignment."
"Speaker 7","00;21;19;27","00;21;21;03","Correspond to."
"Speaker 6","00;21;23;15","00;21;27;25","And of Jim Glazebrook."
"Speaker 7","00;21;27;25","00;21;37;22","And another colleague, Anthony Marciano, who's a physics physicist in Shanghai, showed in a previous paper."
"Speaker 6","00;21;38;20","00;21;40;27","The perfect, perfect cure for."
"Speaker 7","00;21;40;27","00;22;02;02","Alignment between the system and its environment is only possible if the system and environment are entangled. So perfect cure on Earth alone that corresponds actually to the collapse that the bar called blanket because it corresponds to the collapse of severability."
"Speaker 6","00;22;03;01","00;22;06;06","Which means that the mess is no longer well defined."
"Speaker 7","00;22;07;00","00;22;14;01","Because it's no longer in a condition where you're dependent stick. And you can see that."
"Speaker 6","00;22;14;17","00;22;16;09","If you think of what perfect."
"Speaker 7","00;22;16;09","00;22;19;27","Cure alignment means, it means that."
"Speaker 6","00;22;20;10","00;22;20;27","Your."
"Speaker 7","00;22;20;27","00;22;22;19","Actions correspond."
"Speaker 6","00;22;22;19","00;22;23;18","Exactly."
"Speaker 7","00;22;24;14","00;22;25;20","To my predictions."
"Speaker 7","00;22;29;10","00;22;37;27","A conditional statement. It's an exact snip. So if I predict that you're going to do X."
"Speaker 6","00;22;38;03","00;22;39;11","Then you're going to do."
"Speaker 7","00;22;39;11","00;22;40;17","X, period."
"Speaker 6","00;22;42;16","00;22;44;00","Out, which means that."
"Speaker 7","00;22;44;00","00;23;04;03","Your state is no longer independent of by state. Your state actually depends on my state and my state correspondingly actually depends on your state. If you predict that I'm going to do X, then I will do X That's what perfect prediction mix."
"Speaker 6","00;23;05;29","00;23;06;10","Of."
"Speaker 7","00;23;06;23","00;23;08;19","When we translate it into this."
"Speaker 6","00;23;10;07","00;23;11;01","Pure earth."
"Speaker 7","00;23;11;02","00;23;12;05","Based concept."
"Speaker 6","00;23;13;24","00;23;17;01","So perfect prediction and of."
"Speaker 7","00;23;17;28","00;23;21;06","The collapse of severability or the same thing."
"Speaker 6","00;23;24;07","00;23;30;02","So the asymptotic limit of the FP."
"Speaker 7","00;23;30;11","00;23;38;12","Which is perfect prediction corresponds to the collapse of severability. Well, the collapse of severability is just."
"Speaker 6","00;23;38;12","00;23;41;03","Entanglement and."
"Speaker 7","00;23;41;14","00;23;45;08","The principle of charity is the claim that."
"Speaker 6","00;23;45;14","00;23;46;00","Any."
"Speaker 7","00;23;47;06","00;23;52;06","Isolated system grows to its own devices it."
"Speaker 6","00;23;53;22","00;23;54;25","Will evolve."
"Speaker 7","00;23;55;04","00;24;00;23","Its state, which is the joint state of any two of its components, will evolve toward."
"Speaker 6","00;24;01;11","00;24;02;08","Toward our."
"Speaker 7","00;24;02;15","00;24;16;27","Complete entanglement. It will evolve toward a pure state in quantum theoretic jargon, So it's in this sense that the FP is asymptotically the principle of unitary."
"Speaker 6","00;24;17;23","00;24;20;18","It's that if it's."
"Speaker 7","00;24;20;18","00;24;54;14","Asymptotic condition is the same as the condition that the principle charity imposes on closed systems, i.e. on system environment combinations, where whenever I say environment, I just mean everything that exists. That's not the system of interest So a system environment combination is always a closed system by definition. So so that's my introduction. And we can start discussion."
"Speaker 3","00;24;56;04","00;24;59;13","That's great. Thank you. Stephen, did you have a question?"
"Speaker 2","00;25;00;07","00;25;24;16","Yes, you can hear me. Okay. Thanks. I was just going to ask. That's really helpful. There's a lot in there, obviously. I was going to ask in terms of the pure Unix heresy would that be what happened, say, the electron or the kind of these normal quantum particle scales? And as you go to scale of that, you it becomes more and more proximate."
"Speaker 2","00;25;24;16","00;25;37;01","You have less of this isotropic, you know, this this quality of knowing an entanglement of."
"Speaker 6","00;25;38;00","00;25;39;15","Well, that's that's a very."
"Speaker 7","00;25;39;15","00;25;41;18","Deep question and it's a very good question."
"Speaker 6","00;25;42;16","00;25;44;25","Let's think about the the."
"Speaker 7","00;25;45;05","00;25;50;03","The canonical entanglement experience experiment, the sort of bill EPR experiment."
"Speaker 6","00;25;51;11","00;25;53;25","Of. So I'll I'll draw it with."
"Speaker 7","00;25;53;25","00;25;54;23","My hands here."
"Speaker 6","00;25;57;01","00;26;05;26","So in the canonical experiment, you've got a source and it's located here in the in the middle of my face, and it."
"Speaker 7","00;26;05;26","00;26;06;23","Produces."
"Speaker 6","00;26;07;08","00;26;08;15","An entangled pair."
"Speaker 7","00;26;08;16","00;26;13;03","Of something, photons or electrons or buckyballs or whatever you want."
"Speaker 6","00;26;13;28","00;26;16;01","And they travel apart."
"Speaker 7","00;26;16;14","00;26;31;01","At the speed of light or something very close to it. And at some point they encounter two symmetrically placed detectors and the detectors are operated by observers who are always called Alice and Bob."
"Speaker 6","00;26;32;23","00;26;36;16","And these detectors measure something."
"Speaker 7","00;26;36;21","00;26;42;29","And in the canonical experiment, they measure spin and work."
"Speaker 6","00;26;44;05","00;26;45;03","Alice and Bob."
"Speaker 7","00;26;45;24","00;27;12;21","Each observe independently is a random distribution of spins that if we think of this as a two dimensional experiment, then they they either measure sped up or stood down and so coordinate system. So Elsa Bob, each pick a Z-axis that defines up. And with respect to their local Z axis, they see a random distribution of up to."
"Speaker 6","00;27;15;13","00;27;18;03","Now of things get."
"Speaker 7","00;27;18;03","00;27;18;24","Interesting."
"Speaker 6","00;27;20;08","00;27;20;22","When."
"Speaker 7","00;27;20;29","00;27;25;15","Alice and Bob later get together and compare their results."
"Speaker 6","00;27;27;12","00;27;28;17","And what they."
"Speaker 7","00;27;28;17","00;27;34;22","Find is that whenever Alice observes, Bob observes down and vice versa."
"Speaker 6","00;27;37;02","00;27;40;00","And so they conclude that."
"Speaker 7","00;27;40;00","00;27;42;04","Their results are classically correlated."
"Speaker 6","00;27;44;11","00;27;45;10","But then it gets more."
"Speaker 7","00;27;45;10","00;27;47;17","Interesting because what."
"Speaker 6","00;27;47;17","00;27;48;04","We allow."
"Speaker 7","00;27;48;04","00;27;49;20","Alice Bob to do."
"Speaker 6","00;27;50;11","00;27;52;22","Is constantly."
"Speaker 7","00;27;53;02","00;28;08;20","Alter the direction that they detect, the spin it with respect to their own local Z axis. So you can think of the spin detector is like a polarization filter. So like a pair of sunglasses."
"Speaker 6","00;28;09;10","00;28;14;00","And what else and Bob can do is randomly and."
"Speaker 7","00;28;14;01","00;28;17;00","Independently change the tilt of their sunglasses."
"Speaker 6","00;28;17;26","00;28;18;08","Of."
"Speaker 7","00;28;19;09","00;28;20;26","While they do this experiment."
"Speaker 6","00;28;22;06","00;28;24;20","And in, in real implementations."
"Speaker 7","00;28;24;20","00;28;25;28","Of this experiment that."
"Speaker 6","00;28;25;28","00;28;33;10","Is first implemented story by Allen."
"Speaker 7","00;28;33;10","00;28;37;20","Aspect in his lab in Paris in the early 1970s."
"Speaker 6","00;28;38;27","00;28;39;04","Of."
"Speaker 7","00;28;41;08","00;28;44;27","And has since been repeated probably hundreds of times by different groups."
"Speaker 6","00;28;44;27","00;28;45;24","All over the world."
"Speaker 7","00;28;45;24","00;28;51;27","Including the Chinese using a satellite to generate the entangled pairs and measuring them thousands of."
"Speaker 6","00;28;52;14","00;28;52;26","A."
"Speaker 7","00;28;52;26","00;28;54;19","Thousand or so kilometers apart."
"Speaker 6","00;28;55;21","00;28;56;02","Of."
"Speaker 7","00;28;57;07","00;29;05;26","So if you remember the speed of lights the footprint nanosecond. So you've got a lot of nanoseconds in there you're a thousand kilometers apart to play."
"Speaker 6","00;29;05;26","00;29;09;02","With and the."
"Speaker 7","00;29;12;02","00;29;18;00","So the the trick in this experiment is that Alice involved can change the direction of their detector."
"Speaker 6","00;29;19;11","00;29;19;29","Within."
"Speaker 7","00;29;19;29","00;29;36;10","The time it takes for the entangled pair to get from the source to the detectors. So if it takes ten nanoseconds to get from the source to the selectors, they have to be able to change their detectors within ten nanoseconds. So that's why you want detectors that are far."
"Speaker 6","00;29;36;10","00;29;40;23","Apart so Alice and Bob, we do the."
"Speaker 7","00;29;40;23","00;29;42;05","Experiment changing."
"Speaker 6","00;29;42;12","00;29;42;29","Randomly."
"Speaker 7","00;29;42;29","00;29;52;04","Changing the directions that they're measuring with respect to their local Z-axis And then they get together again to compare their results."
"Speaker 6","00;29;53;16","00;29;55;03","And what they find."
"Speaker 7","00;29;55;03","00;29;55;20","Is."
"Speaker 6","00;29;56;23","00;29;58;14","That of."
"Speaker 7","00;30;00;16","00;30;01;20","If Alice observes."
"Speaker 6","00;30;01;20","00;30;11;01","Bob, Bob, or observe down even when they've been randomly and independently."
"Speaker 7","00;30;11;01","00;30;14;04","Changing the directions of their detectors."
"Speaker 6","00;30;15;19","00;30;17;19","So one way to put that."
"Speaker 7","00;30;17;19","00;30;18;03","Is."
"Speaker 6","00;30;18;29","00;30;19;26","If Alice."
"Speaker 7","00;30;19;26","00;30;26;19","Decides to rotate her detector 45 degrees, then Bob's resolve."
"Speaker 6","00;30;26;19","00;30;28;02","It will automatically."
"Speaker 7","00;30;28;02","00;30;45;19","Be rotated 45 degrees and it's symmetrical, so vice and vice versa. So that's not classical correlation, that's classical correlation, that's robust against manipulation. So."
"Speaker 6","00;30;46;09","00;30;46;25","Oh."
"Speaker 7","00;30;49;03","00;30;50;07","I was discussing this with."
"Speaker 6","00;30;50;07","00;30;53;06","Carl a while back, and I use."
"Speaker 7","00;30;53;06","00;30;54;06","This example."
"Speaker 6","00;30;54;28","00;30;56;29","Of if you and I are a classic."
"Speaker 7","00;30;57;09","00;31;02;20","Or classically correlated, then we may have the same beliefs about something."
"Speaker 6","00;31;02;23","00;31;08;20","So we might both believe that the earth is round. That's classical."
"Speaker 7","00;31;08;20","00;31;09;14","Correlation."
"Speaker 6","00;31;11;12","00;31;27;03","Oh. Now suppose someone convinces me that the earth is flat. If if that happens and you then believe that the earth is flat, that's entanglement, that's classical correlation."
"Speaker 7","00;31;27;03","00;31;31;04","That's robust against manipulation. So it's."
"Speaker 6","00;31;31;04","00;31;34;22","It's correlation. No kidding. Oh."
"Speaker 7","00;31;35;19","00;31;47;27","Correlation. That that survives the environment. Doing something to and so."
"Speaker 6","00;31;48;14","00;31;51;23","Oh. Now, let's go back to this question."
"Speaker 7","00;31;51;23","00;31;53;00","Is this is this."
"Speaker 6","00;31;53;00","00;31;55;03","An effect that only."
"Speaker 7","00;31;55;03","00;31;57;21","Occurs in some microscopic domain."
"Speaker 6","00;32;00;16","00;32;05;26","And the answer is it's an effect that was."
"Speaker 7","00;32;05;26","00;32;21;19","First described by a theory that was intended to only describe a microscopic domain like quantum theory was developed to deal with nuclear and atomic and nuclear physics. And so there was this idea of the quantum world, which is very small."
"Speaker 6","00;32;23;06","00;32;24;22","But the math, of."
"Speaker 7","00;32;24;22","00;32;35;11","Course, applies across the board and trying to think of quantum theory, trying to think of classical physics as."
"Speaker 6","00;32;35;11","00;32;37;17","A limit or a mathematical."
"Speaker 7","00;32;37;17","00;32;49;15","Limit of quantum theory always runs into problems. And the problems are always the numbers go to infinity. That shouldn't be infinity. So it's not."
"Speaker 6","00;32;49;19","00;32;50;15","Really."
"Speaker 7","00;32;50;21","00;33;19;21","Accurate to think of classical physics as some sort of mathematical limit. Like each bar goes to zero of quantum theory, because if each word goes to zero, lots of relevant energies go to infinity of. And this is this has been known for a long time. Nonetheless, it's it's constantly taught in this classical limit. Kind of framework that isn't really correct."
"Speaker 6","00;33;23;20","00;33;29;13","So one point of doing Bell."
"Speaker 7","00;33;29;13","00;33;37;18","EPR experiments at larger and larger distances is to demonstrate that quantum theory is not really a microscopic."
"Speaker 6","00;33;37;18","00;33;38;01","Theory."
"Speaker 6","00;33;40;18","00;33;42;28","So if you think of an entangled."
"Speaker 7","00;33;42;28","00;33;44;20","State, an entangled state."
"Speaker 6","00;33;44;20","00;33;48;23","Is one object. It's not two electrons."
"Speaker 7","00;33;48;23","00;33;55;05","That happen to have some mysterious relationship. It's one object that has one state."
"Speaker 6","00;33;55;26","00;33;57;25","Remember what entanglement means."
"Speaker 7","00;33;58;06","00;34;09;22","Is non severability, non independence across any compositional boundary. So an entangled pair is one thing."
"Speaker 6","00;34;10;23","00;34;12;29","And what the Chinese were."
"Speaker 7","00;34;12;29","00;34;14;00","Able to demonstrate."
"Speaker 6","00;34;14;25","00;34;16;06","Was you can have one."
"Speaker 7","00;34;16;06","00;34;22;16","Quantum object that's over 1000 kilometers long. Now, that's not microscopic."
"Speaker 6","00;34;23;01","00;34;27;18","That's big of a nice way to think about it."
"Speaker 7","00;34;27;18","00;34;34;16","Entanglement was introduced by Leonard Susskind quite a few years ago, and Rafael looser."
"Speaker 6","00;34;36;00","00;34;39;23","With their idea of that and entangled."
"Speaker 7","00;34;39;23","00;34;46;24","Pair is the same thing as Einstein, Rosen Bridge and Spacetime and and Einstein. Rosa Bridges a."
"Speaker 6","00;34;46;24","00;34;48;08","Black hole in a white hole."
"Speaker 7","00;34;48;23","00;34;54;05","Connected in the end. Or you can think of it that way. It's it's."
"Speaker 6","00;34;54;05","00;34;54;20","A."
"Speaker 7","00;34;55;02","00;35;05;28","Topological connection in spacetime that simply identifies two points in space time that would otherwise be considered to state. So this emphasizes that."
"Speaker 6","00;35;07;10","00;35;08;28","If you have an entangled pair."
"Speaker 7","00;35;09;00","00;35;35;29","There's no distance inside it. Oh, if you have two entangled electrons, for example, that are a thousand kilometers apart. As far as they're concerned, they're right next to each other. And in fact, as far as they're concerned, they're located at exactly the same point in space time. And that's what this bridge notion emphasizes to us. Oh, there's really no separation here."
"Speaker 7","00;35;35;29","00;35;49;12","That the separation is an artifact of our observational capabilities. It's not a characteristic of the to do it. So entanglement actually calls into question what the idea of distance even means."
"Speaker 6","00;35;51;04","00;35;51;10","It."
"Speaker 7","00;35;51;10","00;36;05;29","Makes it forces it to be relative to us. And that's that's that's why there's all this discussion of emergent spacetime in quantum gravity and quantum cosmology. Because if you think about things from a straight quantum theory point of view."
"Speaker 6","00;36;06;25","00;36;07;07","Of."
"Speaker 7","00;36;07;16","00;36;19;07","Spacetime, is that observable? It's just something it's it's something that's relative to how observations move. It's not an intrinsic property of anything. It's not object, as they say."
"Speaker 6","00;36;21;29","00;36;25;22","So. So let's go."
"Speaker 7","00;36;25;22","00;36;27;13","Back to this question again."
"Speaker 6","00;36;28;02","00;36;34;15","Of if we think about entanglement and we think about."
"Speaker 7","00;36;34;15","00;36;35;14","Observation."
"Speaker 6","00;36;37;15","00;36;38;00","And we think."
"Speaker 7","00;36;38;00","00;36;51;26","About entanglement as something that's observed by comparing observations made by different observers Right. Neither Alice nor Bob in that experiment can detect entanglement."
"Speaker 6","00;36;52;23","00;36;54;11","Of they only."
"Speaker 7","00;36;54;11","00;36;58;27","Realize that there's an entangled state and they talk to each other after they've done the experiment."
"Speaker 6","00;37;01;07","00;37;01;13","Of."
"Speaker 7","00;37;02;08","00;37;29;04","Then this question of scale becomes a question about how observers interact and what observers can know about each other and about each other's experimental apparatus. So when I describe the the entanglement experiment, I said Alice and Bob each have their own work on Z-axis."
"Speaker 6","00;37;31;02","00;37;31;18","And."
"Speaker 7","00;37;31;18","00;37;38;07","When they get together and they discuss their results and they compare their results."
"Speaker 6","00;37;39;11","00;37;41;06","Then they make a very important."
"Speaker 7","00;37;41;06","00;37;47;24","Assumption, which is the assumption that they're Z-axis or comparable. So if."
"Speaker 6","00;37;47;24","00;37;48;04","During."
"Speaker 7","00;37;48;04","00;38;13;09","The experiment Bob's Z axis was varying at random with respect to Alice's Z-axis, then their results, comparing their results would be meaningless because they'd be measured with respect to completely different reference frames of. So we have to make this assumption that they have the same Z-axis."
"Speaker 6","00;38;15;05","00;38;15;14","Now."
"Speaker 7","00;38;15;22","00;38;19;16","Interestingly enough, that assumption by itself."
"Speaker 6","00;38;20;26","00;38;22;09","Tells you that Alice."
"Speaker 7","00;38;22;09","00;38;23;27","And Bob have to be tangled."
"Speaker 6","00;38;24;24","00;38;26;18","Or their Z axes."
"Speaker 7","00;38;26;18","00;38;30;06","Have to be tied So."
"Speaker 6","00;38;30;21","00;38;35;09","Of the idea of entanglement kind of."
"Speaker 7","00;38;36;04","00;38;38;10","Expands to."
"Speaker 6","00;38;38;17","00;38;40;01","Take in all."
"Speaker 7","00;38;40;01","00;38;51;01","Aspects of the experimental situation and says one starts unearthing these assumptions that we make to."
"Speaker 6","00;38;51;17","00;38;55;08","Our talk about comparability."
"Speaker 7","00;38;55;08","00;38;59;01","Between experiments. So let's."
"Speaker 6","00;38;59;02","00;39;03;19","Real will take back about half an hour and."
"Speaker 7","00;39;04;01","00;39;08;24","We see that the quantum reference frames are what make experiments comparable."
"Speaker 6","00;39;08;27","00;39;09;13","For."
"Speaker 7","00;39;09;29","00;39;17;05","An observer its similarity or comparability of quantum reference frames that."
"Speaker 6","00;39;17;05","00;39;17;16","Make."
"Speaker 7","00;39;18;09","00;39;21;24","Comparing experiments possible for two observers."
"Speaker 6","00;39;25;19","00;39;27;09","But if the two."
"Speaker 7","00;39;27;09","00;39;34;18","Observers exactly share their cue, or else in a way that's robust against environmental manipulation."
"Speaker 6","00;39;35;02","00;39;36;01","Then they're entangled."
"Speaker 7","00;39;36;29","00;39;39;06","So we've kind of come full circle here."
"Speaker 6","00;39;40;06","00;39;42;10","Oh, it's one."
"Speaker 7","00;39;42;28","00;39;53;17","One can make this notion of entanglement as macroscopic as one works. And again, this is."
"Speaker 6","00;39;53;25","00;39;54;07","Of."
"Speaker 7","00;39;55;21","00;40;05;12","In a sense, why quantum gravity in quantum cosmology or interest is what drives things like the black hole information paradox, which."
"Speaker 6","00;40;06;03","00;40;12;26","You know, you read about of cert."
"Speaker 7","00;40;12;29","00;40;37;21","So so we're now getting into in a sense, very fundamental physics. Absolutely. What's the relationship between entanglement and the concept of spacetime? What's the relation between quantum theory and general relativity, of which is the big the big question in physics from one point of view."
"Speaker 6","00;40;39;04","00;40;40;16","Oh, but the short."
"Speaker 7","00;40;40;16","00;40;43;24","Answer is you can make entanglement as big as you want."
"Speaker 3","00;40;49;05","00;41;22;10","That's great. Thank you. That actually leads into a question that I had back way back when we were talking about entanglement in quantum reference frames. So I was just thinking, like, if I cannot perfectly predicts my own behavior is my quantum reference frame, like in completely aligned with my own quantum reference frame. I mean, maybe we will have the experience of, you know, predicting if I kick the ball in this way, I predict it'll go over there, but it doesn't actually go over there."
"Speaker 3","00;41;22;11","00;41;40;06","So like, I mean, we predict and we're off our prediction is, is not accurate. So is it actually a temporal separation that that makes that happen? Or what do you think happens in those circumstances where my cue appears unaligned with my own curious."
"Speaker 6","00;41;45;24","00;41;47;27","No, that's also that's also a beautiful."
"Speaker 7","00;41;47;27","00;41;48;24","Deep question."
"Speaker 6","00;41;49;18","00;41;51;05","And it."
"Speaker 7","00;41;51;06","00;41;52;22","Points to something that I think."
"Speaker 6","00;41;53;02","00;41;55;01","Of can and."
"Speaker 7","00;41;55;01","00;41;55;17","Should be."
"Speaker 6","00;41;55;17","00;41;56;09","Stated."
"Speaker 7","00;41;56;09","00;42;15;00","As a general theorem, which is no system can perfectly predict, can perfectly predict its own state oh, no system can observe its own state its own total state."
"Speaker 6","00;42;17;11","00;42;23;12","Of so of so that."
"Speaker 7","00;42;23;25","00;42;25;25","Situation is."
"Speaker 6","00;42;28;18","00;42;35;19","Ubiquitous and unavoidable And one."
"Speaker 7","00;42;35;19","00;42;37;19","Could phrase that by saying."
"Speaker 6","00;42;38;11","00;42;38;25","Oh."
"Speaker 7","00;42;43;00","00;42;44;10","A system can."
"Speaker 6","00;42;44;10","00;42;48;03","Have a a cure F or."
"Speaker 7","00;42;48;03","00;42;57;14","A better processor as one often uses that vocabulary that represents itself. So we all have a self representation."
"Speaker 6","00;42;58;13","00;42;58;24","Of."
"Speaker 7","00;43;00;10","00;43;09;13","That's in a sense, metacognitive. We claim to know what we believe and things like that. But of course, those beliefs are."
"Speaker 6","00;43;09;13","00;43;12;02","All of one."
"Speaker 7","00;43;12;02","00;43;15;27","Very coarse grade, two extremely incomplete."
"Speaker 6","00;43;17;07","00;43;17;20","Of."
"Speaker 7","00;43;18;19","00;43;21;08","Three useful for making predictions, but they're often."
"Speaker 6","00;43;21;08","00;43;30;19","Wrong and you know this this is how this."
"Speaker 7","00;43;30;26","00;43;36;22","This point has had huge technological consequences. I mean, think back to the history of artificial intelligence."
"Speaker 6","00;43;38;02","00;43;39;08","Right. In the."
"Speaker 7","00;43;39;18","00;43;40;16","Seventies."
"Speaker 6","00;43;41;12","00;43;41;27","Oh."
"Speaker 7","00;43;42;12","00;43;47;06","There is the the huge new wave was expert systems."
"Speaker 6","00;43;47;21","00;43;49;02","And you know."
"Speaker 7","00;43;49;13","00;43;52;23","People have redefined themselves as knowledge engineers. If we're."
"Speaker 6","00;43;52;23","00;43;54;11","Going to go out and interview."
"Speaker 7","00;43;54;11","00;43;59;21","Experts and find out how experts did things and coded up in computers, and soon we."
"Speaker 6","00;43;59;23","00;44;00;06","Have."
"Speaker 7","00;44;00;20","00;44;03;23","You know, artificial expert systems that did anything interesting."
"Speaker 6","00;44;04;28","00;44;07;12","And that whole."
"Speaker 7","00;44;07;26","00;44;08;17","Business."
"Speaker 6","00;44;08;26","00;44;09;29","Failed utterly."
"Speaker 7","00;44;11;09","00;44;19;13","It it was a complete disaster. It didn't work at all. Why the simple explanation for why."
"Speaker 6","00;44;19;13","00;44;23;00","Is that experts can't tell you what they're doing."
"Speaker 7","00;44;25;18","00;44;38;08","Expertize isn't verbal, sizable, and it's not just expert piano playing, is it? Verbalize, you know, expert systems engineering is verbal expert computer programing isn't verbalize."
"Speaker 6","00;44;39;27","00;44;40;07","Oh."
"Speaker 7","00;44;40;28","00;44;52;17","And that's that's just an illustration of the fact that our better processors don't actually have a complete model of the rest of us. Much less a model of the rest of us. Plus the better processor."
"Speaker 6","00;44;54;07","00;44;55;02","Of it all."
"Speaker 7","00;44;55;09","00;45;04;01","It all comes back to this general principle that a system can't represent itself, and so it can't predict its own behavior."
"Speaker 3","00;45;09;08","00;45;09;24","Awesome."
"Speaker 3","00;45;12;07","00;45;14;11","So between this work."
"Speaker 7","00;45;14;28","00;45;22;12","Actually, I should ask Karl to comment on that tirade because he's also thought about this an extraordinary amount."
"Speaker 5","00;45;27;09","00;45;52;22","Well, I'll certainly make the comment that that was marvelous. You know, I'm glad this has been recorded because this should certainly be transcribed. And I know it's probably implicit in the paper, but it was so beautifully articulated and clear taking us through the issues. I really enjoyed that. And so I have loads of comments, but I will work with people's time going through all of them."
"Speaker 5","00;45;53;01","00;46;16;10","And that last issue is really interesting about the better process or the metacognitive aspects of a system being able to measure itself. I think there's a fundamental observation that because you know, you can't measure yourself. The whole point of the particular physics paper was to say that, you know, yes, there can be two kinds of information geometries, if you like."
"Speaker 5","00;46;17;12","00;46;47;15","And the big move is that one system can measure, i.e., infer by possessing or having a movement in some sort of information geometry. Infer a belief update about something else. And so at no point is there any room for it just to then also start to infer about its own inference. But that that is you know, that's a mathematical impossibility from from the random dynamical system perspective."
"Speaker 5","00;46;47;15","00;47;10;14","I'm not sure show about the the quantum perspective, but it sounds as though that's also true So that begs the question, and how on earth do we have the illusion that we know ourselves? And of course, you know, that is a little bit of a colloquial question because, you know, 99.9% of things don't actually think that they know themselves."
"Speaker 5","00;47;10;25","00;47;56;12","So unless there's a particular phenotype, particle or species that both philosophers, I'm pretty sure that most of the things that exist I don't have any any pretense to the thinking that they know themselves. It's a really interesting point to get across. Anecdotally, you know, I spend a lot of time and taking people through examples that probably go right back to things like idea, motor theory, that, you know, the way that we the way that we develop a sense of agency, I would think that we have a sense of agency, you know, is a gift, an illusion, that is probably unique to only a small number of us and may not even be available to people with"
"Speaker 5","00;47;56;18","00;48;28;20","severe autism. And the you know, the example of that literally the stage is written down in a dramatic way, was that if you just take vanilla active inference under a mock of blanket and then you look at particular kinds of sparkly structures where the active states of the Markoff blanket or the holographic screen are hidden from the internal state."
"Speaker 5","00;48;28;21","00;49;06;28","So these are special kinds of systems have a particular sparsity where now the active states of the Markoff blanket are now become hidden from the internal states. And you can certainly license some entanglement. And I would I would later ask about the restricted entanglement and synchronization. So entanglement or synchronization of the internal states such that the internal states have beliefs about their action, but those beliefs become beliefs about action as a hidden cause."
"Speaker 5","00;49;07;04","00;49;30;00","So that absolutely no notion from the inside that you cause that you're just representing the cause. So the example I have in mind is you're watching a little fish swimming around, looking for food, gobbling up little bits of particles of food. And you think, oh, that's a very sort of artful fish with purpose and pragmatics and knows how to navigate its world."
"Speaker 5","00;49;32;14","00;49;58;28","But from the point of view of the fish, all that is happening is that the water and the particles are moving around it and a benevolent, nurturing and fortuitous way that the water is delivering food particles to the fish's mouth. So from the fishes point of view, he has absolutely no awareness that it is the author or the agent that's causing this synchronization with the environment."
"Speaker 5","00;49;59;10","00;50;31;05","So you know, the deeper question is how on earth do we have the illusion that we think we know our own our own agency, and how and when do we develop agency and furthermore, it's not just agency about me, it's agency about other things. At what point do you say early neonatal neurodevelopment? Do we have these models of the world that enable us to distinguish between mother and self, you know?"
"Speaker 5","00;50;31;15","00;51;00;11","And at what point do we align our curators, if you like, with not mother but with the world? That enables us to now see Mother as an independent object. So that is something else that is an agent and you know, like I would then be well, perhaps if Mother is nature, perhaps I am an agent. And I guess about that I am now the author of my agency and my actions."
"Speaker 5","00;51;00;17","00;51;19;12","But that is such that's such a high level thing. How much of it pertains to humans That's what that's what I said. I'd love to talk about the homologs of entanglement from a point of view of classical and perhaps I could bring up at this point."
"Speaker 2","00;51;22;09","00;51;22;17","Could."
"Speaker 4","00;51;24;11","00;51;46;11","Just a couple of things came came to my mind listening to this. One is that Josh Bongo had this amazing paper in I think it was about 26 or so where he had these robots and these they were they started out like a six legged starfish. But the cool thing about it was that they didn't have an internal model of what they were in or what their shape is or how to move."
"Speaker 4","00;51;46;18","00;52;09;11","And they basically had to flop around and make, make models of their own structure based on what happened to them, given various outputs that they generated. And eventually they would build a model of what happens and they would walk around and so on. And two interesting things followed. One is that you could, unlike traditional robotics, you could rip off one of the legs and they would very soon revise the model and keep going in different ways."
"Speaker 4","00;52;09;11","00;52;24;16","So they weren't tied to that particular self model, right? They would have to discover it from scratch, but it was still sort of plastic throughout their whole lifetime. And they could they could get along. So they had that plasticity. And the other thing is that and of course, Christophe Adamy wrote a nice kind of interpretation piece of this."
"Speaker 4","00;52;25;08","00;53;00;13","He described they they spent lots of lots of time being completely inactive and basically running through quote unquote mentally running through all the different things that they could do and what they think was going to happen before they actually moved. And so you got Chris to call that dreaming, you know, that they would basically sort of play out before, you know, the in between their actual motions where they would go around testing they would actually sort of play this out internally and try to refine the model such that then when they do move, they would actually make movements that maximally sort of distinguish the different, different possible models and so on."
"Speaker 4","00;53;00;21","00;53;23;22","And so that you can watch them dreaming about about their shape. So and then the other thing I just wanted to briefly mention this, this idea of when and how do you recognize that you are an agent and that actually you need to act for things to happen versus just having the environment do things to you. I suspect that one of the things that drives it very early on is this is this notion of stress."
"Speaker 4","00;53;23;28","00;53;49;09","Then I don't have a particular I don't have a theory of why stress feels stressful. But but just on a purely functional level, I think that what happens in cells, you know, so very early, long before you get to humans or anything like that, I think that what you get is this this set of mechanisms that that evolved from things like stress about protein folding and so on."
"Speaker 4","00;53;49;09","00;54;11;08","But then then basically scaled up to be stress about metabolic and stress about morphology and stress about behavioral issues and so on. That basically is a, is a system wide metric of the delta between what's going on and what you'd like to have going on. Right. The delta between your set point and what's happening now and what then."
"Speaker 4","00;54;11;08","00;54;29;14","I think that drives a strengthening of this of, of the agency model because what will happen is as you as you as you slowly learn that you can do things that reduce the stress level it kind of solidifies this idea that it's actually at least some amount of it is up to you to make life better. And so you then then act."
"Speaker 4","00;54;29;20","00;54;38;11","And then of course, we know that breaks down and sort of learn helplessness assays and so on. That's that's that that really is very traumatic for for all kinds of creatures that won't be long human."
"Speaker 5","00;54;41;14","00;54;44;27","Can I can I speak to that? Because there's some great points that please."
"Speaker 6","00;54;45;09","00;54;45;19","Yeah."
"Speaker 5","00;54;46;09","00;55;09;04","So three really important things being brought to the table. There. So I'm bound to forget the third one. If I start the first one, I just want to say I'm coming back to this question about sort of a purist and alignment in that. And one obvious answer that what could bring to the table is that learning is the alignment that you're at."
"Speaker 5","00;55;09;04","00;55;56;04","So learning at full scale. We are talking here about developmental scales. For example, we were talking about robots that learn to repair themselves or learn that new curious animal or child learning to make sense of its world. Then you can look at the slow process of alignment of the curious, the things that are invariant over the fast of time scales at which there is plans of motion exchange on our in a holographic screen as simply a movement from a state of its entanglement to a state of entanglement as you become better, better at predicting."
"Speaker 5","00;55;56;04","00;56;34;12","But to become better at predicting, you have to align your curiosity up to try to align the. I think the set of the robot examples are perhaps a nice illustration of that in the sense that these robots were equipped with the ability to learn about themselves because they had a lot in developmental psychology. And indeed I would imagine developmental robotics is motor, but it's basically no soliciting outcomes, sensory outcomes in order to start to disambiguate between what did I caused that or did you caused that?"
"Speaker 5","00;56;34;26","00;56;44;29","What parts are apparently under my control? But of course, yeah, that's a very anthropomorphic interpretation because their mind is so mind that's implicit but certainly the."
"Speaker 6","00;56;44;29","00;56;46;22","Learning of the world."
"Speaker 5","00;56;46;22","00;57;23;23","Models, the body model is probably the first thing that any artifact has to contend with because you see that in children, you're shaking their rattle to to solicit and actively solicit the conjunction of visual motion and proprioceptive feedback. From the muscles causing the movement of the mobile or the rattle and the auditory. So soliciting conjunctions or correlations that are explainable and predictable in multiple modalities."
"Speaker 5","00;57;24;13","00;57;47;11","So you may then ask why on earth what is the imperative for that kind of behavior? What drives action to solicit this opportunity to learn the link to correlations and coincidences in the conjunctions? And that brings us to the second point."
"Speaker 5","00;57;50;00","00;57;59;01","That they have these robots dreaming tell you immediately and at some level they have an internal."
"Speaker 6","00;57;59;01","00;57;59;20","Model."
"Speaker 5","00;58;01;05","00;58;32;10","Of the consequences of action. And that tells you immediately that you've got if you wanted to write that down from a point of view of classical active inference, you've got a belief structure on the inside that covers both the covers, both the external world and these hidden actions and the actions upon the of the world and the consequences of those actions on the external states."
"Speaker 5","00;58;32;17","00;59;09;00","That's a very sophisticated generative model to have. And you're getting now into the world of planning is inference. So a thermostat doesn't have that, and yet these robots do have them. So it tells you that there are two natural kinds of particles on blankets or separable systems, at least two kinds, one of which is more like a thermostat and one of which is more like a sort of I was thinking of sort of a starter at a start, but something more like these sort of robots that can learn about about themselves."
"Speaker 5","00;59;09;09","00;59;35;05","And the cute and the crucial distinction, I think, is that the agent has now started to represent the consequences of its actions, but without realizing it's its own actions. And so how we got to the level of the other metacognitive, I am aware kind of kind of smart and interesting. It comes back to what I've said before about natural kinds, where one's active states are hidden from the internal space."
"Speaker 5","00;59;35;05","01;00;02;04","So they have to become a third you have to infer that they're not they're not they are opaque to the internal states. And as soon as you say that, then you're naturally talking about systems that can effectively engage in planning as a prince. So they have to have plans in their heads in order to act, which corresponds to and to the streaming."
"Speaker 5","01;00;02;14","01;00;31;25","And from the point of view of the the frequently active imprints. And then you ask what are the objective functions or what are the principles of this faction that would apply to these kinds of plans? And when you work it through, then one important component of the sort of the package of all the actions in question is a drive to resolve uncertainty."
"Speaker 5","01;00;32;12","01;00;57;03","So we come back to this notion of the child soliciting proprioceptive extra step to sensations that enable it to resolve uncertainty. And this is exactly the same principle behind the optimal basic design that we design experiments that are going to resolve the uncertainty to the greatest extent possible under our current internal models or hypotheses about how the world works."
"Speaker 5","01;00;57;20","01;01;48;14","And that brings me to the third great point about stress and the the really important place of stress and uncertainty and angst and not knowing what to do next or not knowing what's going to work and driving behavior because if a large chunk of the imperatives or planned action is to maximize information gain or minimize expected surprise or or reduce uncertainty, then you can see easily now why two situations of uncertainty and stress that will necessarily cause the most epistemic responses in order to drive the system or the the."
"Speaker 5","01;01;49;05","01;02;17;10","In this instance, the agent to resolve that uncertainty. The final point now, and this is basically paraphrasing what Mike just said, if the system sees itself behaving more in times of greater uncertainty, it may learn that. And I now have the idea, oh, I am the kind of system where I would behaving as if I am the kind of system that responds more when under stress."
"Speaker 5","01;02;18;03","01;02;46;21","And then you will become aware of that. And then you can get into the psychiatric and psychological aspects of stress. You may not if you are just a protein, you might just show a sort of selection for flexibility like response. But that's I think the you know, the two fundamental mechanisms, the imperatives that are being fulfilled here in accord with basic conservation and also principles of least action from the classical perspective account for exactly the same kind of behavior."
"Speaker 5","01;02;46;29","01;03;19;13","I think the interesting thing about stress, uncertainty, they're not talking about the the content of implicit beliefs structures, but the, the, the second order statistics, the uncertainty that's I think brings a whole level of analysis to the table because once you talk about uncertainty and representations of uncertainty, insight, internal states, then from a psychological perspective, you start to talk about tension and consciousness from the point of view of an engineer."
"Speaker 5","01;03;19;13","01;03;29;19","We're talking about things like Kalman gain and get, getting the estimates of noise levels, if you like. Correct. And I'm not show."
"Speaker 6","01;03;30;04","01;03;32;00","Well, what where."
"Speaker 5","01;03;32;08","01;03;59;08","The if you like the well, let me ask from a quantum theoretic point of view is uncertainty baked into that can you can you have a stressed quantum quantum population pull that out right. Well stop talking now yeah."
"Speaker 7","01;03;59;09","01;04;01;13","Just to just to answer that question."
"Speaker 6","01;04;02;03","01;04;08;18","Of if if one if one thinks about."
"Speaker 7","01;04;08;29","01;04;09;14","Quantum."
"Speaker 6","01;04;09;14","01;04;13;07","Theory 04 with."
"Speaker 7","01;04;13;07","01;04;15;20","A Bayesian view of probability with."
"Speaker 2","01;04;15;21","01;04;15;28","A."
"Speaker 7","01;04;16;14","01;04;19;03","Kind of subjective this notion of probability."
"Speaker 6","01;04;20;11","01;04;22;28","Of which I mean that."
"Speaker 7","01;04;24;00","01;04;26;18","Point of view was really pioneered by Chris Fuchs."
"Speaker 6","01;04;26;24","01;04;27;25","And now."
"Speaker 7","01;04;27;25","01;04;33;04","David Berman, for example, has taken it up and written some very good things about."
"Speaker 6","01;04;34;06","01;04;34;16","Oh."
"Speaker 7","01;04;35;17","01;04;46;21","Then this notion of uncertainty, reduction of becomes the explanation for why do you do experiments and build theories. And, and."
"Speaker 6","01;04;47;08","01;04;48;03","You know, it all."
"Speaker 7","01;04;48;03","01;04;50;18","Becomes very well aligned, I think, with."
"Speaker 6","01;04;50;24","01;04;51;07","With."
"Speaker 7","01;04;52;28","01;04;56;04","The idea of active inference. In fact, we."
"Speaker 6","01;04;56;28","01;04;58;15","We wrote."
"Speaker 7","01;04;58;16","01;05;09;01","Into that paper at the very end some remark about how this cubist perspective about quantum theory becoming a result, not an interpretation."
"Speaker 6","01;05;10;09","01;05;12;28","When we think of of quantum theory."
"Speaker 7","01;05;12;28","01;05;17;10","Is in a sense, a way of reformulating the idea of actual inference."
"Speaker 6","01;05;17;26","01;05;18;08","Of."
"Speaker 7","01;05;20;15","01;05;22;07","So I think you're very consistent."
"Speaker 6","01;05;22;15","01;05;23;28","Right now of."
"Speaker 7","01;05;25;26","01;05;39;17","A stressed, stressed quantum is stressed. Quantum system is just a system that gets observational outcomes that it doesn't expect so."
"Speaker 6","01;05;40;10","01;05;42;11","We have to think of."
"Speaker 7","01;05;42;25","01;05;47;20","Oh, such systems as having generative models."
"Speaker 6","01;05;49;10","01;05;50;17","And thinking about."
"Speaker 7","01;05;51;28","01;06;06;23","The generative model of an electron is a bit of a stretch, right? Because the electron is only characterized by mass charge and angular momentum so."
"Speaker 6","01;06;08;10","01;06;10;24","It can't really have."
"Speaker 7","01;06;11;04","01;06;12;17","Expectations about."
"Speaker 6","01;06;12;25","01;06;13;14","Much."
"Speaker 7","01;06;13;21","01;06;19;13","Right? Electron can have no expectations about the external electric field, for example."
"Speaker 6","01;06;20;09","01;06;20;20","Oh."
"Speaker 7","01;06;21;17","01;06;28;08","It can detect that. It can respond to it. But it can't predict it."
"Speaker 6","01;06;29;17","01;06;35;02","And if we think about, oh, something like."
"Speaker 7","01;06;35;02","01;07;19;00","An electron, then we can focus in on this idea that having a generative model requires having enough memory to keep a record of the most recent observation least the most recent one and if you want to have a good generative model, then you better have enough memory to keep a record of quite a number of observations. And it's this memory resource that really simple things like electrons don't have so oh, they're, they're not great predictors."
"Speaker 6","01;07;20;02","01;07;20;14","Oh."
"Speaker 7","01;07;21;29","01;07;29;02","Because they don't have the memory to a level being a great predictor. And as it."
"Speaker 5","01;07;29;02","01;07;29;07","Was."
"Speaker 6","01;07;29;14","01;07;29;25","Both."
"Speaker 7","01;07;30;22","01;07;32;00","Carl and Mike were saying."
"Speaker 6","01;07;32;20","01;07;33;04","Of."
"Speaker 7","01;07;33;29","01;07;48;29","Sense, you have to have memory to be able to feel stress. You have to know that your predictions were wrong. So you have to remember what your predictions were oh. So memory becomes a really key component."
"Speaker 6","01;07;49;16","01;07;52;05","Of the theory. Oh."
"Speaker 7","01;07;52;14","01;08;15;11","Once you put it into this language, because the language, in a sense forces you to to layout assumptions about what the what the computational resources that are being required are that was it very coherent. But anyway, I just wanted to stress the role of memory here."
"Speaker 3","01;08;16;18","01;08;18;02","Perfect. Thank you, Carl."
"Speaker 5","01;08;20;15","01;08;52;10","Just to reinforce mentor's last point and just tell exactly the same story in a much more pragmatic way and from a point of view, a statistician. So I heard Chris say that basically that if I want to go beyond being a little electron or thermostats and I want to now infer the quality of how noisy all my sensors, for example, my favorite sensors, if I'm a thermostat that will require me becoming a little statistician."
"Speaker 5","01;08;52;25","01;09;17;04","And what does that mean? Well, basically, I'm going to be estimating the standard error or the the experimental variance. There's something quite important about that which which comes back exactly to the computational resources and memory. If you do a simple T test as a statistician on some experimental data, you necessarily have to acquire lots of data points and store them."
"Speaker 5","01;09;17;20","01;10;08;03","And of course, that is just the degrees of freedom associated with your T test or F test. So the degrees of freedom score, the number of data points that you'll be able to remember, and you need a sufficient number in order to get a precise estimate of the uncertainty. So literally the degrees of freedom in classical statistics is literally a statistic that scores your confidence in the estimation of the standard error which is pooled over multiple observations, which is an attempt to estimate on average, if I observe with this kind of or I, I asked my question, so I wrote to my holographic screen or I solicited these sensory states."
"Speaker 5","01;10;08;12","01;10;33;10","And, you know, what would on average, what would the uncertainty be associated with it? So I think it's a really important point about the computation resources, the degrees of freedom, literally in the sense of the degrees of freedom associated with your F test or the degrees of freedom you have available for the computing power to actually get up to these second order inference machines or takes on on second order inference."
"Speaker 5","01;10;33;20","01;11;01;00","So and I think that is particularly important when it comes back to my observation about stress and uncertainty and these higher order ways of making sense of the world, but in this instance, making sense of sensations that are accrued over time, not about the content, but about the reliability or the precision of that content. So as is a really important point Awesome."
"Speaker 3","01;11;01;18","01;11;04;14","So that kind of. Oh, Chris, go ahead."
"Speaker 6","01;11;06;13","01;11;06;19","Yeah."
"Speaker 7","01;11;07;03","01;11;21;08","If I could just pick up on this and take it in in yet another highly related direction. It's just to point out that all of these resources are energetically expensive. So if I'm going to devote."
"Speaker 6","01;11;24;21","01;11;25;14","Space."
"Speaker 7","01;11;27;00","01;11;52;26","In my state space to recording memories, then that's only useful if I can defend those memories against entropy, if I can keep them from decaying. So I've got to consume energy to write the memories I've got to consume energies to energy to maintain the memories. And then I have to consume energy to read the memories and consume energy to."
"Speaker 6","01;11;54;01","01;11;54;25","Compare."
"Speaker 7","01;11;55;09","01;12;12;09","What I've read with what I see with my kind of current events, sensors. So as we start adding these computational resources to systems, the energy budget goes way up. And it's it's."
"Speaker 6","01;12;12;09","01;12;13;28","Another kind of."
"Speaker 7","01;12;15;09","01;12;22;19","Thing to keep in mind as we think about these in terms of embodied forms, whether they're robots or organisms."
"Speaker 6","01;12;23;10","01;12;27;14","That of these these."
"Speaker 7","01;12;27;14","01;12;28;20","Entities are."
"Speaker 6","01;12;28;21","01;12;30;03","Extracting."
"Speaker 7","01;12;30;19","01;12;36;25","This free energy that they have to have to run their computations and maintain their memories and all of that from."
"Speaker 6","01;12;36;25","01;12;37;00","The."
"Speaker 7","01;12;37;00","01;12;45;14","Environment. So here's this is another input that in a sense is not sensory. Then it's still."
"Speaker 6","01;12;45;14","01;12;47;12","Having to flow through the bark."
"Speaker 7","01;12;47;12","01;12;52;01","Of blanket. It's still having to flow through the boundary between the system its environment."
"Speaker 6","01;12;52;22","01;12;53;04","And."
"Speaker 7","01;12;53;26","01;12;58;21","A lot of the systems actions on its environment, its expenditures."
"Speaker 6","01;12;58;29","01;12;59;28","Of, of."
"Speaker 7","01;13;00;29","01;13;02;11","Of its own internal energy."
"Speaker 6","01;13;02;29","01;13;04;28","Of our to."
"Speaker 7","01;13;04;28","01;13;08;10","Acquire this free energy. So, you."
"Speaker 6","01;13;08;10","01;13;10;11","Know, we, we go out and."
"Speaker 7","01;13;11;19","01;13;35;24","Shop for groceries, make breakfast or whatever, all that stuff that we have to do to keep all of these processes running So it ties of metabolism and cognition together in a way that they aren't often tied, but that they have to be to make sense of what's going on Great."
"Speaker 3","01;13;36;08","01;14;03;03","So just on that point, something that we had written down as a question from last time and in terms of an electron having a generative model and discussing agency, we had talked about free choice and it was brought up in the paper several times, both in terms of like any physical system having free choice. If one physical system has free choice they all have free choice."
"Speaker 3","01;14;03;12","01;14;28;06","They generate like there their noise generating things like free choice generates noise in both classical and quantum systems. And so I just was wondering if you could maybe say a few words about the difference in free choice in an electron and the difference in between an electron and like a human or an animal or even a cell. What is that difference?"
"Speaker 3","01;14;28;06","01;14;30;06","And is that also related to memory?"
"Speaker 6","01;14;37;29","01;14;38;03","Oh."
"Speaker 7","01;14;38;16","01;14;39;18","Is that a question for me?"
"Speaker 3","01;14;41;15","01;14;43;24","The general question for anyone."
"Speaker 6","01;14;45;28","01;14;46;28","Well, I'll I'll make a."
"Speaker 7","01;14;46;28","01;14;47;24","Couple of comments."
"Speaker 6","01;14;48;25","01;14;55;15","Of one is of you remember in."
"Speaker 7","01;14;55;16","01;15;22;08","Talking about the canonical entanglement, the experiment of part of the description is that Alice and Bob can alter the directions of their detectors however they want to random independently, whatever you want to call it during the experiment. So that's the free choice assumption or that's called in physics, the free choice assumption."
"Speaker 6","01;15;24;16","01;15;25;27","And what."
"Speaker 7","01;15;25;27","01;15;48;17","That assumption means, it's effectively an assumption of independence. It means that there's not some common cause in the past that determines what they're going to do as they operate their detectors."
"Speaker 6","01;15;51;13","01;15;54;04","And one can reformulate."
"Speaker 7","01;15;56;07","01;15;57;05","Quantum theory."
"Speaker 6","01;15;58;15","01;15;59;01","Of."
"Speaker 7","01;15;59;09","01;16;14;03","In terms of what's called super determinism and super determinism is the idea that there is some common cause in the past."
"Speaker 6","01;16;15;04","01;16;15;19","That."
"Speaker 7","01;16;16;05","01;16;33;04","Determines how experimenters are going to do their experiments. And in particular determines how Alice and Bob are going to rotate their detectors. In this EPR experiment."
"Speaker 6","01;16;35;09","01;16;37;25","And of."
"Speaker 7","01;16;39;00","01;16;43;12","Super determinism is kind of the ultimate, non-local hidden variable."
"Speaker 6","01;16;44;26","01;16;50;07","Oh, so yeah, it allows."
"Speaker 7","01;16;50;07","01;16;52;02","You to predict exactly."
"Speaker 6","01;16;52;02","01;16;52;21","What the."
"Speaker 7","01;16;52;24","01;17;19;15","Entangled pairs are going to do. And in fact, it renders entanglement a classical effect. Right. It just says these these kind of super classical correlations are preserved because there there is no independence to begin with. Everything was determined from the very beginning. And if you think."
"Speaker 6","01;17;19;15","01;17;19;24","About."
"Speaker 7","01;17;21;22","01;17;30;14","As rigid last time, Newtonian physics as formulated by Le CLOs, it's a super determined, deterministic system."
"Speaker 6","01;17;32;02","01;17;32;15","Oh."
"Speaker 7","01;17;33;05","01;18;02;17","So anything that happens anywhere in the universe instantly affects what's going on everywhere else in the universe. And the most the most current formulation of that is Bromium. Quantum mechanics for the motion of any particle depends instantaneously on the motion of every other particle of the universe. That's how Newtonian gravity worked right before. Einstein imposed locality by making the speed of light finite."
"Speaker 7","01;18;03;26","01;18;16;07","So all of these things are interconnected assumptions about spacetime, assumptions, subjects about the speed of communication, assumptions about super determinism, and assumptions about free choice."
"Speaker 6","01;18;18;15","01;18;21;00","It's that cluster."
"Speaker 7","01;18;21;00","01;18;30;05","Of assumptions that the so-called free will theorem in physics is about theorems that have now a couple of them to do to convey."
"Speaker 6","01;18;31;21","01;18;34;18","And so what those."
"Speaker 7","01;18;34;18","01;19;01;11","Theorem show is that from a form perspective in physics, if you assume that some system has free choice, so if you assume that some system is not subject to super determinism, then you have to assume that all systems have free choice in the sense that all systems are not subject to super determinism. So you can't."
"Speaker 6","01;19;01;17","01;19;02;01","Limit."
"Speaker 7","01;19;02;01","01;19;18;11","Super determinism to some little piece of the universe and say it only applies here it doesn't apply anywhere else, and in particular it doesn't apply to me. I have free choice even though nothing else does. That's mathematically inconsistent."
"Speaker 6","01;19;20;29","01;19;24;00","So that's that's what."
"Speaker 7","01;19;24;23","01;19;34;07","The free choice assumption means. And it's in a strict physical context Thank you."
"Speaker 3","01;19;34;07","01;19;37;19","Very cool. You've answered you have a question."
"Speaker 2","01;19;41;05","01;20;15;11","I was just going to ask a little bit more about the and the degrees of entanglement and whether that's different in terms of the observer's degrees and versus the like the mechanical nature of quantum mechanics degrees. I think you've answered that to some extent. But just just the way that that varying degrees of entanglement can be thought about and whether that maybe ties into how the Hilbert space is is thought about at same time."
"Speaker 6","01;20;21;27","01;20;22;27","You know."
"Speaker 7","01;20;23;02","01;20;26;14","This this assumption or this question touches on."
"Speaker 6","01;20;27;00","01;20;27;29","Why we do everything."
"Speaker 7","01;20;27;29","01;20;36;24","In the paper from the point of view of a bipartite decomposition. So we always we always decompose into a system in its environment, in the paper."
"Speaker 7","01;20;39;27","01;20;44;13","And there are two reasons for that. One is to keep it simple."
"Speaker 6","01;20;46;17","01;20;47;23","And the other ones."
"Speaker 7","01;20;47;23","01;20;52;09","To enforce the called blanket condition So."
"Speaker 6","01;20;54;15","01;20;54;28","It's."
"Speaker 7","01;20;56;07","01;21;04;02","Entirely commonplace to do physics in an open systems framework where we talk about."
"Speaker 6","01;21;04;20","01;21;05;03","Our."
"Speaker 7","01;21;06;27","01;21;17;18","Two systems. We can call analysis involved again, that are embedded in a common environment. And in that case, whenever."
"Speaker 6","01;21;17;18","01;21;19;01","You have a."
"Speaker 7","01;21;19;01","01;21;32;12","Tripartite or greater some sort of multi particle kind of decomposition of the state space, you can talk about degrees of entanglement between different systems and you can."
"Speaker 6","01;21;32;20","01;21;33;02","You know."
"Speaker 7","01;21;33;19","01;21;45;28","Cut up the state space anywhere you want to ask about the entanglement, entropy of some component of it. Of and then you get these ideas of of."
"Speaker 6","01;21;46;05","01;21;46;26","Partial."
"Speaker 7","01;21;47;13","01;21;49;21","Or they call it non-monogamous entanglement."
"Speaker 6","01;21;51;06","01;21;54;10","Of and that's all well and good."
"Speaker 7","01;21;54;10","01;22;04;14","It's it's mathematically complicated. It's conceptually complicated, but in a sense, it deeply violates the work called blanket condition."
"Speaker 6","01;22;06;02","01;22;09;09","Of because in point of fact, each."
"Speaker 7","01;22;09;09","01;22;11;07","Of us is an observer."
"Speaker 6","01;22;12;25","01;22;15;07","And of our goal."
"Speaker 7","01;22;15;08","01;22;17;05","Is to just say."
"Speaker 6","01;22;17;11","01;22;18;20","What does the world look."
"Speaker 7","01;22;18;20","01;22;20;11","Like to an observer."
"Speaker 6","01;22;22;29","01;22;24;14","And from."
"Speaker 7","01;22;24;22","01;22;26;08","Alice's point of view."
"Speaker 6","01;22;27;14","01;22;29;02","Of Bob."
"Speaker 7","01;22;29;19","01;22;31;19","Is the decomposition."
"Speaker 6","01;22;31;19","01;22;35;15","Of her bar called Blanket. Right."
"Speaker 7","01;22;37;02","01;22;40;16","How else has to actively disambiguate."
"Speaker 6","01;22;41;29","01;22;42;13","Of."
"Speaker 7","01;22;43;04","01;23;01;19","Her incoming signals into signals that she attributes to Bob as an entity? And signals that she attributes to the rest of the environment as an entity. So that's an active cognitive process. On Alice's part."
"Speaker 6","01;23;03;08","01;23;04;28","Of that's what the mark of."
"Speaker 7","01;23;04;28","01;23;13;21","Blanket tradition. That's how the bar called blanket conditioned in a sense, forces us to think so."
"Speaker 6","01;23;14;08","01;23;15;11","Of the mark of."
"Speaker 7","01;23;15;19","01;23;17;09","The condition itself."
"Speaker 7","01;23;19;13","01;23;32;13","Makes us take this idea of bipartite decomposition seriously. And again, you can think of this in terms of implicit assumptions about the sources."
"Speaker 6","01;23;33;24","01;23;36;02","Of if you think."
"Speaker 7","01;23;36;02","01;24;05;03","In open systems terms. And so you think of Alice Bob as as antic entities that are that are separate from each other by our priority assumption and separate from their environments by our priority assumption, then you systematically underestimate the amount of cognition that Alice and Bob have to be to it. And so you systematically underestimate their energy consumption."
"Speaker 7","01;24;05;24","01;24;28;28","And so you systematically underestimate their they are uncontrollable affect on the environment, a generation of waste, heat acquisition of free energy resources and all that. So it's not just a philosophical difference. It's a difference that leads you to make."
"Speaker 6","01;24;29;22","01;24;31;29","Of genuinely."
"Speaker 7","01;24;31;29","01;24;39;24","Alternative predictions about things like metabolic load. So that's why."
"Speaker 6","01;24;39;24","01;24;40;03","We."
"Speaker 7","01;24;40;14","01;24;49;14","Do things in this bipartite framework to respect the work of condition and to keep our assumptions."
"Speaker 6","01;24;50;09","01;24;50;24","About."
"Speaker 7","01;24;51;00","01;24;52;15","Energy flow explicit."
"Speaker 1","01;24;58;11","01;25;18;21","And we take that to the latter sections in the paper about biological or cognition What are the implications for this for biological systems Yeah."
"Speaker 6","01;25;18;27","01;25;23;20","Coral Well."
"Speaker 5","01;25;26;05","01;25;54;02","Just to pursue that sort of thought experiment where you're trying to now say you wanted to use active inference, distinguishing Alice and Bob, observing a pair of electrons and remembering that the pair of electrons are one thing. So you now got a tripartite with three mark of blankets in play and many of the issues, for example, the super determinism that allows some assumptions about the pure alignment between Bob and Alice."
"Speaker 5","01;25;55;16","01;26;32;15","To be in play and also the discussion of how Alice has to have has to contextualize sensations from Bob under a belief or an internal model that Bob is indeed another mark of blanket and possibly a malleable blanket, very much like Alice. What you are saying is that two of these particles of bananas have aligned QR acts that could have been aligned historically under the Super Bowl, which I'd never heard of before."
"Speaker 5","01;26;32;15","01;27;13;27","But I like the word at the super determinism, and that may be a prerequisite to understand the experiments that we were taken through. I previously went looking at the third mark of Blanket, which would be the the electron or the two electrons, but for simplicity. And so that from a biological perspective tells you something quite quite interesting in the sense that it starts to get to the if it's the case that you can basically carve up a bunch of states not in a bipartite way, but in a multiparty way."
"Speaker 5","01;27;14;06","01;27;43;14","And that carving is by inserting Markov blankets to define the partition and the every, if you like, subset of that space now becomes interpreted as a mark of packet. So there are now no external states or we have a play now or a set of internal states, each equipped with the holographic screen or mock of blanket states that are exchanging with other internal states."
"Speaker 5","01;27;43;24","01;28;12;19","Then there's some really interesting questions about how that system will evolve from the point of view of the discussion we've been having. It's going to evolve under the principle of the maturity to entanglement. So it's going to from from a classical perspective, if you allow me, it's going to tend to a state of generalized synchronization where everything collapses under the same synchronization manifold and everything's indistinguishable."
"Speaker 5","01;28;12;22","01;28;44;13","This perfect mutual predictability. That's a communication of an elemental and fundamental soul. So everything has basically in everything is seen from exactly the same hymn sheet. That's the natural way of things. The free energy principle is just one way of describing that natural tendency. What would that look like? Cognitively? Well, it would look as if the mark of blackheads we're trying to learn about each other, and to the extent that they can act on each other, they're going to try and solicit the kinds of outcomes that would enable them to learn about each other."
"Speaker 5","01;28;44;24","01;29;12;23","So we're now going to get a situation that is driven by the imperative towards mutual predictability and entanglement. That's an illusion. All that is actually happening is that the system is becoming entangled, but it will look as if all of these separate Markov blankets or sets of internal states are aligning in a mutually compatible way that cure so that they can exchange and protect each other."
"Speaker 5","01;29;12;29","01;29;35;28","And if there's if you like, an odd man out, namely the power of electrons, and then then there will be an asymmetry and there will be greater degrees of entanglement, the multiple levels, for example, if they're both observing a thermal state, that the thermostat is not going to be very good at learning how to a light bulb analysis, but they're all going to make the best job of it."
"Speaker 5","01;29;36;11","01;29;52;19","And ultimately, of course, we could culturally can establish construction, though they'll build better thermostats to become little robots, and then they can all live happily and communicate. So I think that's sort of the cognitive thing here comes again back to learning to live in your."
"Speaker 6","01;29;52;19","01;29;53;04","World."
"Speaker 5","01;29;53;23","01;30;20;16","As an apparent expression of the the inevitable progression to entanglement whereby we try to learn about each other under the plausible hypothesis that you are like me. It's not necessarily true, but it is one hypothesis you can bring to the table. You never know whether it's true or not. But that's certainly one hypothesis. It would work very nicely for Alex and Bob if they can develop a common language."
"Speaker 5","01;30;20;25","01;30;58;04","So this notion of aligning curates between two blanketed systems particles that are sufficiently similar then just simply translates into learning to share the same narrative, to share the same language, in order to render everything mutually predictable. So I know exactly what you're going to say next, and you know exactly what I'm going to say next. And we come now to this asymptotic limit of zero prediction error 03 energy and complete entanglement And that would be the know."
"Speaker 5","01;30;58;13","01;31;29;26","The object will have no Ukraines or Brexit. So if we could get there, but that would be the other direction of travel from a biological perspective. And just just to say that there are simulations of this from a purely classical perspective, star and what you normally do is start off with two systems that think they have strange attractors, usually a Lorenz attractor."
"Speaker 5","01;31;30;16","01;31;59;02","So they think that the dynamics are generated by the act that they're autonomous or the active states create stuff out there that has a chaotic aspect. And I say that explicitly just because the sort of the notion of freewill and choice in the classical domain usually reduces to sensitivity due to initial conditions, which strikes me as a homolog of the super determinism game."
"Speaker 5","01;31;59;15","01;32;30;18","Yeah. Can you go right back to the beginning and explain everything and in sort of classical dynamical systems, there are certain situations where you can't because you've got a sensitive situation conditions so that the space or free word choice that that's likely to occur at what level. But I digress. So what you do is you basically put sort of two chaotic systems with sensitivity to initial conditions together, but they're not identical in the first instance."
"Speaker 5","01;32;30;18","01;33;11;02","But if they can exchange sensory and active space so they can exchange across a shared holographic screen. So we're now back to the bipartite situation, then they will naturally. If you think about it, they can't do anything else they will naturally come to a state of entanglement, i.e. if a generalized synchrony. And if you allow the parameters of the equations of motion to underwrite these chaotic dynamic dynamics to also maximize mutual predictability or minimize energy then they will actually come to show an identical synchronization because they will learn to become like each other just like max robots."
"Speaker 5","01;33;11;26","01;33;37;19","But in this instance, they're learning about the other person simply to make things predictable. So then you will have a shared narrative, and in principle you should be able to evince a kind I mentioned that because I know Chris wanted to talk about. We wanted to talk about, you know, quantum. Quantum physics is just basically a description of communication, of language I don't think we can have time to do that, but I thought honestly about it anyway."
"Speaker 3","01;33;40;14","01;33;46;23","The rest of you want to say a few words, quantum and language."
"Speaker 6","01;33;49;14","01;33;50;23","Oh, well, that."
"Speaker 7","01;33;50;27","01;34;05;11","Was that was lovely. Carl and I, I like the idea of this kind of simulation leading to, to generalize synchrony. I think it's interesting from this perspective."
"Speaker 6","01;34;05;19","01;34;10;25","That we of we always."
"Speaker 7","01;34;10;25","01;34;17;18","Divide our environment into entities like us."
"Speaker 6","01;34;18;19","01;34;21;12","And then at least one entity."
"Speaker 7","01;34;21;12","01;34;30;05","That's radically unlike us, which we call the shared environment or the, the open environment, the general environment or something like that."
"Speaker 6","01;34;30;27","01;34;34;22","And so we."
"Speaker 7","01;34;34;22","01;34;41;14","Have this sense of a social grouping of similar entities."
"Speaker 6","01;34;43;02","01;34;43;10","That."
"Speaker 7","01;34;43;10","01;34;47;25","Are commonly exposed to this vastly dissimilar entity."
"Speaker 6","01;34;48;22","01;34;49;01","With."
"Speaker 7","01;34;49;01","01;35;03;14","Which we don't share a common language. Oh, and we're not very good at predicting and so on. And so we always have this kind of open systems point of view."
"Speaker 6","01;35;04;23","01;35;07;06","And of one of the."
"Speaker 7","01;35;07;06","01;35;26;09","Functions of this vastly different system with which we don't share a common language is it's our free energy source and SEC. So it's where we put our waste and it's, it's where we get our free energy for doing computation Oh."
"Speaker 6","01;35;28;03","01;35;31;04","So I, I think it's."
"Speaker 7","01;35;31;04","01;35;32;01","Interesting to."
"Speaker 6","01;35;32;01","01;35;33;13","Think of all."
"Speaker 7","01;35;33;26","01;35;35;10","The situation of."
"Speaker 6","01;35;36;09","01;35;38;11","All kind of local."
"Speaker 7","01;35;39;08","01;35;40;10","Synchrony or."
"Speaker 6","01;35;40;11","01;35;42;18","Local entanglement or a local."
"Speaker 7","01;35;42;18","01;35;43;28","Language community."
"Speaker 6","01;35;44;20","01;35;58;15","All local shared predictability, all embedded in, of this unpredictable chaotic and in a."
"Speaker 7","01;35;58;15","01;36;02;00","Sense in principle chaotic because it's."
"Speaker 6","01;36;02;10","01;36;05;27","The waste heat though, right? Now."
"Speaker 7","01;36;06;11","01;36;11;03","We've assumed our priorities that we can't understand it because it's where we're."
"Speaker 6","01;36;11;03","01;36;19;14","Putting all of our the thermodynamic entropy that we're creating Oh."
"Speaker 7","01;36;21;05","01;36;24;18","We've we've put ourselves in a conceptual."
"Speaker 6","01;36;24;18","01;36;25;29","Bind almost."
"Speaker 7","01;36;25;29","01;36;31;22","Automatically by being systems that does have to generate this entropy and put it somewhere."
"Speaker 6","01;36;33;21","01;36;34;06","So I."
"Speaker 7","01;36;34;06","01;36;39;12","Like this, this classical to quantum correspondence very much, and I think it works very nicely."
"Speaker 3","01;36;41;19","01;36;42;01","Awesome."
"Speaker 4","01;36;42;13","01;37;16;06","Mike Yeah. I want to I want to float an idea which is literally just a few days old, so it may be complete nonsense, but I'll float it anyway because I think it's I think it's, it's relevant and I've been thinking about it this way. It occurs to me that, you know, this binary distinction between there are agents, some of them like me, some of them different, maybe competitors, whatever, but they're there are some agents that I can communicate with or can I receive influence or signals from."
"Speaker 4","01;37;16;15","01;37;33;09","And then and then there's this environment which is, you know, something that we assume or I mean, some, some cultures, of course, don't assume that. But but we can assume that it has very low or zero agency, meaning that it just is this sort of dumb, purposeless universe and it's on us to sort of figure out what it's doing right."
"Speaker 4","01;37;33;18","01;37;55;25","So it occurs to me that that distinction maybe shouldn't be binary. And maybe what we want to be thinking about is as an agent, when you are receiving something from from what you think is the outside, you might want to estimate what is the agency on the other end for, and you might want to do this for the following reason."
"Speaker 4","01;37;55;25","01;38;12;14","Right. And I started thinking about this by imagining what it would be like to be in an internal partition or a chunk of a giant neural net being trained. You know, you live if that's you, you live in a very mindful universe. You know, you could catch on to the fact that, you know what I'm being I'm being trained for something."
"Speaker 4","01;38;12;14","01;38;33;11","You know the world like there are bigger patterns here. And of course, it moves in inscrutable ways and everything because I can't you know, I can't sort of I can't understand the whole pattern of what's going on. But I can definitely tell that it's rewarding me and punishing me for specific behaviors. Right. And of course, some people do feel that way about the universe and very large that there are patterns that are that are not just you know, not quote unquote, just physics."
"Speaker 4","01;38;33;25","01;38;49;14","And so so the reason that the reason I think and this extends to, you know, we have supervised learning and unsupervised learning. And again, we think of those is kind of binary things, right? Is there some sort of intelligence on the other end telling you what's right and wrong or is it just on you to abstract patterns from the environment?"
"Speaker 4","01;38;49;25","01;39;12;16","And the reason I think we this matters is that if if if you are trying to learn from the environment, meaning there's only one agent involved, there's right there, that's you. There's one agent. And then there's this sort of unthinking universe around you, then you are pretty much guaranteed that whatever whatever you can manage to infer to it will be to your utility."
"Speaker 4","01;39;12;16","01;39;36;05","It's on you to figure out, to learn whatever you can. If there's another agent on the other side and you are being trained right, then what are the odds that that agent has your best interests at heart? I mean, maybe, but maybe not. And so if this is some sort of supervised learning, you have to ask yourself, what is it that I'm being trained and is it really what I what I want?"
"Speaker 4","01;39;36;05","01;40;04;06","Right. Is this another kind of a whole thing that you can imagine evolutionarily that maybe to avoid being hijacked by bye bye, bye bye parasites, by by competitors, by whoever you don't really want to be trainable too much. You want to learn, but you don't really want to be trained. And so maybe the idea then is that what if what if and this is okay, this is where, you know, I really haven't ever talked to anybody about this yet."
"Speaker 4","01;40;04;06","01;40;26;15","So this is this again, could be a very immature stuff. But but what if something like back propagation or whatever? What if that literally hurts? What if as a as a right, as an early creature having some sort of error function forced back through your channels as opposed to whatever you were trying to generate yourself? What if that's evolutionarily designed to be unpleasant?"
"Speaker 4","01;40;26;22","01;40;47;16","And what if what you're trying to do is avoid that happening? You don't want to be trained. You want to learn on your own terms. And you could sort of imagine the different layers of a feedforward artificial neural network where the like the initial input layer that that sort of creature gets to see the world, quote unquote, as it is."
"Speaker 4","01;40;47;16","01;41;03;16","It gets the raw inputs the next layer and certainly the layers past that, you know, the ones on the right that are abstracting, they're getting all kinds of propaganda filtered to them by the early layers you know, they don't get to see the real inputs. They get the C, whatever the pre with the prior layers think they should be seeing."
"Speaker 4","01;41;04;00","01;41;29;08","And and so maybe if you don't have a flat network like this, but maybe what you have is a, you know, more biologically you have a kind of a nested multiscale kind of system. Maybe there's some sort of incentive for the middle layers to try to sort of crawl leftward so that they have more raw access to the real world and not be trapped being being fed by these other agents."
"Speaker 4","01;41;29;08","01;41;35;15","Right. So again, you know, this is all very qualitative stuff, but you get the idea that's that's kind of what what what I was thinking about."
"Speaker 3","01;41;39;03","01;41;42;23","Like the in and then there."
"Speaker 2","01;41;45;02","01;42;27;20","Mike, if you want to chat about this, this is what I was doing for about ten years, unleashing and getting out of the lab and getting passed to a model. So perhaps we should add about this for a bit. I can I just a couple of things, Chris. First of all, thank you for I feel like I've come away with a Munich Stein volume worth of of coolness for the last two weeks since listening to explain these really complex, complicated things to me in ways that I can actually understand one of the things that I'm I'm still kind of curious about is once we let things out of the lab and we keep them in that"
"Speaker 2","01;42;27;20","01;42;48;06","variability routine, space, and we're and we don't want to be in conflict with sort of the basic rules of what quantum information tells us. I want to kind of go back for one second to what Steven was kind of closing the 40.1 with. And that is what do we do when we look at things in that sort of relational realm?"
"Speaker 2","01;42;48;06","01;43;16;29","That a lot of in indigenous cultures sort of take up and try to find themselves within and kind of leading to this idea that there's there's a sort of a subject matter generalist that leads to a prediction matter expert down the road. And I, I talked to Karl. I have it was my question to Karl back in June when he was talking to us in the Act of Inference lab."
"Speaker 2","01;43;16;29","01;43;40;11","And so without getting into any kind of conflict with the quantum aspects of this, what, what, what do we take out was with us when we go on a bike ride with with Chris Fields that's that's quantum related, that isn't in conflict with everything we've talked about today but gives us a better confidence around the things that we might encounter and predict."
"Speaker 1","01;43;47;11","01;43;48;25","What do you take on your bike, Chris?"
"Speaker 2","01;43;50;11","01;43;53;24","Yeah. What's in your quiver yeah."
"Speaker 6","01;43;53;26","01;43;54;11","A good."
"Speaker 7","01;43;54;11","01;43;55;03","Question."
"Speaker 6","01;43;55;13","01;44;11;09","Of know Once again, these these theoretical frameworks are."
"Speaker 7","01;44;11;09","01;44;12;15","Languages."
"Speaker 6","01;44;14;00","01;44;17;28","And they their role."
"Speaker 7","01;44;17;28","01;44;23;05","Is to shape our concepts where there they are ways of shaping our concepts."
"Speaker 6","01;44;25;03","01;44;35;02","And of I think the fundamental kind of."
"Speaker 7","01;44;35;09","01;44;42;07","Lesson of quantum theory for us is to."
"Speaker 6","01;44;44;02","01;44;45;20","Not take the."
"Speaker 7","01;44;45;20","01;45;15;16","Boundaries we see. Oh, as literally as we're encouraged to do. And the classical worldview, I'll try to distinguish the classical worldview from classical physics, because classical physics by itself again, going back to someone local place."
"Speaker 6","01;45;16;18","01;45;17;00","Oh."
"Speaker 7","01;45;18;08","01;45;21;00","Is a physics of."
"Speaker 6","01;45;21;00","01;45;23;02","Of atoms."
"Speaker 7","01;45;24;09","01;45;27;26","Which are, which are, you know, sort of elemental."
"Speaker 6","01;45;28;16","01;45;28;27","Oh."
"Speaker 7","01;45;29;15","01;45;35;22","It's not a physics of bounded macroscopic objects. The boundaries even in classical physics are sort of arbitrary."
"Speaker 6","01;45;37;13","01;45;39;16","And I think that's what quantum."
"Speaker 7","01;45;40;01","01;45;46;26","Theory is trying to tell us to is try to tell. It's that these, these are boundaries that we draw."
"Speaker 6","01;45;47;10","01;45;48;23","On our blankets."
"Speaker 7","01;45;49;22","01;45;52;07","And I think this is in a sense, what."
"Speaker 6","01;45;53;04","01;45;53;29","Our thinking."
"Speaker 7","01;45;53;29","01;45;56;08","About the FP is trying to tell. It's not."
"Speaker 6","01;45;57;06","01;45;58;01","That we have to."
"Speaker 7","01;45;58;04","01;46;10;17","Take this notion that we're blanketed entities seriously when we think about what we're interacting with, which is everything but us."
"Speaker 3","01;46;16;15","01;46;16;27","Daniel."
"Speaker 1","01;46;20;23","01;46;53;04","In our closing minutes, if we could just each give a thought, this is really just a special and very powerful conversation. Mike, with the back propaganda, amazing experiments there. And no boundary and quantum questions touching on the work of like Ken Wilbur. And I think it's just so powerful about does someone have the whole world in their hands is not a good person?"
"Speaker 1","01;46;53;04","01;47;24;08","Is it a bad person or thing? What kind of thing is that? Who's on the other side of this video call? Who's on the other side of that other side? What's the bigger picture? And it really brings it home that, no, it's not just about electrons. This is something that is across scales and systems. So really just want to appreciate the paper and hope that we continue on this line of development."
"Speaker 1","01;47;25;18","01;47;26;19","And I'll pass to Stephen."
"Speaker 2","01;47;29;12","01;48;09;12","Thanks, Daniel. Yeah, I was going to try this a little bit. Some of the threads with this challenge of having this false sense of certainty in our culture, and it does feel uncomfortable to be trained, but we do it in the West because we're confident that we've got this expert knowledge, but then we suddenly find that we don't know as much as we do know or we think we know so that may be why bottom up so organic, indigenous kind of ways of being or ways of sensing can feel more holistic so I think there might be something quite powerful in that."
"Speaker 2","01;48;09;12","01;48;44;08","So I like that come in. I think that ties together with the challenges in practice when we try to train up community, especially if we're working inside of our works in rural Africa and the communities that if they don't feel connected to the the colonizing narrative, it feels very oppressive. So there's, you know, there's a lot of good points there around where is there coherence, where there's a decoherence, and also where's the certainty and where there's uncertainty."
"Speaker 2","01;48;44;08","01;48;53;28","So thanks this is really helpful. And then I'll pass it over to Blue Well."
"Speaker 3","01;48;54;13","01;49;07;23","I've said enough. I think I'd like to hear from Mike or Carl or Chris about where where you're going or what you're taking away, or what are your final thoughts about the discussion we've had over the last couple of weeks."
"Speaker 4","01;49;10;09","01;49;35;09","I mean, I guess I guess the only thing I'll say is that to me, I really like this idea that it turns on its head, this notion that that you have this, this, this massive amount of mindless stuff, and then somehow a little bit of mine shows up at the end that kind of turns it upside down. And and if that's the case, then it becomes then the scaling problem is really, really interesting, right?"
"Speaker 4","01;49;35;09","01;49;57;01","Is how you scale how biology manages to scale these things so that they become synergistic, synergistic and bigger and bigger as opposed to, you know, just merely a bigger pile of rocks than than the previous pile of rocks. And so that right. So so those are those mechanisms and in particular in biology. And so I look at it from from cells getting together to be organisms and solving problems in the anatomical space."
"Speaker 4","01;49;57;11","01;50;19;14","But but I think there we actually have some pretty good alternative. Well, although very, very, very similar in many ways, I see more free but alternative stories to what happens in neuroscience to try to understand how that scaling actually works. So I'm super I'm just super, super excited about that. And also the role of the observer in all of this and the idea that all of this is based on various observers observing each other."
"Speaker 4","01;50;19;14","01;50;25;21","And I think that makes it makes for a lot of progress and fewer pseudo problems. When you when you look at it that way."
"Speaker 3","01;50;31;14","01;50;40;05","Karl or Chris, any final thoughts well."
"Speaker 7","01;50;40;12","01;50;45;15","I'll just thank you guys again for putting us together. I thought this was a fascinating conversation."
"Speaker 6","01;50;46;11","01;50;51;29","And I'll I'll throw one."
"Speaker 7","01;50;51;29","01;50;58;03","More thing into it. I, I, I think conversations like this are, are evidence."
"Speaker 6","01;50;58;22","01;50;59;06","Or."
"Speaker 7","01;51;00;04","01;51;14;06","Oh, the, the kind of disciplinary civilization that's been forced on to us by academic tradition being an artifact and not necessarily being all that useful."
"Speaker 3","01;51;21;14","01;51;26;09","Thanks so much, Karl. We're going to leave you with the final word go ahead."
"Speaker 5","01;51;26;10","01;51;55;03","Well, it has to be a because of the more you lock for putting this together and for the brilliant didactic and also challenging didactic unpacking of some really challenging, but I think revealing issues and also the brilliant questions. And my final work will be future pointing. I'm just taking off taking up the slate of questions. You know, having on siloed conversations is useful."
"Speaker 5","01;51;55;03","01;52;21;01","Just think thinking about Mike having the balls to come out with his brand new hypotheses of two years or so, two days of my book, it's how I thought it was really interesting and just an example of putting things into this kind of discussion which are all going away and think about. So my immediate thought was, how on earth does the second layer in a variational to encode or something doing back problem act?"
"Speaker 5","01;52;22;08","01;52;47;12","And of course it can act if if it's a recurrent neural network and it can select which of the the low level neurons or hidden that as I know, are not hidden units to listen to. And of course we come back again exactly to attention and selecting those sources of precise information and where you've got a kind of internal action."
"Speaker 5","01;52;47;19","01;53;00;28","So it's an interesting and silly thought, but just a nice example of how talking together can excite interesting and potentially useful or possibly silly. So we thought, well, again, thank you."
"Speaker 3","01;53;02;07","01;53;08;17","Wonderful. I had a great time observing all of you and hope to get to do more of it in the future."
"Speaker 1","01;53;10;04","01;53;28;07","Yep, we can have a dart three any time. Consider 40 in the interim measurement interval while Argus is digesting and talk to you all since Thanks again."
"Speaker 4","01;53;28;25","01;53;30;07","Thanks very much everyone. Thank you."
"Speaker 2","01;53;30;07","01;53;31;15","Bye bye. It's great."
