"00;01;31;22","00;01;35;04","And in this data,"
"00;01;35;07","00;01;37;16","we're just going to have introductions"
"00;01;37;16","00;01;38;16","and then jump"
"00;01;38;16","00;01;41;22","right in to several of the notes"
"00;01;41;22","00;01;43;05","that we left for ourself"
"00;01;43;05","00;01;44;14","from last time"
"00;01;44;14","00;01;46;27","and see where else it goes."
"00;01;46;27","00;01;47;29","And anyone can write"
"00;01;47;29","00;01;49;19","a comment in the live chat"
"00;01;49;19","00;01;52;13","and we'll just say hello again,"
"00;01;53;07","00;01;55;10","pick up with some threads"
"00;01;55;18","00;01;58;01","that were left unspooled in the dot one"
"00;01;58;12","00;02;00;11","and see where we get in the dot too"
"00;02;00;11","00;02;02;18","and how we continue going forward."
"00;02;02;18","00;02;05;23","So I'm Daniel, I'm a researcher"

"00;02;18;08","00;02;20;19","I'm in Calgary in Canada."
"00;02;20;19","00;02;21;10","My emphasis,"
"00;02;21;10","00;02;22;22","I think, is on the practice part"
"00;02;22;22","00;02;23;23","of active inference"
"00;02;23;23","00;02;25;15","and seeing how"
"00;02;25;15","00;02;26;08","it gets applied"
"00;02;26;08","00;02;28;20","in in different contexts situations."
"00;02;29;13","00;02;32;29","I'll pass it to Blue."

"00;02;40;14","00;02;42;14","be facilitating the discussion today."
"00;02;42;14","00;02;45;15","But let me pass it off to Stephen"
"00;02;45;15","00;02;46;21","if he's still here."

"00;03;11;24","00;03;12;12","We go"
"00;03;12;12","00;03;15;10","so let's pass it to Mike first"
"00;03;15;10","00;03;18;01","since we have audio this time."
"00;03;21;06","00;03;22;11","Yes, I yeah."
"00;03;22;11","00;03;24;08","This is Mike Levin."
"00;03;24;20","00;03;26;15","I do biology at Tufts"
"00;03;26;15","00;03;27;15","trying to"
"00;03;27;15","00;03;28;27","understand what"
"00;03;28;27","00;03;29;26","what living systems"
"00;03;29;26","00;03;30;29","are doing at all scales"
"00;03;30;29","00;03;31;22","and how"
"00;03;31;29","00;03;34;01","intelligence manifests in various"
"00;03;34;11","00;03;37;18","unconventional embodiments across them."
"00;03;37;21","00;03;38;19","And they compete in"
"00;03;38;19","00;03;39;17","and cooperate across"
"00;03;39;17","00;03;41;02","scales to give us the amazing"
"00;03;41;02","00;03;42;12","phenomena we see in biology."
"00;03;44;19","00;03;45;12","Awesome."
"00;03;45;12","00;03;46;15","Thank you."
"00;03;46;25","00;03;48;25","Dave, would you like to say hello?"
"00;03;48;26","00;03;50;16","Introduce yourself"
"00;03;54;07","00;03;56;11","maybe no audio also."
"00;03;56;11","00;03;57;03","Okay."
"00;03;57;03","00;03;59;03","How about Carl?"
"00;03;59;10","00;04;01;22","Would you like to say hello?"
"00;04;02;09","00;04;03;16","Yes, I would."
"00;04;03;16","00;04;04;03","Hello."
"00;04;04;25","00;04;06;06","I'm Carl."
"00;04;06;06","00;04;08;18","I'm one of the coauthors on the paper."
"00;04;08;21","00;04;11;15","I'm a neuroscientist from London."
"00;04;11;15","00;04;12;10","I have to confess, I'm"
"00;04;12;10","00;04;13;11","a bit of a passenger"
"00;04;13;11","00;04;14;28","and admirer of this paper,"
"00;04;14;28","00;04;17;03","so I'm here to learn as much to"
"00;04;17;20","00;04;19;10","as trans the questions."
"00;04;19;10","00;04;22;10","So I'll pass it on to Chris who."
"00;04;27;01","00;04;27;23","Hi, I'm."
"00;04;27;23","00;04;28;19","Chris Fields."
"00;04;28;19","00;04;30;29","I'm also an independent researcher."
"00;04;32;07","00;04;33;17","Working. Sort of. On the."
"00;04;33;17","00;04;36;15","Boundaries between physics and biology."
"00;04;36;15","00;04;38;29","And information science and"
"00;04;40;17","00;04;41;16","sort of convinced"
"00;04;41;16","00;04;42;22","that those are all three"
"00;04;42;22","00;04;46;02","the same actual discipline."
"00;04;46;02","00;04;49;08","So this is a paper that expands"
"00;04;49;08","00;04;50;15","on that theme a little bit."
"00;04;52;25","00;04;53;11","Great."
"00;04;53;11","00;04;54;08","Thank you."
"00;04;54;16","00;04;56;14","So I think where we left off"
"00;04;56;14","00;04;59;28","last time was talking about how"
"00;05;00;21","00;05;03;28","the FP is asymptotically"
"00;05;03;28","00;05;06;08","the principle of unitary."
"00;05;06;08","00;05;07;08","And maybe, Chris,"
"00;05;07;08","00;05;09;17","would you mind leaving this off here?"
"00;05;09;17","00;05;12;08","And if you want to point out a specific"
"00;05;12;28","00;05;15;17","maybe formalism or place"
"00;05;15;17","00;05;17;02","where we should start,"
"00;05;17;02","00;05;18;19","I think it was the very last formalism"
"00;05;18;19","00;05;20;24","in the in the paper actually."
"00;05;20;24","00;05;21;26","But maybe if you would"
"00;05;21;26","00;05;22;27","talk us through that,"
"00;05;22;27","00;05;25;25","that would be super appreciated."
"00;05;29;17","00;05;30;12","Okay."
"00;05;30;12","00;05;31;13","Oh, well,"
"00;05;31;13","00;05;34;14","let's let's talk first informally."
"00;05;35;08","00;05;37;07","Just about."
"00;05;37;25","00;05;38;20","The motivation."
"00;05;38;20","00;05;39;25","For this idea"
"00;05;39;25","00;05;42;09","and how it might make sense."
"00;05;42;15","00;05;44;07","Intuitively."
"00;05;44;11","00;05;46;12","And again, I'll go."
"00;05;46;12","00;05;48;06","Back to"
"00;05;48;27","00;05;51;13","calls paper from 2019"
"00;05;51;13","00;05;52;02","the free energy"
"00;05;52;02","00;05;54;04","principle for a particular physics."
"00;05;55;01","00;05;56;07","Which, which."
"00;05;56;07","00;05;57;29","The current paper is obviously."
"00;05;57;29","00;06;00;03","Modeled. After in a certain way."
"00;06;01;13","00;06;04;23","And as we discussed last time I think."
"00;06;05;05","00;06;06;23","Of what."
"00;06;06;23","00;06;07;19","Carl was able"
"00;06;07;19","00;06;09;24","to show in particular physics."
"00;06;10;24","00;06;13;04","Was that the idea"
"00;06;13;19","00;06;17;08","of the very intuitive idea of a thing"
"00;06;18;06","00;06;19;22","of. Something."
"00;06;19;22","00;06;23;06","That exists and"
"00;06;24;17","00;06;26;11","importantly maintains."
"00;06;26;11","00;06;28;20","Its identity"
"00;06;28;20","00;06;31;22","as a single system"
"00;06;31;22","00;06;33;09","over time."
"00;06;33;13","00;06;35;02","And what that means."
"00;06;35;02","00;06;35;24","Is that it's"
"00;06;35;24","00;06;37;05","it can be measured"
"00;06;37;05","00;06;40;06","by some other system."
"00;06;40;06","00;06;42;22","Of and it can be."
"00;06;42;22","00;06;45;08","Measured repeatedly and reliably."
"00;06;47;09","00;06;48;13","Over time by."
"00;06;48;13","00;06;49;18","Some other system."
"00;06;49;18","00;06;50;29","So something"
"00;06;50;29","00;06;52;07","this is associated"
"00;06;52;07","00;06;55;07","with repeated measure of building."
"00;06;55;19","00;06;56;21","And what"
"00;06;57;05","00;06;59;13","code is able to show and."
"00;06;59;13","00;07;01;16","In particular physics was. That if."
"00;07;01;16","00;07;03;26","We assume that something is a thing."
"00;07;04;14","00;07;05;29","That then we're."
"00;07;05;29","00;07;06;18","Effectively"
"00;07;06;18","00;07;09;09","assuming that it has a stable,"
"00;07;09;22","00;07;11;27","non-equilibrium, steady state density"
"00;07;12;17","00;07;13;26","and therefore we're assuming"
"00;07;13;26","00;07;15;08","that it has a Markov block,"
"00;07;16;12","00;07;17;13","and therefore we can."
"00;07;17;13","00;07;20;23","Treat it as implementing."
"00;07;20;23","00;07;22;23","Active inference as."
"00;07;23;02","00;07;23;24","Of."
"00;07;24;05","00;07;25;01","Constantly"

"00;07;31;02","00;07;33;13","that prediction come true"
"00;07;33;13","00;07;34;01","to the extent."
"00;07;34;01","00;07;37;05","That it can and how."
"00;07;37;26","00;07;38;09","Such."
"00;07;38;09","00;07;42;13","Behavior may be prevented or overcome."
"00;07;42;13","00;07;44;28","By its environment"
"00;07;44;28","00;07;47;16","so the environment of some thing"
"00;07;48;25","00;07;51;16","may cause it to cease to exist."
"00;07;53;01","00;07;55;13","Oh, you know, the thing could be a."
"00;07;55;13","00;07;58;03","Marble sitting on a table, and its."
"00;07;58;03","00;07;59;10","Environment could."
"00;07;59;10","00;08;00;18","Include a sledgehammer"
"00;08;00;18","00;08;03;09","that's about to come down on top of it."
"00;08;03;09","00;08;05;20","And had destroy its thing."
"00;08;05;20","00;08;06;15","This"
"00;08;08;13","00;08;10;28","But as long as"
"00;08;10;28","00;08;11;22","the environment"
"00;08;11;22","00;08;15;02","doesn't do the out of the."
"00;08;15;02","00;08;17;29","The object can continue."
"00;08;18;22","00;08;19;16","To."
"00;08;20;05","00;08;22;20","To execute active inference"
"00;08;22;20","00;08;23;12","and maintain"
"00;08;23;12","00;08;25;27","its mark of blanket by so do it."
"00;08;25;27","00;08;27;04","And of course its Markov."
"00;08;27;04","00;08;28;11","Blanket is what."
"00;08;28;11","00;08;32;09","Defines it as a separate entity, as a."
"00;08;32;09","00;08;33;11","Thing."
"00;08;33;11","00;08;35;13","That's distinct from its environment."
"00;08;37;01","00;08;38;07","So let's translate."
"00;08;38;07","00;08;41;05","All of. That into quantum. Theory"
"00;08;41;05","00;08;43;17","of in quantum theory"
"00;08;43;28","00;08;46;04","we have this"
"00;08;46;29","00;08;47;15","notion."
"00;08;47;15","00;08;49;23","Of interaction as measurement."
"00;08;49;24","00;08;50;28","Already."
"00;08;50;28","00;08;52;22","And we have a notion of interaction."
"00;08;52;22","00;08;55;23","There's information exchange on Reddit."
"00;08;55;23","00;08;58;10","So it's very natural to"
"00;08;59;12","00;09;01;26","take this whole picture and, and,"
"00;09;03;07","00;09;06;11","and make the notion of measurement"

"00;09;25;03","00;09;26;00","And holographic."
"00;09;26;00","00;09;28;07","Screens were introduced"

"00;09;32;16","00;09;34;17","Well, but a holographic screen."
"00;09;35;02","00;09;37;04","Is is just a reformulation"
"00;09;37;04","00;09;38;04","of the concept"
"00;09;38;04","00;09;39;14","of a more called blanket."
"00;09;39;14","00;09;41;24","It's it's. A boundary."
"00;09;42;02","00;09;44;17","That encodes information"

"00;09;55;10","00;09;56;09","So"
"00;09;58;01","00;09;59;17","it does"
"00;09;59;17","00;10;01;20","just whatever work it does, it"

"00;10;14;06","00;10;16;02","And this notion of identity and quantum"

"00;17;26;01","00;17;28;01","Implemented computation."
"00;17;28;25","00;17;30;18","That makes a measurement."
"00;17;30;18","00;17;33;16","Comparable across time"
"00;17;33;16","00;17;34;10","So."
"00;17;35;21","00;17;37;21","The meter stick, for example,"
"00;17;37;21","00;17;39;25","implements a computation."
"00;17;39;25","00;17;41;22","Of length and it."
"00;17;41;22","00;17;42;15","Allows us"
"00;17;42;15","00;17;43;16","to compare"
"00;17;43;16","00;17;45;16","measurements of length across time"
"00;17;46;19","00;17;49;16","because we assume that it's fixed."
"00;17;49;16","00;17;50;27","And of course, we could use"
"00;17;50;27","00;17;52;08","a meter stick"
"00;17;52;08","00;17;54;19","because each of us has embedded"
"00;17;54;19","00;17;57;27","in our brains a representation of life."
"00;17;59;04","00;17;59;15","In fact,"
"00;17;59;15","00;18;01;05","we have a representation of the three"
"00;18;01;05","00;18;03;03","D coordinate system"
"00;18;03;10","00;18;05;14","oh, without which"
"00;18;06;02","00;18;07;27","states would be useless."
"00;18;07;27","00;18;10;11","So we can use external reference"
"00;18;10;11","00;18;11;20","frames or meter sticks"
"00;18;11;20","00;18;13;10","because we have internal reference"
"00;18;13;10","00;18;15;14","frames like our representation"
"00;18;15;14","00;18;17;06","in 3D space,"
"00;18;17;06","00;18;19;17","in our intuitive understanding length."
"00;18;20;14","00;18;21;06","Oh."
"00;18;21;06","00;18;23;17","That we assume stays fixed over time"
"00;18;24;00","00;18;25;18","and that allows our measurements"
"00;18;25;18","00;18;27;26","of works to be comparable across time"
"00;18;28;05","00;18;28;23","for us."
"00;18;31;01","00;18;33;02","So now let's think about"
"00;18;33;09","00;18;37;15","a cure of as a way of of."
"00;18;38;18","00;18;39;27","Something that implements"
"00;18;39;27","00;18;41;01","activity rates"
"00;18;41;01","00;18;42;27","or that enables a system"
"00;18;42;27","00;18;44;24","to implement active inference"
"00;18;44;24","00;18;45;26","by allowing it"
"00;18;45;26","00;18;48;02","to compare its measurements over time."
"00;18;48;14","00;18;50;23","Right. Prediction is meaningless."
"00;18;50;23","00;18;52;03","If you can't"
"00;18;52;06","00;18;55;08","compare your measurements over time."
"00;18;55;08","00;18;55;28","Of"
"00;18;57;28","00;18;59;04","so much to"
"00;18;59;04","00;19;01;22","ask, what what would it be like."
"00;19;02;06","00;19;02;26","For a system"

"00;19;14;15","00;19;16;25","By acting on"
"00;19;17;15","00;19;19;29","So of."
"00;19;19;29","00;19;21;25","Our question of perfect prediction is"

"00;19;35;04","00;19;37;08","So on the other side of our way,"
"00;19;37;08","00;19;38;04","let's try to predict"

"00;20;37;20","00;20;39;25","So if I use my meter stick to cut a two"

"00;25;59;17","00;26;01;28","you've got a source and it's located"
"00;26;01;28","00;26;04;02","here in the in the middle of my face,"
"00;26;05;07","00;26;07;08","and it. Produces."
"00;26;07;08","00;26;08;16","An entangled pair."
"00;26;08;16","00;26;09;06","Of something,"
"00;26;09;06","00;26;12;08","photons or electrons or buckyballs"
"00;26;12;08","00;26;13;28","or whatever you want."
"00;26;13;28","00;26;16;01","And they travel apart."
"00;26;16;14","00;26;17;16","At the speed of light"
"00;26;17;16","00;26;20;01","or something very close to it."
"00;26;20;01","00;26;22;20","And at some point"
"00;26;22;20","00;26;23;21","they encounter"
"00;26;23;21","00;26;25;29","two symmetrically placed detectors"
"00;26;26;11","00;26;27;15","and the detectors"
"00;26;27;15","00;26;29;15","are operated by observers"
"00;26;29;15","00;26;31;01","who are always called Alice and Bob."
"00;26;32;23","00;26;36;16","And these detectors measure something."
"00;26;36;21","00;26;38;19","And in the canonical experiment,"
"00;26;38;19","00;26;40;22","they measure spin"
"00;26;41;19","00;26;44;05","and work."
"00;26;44;05","00;26;45;24","Alice and Bob."
"00;26;45;24","00;26;47;26","Each observe independently"
"00;26;48;15","00;26;52;05","is a random distribution of spins"
"00;26;52;23","00;26;53;22","that if we think of this"
"00;26;53;22","00;26;56;10","as a two dimensional experiment, then"
"00;26;58;18","00;26;59;19","they they either"
"00;26;59;19","00;27;01;13","measure sped up or stood down"
"00;27;01;13","00;27;02;24","and so coordinate system."
"00;27;02;24","00;27;06;07","So Elsa Bob, each pick a Z-axis"
"00;27;06;07","00;27;07;16","that defines up."
"00;27;07;16","00;27;10;09","And with respect to their local Z axis,"
"00;27;10;09","00;27;11;13","they see a random"
"00;27;11;13","00;27;14;00","distribution of up to."
"00;27;15;13","00;27;18;03","Now of things get."
"00;27;18;03","00;27;19;15","Interesting."
"00;27;20;08","00;27;20;29","When."
"00;27;20;29","00;27;21;28","Alice and Bob"
"00;27;21;28","00;27;23;22","later get together"
"00;27;23;22","00;27;27;08","and compare their results."
"00;27;27;12","00;27;28;17","And what they."
"00;27;28;17","00;27;31;09","Find is that whenever Alice observes,"
"00;27;32;15","00;27;34;22","Bob observes down and vice versa."
"00;27;37;02","00;27;40;00","And so they conclude that."
"00;27;40;00","00;27;40;21","Their results"
"00;27;40;21","00;27;43;17","are classically correlated."
"00;27;44;11","00;27;45;10","But then it gets more."
"00;27;45;10","00;27;47;17","Interesting because what."
"00;27;47;17","00;27;49;20","We allow. Alice Bob to do."
"00;27;50;11","00;27;52;22","Is constantly."
"00;27;53;02","00;27;53;23","Alter"
"00;27;54;23","00;27;56;23","the direction that they"

"00;27;59;20","00;28;01;23","to their own local Z axis."
"00;28;02;26","00;28;04;29","So you can think of the spin detector"
"00;28;04;29","00;28;07;02","is like a polarization filter."
"00;28;07;02","00;28;09;10","So like a pair of sunglasses."
"00;28;09;10","00;28;12;24","And what else and Bob can do is"
"00;28;13;01","00;28;14;01","randomly and."
"00;28;14;01","00;28;15;12","Independently change"
"00;28;15;12","00;28;17;26","the tilt of their sunglasses."
"00;28;17;26","00;28;18;20","Of."
"00;28;19;09","00;28;22;07","While they do this experiment."
"00;28;22;07","00;28;24;20","And in, in real implementations."
"00;28;24;20","00;28;25;21","Of this experiment"
"00;28;25;21","00;28;28;09","that. Is first implemented story"

"00;28;32;29","00;28;33;10","Allen."
"00;28;33;10","00;28;35;14","Aspect in his lab in Paris"
"00;28;35;14","00;28;37;20","in the early 1970s."
"00;28;38;27","00;28;39;12","Of."
"00;28;41;08","00;28;42;21","And has since been repeated"
"00;28;42;21","00;28;43;29","probably hundreds of times"
"00;28;43;29","00;28;44;27","by different groups."
"00;28;44;27","00;28;45;24","All over the world."
"00;28;45;24","00;28;46;29","Including the Chinese"
"00;28;46;29","00;28;48;03","using a satellite"
"00;28;48;03","00;28;49;26","to generate the entangled pairs"
"00;28;49;26","00;28;51;27","and measuring them thousands of."
"00;28;52;14","00;28;52;26","A."
"00;28;52;26","00;28;55;21","Thousand or so kilometers apart."
"00;28;55;21","00;28;56;12","Of."
"00;28;57;07","00;28;59;24","So if you remember the speed of lights"
"00;28;59;24","00;29;01;15","the footprint nanosecond."
"00;29;01;15","00;29;03;04","So you've got a lot of nanoseconds"
"00;29;03;04","00;29;03;20","in there"
"00;29;03;20","00;29;05;01","you're a thousand kilometers"
"00;29;05;01","00;29;06;03","apart to play. With"
"00;29;07;14","00;29;10;21","and the."
"00;29;12;02","00;29;14;03","So the the trick in this experiment"
"00;29;14;03","00;29;15;11","is that Alice involved"
"00;29;15;11","00;29;17;00","can change the direction"
"00;29;17;00","00;29;19;00","of their detector."
"00;29;19;11","00;29;19;29","Within."
"00;29;19;29","00;29;21;07","The time it takes"
"00;29;21;07","00;29;23;02","for the entangled pair"
"00;29;23;02","00;29;24;10","to get from the source"
"00;29;24;10","00;29;25;26","to the detectors."
"00;29;25;26","00;29;28;22","So if it takes ten nanoseconds"
"00;29;28;22","00;29;29;25","to get from the source"
"00;29;29;25","00;29;30;22","to the selectors,"
"00;29;30;22","00;29;31;08","they have to be able"
"00;29;31;08","00;29;32;14","to change their detectors"
"00;29;32;14","00;29;34;06","within ten nanoseconds."
"00;29;34;06","00;29;35;27","So that's why you want detectors"
"00;29;35;27","00;29;37;17","that are far. Apart"
"00;29;38;22","00;29;40;23","so Alice and Bob, we do the."
"00;29;40;23","00;29;42;12","Experiment changing."
"00;29;42;12","00;29;42;29","Randomly."
"00;29;42;29","00;29;44;07","Changing the directions"
"00;29;44;07","00;29;45;28","that they're measuring"
"00;29;45;28","00;29;47;29","with respect to their local Z-axis"
"00;29;48;17","00;29;50;02","And then they get together again"
"00;29;50;02","00;29;52;04","to compare their results."
"00;29;53;16","00;29;55;03","And what they find."
"00;29;55;03","00;29;56;07","Is."
"00;29;56;23","00;30;00;04","That of."
"00;30;00;16","00;30;01;20","If Alice observes."
"00;30;01;20","00;30;02;15","Bob,"
"00;30;03;21","00;30;06;28","Bob, or observe down"
"00;30;07;12","00;30;09;20","even when they've been randomly"
"00;30;09;20","00;30;11;01","and independently."
"00;30;11;01","00;30;13;03","Changing the directions"
"00;30;13;03","00;30;14;04","of their detectors."
"00;30;15;19","00;30;17;19","So one way to put that."
"00;30;17;19","00;30;18;16","Is."
"00;30;18;29","00;30;19;26","If Alice."
"00;30;19;26","00;30;22;10","Decides to rotate her detector"
"00;30;22;13","00;30;24;29","45 degrees,"
"00;30;24;29","00;30;26;19","then Bob's resolve."
"00;30;26;19","00;30;28;02","It will automatically."
"00;30;28;02","00;30;31;29","Be rotated 45 degrees"
"00;30;32;20","00;30;33;18","and it's symmetrical,"
"00;30;33;18","00;30;35;29","so vice and vice versa."
"00;30;35;29","00;30;38;09","So that's not classical correlation,"
"00;30;39;06","00;30;41;01","that's classical correlation,"
"00;30;41;01","00;30;43;12","that's robust against manipulation."
"00;30;45;06","00;30;46;02","So."
"00;30;46;09","00;30;47;11","Oh."
"00;30;49;03","00;30;50;07","I was discussing this with."
"00;30;50;07","00;30;53;06","Carl a while back, and I use."
"00;30;53;06","00;30;54;28","This example."
"00;30;54;28","00;30;56;29","Of if you and I are a classic."
"00;30;57;09","00;30;59;02","Or classically correlated,"
"00;30;59;02","00;31;01;21","then we may have the same beliefs"
"00;31;01;21","00;31;02;23","about something."
"00;31;02;23","00;31;05;12","So we might both believe"
"00;31;05;12","00;31;07;25","that the earth is round."
"00;31;07;25","00;31;08;20","That's classical."
"00;31;08;20","00;31;10;08","Correlation."
"00;31;11;12","00;31;12;05","Oh."
"00;31;12;23","00;31;15;01","Now suppose someone convinces me"
"00;31;15;01","00;31;17;13","that the earth is flat."
"00;31;18;03","00;31;20;16","If if that happens"
"00;31;20;16","00;31;21;08","and you"
"00;31;21;08","00;31;23;14","then believe that the earth is flat,"
"00;31;23;14","00;31;25;11","that's entanglement,"
"00;31;25;11","00;31;27;03","that's classical correlation."
"00;31;27;03","00;31;29;00","That's robust against manipulation."
"00;31;30;18","00;31;31;04","So it's."
"00;31;31;04","00;31;32;11","It's correlation."
"00;31;32;11","00;31;33;20","No kidding."
"00;31;34;08","00;31;35;05","Oh."
"00;31;35;19","00;31;36;13","Correlation."
"00;31;36;13","00;31;39;04","That that survives the environment."
"00;31;39;04","00;31;41;20","Doing something to"
"00;31;42;25","00;31;43;23","and"
"00;31;47;13","00;31;48;12","so."
"00;31;48;14","00;31;49;08","Oh."
"00;31;49;27","00;31;51;24","Now, let's go back to this question."
"00;31;51;24","00;31;53;00","Is this is this."
"00;31;53;00","00;31;55;03","An effect that only."
"00;31;55;03","00;31;57;21","Occurs in some microscopic domain."
"00;32;00;16","00;32;01;13","And"
"00;32;04;03","00;32;05;26","the answer is it's an effect that was."
"00;32;05;26","00;32;07;00","First described"
"00;32;07;00","00;32;08;02","by a theory"
"00;32;08;02","00;32;10;06","that was intended to only describe"
"00;32;10;06","00;32;11;29","a microscopic domain"
"00;32;11;29","00;32;12;16","like quantum"
"00;32;12;16","00;32;13;16","theory was developed"
"00;32;13;16","00;32;13;27","to deal"
"00;32;13;27","00;32;14;17","with nuclear"
"00;32;14;17","00;32;17;14","and atomic and nuclear physics."
"00;32;17;14","00;32;18;29","And so there was this idea of"
"00;32;18;29","00;32;21;19","the quantum world, which is very small."
"00;32;23;06","00;32;24;22","But the math, of."
"00;32;24;22","00;32;28;17","Course, applies across the board"
"00;32;28;19","00;32;29;17","and"
"00;32;30;05","00;32;32;20","trying to think of quantum"
"00;32;32;20","00;32;33;06","theory,"
"00;32;33;06","00;32;33;23","trying to think"
"00;32;33;23","00;32;35;11","of classical physics as."
"00;32;35;11","00;32;37;18","A limit or a mathematical."
"00;32;37;18","00;32;39;20","Limit of quantum theory"
"00;32;39;20","00;32;42;10","always runs into problems."
"00;32;42;10","00;32;44;12","And the problems are always the numbers"
"00;32;44;12","00;32;45;11","go to infinity."
"00;32;45;11","00;32;46;21","That shouldn't be infinity."
"00;32;47;25","00;32;49;19","So it's not."
"00;32;49;19","00;32;50;21","Really."
"00;32;50;21","00;32;53;19","Accurate to think of classical physics"
"00;32;53;19","00;32;55;11","as some sort of mathematical limit."
"00;32;55;11","00;32;58;27","Like each bar goes to zero"
"00;32;58;27","00;33;01;03","of quantum theory,"
"00;33;01;03","00;33;03;05","because if each word goes to zero,"
"00;33;03;05","00;33;04;18","lots of relevant energies"
"00;33;04;18","00;33;06;12","go to infinity"
"00;33;07;23","00;33;08;25","of."
"00;33;08;25","00;33;09;12","And this is"
"00;33;09;12","00;33;11;23","this has been known for a long time."
"00;33;11;23","00;33;13;28","Nonetheless, it's it's constantly"
"00;33;13;28","00;33;16;19","taught in this classical limit."
"00;33;17;05","00;33;18;20","Kind of framework"
"00;33;18;20","00;33;20;23","that isn't really correct."
"00;33;23;20","00;33;26;14","So one point of"
"00;33;28;23","00;33;29;13","doing Bell."
"00;33;29;13","00;33;30;17","EPR experiments"
"00;33;30;17","00;33;31;16","at larger and larger"
"00;33;31;16","00;33;34;04","distances is to demonstrate that"
"00;33;34;17","00;33;35;12","quantum theory"
"00;33;35;12","00;33;37;18","is not really a microscopic."
"00;33;37;18","00;33;38;15","Theory."
"00;33;40;19","00;33;42;28","So if you think of an entangled."
"00;33;42;28","00;33;44;20","State, an entangled state."
"00;33;44;20","00;33;47;01","Is one object."
"00;33;47;01","00;33;48;23","It's not two electrons."
"00;33;48;23","00;33;49;14","That happen"
"00;33;49;14","00;33;51;29","to have some mysterious relationship."
"00;33;51;29","00;33;55;05","It's one object that has one state."
"00;33;55;26","00;33;58;06","Remember what entanglement means."
"00;33;58;06","00;34;01;19","Is non severability, non"
"00;34;01;19","00;34;03;08","independence"
"00;34;03;08","00;34;05;25","across any compositional boundary."
"00;34;07;00","00;34;09;22","So an entangled pair is one thing."
"00;34;10;23","00;34;12;29","And what the Chinese were."
"00;34;12;29","00;34;14;26","Able to demonstrate."
"00;34;14;26","00;34;16;06","Was you can have one."

"00;34;20;19","00;34;23;01","Now, that's not microscopic."
"00;34;23;01","00;34;24;23","That's big"
"00;34;25;08","00;34;27;19","of a nice way to think about it."
"00;34;27;19","00;34;28;25","Entanglement was introduced"
"00;34;28;25","00;34;31;12","by Leonard Susskind"
"00;34;31;12","00;34;33;04","quite a few years ago,"
"00;34;33;09","00;34;35;23","and Rafael looser."
"00;34;36;00","00;34;38;23","With their idea of that"
"00;34;39;02","00;34;39;23","and entangled."
"00;34;39;23","00;34;40;27","Pair is the same thing"
"00;34;40;27","00;34;43;15","as Einstein, Rosen Bridge and Spacetime"

"00;34;48;23","00;34;50;28","Connected in the end."
"00;34;50;28","00;34;52;13","Or you can think of it that way."
"00;34;52;13","00;34;54;20","It's it's. A."
"00;34;55;02","00;34;56;13","Topological connection"
"00;34;56;13","00;34;57;06","in spacetime"
"00;34;57;06","00;34;58;26","that simply identifies"
"00;34;58;26","00;35;00;20","two points in space time"
"00;35;00;20","00;35;01;01","that would"
"00;35;01;01","00;35;03;20","otherwise be considered to state."
"00;35;03;20","00;35;05;28","So this emphasizes that."
"00;35;07;10","00;35;09;00","If you have an entangled pair."
"00;35;09;00","00;35;11;27","There's no distance inside it."
"00;35;11;27","00;35;12;07","Oh,"
"00;35;13;09","00;35;14;12","if you have two"
"00;35;14;12","00;35;16;10","entangled electrons, for example,"
"00;35;16;10","00;35;18;16","that are a thousand kilometers apart."
"00;35;18;16","00;35;20;09","As far as they're concerned,"
"00;35;20;09","00;35;22;13","they're right next to each other."
"00;35;22;13","00;35;23;11","And in fact,"
"00;35;23;11","00;35;24;21","as far as they're concerned,"
"00;35;24;21","00;35;25;15","they're located"
"00;35;25;15","00;35;26;07","at exactly"
"00;35;26;07","00;35;29;00","the same point in space time."
"00;35;29;02","00;35;31;17","And that's what this bridge notion"

"00;35;33;26","00;35;35;29","Oh, there's really no separation here."
"00;35;35;29","00;35;36;27","That the separation"
"00;35;36;27","00;35;37;24","is an artifact"
"00;35;37;24","00;35;40;04","of our observational capabilities."
"00;35;40;14","00;35;42;13","It's not a characteristic of the"

"00;35;44;02","00;35;45;10","So entanglement"
"00;35;45;10","00;35;47;02","actually calls into question"
"00;35;47;02","00;35;49;12","what the idea of distance even means."
"00;35;51;04","00;35;51;10","It."

"00;35;54;16","00;35;54;29","And that's"
"00;35;54;29","00;35;55;28","that's that's why"
"00;35;55;28","00;35;57;03","there's all this discussion"
"00;35;57;03","00;35;58;09","of emergent spacetime"

"00;35;59;08","00;36;01;14","and quantum cosmology."
"00;36;01;14","00;36;03;16","Because if you think about things"

"00;36;07;17","00;36;09;10","Spacetime, is that observable?"
"00;36;09;10","00;36;11;03","It's just something it's"
"00;36;11;03","00;36;12;28","it's something that's relative"

"00;36;14;23","00;36;16;11","It's not an intrinsic property"
"00;36;16;11","00;36;17;01","of anything."
"00;36;17;01","00;36;19;07","It's not object, as they say."
"00;36;21;29","00;36;22;12","So."
"00;36;23;08","00;36;25;22","So let's go."
"00;36;25;22","00;36;28;02","Back to this question again."
"00;36;28;02","00;36;28;23","Of"
"00;36;29;13","00;36;32;07","if we think about entanglement"
"00;36;33;22","00;36;34;15","and we think about."
"00;36;34;15","00;36;36;12","Observation."
"00;36;37;15","00;36;38;00","And we think."
"00;36;38;00","00;36;39;16","About entanglement"
"00;36;39;16","00;36;42;21","as something that's observed"
"00;36;42;21","00;36;43;25","by comparing"
"00;36;43;25","00;36;44;28","observations"
"00;36;44;28","00;36;48;05","made by different observers Right."
"00;36;48;07","00;36;49;05","Neither Alice"
"00;36;49;05","00;36;50;20","nor Bob in that experiment"
"00;36;50;20","00;36;52;23","can detect entanglement."
"00;36;52;23","00;36;54;11","Of they only."
"00;36;54;11","00;36;56;12","Realize that there's an entangled state"
"00;36;56;12","00;36;57;16","and they talk to each other"
"00;36;57;16","00;37;00;11","after they've done the experiment."
"00;37;01;07","00;37;01;18","Of."
"00;37;02;08","00;37;05;13","Then this question of scale"
"00;37;06;14","00;37;07;19","becomes a question"
"00;37;07;19","00;37;10;00","about how observers interact"
"00;37;10;14","00;37;12;25","and what observers can know"

"00;37;17;00","00;37;19;28","experimental apparatus."
"00;37;20;04","00;37;22;26","So when I describe the"
"00;37;22;26","00;37;24;27","the entanglement experiment,"
"00;37;24;27","00;37;26;16","I said Alice and Bob each"
"00;37;26;16","00;37;29;04","have their own work on Z-axis."
"00;37;31;02","00;37;31;18","And."
"00;37;31;18","00;37;32;26","When they get together"

"00;37;39;11","00;37;41;06","Then they make a very important."
"00;37;41;06","00;37;41;27","Assumption,"

"00;37;43;00","00;37;45;12","that they're Z-axis or comparable."
"00;37;47;03","00;37;48;04","So if. During."
"00;37;48;04","00;37;49;19","The experiment"
"00;37;49;19","00;37;52;27","Bob's Z axis was varying at random"
"00;37;52;27","00;37;55;26","with respect to Alice's Z-axis,"
"00;37;57;08","00;38;00;02","then their results, comparing"
"00;38;00;02","00;38;02;03","their results would be meaningless"
"00;38;02;03","00;38;03;16","because they'd be measured"

"00;38;09;16","00;38;10;00","of."
"00;38;10;00","00;38;11;15","So we have to make this assumption"
"00;38;11;15","00;38;15;03","that they have the same Z-axis."
"00;38;15;05","00;38;15;22","Now."
"00;38;15;22","00;38;17;17","Interestingly enough,"
"00;38;17;17","00;38;20;26","that assumption by itself."
"00;38;20;26","00;38;22;09","Tells you that Alice."

"00;38;24;24","00;38;26;18","Or their Z axes."
"00;38;26;18","00;38;28;08","Have to be tied"

"00;41;13;16","00;41;14;11","I mean,"
"00;41;14;11","00;41;16;23","maybe we will have the experience of,"
"00;41;16;23","00;41;17;11","you know,"
"00;41;17;13","00;41;18;00","predicting"
"00;41;18;00","00;41;19;07","if I kick the ball in this way,"
"00;41;19;07","00;41;20;10","I predict it'll go over there,"

"00;43;03;00","00;43;04;21","We claim to know what we believe"

"00;43;07;14","00;43;09;14","But of course, those beliefs are."

"00;43;30;26","00;43;32;08","This point has had huge"

"00;43;34;03","00;43;35;13","I mean, think back to the history"
"00;43;35;13","00;43;38;02","of artificial intelligence."
"00;43;38;02","00;43;38;17","Right."

"00;43;42;12","00;43;43;08","There is the"
"00;43;43;08","00;43;47;06","the huge new wave was expert systems."

"00;43;49;13","00;43;51;09","People have redefined themselves"

"00;44;13;27","00;44;15;13","It didn't work at all."
"00;44;15;13","00;44;16;10","Why"
"00;44;17;20","00;44;19;13","the simple explanation for why."
"00;44;19;13","00;44;22;15","Is that experts can't tell you what"
"00;44;22;15","00;44;23;15","they're doing."
"00;44;25;18","00;44;27;22","Expertize isn't verbal, sizable,"

"00;44;30;27","00;44;32;04","Verbalize,"
"00;44;32;04","00;44;32;21","you know,"
"00;44;32;21","00;44;35;01","expert systems engineering is verbal"

"00;44;39;27","00;44;40;17","Oh."
"00;44;40;28","00;44;42;07","And that's"
"00;44;42;07","00;44;42;24","that's just"
"00;44;42;24","00;44;43;20","an illustration"
"00;44;43;20","00;44;45;17","of the fact that our better processors"
"00;44;45;17","00;44;46;23","don't actually have"
"00;44;46;23","00;44;49;08","a complete model of the rest of us."
"00;44;49;08","00;44;51;06","Much less a model of the rest of us."
"00;44;51;06","00;44;53;27","Plus the better processor."
"00;44;54;07","00;44;55;09","Of it all."
"00;44;55;09","00;44;58;02","It all comes back to this"
"00;44;58;02","00;44;59;15","general principle"
"00;44;59;15","00;45;01;27","that a system can't represent itself,"
"00;45;01;27","00;45;03;10","and so it can't predict"
"00;45;03;10","00;45;04;23","its own behavior."
"00;45;09;09","00;45;10;09","Awesome."
"00;45;12;07","00;45;14;11","So between this work."
"00;45;14;28","00;45;15;12","Actually,"
"00;45;15;12","00;45;16;08","I should ask Karl"
"00;45;16;08","00;45;18;08","to comment on that tirade"
"00;45;19;03","00;45;20;28","because he's also thought about this"
"00;45;20;28","00;45;23;26","an extraordinary amount."
"00;45;27;09","00;45;27;18","Well,"
"00;45;27;18","00;45;29;28","I'll certainly make the comment that"
"00;45;29;28","00;45;30;27","that was marvelous."
"00;45;30;27","00;45;31;18","You know,"
"00;45;32;11","00;45;33;24","I'm glad this has been recorded"
"00;45;33;24","00;45;34;09","because this should"
"00;45;34;09","00;45;35;20","certainly be transcribed."
"00;45;35;20","00;45;36;28","And I know it's"
"00;45;36;28","00;45;40;07","probably implicit in the paper,"
"00;45;40;12","00;45;42;23","but it was so beautifully articulated"
"00;45;43;00","00;45;45;03","and clear taking us through the issues."
"00;45;45;03","00;45;47;02","I really enjoyed that."
"00;45;47;02","00;45;49;20","And so I have loads of comments,"
"00;45;49;20","00;45;51;24","but I will work with people's time"
"00;45;51;24","00;45;53;02","going through all of them."
"00;45;53;02","00;45;55;13","And that last issue is"
"00;45;55;13","00;45;56;07","really interesting"
"00;45;56;07","00;45;57;14","about the better process"
"00;45;57;14","00;45;58;22","or the metacognitive aspects"
"00;45;58;22","00;45;59;19","of a system"
"00;45;59;19","00;46;00;27","being able to measure itself."
"00;46;00;27","00;46;01;08","I think there's"
"00;46;01;08","00;46;03;12","a fundamental observation that because"
"00;46;03;23","00;46;04;03","you know,"
"00;46;05;05","00;46;08;03","you can't measure yourself."
"00;46;08;03","00;46;09;00","The whole point"
"00;46;09;00","00;46;11;01","of the particular physics"
"00;46;11;01","00;46;13;09","paper was to say that, you know, yes,"
"00;46;13;09","00;46;15;02","there can be two kinds of information"
"00;46;15;02","00;46;17;12","geometries, if you like."
"00;46;17;12","00;46;20;00","And the big move is that one system can"
"00;46;20;15","00;46;24;13","measure, i.e., infer by possessing"
"00;46;24;13","00;46;25;26","or having a movement"
"00;46;25;26","00;46;28;12","in some sort of information geometry."
"00;46;28;25","00;46;31;27","Infer a belief update"
"00;46;32;04","00;46;34;09","about something else."
"00;46;34;09","00;46;35;12","And so at no point"
"00;46;35;12","00;46;37;12","is there any room for it just to"
"00;46;37;12","00;46;39;18","then also start to infer"
"00;46;39;18","00;46;40;28","about its own inference."
"00;46;40;28","00;46;42;29","But that that is"
"00;46;42;29","00;46;43;06","you know,"
"00;46;43;06","00;46;44;29","that's a mathematical impossibility"
"00;46;44;29","00;46;46;05","from from the random"
"00;46;46;05","00;46;47;15","dynamical system perspective."
"00;46;47;15","00;46;49;01","I'm not sure show about the"
"00;46;49;01","00;46;50;06","the quantum perspective,"
"00;46;50;06","00;46;51;01","but it sounds as though"
"00;46;51;01","00;46;52;14","that's also true"
"00;46;52;14","00;46;54;05","So that begs the question,"
"00;46;54;05","00;46;55;13","and how on earth"
"00;46;55;13","00;46;57;21","do we have the illusion"
"00;46;57;21","00;46;59;00","that we know ourselves?"
"00;47;00;06","00;47;02;09","And of course, you know,"
"00;47;02;09","00;47;03;29","that is a little bit of"
"00;47;03;29","00;47;05;08","a colloquial question"
"00;47;05;08","00;47;05;22","because, you know,"
"00;47;05;22","00;47;07;23","99.9% of things"
"00;47;08;00","00;47;09;12","don't actually think"
"00;47;09;12","00;47;10;25","that they know themselves."
"00;47;10;25","00;47;11;19","So unless there's a"
"00;47;11;19","00;47;14;06","particular phenotype, particle"
"00;47;14;06","00;47;16;08","or species"
"00;47;16;14","00;47;18;09","that both philosophers,"
"00;47;18;09","00;47;20;12","I'm pretty sure that most of the things"
"00;47;20;12","00;47;23;00","that exist I don't have any"
"00;47;23;23","00;47;24;20","any pretense"
"00;47;24;20","00;47;25;14","to the thinking"
"00;47;25;14","00;47;27;10","that they know themselves."
"00;47;27;10","00;47;29;01","It's a really interesting"
"00;47;29;01","00;47;30;14","point to get across."
"00;47;30;14","00;47;32;09","Anecdotally, you know,"
"00;47;32;09","00;47;33;25","I spend a lot of time"
"00;47;33;25","00;47;36;14","and taking people through examples"
"00;47;37;08","00;47;37;25","that probably go"
"00;47;37;25","00;47;39;08","right back to things like idea,"
"00;47;39;08","00;47;41;00","motor theory,"
"00;47;41;06","00;47;44;05","that, you know, the way that we"
"00;47;44;05","00;47;44;15","the way"
"00;47;44;15","00;47;45;07","that we"
"00;47;45;07","00;47;47;00","develop a sense of agency,"
"00;47;47;00","00;47;47;16","I would think that"
"00;47;47;16","00;47;49;03","we have a sense of agency,"
"00;47;49;03","00;47;51;08","you know, is a gift, an illusion,"
"00;47;51;08","00;47;52;26","that is probably unique"
"00;47;52;26","00;47;54;09","to only a small number of us"
"00;47;54;09","00;47;56;00","and may not even be available to"
"00;47;56;00","00;47;57;16","people with severe autism."
"00;47;58;28","00;48;01;14","And the you know, the example of that"
"00;48;01;21","00;48;02;06","literally"
"00;48;02;06","00;48;04;06","the stage is written down"
"00;48;04;06","00;48;06;23","in a dramatic way, was that"
"00;48;07;07","00;48;10;02","if you just take vanilla"
"00;48;10;05","00;48;11;07","active inference"
"00;48;11;07","00;48;14;03","under a mock of blanket"
"00;48;14;12","00;48;17;16","and then you"
"00;48;17;16","00;48;19;16","look at particular kinds"
"00;48;19;16","00;48;21;00","of sparkly structures"
"00;48;21;00","00;48;23;00","where the active states"
"00;48;23;00","00;48;24;20","of the Markoff blanket"
"00;48;24;20","00;48;26;25","or the holographic screen"
"00;48;26;25","00;48;28;21","are hidden from the internal state."
"00;48;28;21","00;48;30;24","So these are special kinds of systems"
"00;48;31;10","00;48;33;25","have a particular sparsity"
"00;48;33;25","00;48;36;11","where now the active states"
"00;48;36;18","00;48;37;10","of the Markoff"
"00;48;37;10","00;48;38;00","blanket"
"00;48;38;00","00;48;39;06","are now become hidden"
"00;48;39;06","00;48;41;20","from the internal states."
"00;48;41;20","00;48;43;28","And you can certainly license"
"00;48;43;28","00;48;46;21","some entanglement."
"00;48;46;21","00;48;48;28","And I would I would later"
"00;48;48;28","00;48;50;21","ask about the restricted entanglement"
"00;48;50;21","00;48;52;04","and synchronization."
"00;48;52;04","00;48;54;23","So entanglement or synchronization"
"00;48;55;09","00;48;57;14","of the internal states"
"00;48;57;25","00;48;59;12","such that the internal states"
"00;48;59;12","00;49;02;17","have beliefs about their action,"
"00;49;02;17","00;49;05;07","but those beliefs become beliefs"
"00;49;05;07","00;49;07;05","about action as a hidden cause."
"00;49;07;05","00;49;09;03","So that absolutely no notion"
"00;49;09;03","00;49;10;09","from the inside"
"00;49;10;09","00;49;11;27","that you cause that you're"
"00;49;11;27","00;49;13;19","just representing the cause."
"00;49;13;19","00;49;16;19","So the example I have in mind"
"00;49;16;28","00;49;17;19","is you're watching"
"00;49;17;19","00;49;19;16","a little fish swimming around,"
"00;49;19;16","00;49;20;25","looking for food, gobbling up"
"00;49;20;25","00;49;23;02","little bits of particles of food."
"00;49;23;02","00;49;23;25","And you think, oh,"
"00;49;23;25","00;49;25;23","that's a very sort of artful"
"00;49;25;23","00;49;26;24","fish with purpose"
"00;49;26;24","00;49;28;22","and pragmatics and knows"
"00;49;28;22","00;49;30;01","how to navigate its world."
"00;49;32;14","00;49;34;26","But from the point of view of the fish,"
"00;49;34;26","00;49;35;29","all that is happening"
"00;49;35;29","00;49;37;10","is that the water"
"00;49;37;10","00;49;39;26","and the particles are moving around it"
"00;49;39;26","00;49;41;15","and a benevolent,"
"00;49;41;15","00;49;43;25","nurturing and fortuitous way"
"00;49;44;12","00;49;46;27","that the water is delivering"
"00;49;46;27","00;49;49;00","food particles to the fish's mouth."
"00;49;49;00","00;49;50;09","So from the fishes point of view,"
"00;49;50;09","00;49;52;16","he has absolutely no awareness"
"00;49;52;19","00;49;55;13","that it is the author or the agent"
"00;49;55;22","00;49;57;29","that's causing this synchronization"
"00;49;57;29","00;49;59;10","with the environment."
"00;49;59;10","00;50;01;10","So you know,"
"00;50;01;10","00;50;02;12","the deeper question is"
"00;50;02;12","00;50;03;00","how on earth"
"00;50;03;00","00;50;04;13","do we have the illusion that we think"
"00;50;04;13","00;50;06;17","we know our own our own agency,"
"00;50;06;17","00;50;07;05","and how"
"00;50;07;05","00;50;09;10","and when do we develop agency and"
"00;50;10;18","00;50;12;10","furthermore,"
"00;50;12;24","00;50;14;04","it's not just agency"
"00;50;14;04","00;50;15;16","about me, it's agency"
"00;50;15;16","00;50;16;23","about other things."
"00;50;16;23","00;50;18;23","At what point do"
"00;50;18;23","00;50;19;20","you say"
"00;50;19;20","00;50;21;21","early neonatal neurodevelopment?"
"00;50;22;06","00;50;25;04","Do we have these models of the world"
"00;50;25;15","00;50;29;09","that enable us to distinguish between"
"00;50;29;09","00;50;31;16","mother and self, you know?"
"00;50;31;16","00;50;33;09","And at what point"
"00;50;33;09","00;50;36;21","do we align our curators, if you like,"
"00;50;37;20","00;50;40;24","with not mother but with the world?"
"00;50;40;24","00;50;42;17","That enables us to now"
"00;50;42;17","00;50;44;27","see Mother as an independent object."
"00;50;45;15","00;50;47;01","So that is something else"
"00;50;47;01","00;50;49;06","that is an agent"
"00;50;49;06","00;50;51;09","and you know, like I would"
"00;50;51;09","00;50;52;21","then be well, perhaps"
"00;50;52;21","00;50;53;24","if Mother is nature,"
"00;50;53;24","00;50;55;08","perhaps I am an agent."
"00;50;55;08","00;50;56;23","And I guess about"
"00;50;57;02","00;50;59;16","that I am now the author of my agency"
"00;50;59;16","00;51;00;17","and my actions."
"00;51;00;17","00;51;02;00","But that is such"
"00;51;02;00","00;51;03;11","that's such a high level thing."
"00;51;03;11","00;51;06;03","How much of it pertains"
"00;51;06;03","00;51;07;18","to humans"
"00;51;08;12","00;51;09;14","That's what that's what I said."
"00;51;09;14","00;51;11;24","I'd love to talk about"
"00;51;12;14","00;51;14;19","the homologs of entanglement"
"00;51;14;19","00;51;16;24","from a point of view of classical"
"00;51;16;24","00;51;18;12","and perhaps I could"
"00;51;18;12","00;51;20;11","bring up at this point."
"00;51;22;09","00;51;22;25","Could."
"00;51;24;11","00;51;25;13","Just a couple of things"
"00;51;25;13","00;51;27;13","came came to my mind listening to this."
"00;51;28;01","00;51;31;23","One is that Josh Bongo had this amazing"
"00;51;31;27","00;51;35;02","paper in I think it was about 26 or so"
"00;51;35;11","00;51;36;17","where he had these robots"
"00;51;36;17","00;51;37;07","and these they were"
"00;51;37;07","00;51;37;28","they started out"
"00;51;37;28","00;51;39;19","like a six legged starfish."
"00;51;39;19","00;51;41;04","But the cool thing about it was that"
"00;51;41;04","00;51;43;08","they didn't have an internal model"
"00;51;43;08","00;51;45;02","of what they were in or what"
"00;51;45;02","00;51;46;18","their shape is or how to move."
"00;51;46;18","00;51;48;08","And they basically had to flop around"
"00;51;48;08","00;51;48;23","and make,"
"00;51;48;23","00;51;51;23","make models of their own structure"
"00;51;51;23","00;51;53;12","based on what happened to them,"
"00;51;53;12","00;51;54;22","given various outputs"
"00;51;54;22","00;51;55;20","that they generated."
"00;51;55;20","00;51;56;08","And eventually"
"00;51;56;08","00;51;57;25","they would build a model"
"00;51;57;25","00;51;58;16","of what happens"
"00;51;58;16","00;52;00;05","and they would walk around and so on."
"00;52;00;05","00;52;01;28","And two interesting things followed."
"00;52;01;28","00;52;03;12","One is that you could,"
"00;52;03;12","00;52;04;17","unlike traditional robotics,"
"00;52;04;17","00;52;06;06","you could rip off one of the legs"
"00;52;06;06","00;52;07;08","and they would very soon"
"00;52;07;08","00;52;08;00","revise the model"
"00;52;08;00","00;52;09;12","and keep going in different ways."
"00;52;09;12","00;52;09;26","So they weren't"
"00;52;09;26","00;52;11;24","tied to that particular self"
"00;52;11;24","00;52;12;05","model, right?"
"00;52;12;05","00;52;13;03","They would have to discover it"
"00;52;13;03","00;52;13;17","from scratch,"
"00;52;13;17","00;52;15;07","but it was still sort of plastic"
"00;52;15;07","00;52;16;06","throughout their whole lifetime."
"00;52;16;06","00;52;17;08","And they could they could get along."
"00;52;17;08","00;52;18;18","So they had that plasticity."
"00;52;18;18","00;52;19;19","And the other thing is that"
"00;52;19;19","00;52;20;29","and of course,"
"00;52;20;29","00;52;21;26","Christophe Adamy wrote"
"00;52;21;26","00;52;24;01","a nice kind of interpretation"
"00;52;24;01","00;52;25;02","piece of this."
"00;52;25;08","00;52;26;10","He described"
"00;52;26;10","00;52;28;12","they they spent lots of"
"00;52;28;12","00;52;30;13","lots of time being completely inactive"
"00;52;30;13","00;52;31;15","and basically running"
"00;52;31;15","00;52;32;25","through quote"
"00;52;32;25","00;52;33;28","unquote mentally running"
"00;52;33;28","00;52;35;05","through all the different things"
"00;52;35;05","00;52;36;04","that they could do"
"00;52;36;04","00;52;38;07","and what they think was going to happen"
"00;52;38;07","00;52;39;16","before they actually moved."
"00;52;39;16","00;52;41;17","And so you got Chris"
"00;52;41;17","00;52;42;22","to call that dreaming,"
"00;52;42;22","00;52;42;29","you know,"
"00;52;42;29","00;52;43;27","that they would basically"
"00;52;43;27","00;52;45;09","sort of play out"
"00;52;45;09","00;52;46;01","before, you know, the"
"00;52;46;01","00;52;47;17","in between their actual motions"
"00;52;47;17","00;52;48;27","where they would go around testing"
"00;52;48;27","00;52;49;24","they would actually sort of"
"00;52;49;24","00;52;51;13","play this out internally"
"00;52;51;13","00;52;53;07","and try to refine the model"
"00;52;53;07","00;52;53;19","such that"
"00;52;53;19","00;52;54;16","then when they do move,"
"00;52;54;16","00;52;56;03","they would actually make movements"
"00;52;56;03","00;52;58;14","that maximally sort of distinguish"
"00;52;58;14","00;52;58;28","the different,"
"00;52;58;28","00;53;00;21","different possible models and so on."
"00;53;00;21","00;53;02;11","And so that you can watch them"
"00;53;02;11","00;53;03;24","dreaming about about their shape."
"00;53;05;00","00;53;05;15","So and"
"00;53;05;15","00;53;06;01","then the other thing I"
"00;53;06;01","00;53;07;11","just wanted to briefly mention"
"00;53;07;11","00;53;10;03","this, this idea of"
"00;53;10;03","00;53;12;06","when and how do you recognize that"
"00;53;12;06","00;53;12;28","you are an agent"
"00;53;12;28","00;53;13;19","and that actually"
"00;53;13;19","00;53;15;12","you need to act for things to happen"
"00;53;15;12","00;53;16;22","versus just having the environment"
"00;53;16;22","00;53;17;16","do things to you."
"00;53;17;16","00;53;19;05","I suspect that"
"00;53;19;05","00;53;20;18","one of the things that drives it"
"00;53;20;18","00;53;22;04","very early on is this"
"00;53;22;04","00;53;23;28","is this notion of stress."
"00;53;23;28","00;53;27;02","Then I don't have a particular"
"00;53;27;02","00;53;28;16","I don't have a theory of why"
"00;53;28;16","00;53;29;26","stress feels stressful."
"00;53;29;26","00;53;30;11","But but"
"00;53;30;11","00;53;32;15","just on a purely functional level,"
"00;53;32;15","00;53;35;03","I think that what happens in cells,"
"00;53;35;04","00;53;35;16","you know,"
"00;53;35;16","00;53;36;23","so very early, long"
"00;53;36;23","00;53;37;29","before you get to humans"
"00;53;37;29","00;53;39;00","or anything like that,"
"00;53;39;00","00;53;42;07","I think that what you get is this this"
"00;53;43;18","00;53;44;16","set of mechanisms"
"00;53;44;16","00;53;45;16","that that evolved"
"00;53;45;16","00;53;47;14","from things like"
"00;53;47;14","00;53;49;09","stress about protein folding and so on."
"00;53;49;09","00;53;51;02","But then then basically scaled up"
"00;53;51;02","00;53;52;26","to be stress about metabolic"
"00;53;52;26","00;53;53;10","and stress"
"00;53;53;10","00;53;55;07","about morphology and stress"
"00;53;55;07","00;53;57;17","about behavioral issues and so on."
"00;53;57;26","00;53;59;11","That basically is a,"
"00;53;59;11","00;54;01;23","is a system wide metric of"
"00;54;03;02","00;54;05;07","the delta between what's going on"
"00;54;05;07","00;54;06;20","and what you'd like to have going on."
"00;54;06;20","00;54;07;01","Right."
"00;54;07;01","00;54;08;21","The delta between your set point"
"00;54;08;21","00;54;11;09","and what's happening now and what then."
"00;54;11;09","00;54;12;14","I think that drives"
"00;54;12;14","00;54;14;15","a strengthening of this of,"
"00;54;14;17","00;54;15;23","of the agency model"
"00;54;15;23","00;54;16;23","because what will happen"
"00;54;16;23","00;54;18;06","is as you as you"
"00;54;18;06","00;54;18;28","as you slowly"
"00;54;18;28","00;54;20;08","learn that you can do things"
"00;54;20;08","00;54;22;00","that reduce the stress level"
"00;54;22;00","00;54;23;11","it kind of solidifies"
"00;54;23;11","00;54;23;26","this idea"
"00;54;23;26","00;54;24;26","that it's actually at least"
"00;54;24;26","00;54;26;00","some amount of it"
"00;54;26;00","00;54;27;27","is up to you to make life better."
"00;54;27;27","00;54;29;20","And so you then then act."
"00;54;29;20","00;54;30;03","And then of course,"
"00;54;30;03","00;54;31;05","we know that breaks down"
"00;54;31;05","00;54;32;22","and sort of learn helplessness assays"
"00;54;32;22","00;54;33;04","and so on."
"00;54;33;04","00;54;34;05","That's that's"
"00;54;34;05","00;54;36;00","that that really is very traumatic"
"00;54;36;00","00;54;37;10","for for all kinds of creatures"
"00;54;37;10","00;54;38;11","that won't be long human."
"00;54;41;14","00;54;42;20","Can I can I speak to that?"
"00;54;42;20","00;54;43;27","Because there's some great points"
"00;54;43;27","00;54;46;09","that please. Yeah."
"00;54;46;09","00;54;48;22","So three really important"
"00;54;48;22","00;54;49;28","things being brought to the table."
"00;54;49;28","00;54;50;22","There."
"00;54;51;23","00;54;54;04","So I'm bound to forget the third one."
"00;54;54;04","00;54;55;04","If I start the first one,"
"00;54;55;04","00;54;55;29","I just want to say"
"00;54;55;29","00;54;57;27","I'm coming back to this"
"00;54;57;27","00;55;00;02","question about sort of a"
"00;55;00;02","00;55;01;19","purist and alignment in that."
"00;55;01;19","00;55;04;07","And one obvious answer that"
"00;55;05;02","00;55;06;06","what could bring to the table"
"00;55;06;06","00;55;07;15","is that learning"
"00;55;07;15","00;55;09;04","is the alignment that you're at."
"00;55;09;04","00;55;11;23","So learning at full scale."
"00;55;12;01","00;55;13;05","We are talking here"
"00;55;13;05","00;55;14;28","about developmental scales."
"00;55;14;28","00;55;15;12","For example,"
"00;55;15;12","00;55;16;28","we were talking about robots"
"00;55;16;28","00;55;18;17","that learn to repair themselves"
"00;55;18;17","00;55;20;18","or learn that new curious"
"00;55;21;21","00;55;23;07","animal or child"
"00;55;23;07","00;55;25;23","learning to make sense of its world."
"00;55;26;08","00;55;29;12","Then you can look at the slow"
"00;55;29;12","00;55;32;29","process of alignment of the curious,"
"00;55;33;00","00;55;34;27","the things that are invariant"
"00;55;34;27","00;55;36;29","over the fast of time scales"
"00;55;36;29","00;55;37;16","at which"
"00;55;37;16","00;55;38;15","there is"
"00;55;38;16","00;55;41;24","plans of motion exchange on our in"
"00;55;42;17","00;55;45;15","a holographic screen as simply"
"00;55;46;15","00;55;49;03","a movement from a state of"
"00;55;50;09","00;55;51;11","its entanglement"
"00;55;51;11","00;55;53;25","to a state of entanglement"
"00;55;53;25","00;55;55;07","as you become better,"
"00;55;55;07","00;55;56;04","better at predicting."
"00;55;56;04","00;55;57;13","But to become better at predicting,"
"00;55;57;13","00;55;59;17","you have to align your curiosity up"
"00;55;59;17","00;56;01;18","to try to align the."
"00;56;01;18","00;56;02;24","I think the set of the robot"
"00;56;02;24","00;56;04;11","examples are perhaps"
"00;56;04;11","00;56;06;08","a nice illustration of that"
"00;56;06;08","00;56;06;28","in the sense"
"00;56;06;28","00;56;09;14","that these robots were equipped with"
"00;56;10;02","00;56;10;18","the ability"
"00;56;10;18","00;56;12;02","to learn about themselves"
"00;56;12;02","00;56;14;26","because they had a lot"
"00;56;14;26","00;56;16;21","in developmental psychology."
"00;56;16;21","00;56;17;03","And indeed"
"00;56;17;03","00;56;20;04","I would imagine developmental robotics"
"00;56;20;04","00;56;22;20","is motor, but it's basically no"
"00;56;23;14","00;56;25;10","soliciting"
"00;56;25;26","00;56;29;08","outcomes, sensory outcomes"
"00;56;29;17","00;56;31;23","in order to start to disambiguate"
"00;56;31;23","00;56;33;08","between what did I caused that"
"00;56;33;08","00;56;34;26","or did you caused that?"
"00;56;34;26","00;56;36;12","What parts are"
"00;56;36;12","00;56;38;09","apparently under my control?"
"00;56;38;09","00;56;39;03","But of course,"
"00;56;39;03","00;56;39;16","yeah,"
"00;56;39;16","00;56;40;11","that's a very"
"00;56;40;11","00;56;42;00","anthropomorphic interpretation"
"00;56;42;00","00;56;43;11","because their mind is so mind"
"00;56;43;11","00;56;44;29","that's implicit but certainly the."
"00;56;44;29","00;56;46;23","Learning of the world."
"00;56;46;23","00;56;48;15","Models, the body model"
"00;56;49;17","00;56;50;22","is probably the first thing"
"00;56;50;22","00;56;53;12","that any artifact has to contend with"
"00;56;53;12","00;56;55;04","because you see that in children,"
"00;56;55;04","00;56;57;10","you're shaking their rattle to to"
"00;56;59;27","00;57;01;01","solicit"
"00;57;01;01","00;57;03;19","and actively solicit"

"00;57;07;14","00;57;09;09","and proprioceptive feedback."
"00;57;09;09","00;57;10;04","From the muscles"
"00;57;10;04","00;57;12;03","causing the movement of the mobile"

"00;57;14;24","00;57;16;24","So soliciting"
"00;57;16;24","00;57;18;28","conjunctions or correlations"
"00;57;19;01","00;57;21;05","that are explainable and predictable"
"00;57;22;08","00;57;24;13","in multiple modalities."
"00;57;24;13","00;57;26;28","So you may then ask why on earth"
"00;57;26;29","00;57;28;21","what is the imperative"
"00;57;28;21","00;57;30;22","for that kind of behavior?"
"00;57;30;29","00;57;34;13","What drives action to solicit"
"00;57;34;22","00;57;41;03","this opportunity to learn the link"
"00;57;41;08","00;57;42;20","to correlations"
"00;57;42;20","00;57;44;27","and coincidences in the conjunctions?"
"00;57;45;22","00;57;48;29","And that brings us to the second point."
"00;57;50;00","00;57;51;11","That they have"
"00;57;51;11","00;57;54;11","these robots dreaming"
"00;57;54;11","00;57;57;01","tell you immediately and at some level"
"00;57;57;11","00;57;59;01","they have an internal."
"00;57;59;01","00;58;00;11","Model."
"00;58;01;05","00;58;03;10","Of the consequences of action."
"00;58;04;17","00;58;05;10","And that tells you"
"00;58;05;10","00;58;07;13","immediately that you've got"
"00;58;07;13","00;58;08;18","if you wanted to write that down"
"00;58;08;18","00;58;09;05","from a point of view"
"00;58;09;05","00;58;10;01","of classical active"
"00;58;10;01","00;58;13;06","inference, you've got a belief"
"00;58;13;25","00;58;16;20","structure on the inside"
"00;58;17;07","00;58;18;05","that covers"
"00;58;18;05","00;58;21;00","both the covers,"
"00;58;21;00","00;58;23;01","both the external world"
"00;58;23;14","00;58;25;15","and these hidden actions"
"00;58;25;15","00;58;28;07","and the actions upon the of the world"
"00;58;28;11","00;58;29;24","and the consequences"
"00;58;29;24","00;58;30;26","of those actions"
"00;58;30;26","00;58;32;17","on the external states."
"00;58;32;17","00;58;33;28","That's a very sophisticated"
"00;58;33;28","00;58;35;16","generative model to have."
"00;58;35;16","00;58;37;01","And you're getting now into the world"
"00;58;37;01","00;58;38;18","of planning is inference."
"00;58;38;18","00;58;40;09","So a thermostat"
"00;58;40;09","00;58;41;13","doesn't have that,"
"00;58;41;13","00;58;43;19","and yet these robots do have them."
"00;58;43;28","00;58;44;17","So it tells you"
"00;58;44;17","00;58;47;01","that there are two natural kinds"
"00;58;47;10","00;58;48;07","of particles"
"00;58;48;07","00;58;51;00","on blankets or separable systems,"
"00;58;51;29","00;58;53;09","at least two kinds,"
"00;58;53;09","00;58;55;08","one of which is more like a thermostat"
"00;58;55;08","00;58;56;20","and one of which is more like"
"00;58;58;10","00;58;59;11","a sort of"
"00;58;59;22","00;59;01;11","I was thinking of sort of"
"00;59;02;07","00;59;04;16","a starter at a start,"
"00;59;04;16","00;59;05;12","but something more like"
"00;59;05;12","00;59;06;28","these sort of robots"
"00;59;06;28","00;59;09;00","that can learn about about themselves."
"00;59;09;09","00;59;10;05","And the cute"
"00;59;10;05","00;59;12;15","and the crucial distinction,"
"00;59;12;27","00;59;14;04","I think, is that"
"00;59;14;04","00;59;16;11","the agent has now started to represent"
"00;59;16;11","00;59;18;14","the consequences of its actions,"
"00;59;18;14","00;59;19;24","but without realizing it's"
"00;59;19;24","00;59;20;21","its own actions."
"00;59;20;21","00;59;21;26","And so how we got to the level"
"00;59;21;26","00;59;23;08","of the other metacognitive,"
"00;59;23;08","00;59;25;21","I am aware kind of kind of smart"
"00;59;26;24","00;59;27;16","and interesting."
"00;59;27;16","00;59;29;11","It comes back to"
"00;59;29;11","00;59;29;25","what I've said"
"00;59;29;25","00;59;31;29","before about natural kinds,"
"00;59;31;29","00;59;33;20","where one's active states"
"00;59;33;20","00;59;35;05","are hidden from the internal space."
"00;59;35;05","00;59;37;07","So they have to become a third"
"00;59;37;07","00;59;38;25","you have to infer that they're not"
"00;59;38;25","00;59;39;16","they're not"
"00;59;39;16","00;59;42;23","they are opaque to the internal states."
"00;59;43;04","00;59;45;06","And as soon as you say that,"
"00;59;45;06","00;59;46;13","then you're naturally talking"
"00;59;46;13","00;59;48;04","about systems that"
"00;59;49;11","00;59;52;07","can effectively"
"00;59;52;11","00;59;54;20","engage in planning as a prince."
"00;59;54;23","00;59;56;08","So they have to have plans"
"00;59;56;08","00;59;58;02","in their heads"
"00;59;58;05","01;00;00;25","in order to act, which corresponds to"
"01;00;01;06","01;00;02;14","and to the streaming."
"01;00;02;14","01;00;04;16","And from the point of view of the"
"01;00;05;03","01;00;07;23","the frequently active imprints."
"01;00;07;23","01;00;08;26","And then you ask"
"01;00;08;26","01;00;10;29","what are the objective functions"
"01;00;12;07","01;00;12;18","or what"
"01;00;12;18","01;00;14;08","are the principles of this faction"
"01;00;14;08","01;00;15;10","that would"
"01;00;16;21","01;00;19;08","apply to these kinds of plans?"
"01;00;19;09","01;00;20;29","And when you work it through,"
"01;00;20;29","01;00;22;11","then one important"
"01;00;22;11","01;00;25;15","component of the sort"
"01;00;25;15","01;00;26;22","of the package"
"01;00;26;22","01;00;28;23","of all the actions in question"
"01;00;28;23","01;00;31;25","is a drive to resolve uncertainty."
"01;00;32;12","01;00;33;19","So we come back"
"01;00;33;19","01;00;35;15","to this notion of the child"
"01;00;35;15","01;00;37;26","soliciting proprioceptive extra step to"
"01;00;39;28","01;00;42;00","sensations that enable it"
"01;00;42;00","01;00;43;17","to resolve uncertainty."
"01;00;43;17","01;00;45;01","And this is exactly the same principle"
"01;00;45;01","01;00;46;21","behind the optimal basic design"
"01;00;46;21","01;00;48;27","that we design experiments"
"01;00;48;27","01;00;50;04","that are going to resolve"
"01;00;50;04","01;00;51;13","the uncertainty"
"01;00;51;13","01;00;53;08","to the greatest extent possible"
"01;00;53;08","01;00;54;28","under our current internal models"
"01;00;54;28","01;00;55;18","or hypotheses"
"01;00;55;18","01;00;57;20","about how the world works."
"01;00;57;20","01;00;59;06","And that brings me to the third"
"01;00;59;06","01;01;01;27","great point about stress"
"01;01;02;17","01;01;05;20","and the the really important"
"01;01;08;16","01;01;09;28","place of stress and"
"01;01;09;28","01;01;11;20","uncertainty and angst"
"01;01;11;20","01;01;13;12","and not knowing what to do next"
"01;01;13;12","01;01;15;26","or not knowing what's going to work"
"01;01;15;26","01;01;17;19","and driving behavior"
"01;01;17;19","01;01;20;00","because if a large chunk"
"01;01;20;00","01;01;24;00","of the imperatives or planned action"
"01;01;24;27","01;01;27;22","is to maximize information gain"
"01;01;28;09","01;01;31;14","or minimize expected surprise or"
"01;01;31;24","01;01;33;26","or reduce uncertainty,"
"01;01;33;26","01;01;35;28","then you can see easily now"
"01;01;35;28","01;01;38;08","why two situations of uncertainty"
"01;01;38;08","01;01;41;21","and stress that will necessarily cause"
"01;01;41;21","01;01;45;17","the most epistemic responses"
"01;01;45;24","01;01;47;20","in order to drive the system"
"01;01;47;20","01;01;49;05","or the the."
"01;01;49;05","01;01;49;24","In this instance,"
"01;01;49;24","01;01;53;00","the agent to resolve that uncertainty."
"01;01;53;22","01;01;55;00","The final point now,"
"01;01;55;00","01;01;56;25","and this is basically paraphrasing"
"01;01;56;25","01;01;58;08","what Mike just said,"
"01;01;58;08","01;02;01;26","if the system sees itself behaving more"
"01;02;02;15","01;02;05;12","in times of greater uncertainty,"
"01;02;05;21","01;02;07;29","it may learn that."
"01;02;07;29","01;02;09;25","And I now have the idea, oh,"
"01;02;09;25","01;02;11;25","I am the kind of system"
"01;02;11;25","01;02;12;23","where I would behaving"
"01;02;12;23","01;02;14;15","as if I am the kind of system"
"01;02;14;15","01;02;17;10","that responds more when under stress."
"01;02;18;03","01;02;19;18","And then you will become aware of that."
"01;02;19;18","01;02;20;12","And then you can get into"
"01;02;20;12","01;02;21;07","the psychiatric"
"01;02;21;07","01;02;23;05","and psychological aspects of stress."
"01;02;23;05","01;02;25;04","You may not if you are just a protein,"
"01;02;25;04","01;02;26;10","you might just show a sort of"
"01;02;28;01","01;02;29;11","selection for flexibility"
"01;02;29;11","01;02;30;25","like response."
"01;02;30;25","01;02;32;05","But that's"
"01;02;32;06","01;02;33;10","I think the you know,"
"01;02;33;10","01;02;34;01","the two"
"01;02;34;01","01;02;35;12","fundamental mechanisms,"
"01;02;35;12","01;02;36;07","the imperatives"
"01;02;36;07","01;02;38;09","that are being fulfilled here"
"01;02;38;09","01;02;40;03","in accord with basic conservation"
"01;02;40;03","01;02;41;24","and also principles of least action"
"01;02;41;24","01;02;44;19","from the classical perspective"
"01;02;44;19","01;02;45;03","account"
"01;02;45;03","01;02;46;29","for exactly the same kind of behavior."
"01;02;46;29","01;02;47;20","I think the interesting thing"
"01;02;47;20","01;02;48;10","about stress,"
"01;02;48;10","01;02;51;18","uncertainty, they're not talking about"
"01;02;51;18","01;02;54;01","the the content of"
"01;02;54;09","01;02;55;23","implicit beliefs structures,"
"01;02;55;23","01;02;57;00","but the, the,"
"01;02;57;00","01;02;57;25","the second order"
"01;02;57;25","01;03;00;17","statistics, the uncertainty"
"01;03;00;17","01;03;01;24","that's I think"
"01;03;01;29","01;03;02;10","brings"
"01;03;02;10","01;03;04;04","a whole level of analysis to the table"
"01;03;04;04","01;03;04;27","because once you talk"
"01;03;04;27","01;03;06;15","about uncertainty"
"01;03;06;15","01;03;08;18","and representations of uncertainty,"
"01;03;09;23","01;03;12;22","insight, internal states,"
"01;03;12;22","01;03;14;25","then from a psychological perspective,"
"01;03;14;25","01;03;16;05","you start to talk about tension"
"01;03;16;05","01;03;18;00","and consciousness"

"01;03;19;13","01;03;20;08","We're talking about things"
"01;03;20;08","01;03;21;26","like Kalman gain and get,"

"01;03;36;18","01;03;38;20","from a quantum theoretic point of view"
"01;03;39;27","01;03;41;29","is uncertainty baked into that can you"

"01;05;42;26","01;05;45;07","Oh, such systems as"
"01;05;45;27","01;05;49;10","having generative models."
"01;05;49;10","01;05;51;25","And thinking about."
"01;05;51;28","01;05;54;00","The generative model of an electron"
"01;05;56;08","01;05;58;09","is a bit of a stretch, right?"
"01;05;58;09","01;06;01;27","Because the electron"
"01;06;01;27","01;06;04;01","is only characterized by mass"
"01;06;04;01","01;06;06;23","charge and angular momentum so."
"01;06;08;10","01;06;10;25","It can't really have."
"01;06;11;04","01;06;12;25","Expectations about."
"01;06;12;25","01;06;14;01","Much. Right?"
"01;06;14;01","01;06;14;19","Electron"
"01;06;14;19","01;06;16;17","can have no expectations"
"01;06;16;17","01;06;18;21","about the external electric field,"
"01;06;18;21","01;06;21;17","for example. Oh."
"01;06;21;17","01;06;23;00","It can detect that."
"01;06;23;00","01;06;24;17","It can respond to it."
"01;06;26;00","01;06;28;08","But it can't predict it."
"01;06;29;17","01;06;32;27","And if we think about,"
"01;06;32;27","01;06;35;02","oh, something like."
"01;06;35;02","01;06;36;19","An electron,"
"01;06;36;26","01;06;40;18","then we can focus in on this idea"
"01;06;40;18","01;06;42;26","that having a generative model"
"01;06;44;12","01;06;46;25","requires having enough memory"
"01;06;48;04","01;06;50;13","to keep a record"
"01;06;50;13","01;06;52;11","of the most recent observation"
"01;06;52;11","01;06;54;21","least the most recent one"
"01;06;54;21","01;06;55;15","and if you want to have"
"01;06;55;15","01;06;56;27","a good generative model,"
"01;06;56;27","01;06;58;19","then you better have enough memory"
"01;06;58;19","01;06;59;15","to keep a record of"
"01;06;59;15","01;07;02;25","quite a number of observations."
"01;07;02;25","01;07;04;17","And it's"
"01;07;04;17","01;07;07;27","this memory resource"
"01;07;07;27","01;07;10;01","that really simple things"
"01;07;10;01","01;07;13;17","like electrons don't have"
"01;07;14;01","01;07;16;02","so oh,"
"01;07;16;02","01;07;19;00","they're, they're not great predictors."
"01;07;20;02","01;07;20;27","Oh."
"01;07;21;29","01;07;23;14","Because they don't have the memory"
"01;07;23;14","01;07;26;10","to a level being a great predictor."
"01;07;27;17","01;07;29;14","And as it. Was."
"01;07;29;14","01;07;30;06","Both."
"01;07;30;22","01;07;32;20","Carl and Mike were saying."
"01;07;32;20","01;07;33;17","Of."
"01;07;33;29","01;07;35;24","Sense, you have to have memory to"
"01;07;35;24","01;07;37;01","be able to feel stress."
"01;07;38;09","01;07;39;07","You have to know that your"
"01;07;39;07","01;07;40;25","predictions were wrong."
"01;07;40;25","01;07;41;24","So you have to remember"
"01;07;41;24","01;07;44;09","what your predictions were"
"01;07;44;21","01;07;45;14","oh."
"01;07;45;17","01;07;46;23","So memory"
"01;07;46;23","01;07;48;29","becomes a really key component."
"01;07;49;16","01;07;51;21","Of the theory."
"01;07;51;21","01;07;52;15","Oh."
"01;07;52;15","01;07;55;25","Once you put it into this language,"
"01;07;57;17","01;07;59;14","because the language, in a sense forces"
"01;07;59;14","01;08;00;20","you to"
"01;08;01;05","01;08;03;11","to layout assumptions about what the"
"01;08;03;11","01;08;05;24","what the computational resources"
"01;08;05;24","01;08;08;05","that are being required are"
"01;08;10;05","01;08;11;13","that was it very coherent."
"01;08;11;13","01;08;12;20","But anyway,"
"01;08;12;20","01;08;14;04","I just wanted to stress"
"01;08;14;04","01;08;16;18","the role of memory here."
"01;08;16;19","01;08;17;04","Perfect."
"01;08;17;04","01;08;19;00","Thank you, Carl."
"01;08;20;15","01;08;23;19","Just to reinforce mentor's last point"
"01;08;24;11","01;08;27;24","and just tell exactly the same story"
"01;08;27;29","01;08;29;24","in a much more pragmatic way"
"01;08;29;24","01;08;30;17","and from a point of view,"
"01;08;30;17","01;08;31;25","a statistician."
"01;08;31;25","01;08;33;29","So I heard Chris say that"
"01;08;33;29","01;08;37;03","basically that if I want to go beyond"
"01;08;37;14","01;08;40;14","being a little electron or thermostats"
"01;08;40;23","01;08;42;21","and I want to now"
"01;08;42;21","01;08;45;14","infer the quality of how noisy"
"01;08;45;14","01;08;47;04","all my sensors, for example,"
"01;08;47;04","01;08;48;05","my favorite sensors,"
"01;08;48;05","01;08;49;19","if I'm a thermostat"
"01;08;49;19","01;08;50;28","that will require me"
"01;08;50;28","01;08;52;26","becoming a little statistician."
"01;08;52;26","01;08;53;20","And what does that mean?"
"01;08;53;20","01;08;54;20","Well, basically,"
"01;08;54;20","01;08;55;14","I'm going to be"
"01;08;55;14","01;08;57;19","estimating the standard error or the"
"01;08;58;12","01;09;00;09","the experimental variance."
"01;09;00;09","01;09;01;13","There's something quite important"
"01;09;01;13","01;09;03;06","about that which which"
"01;09;04;15","01;09;05;09","comes back"
"01;09;05;09","01;09;06;06","exactly to the"
"01;09;06;06","01;09;08;16","computational resources and memory."
"01;09;08;16","01;09;10;11","If you do a simple T test"
"01;09;10;11","01;09;11;11","as a statistician"
"01;09;11;11","01;09;13;04","on some experimental data,"
"01;09;13;04","01;09;14;29","you necessarily have to acquire"
"01;09;14;29","01;09;17;04","lots of data points and store them."
"01;09;17;20","01;09;20;17","And of course, that is just the degrees"
"01;09;20;17","01;09;21;13","of freedom"
"01;09;21;13","01;09;24;21","associated with your T test or F test."
"01;09;24;26","01;09;27;03","So the degrees of freedom score,"
"01;09;27;09","01;09;28;18","the number of data points"
"01;09;28;18","01;09;30;15","that you'll be able to remember,"
"01;09;30;15","01;09;31;10","and you need"
"01;09;31;10","01;09;32;28","a sufficient number in order"
"01;09;32;28","01;09;34;27","to get a precise estimate"
"01;09;34;27","01;09;36;05","of the uncertainty."
"01;09;36;05","01;09;38;13","So literally the degrees of freedom"
"01;09;38;13","01;09;41;02","in classical statistics is literally"
"01;09;41;17","01;09;45;01","a statistic that scores your confidence"
"01;09;45;09","01;09;48;05","in the estimation of the standard error"
"01;09;48;08","01;09;50;01","which is pooled over"
"01;09;50;01","01;09;52;08","multiple observations,"
"01;09;52;08","01;09;52;23","which is"
"01;09;52;23","01;09;55;22","an attempt to estimate on average,"
"01;09;55;22","01;09;59;10","if I observe with this kind of or I,"
"01;09;59;26","01;10;01;14","I asked my question,"
"01;10;01;14","01;10;03;12","so I wrote to my holographic screen"
"01;10;04;21","01;10;08;03","or I solicited these sensory states."
"01;10;08;12","01;10;11;27","And, you know, what would on average,"
"01;10;12;00","01;10;13;14","what would the uncertainty"
"01;10;13;14","01;10;14;24","be associated with it?"
"01;10;14;24","01;10;16;05","So I think it's a really"
"01;10;16;05","01;10;16;22","important point"
"01;10;16;22","01;10;18;05","about the computation resources,"
"01;10;18;05","01;10;20;04","the degrees of freedom, literally"
"01;10;20;04","01;10;22;04","in the sense of the degrees of freedom"
"01;10;22;04","01;10;24;03","associated with your F test"
"01;10;24;03","01;10;25;11","or the degrees of freedom"
"01;10;25;11","01;10;26;05","you have available"
"01;10;26;05","01;10;27;21","for the computing power"
"01;10;27;21","01;10;28;17","to actually get up"
"01;10;28;17","01;10;29;12","to these"
"01;10;29;12","01;10;30;04","second order"
"01;10;30;04","01;10;31;02","inference machines"
"01;10;31;02","01;10;33;10","or takes on on second order inference."
"01;10;33;20","01;10;34;24","So and I think"
"01;10;34;24","01;10;36;25","that is particularly important"
"01;10;36;25","01;10;38;17","when it comes back to my observation"
"01;10;38;17","01;10;40;15","about stress and uncertainty"
"01;10;40;15","01;10;42;01","and these higher order"
"01;10;42;01","01;10;44;08","ways of making sense of the world,"
"01;10;44;08","01;10;45;12","but in this instance,"
"01;10;45;12","01;10;47;25","making sense of sensations"
"01;10;47;25","01;10;50;00","that are accrued over time,"
"01;10;50;07","01;10;51;13","not about the content,"
"01;10;51;13","01;10;53;07","but about the reliability"
"01;10;53;07","01;10;54;16","or the precision of that content."
"01;10;54;16","01;10;56;06","So as is a really important point"
"01;11;00;14","01;11;01;17","Awesome."
"01;11;01;18","01;11;03;03","So that kind of."
"01;11;03;03","01;11;05;24","Oh, Chris, go ahead."
"01;11;06;13","01;11;06;24","Yeah."
"01;11;07;04","01;11;08;22","If I could just pick up on this"
"01;11;08;22","01;11;10;14","and take it in in yet"
"01;11;10;14","01;11;12;22","another highly related direction."
"01;11;13;06","01;11;14;24","It's just to point out"
"01;11;14;24","01;11;16;14","that all of these resources"
"01;11;16;14","01;11;18;22","are energetically expensive."
"01;11;19;26","01;11;22;21","So if I'm going to devote."
"01;11;24;21","01;11;26;08","Space."
"01;11;27;00","01;11;28;16","In my state space"
"01;11;28;16","01;11;31;14","to recording memories,"
"01;11;31;18","01;11;33;19","then that's only useful"
"01;11;33;19","01;11;34;19","if I can defend"
"01;11;34;19","01;11;37;01","those memories against entropy,"
"01;11;37;01","01;11;39;23","if I can keep them from decaying."
"01;11;39;23","01;11;42;13","So I've got to consume energy to write"
"01;11;42;13","01;11;43;04","the memories"
"01;11;43;04","01;11;44;21","I've got to consume energies"
"01;11;44;21","01;11;47;03","to energy to maintain the memories."
"01;11;47;28","01;11;49;14","And then I have to consume energy"
"01;11;49;14","01;11;51;03","to read the memories"
"01;11;51;03","01;11;54;01","and consume energy to."
"01;11;54;01","01;11;55;09","Compare."
"01;11;55;09","01;11;56;02","What I've read"
"01;11;56;02","01;11;57;08","with what I see"
"01;11;57;08","01;11;58;10","with my"
"01;11;58;17","01;12;01;03","kind of current events, sensors."
"01;12;01;03","01;12;04;04","So as we start adding"
"01;12;04;04","01;12;05;27","these computational resources"
"01;12;05;27","01;12;06;24","to systems,"
"01;12;06;24","01;12;08;23","the energy budget goes way up."
"01;12;09;25","01;12;10;24","And"
"01;12;11;17","01;12;12;09","it's it's."
"01;12;12;09","01;12;15;10","Another kind of."
"01;12;15;10","01;12;17;12","Thing to keep in mind as we"
"01;12;17;25","01;12;18;18","think about these"
"01;12;18;18","01;12;19;13","in terms of"
"01;12;19;13","01;12;20;23","embodied forms,"
"01;12;20;23","01;12;23;10","whether they're robots or organisms."
"01;12;23;10","01;12;26;02","That of"
"01;12;26;14","01;12;27;14","these these."
"01;12;27;14","01;12;28;21","Entities are."
"01;12;28;21","01;12;30;19","Extracting."
"01;12;30;19","01;12;32;11","This free energy"
"01;12;32;11","01;12;33;13","that they have to have"
"01;12;33;13","01;12;34;25","to run their computations"
"01;12;34;25","01;12;35;28","and maintain their memories"
"01;12;35;28","01;12;38;25","and all of that from. The. Environment."
"01;12;38;25","01;12;41;17","So here's this is another input"
"01;12;41;23","01;12;44;01","that in a sense is not sensory."
"01;12;44;25","01;12;45;14","Then it's still."
"01;12;45;14","01;12;47;12","Having to flow through the bark."
"01;12;47;12","01;12;48;02","Of blanket."
"01;12;48;02","01;12;49;10","It's still having to flow"
"01;12;49;10","01;12;51;10","through the boundary between the system"
"01;12;51;10","01;12;53;26","its environment. And."
"01;12;53;26","01;12;55;24","A lot of the systems actions"
"01;12;55;24","01;12;58;21","on its environment, its expenditures."
"01;12;59;00","01;13;00;28","Of, of."
"01;13;00;29","01;13;02;29","Of its own internal energy."
"01;13;02;29","01;13;04;28","Of our to."
"01;13;04;28","01;13;07;22","Acquire this free energy."
"01;13;07;22","01;13;08;10","So, you."
"01;13;08;10","01;13;10;11","Know, we, we go out and."
"01;13;11;19","01;13;12;25","Shop for groceries,"
"01;13;12;25","01;13;15;00","make breakfast or whatever,"
"01;13;15;00","01;13;17;05","all that stuff that we have to do"
"01;13;17;05","01;13;19;16","to keep all of these processes running"
"01;13;22;05","01;13;23;22","So it ties of metabolism and"
"01;13;23;22","01;13;25;06","cognition together"
"01;13;25;06","01;13;25;24","in a way"
"01;13;25;24","01;13;27;23","that they aren't often tied,"
"01;13;27;23","01;13;28;06","but that"
"01;13;28;06","01;13;29;27","they have to be to make sense of"
"01;13;29;27","01;13;31;13","what's going on"
"01;13;35;12","01;13;36;06","Great."
"01;13;36;08","01;13;38;23","So just on that point,"
"01;13;39;02","01;13;40;29","something that we had"
"01;13;40;29","01;13;41;22","written down"
"01;13;41;22","01;13;44;17","as a question from last time"
"01;13;44;17","01;13;47;28","and in terms of an electron"
"01;13;47;28","01;13;49;18","having a generative model"
"01;13;49;18","01;13;51;10","and discussing agency,"
"01;13;51;10","01;13;53;04","we had talked about free choice"
"01;13;53;04","01;13;55;07","and it was brought up in the paper"
"01;13;55;07","01;13;56;09","several times,"
"01;13;56;09","01;13;57;01","both in terms"
"01;13;57;01","01;13;58;12","of like any physical system"
"01;13;58;12","01;13;59;18","having free choice."
"01;13;59;18","01;14;02;01","If one physical system has free choice"
"01;14;02;01","01;14;03;12","they all have free choice."

"01;14;11;09","01;14;12;15","And so I just was wondering"

"01;14;13;24","01;14;15;16","maybe say a few words"

"01;14;26;27","01;14;28;07","What is that difference?"
"01;14;28;07","01;14;30;06","And is that also related to memory?"
"01;14;38;00","01;14;38;07","Oh."
"01;14;38;16","01;14;40;21","Is that a question for me?"

"01;15;17;13","01;15;19;18","So that's the free choice assumption"

"01;23;03;08","01;23;04;28","Of that's what the mark of."
"01;23;04;28","01;23;07;09","Blanket tradition."
"01;23;07;09","01;23;08;20","That's how the bar called blanket"
"01;23;08;20","01;23;10;09","conditioned in a sense, forces"
"01;23;10;09","01;23;12;01","us to think"
"01;23;13;09","01;23;14;03","so."
"01;23;14;08","01;23;15;19","Of the mark of."
"01;23;15;19","01;23;18;29","The condition itself."
"01;23;19;13","01;23;20;25","Makes us take this idea"
"01;23;20;25","01;23;23;18","of bipartite decomposition seriously."
"01;23;24;13","01;23;25;15","And"
"01;23;26;04","01;23;28;26","again, you can think of this in terms"
"01;23;28;26","01;23;31;09","of implicit assumptions"
"01;23;31;09","01;23;33;17","about the sources."
"01;23;33;24","01;23;34;19","Of"
"01;23;35;14","01;23;36;02","if you think."
"01;23;36;02","01;23;37;21","In open systems terms."
"01;23;37;21","01;23;41;11","And so you think of Alice Bob as as"
"01;23;41;24","01;23;44;09","antic entities that are that are"
"01;23;45;07","01;23;47;14","separate from each other"
"01;23;47;14","01;23;49;15","by our priority assumption"
"01;23;50;02","01;23;50;23","and separate"
"01;23;50;23","01;23;51;25","from their environments"
"01;23;51;25","01;23;53;13","by our priority assumption,"
"01;23;54;22","01;23;57;14","then you systematically underestimate"
"01;23;57;14","01;23;58;25","the amount of cognition"
"01;23;58;25","01;24;01;11","that Alice and Bob have to be to it."
"01;24;01;11","01;24;03;25","And so you systematically underestimate"
"01;24;03;25","01;24;05;24","their energy consumption."
"01;24;05;24","01;24;08;09","And so you systematically underestimate"
"01;24;08;12","01;24;09;09","their"
"01;24;09;12","01;24;11;29","they are uncontrollable affect"
"01;24;11;29","01;24;12;28","on the environment,"
"01;24;12;28","01;24;14;29","a generation of waste, heat"
"01;24;15;14","01;24;17;17","acquisition of free energy resources"
"01;24;17;17","01;24;18;21","and all that."
"01;24;19;04","01;24;19;28","So"
"01;24;20;19","01;24;22;17","it's not just a"
"01;24;22;17","01;24;25;17","philosophical difference."
"01;24;25;17","01;24;28;09","It's a difference that leads you"
"01;24;28;09","01;24;29;17","to make."
"01;24;29;22","01;24;31;29","Of genuinely."
"01;24;31;29","01;24;33;18","Alternative predictions"
"01;24;33;18","01;24;37;12","about things like metabolic load."
"01;24;37;12","01;24;38;11","So"
"01;24;39;02","01;24;40;14","that's why. We."
"01;24;40;14","01;24;42;29","Do things in this bipartite framework"
"01;24;43;13","01;24;46;18","to respect the work of condition and to"
"01;24;48;04","01;24;50;09","keep our assumptions."
"01;24;50;09","01;24;51;00","About."
"01;24;51;00","01;24;54;00","Energy flow explicit."
"01;24;58;11","01;25;01;06","And we take that to the latter"
"01;25;01;06","01;25;04;15","sections in the paper about biological"
"01;25;04;15","01;25;06;21","or cognition"
"01;25;08;16","01;25;10;14","What are the implications"
"01;25;10;14","01;25;14;00","for this for biological systems"
"01;25;18;16","01;25;18;27","Yeah."
"01;25;18;27","01;25;19;22","Coral"
"01;25;23;10","01;25;24;00","Well."
"01;25;26;05","01;25;27;16","Just to pursue that sort of"
"01;25;27;16","01;25;28;13","thought experiment"
"01;25;28;13","01;25;29;23","where you're trying to now"
"01;25;29;23","01;25;30;29","say you wanted to use active"
"01;25;30;29","01;25;32;00","inference, distinguishing"
"01;25;32;00","01;25;32;26","Alice and Bob,"
"01;25;32;26","01;25;35;00","observing a pair of electrons"
"01;25;35;00","01;25;35;22","and remembering"
"01;25;35;22","01;25;37;12","that the pair of electrons are"
"01;25;37;12","01;25;38;13","one thing."
"01;25;38;13","01;25;41;01","So you now got a tripartite"
"01;25;41;01","01;25;43;05","with three mark of blankets in play"
"01;25;44;09","01;25;46;19","and many of the issues, for example,"
"01;25;47;13","01;25;48;23","the super determinism"
"01;25;48;23","01;25;50;20","that allows some assumptions"
"01;25;50;20","01;25;51;25","about the"
"01;25;51;25","01;25;54;02","pure alignment between Bob and Alice."
"01;25;55;16","01;25;57;18","To be in play"
"01;25;57;18","01;25;59;29","and also the discussion"
"01;26;00;02","01;26;02;25","of how"
"01;26;03;05","01;26;05;21","Alice has to have"
"01;26;05;21","01;26;08;02","has to contextualize"
"01;26;09;02","01;26;11;12","sensations from Bob"
"01;26;12;16","01;26;15;04","under a belief or an internal model"
"01;26;15;04","01;26;16;17","that Bob is indeed"
"01;26;16;17","01;26;17;28","another mark of blanket"
"01;26;17;28","01;26;18;13","and possibly"
"01;26;18;13","01;26;19;07","a malleable blanket,"
"01;26;19;07","01;26;21;14","very much like Alice."
"01;26;21;14","01;26;22;11","What you are saying"
"01;26;22;11","01;26;23;01","is that"
"01;26;23;01","01;26;25;21","two of these particles of bananas"
"01;26;26;00","01;26;27;17","have aligned QR acts"
"01;26;27;17","01;26;29;03","that could have been aligned"
"01;26;29;03","01;26;31;12","historically under the Super Bowl,"
"01;26;31;17","01;26;32;16","which I'd never heard of before."
"01;26;32;16","01;26;33;19","But I like the word"
"01;26;33;19","01;26;35;07","at the super determinism,"
"01;26;35;07","01;26;37;10","and that may be a prerequisite"
"01;26;37;10","01;26;38;06","to understand"
"01;26;38;06","01;26;39;00","the experiments"
"01;26;39;00","01;26;40;07","that we were taken through."
"01;26;40;07","01;26;41;10","I previously went looking"
"01;26;41;10","01;26;42;16","at the third mark of Blanket,"
"01;26;42;16","01;26;44;09","which would be the the electron"
"01;26;45;22","01;26;46;27","or the two electrons, but"
"01;26;46;27","01;26;48;00","for simplicity."
"01;26;48;00","01;26;50;12","And so"
"01;26;50;12","01;26;52;01","that from a biological perspective"
"01;26;52;01","01;26;54;26","tells you something quite"
"01;26;54;26","01;26;57;04","quite interesting in the sense"
"01;26;57;04","01;27;00;04","that it starts to get to"
"01;27;02;05","01;27;04;18","the if it's the case"
"01;27;04;21","01;27;08;09","that you can basically carve up"
"01;27;08;17","01;27;10;19","a bunch of states"
"01;27;10;27","01;27;12;10","not in a bipartite way,"
"01;27;12;10","01;27;14;06","but in a multiparty way."
"01;27;14;06","01;27;17;00","And that carving is by inserting"
"01;27;18;01","01;27;20;22","Markov blankets"
"01;27;21;01","01;27;24;00","to define the partition and the every,"
"01;27;25;00","01;27;27;09","if you like, subset of that space"
"01;27;27;20","01;27;28;24","now becomes interpreted"
"01;27;28;24","01;27;29;25","as a mark of packet."
"01;27;29;25","01;27;31;21","So there are now no external states"
"01;27;31;21","01;27;34;28","or we have a play now or a set of"
"01;27;34;28","01;27;36;01","internal states,"
"01;27;36;01","01;27;37;05","each equipped"
"01;27;37;05","01;27;38;15","with the holographic screen"
"01;27;38;15","01;27;40;19","or mock of blanket states"
"01;27;40;26","01;27;41;22","that are exchanging"
"01;27;41;22","01;27;43;24","with other internal states."
"01;27;43;24","01;27;44;06","Then there's"
"01;27;44;06","01;27;45;09","some really interesting questions"
"01;27;45;09","01;27;47;15","about how that system will evolve"
"01;27;49;06","01;27;49;25","from the point of"
"01;27;49;25","01;27;50;27","view of the discussion"
"01;27;50;27","01;27;52;09","we've been having."
"01;27;52;09","01;27;53;26","It's going to evolve"
"01;27;53;26","01;27;55;26","under the principle of the maturity"
"01;27;55;26","01;27;57;03","to entanglement."
"01;27;57;03","01;27;58;26","So it's going to from"
"01;27;58;26","01;28;01;08","from a classical perspective,"
"01;28;01;08","01;28;03;17","if you allow me, it's going to tend"
"01;28;03;17","01;28;06;18","to a state of"
"01;28;06;23","01;28;08;08","generalized synchronization"
"01;28;08;08","01;28;08;26","where everything"
"01;28;08;26","01;28;09;15","collapses under"
"01;28;09;15","01;28;10;21","the same synchronization"
"01;28;10;21","01;28;11;22","manifold and everything's"
"01;28;11;22","01;28;12;23","indistinguishable."
"01;28;12;23","01;28;14;27","This perfect mutual predictability."
"01;28;14;27","01;28;16;25","That's a communication of an elemental"
"01;28;16;25","01;28;18;03","and fundamental soul."
"01;28;18;03","01;28;20;03","So everything has basically in"
"01;28;20;03","01;28;21;21","everything is seen from exactly"
"01;28;21;21","01;28;23;12","the same hymn sheet."
"01;28;23;12","01;28;25;12","That's the natural way of things."
"01;28;25;12","01;28;25;26","The free energy"
"01;28;25;26","01;28;26;25","principle is just one way"
"01;28;26;25","01;28;28;27","of describing that natural tendency."
"01;28;29;19","01;28;31;07","What would that look like? Cognitively?"
"01;28;31;07","01;28;32;23","Well, it would look as if"
"01;28;32;23","01;28;33;21","the mark of blackheads"
"01;28;33;21","01;28;35;04","we're trying to learn about each other,"
"01;28;35;04","01;28;35;24","and to the extent"
"01;28;35;24","01;28;37;18","that they can act on each other,"
"01;28;37;18","01;28;40;02","they're going to try and solicit"
"01;28;41;05","01;28;42;18","the kinds of outcomes"
"01;28;42;18","01;28;43;11","that would enable them"
"01;28;43;11","01;28;44;24","to learn about each other."
"01;28;44;24","01;28;46;24","So we're now going to get a situation"
"01;28;46;24","01;28;48;08","that is driven"
"01;28;48;08","01;28;49;16","by the imperative towards"
"01;28;49;16","01;28;51;24","mutual predictability and entanglement."
"01;28;52;17","01;28;54;20","That's an illusion."
"01;28;54;20","01;28;55;25","All that is actually happening"
"01;28;55;25","01;28;56;01","is that"
"01;28;56;01","01;28;57;19","the system is becoming entangled,"
"01;28;57;19","01;28;58;07","but it will look"
"01;28;58;07","01;29;00;16","as if all of these separate"
"01;29;02;05","01;29;04;17","Markov blankets or"
"01;29;04;18","01;29;07;07","sets of internal states are aligning"
"01;29;07;20","01;29;10;13","in a mutually compatible way that cure"
"01;29;10;15","01;29;11;21","so that they can exchange"
"01;29;11;21","01;29;12;29","and protect each other."
"01;29;12;29","01;29;14;22","And if there's if you like, an odd"
"01;29;14;22","01;29;17;00","man out, namely the power of electrons,"
"01;29;17;08","01;29;18;26","and then"
"01;29;18;26","01;29;20;14","then there will be an asymmetry"
"01;29;20;14","01;29;21;09","and there will be"
"01;29;21;09","01;29;24;07","greater degrees of entanglement,"
"01;29;24;07","01;29;26;18","the multiple levels, for example,"
"01;29;27;03","01;29;28;06","if they're both observing"
"01;29;28;06","01;29;28;28","a thermal state,"
"01;29;28;28","01;29;29;20","that the thermostat"
"01;29;29;20","01;29;30;21","is not going to be very good"
"01;29;30;21","01;29;32;05","at learning how to a light"
"01;29;33;04","01;29;34;18","bulb analysis, but"
"01;29;34;18","01;29;35;20","they're all going to make the best job"
"01;29;35;20","01;29;36;06","of it."
"01;29;36;12","01;29;37;05","And ultimately,"
"01;29;37;05","01;29;37;15","of course,"
"01;29;37;15","01;29;39;10","we could culturally can establish"
"01;29;39;10","01;29;40;14","construction, though"
"01;29;40;14","01;29;41;08","they'll build better"
"01;29;41;08","01;29;42;28","thermostats to become little robots,"
"01;29;42;28","01;29;44;21","and then they can all live happily"
"01;29;44;21","01;29;46;00","and communicate."
"01;29;46;00","01;29;48;03","So I think that's sort of the cognitive"
"01;29;48;03","01;29;49;05","thing here"
"01;29;49;05","01;29;49;29","comes again"
"01;29;49;29","01;29;52;19","back to learning to live in your."
"01;29;52;19","01;29;53;18","World."
"01;29;53;23","01;29;58;00","As an apparent expression of the"
"01;29;58;26","01;30;01;00","the inevitable progression"
"01;30;01;00","01;30;02;12","to entanglement"
"01;30;02;12","01;30;03;11","whereby we try"
"01;30;03;11","01;30;05;04","to learn about each other"
"01;30;05;04","01;30;06;15","under the plausible"
"01;30;06;15","01;30;08;15","hypothesis that you are like me."
"01;30;08;15","01;30;09;23","It's not necessarily true,"
"01;30;09;23","01;30;11;02","but it is one hypothesis"
"01;30;11;02","01;30;12;08","you can bring to the table."
"01;30;12;08","01;30;12;24","You never know"
"01;30;12;24","01;30;14;12","whether it's true or not."
"01;30;14;12","01;30;16;17","But that's certainly one hypothesis."
"01;30;16;17","01;30;17;00","It would work"
"01;30;17;00","01;30;18;21","very nicely for Alex and Bob"
"01;30;18;21","01;30;20;25","if they can develop a common language."
"01;30;20;25","01;30;23;29","So this notion of aligning curates"
"01;30;24;09","01;30;27;00","between two blanketed systems"
"01;30;27;12","01;30;31;08","particles that are sufficiently similar"
"01;30;32;13","01;30;33;28","then just simply"
"01;30;33;28","01;30;37;04","translates into learning"
"01;30;37;28","01;30;39;25","to share the same narrative,"
"01;30;39;25","01;30;42;20","to share the same language, in order"
"01;30;42;20","01;30;44;01","to render"
"01;30;44;02","01;30;46;00","everything mutually predictable."
"01;30;46;00","01;30;46;27","So I know exactly"
"01;30;46;27","01;30;47;28","what you're going to say next,"
"01;30;47;28","01;30;48;08","and you know"
"01;30;48;08","01;30;49;25","exactly what I'm going to say next."
"01;30;49;25","01;30;50;18","And we come now"
"01;30;50;18","01;30;51;23","to this asymptotic"
"01;30;51;23","01;30;53;11","limit of zero"
"01;30;53;11","01;30;55;10","prediction error 03 energy"
"01;30;55;10","01;30;57;00","and complete entanglement"
"01;30;57;00","01;30;58;13","And that would be the know."
"01;30;58;13","01;30;59;01","The object"
"01;30;59;01","01;31;01;10","will have no Ukraines or Brexit."
"01;31;01;10","01;31;03;21","So if we could get there,"
"01;31;04;13","01;31;05;14","but that would be"
"01;31;05;14","01;31;06;09","the other direction"
"01;31;06;09","01;31;06;22","of travel"
"01;31;06;22","01;31;09;13","from a biological perspective."
"01;31;09;13","01;31;10;16","And just just to say"
"01;31;10;16","01;31;12;07","that there are simulations of this"
"01;31;12;07","01;31;14;13","from a purely classical perspective,"
"01;31;15;18","01;31;17;22","star and what you normally do"
"01;31;18;13","01;31;22;18","is start off with two systems"
"01;31;23;19","01;31;26;17","that think they have"
"01;31;27;12","01;31;28;17","strange attractors,"
"01;31;28;17","01;31;30;16","usually a Lorenz attractor."
"01;31;30;16","01;31;32;18","So they think that the dynamics"
"01;31;33;12","01;31;35;28","are generated by the act"
"01;31;36;01","01;31;37;04","that they're autonomous"
"01;31;37;04","01;31;38;13","or the active states"
"01;31;39;14","01;31;41;08","create stuff out there"
"01;31;41;08","01;31;44;13","that has"
"01;31;45;00","01;31;46;09","a chaotic aspect."
"01;31;46;09","01;31;47;29","And I say that explicitly"
"01;31;47;29","01;31;49;27","just because the sort of the notion"
"01;31;49;27","01;31;51;20","of freewill and choice"
"01;31;51;20","01;31;53;03","in the classical domain"
"01;31;53;03","01;31;54;29","usually reduces to sensitivity due"
"01;31;54;29","01;31;55;29","to initial conditions,"
"01;31;55;29","01;31;57;21","which strikes me as a homolog"
"01;31;57;21","01;31;59;15","of the super determinism game."
"01;31;59;15","01;31;59;29","Yeah."
"01;31;59;29","01;32;01;22","Can you go right back to the beginning"
"01;32;01;22","01;32;04;27","and explain everything"
"01;32;04;27","01;32;06;22","and in sort of classical"
"01;32;06;22","01;32;08;01","dynamical systems,"
"01;32;08;01","01;32;09;08","there are certain situations"
"01;32;09;08","01;32;09;27","where you can't"
"01;32;09;27","01;32;10;12","because you've got"
"01;32;10;12","01;32;13;04","a sensitive situation conditions"
"01;32;13;04","01;32;16;15","so that the space or free word choice"
"01;32;16;16","01;32;18;24","that that's likely to occur"
"01;32;18;24","01;32;19;24","at what level."
"01;32;19;24","01;32;21;19","But I digress."
"01;32;21;19","01;32;22;10","So what you do"
"01;32;22;10","01;32;23;28","is you basically put sort of two"
"01;32;23;28","01;32;25;00","chaotic systems"
"01;32;25;00","01;32;25;22","with sensitivity"
"01;32;25;22","01;32;28;02","to initial conditions together,"
"01;32;28;20","01;32;29;20","but they're not identical"
"01;32;29;20","01;32;30;18","in the first instance."
"01;32;30;18","01;32;32;12","But if they can exchange"
"01;32;32;12","01;32;33;19","sensory and active space"
"01;32;33;19","01;32;35;22","so they can exchange across a shared"
"01;32;35;29","01;32;37;19","holographic screen."
"01;32;37;19","01;32;38;10","So we're now back"
"01;32;38;10","01;32;40;10","to the bipartite situation,"
"01;32;40;10","01;32;42;15","then they will naturally."
"01;32;42;15","01;32;43;03","If you think about it,"
"01;32;43;03","01;32;44;03","they can't do anything else"
"01;32;45;02","01;32;45;12","they will"
"01;32;45;12","01;32;47;03","naturally come to"
"01;32;47;03","01;32;49;06","a state of entanglement, i.e."
"01;32;49;15","01;32;52;12","if a generalized synchrony."
"01;32;52;22","01;32;53;12","And if you"
"01;32;53;12","01;32;54;26","allow the parameters"
"01;32;54;26","01;32;56;03","of the"
"01;32;56;03","01;32;57;03","equations of motion"
"01;32;57;03","01;32;57;22","to underwrite"
"01;32;57;22","01;33;00;23","these chaotic dynamic dynamics to also"
"01;33;00;29","01;33;02;21","maximize mutual predictability"
"01;33;02;21","01;33;04;02","or minimize energy"
"01;33;04;02","01;33;05;04","then they will actually come"
"01;33;05;04","01;33;07;04","to show an identical synchronization"
"01;33;07;04","01;33;08;11","because they will learn"
"01;33;08;11","01;33;09;21","to become like each other"
"01;33;09;21","01;33;11;26","just like max robots."
"01;33;11;26","01;33;12;21","But in this instance,"
"01;33;12;21","01;33;14;11","they're learning about the other person"
"01;33;14;11","01;33;16;03","simply to make things predictable."
"01;33;16;03","01;33;17;03","So then you will have"
"01;33;17;03","01;33;19;08","a shared narrative, and in principle"
"01;33;20;00","01;33;22;22","you should be able to evince a kind"
"01;33;22;22","01;33;24;18","I mentioned that because I know"
"01;33;24;18","01;33;26;17","Chris wanted to talk about."
"01;33;26;17","01;33;27;25","We wanted to talk about,"
"01;33;27;25","01;33;29;01","you know, quantum."
"01;33;29;01","01;33;30;01","Quantum physics"
"01;33;30;01","01;33;31;27","is just basically a description"
"01;33;31;27","01;33;34;14","of communication, of language"
"01;33;34;14","01;33;35;07","I don't think we can"
"01;33;35;07","01;33;36;19","have time to do that, but I thought"
"01;33;36;19","01;33;37;19","honestly about it anyway."
"01;33;40;14","01;33;40;19","The"
"01;33;44;04","01;33;45;02","rest of you want to say a"
"01;33;45;02","01;33;48;14","few words, quantum and language."
"01;33;49;14","01;33;50;27","Oh, well, that."
"01;33;50;27","01;33;52;00","Was that was lovely."
"01;33;52;00","01;33;53;04","Carl and I,"
"01;33;53;04","01;33;57;02","I like the idea of this kind of"
"01;33;58;15","01;34;00;08","simulation leading to,"
"01;34;00;08","01;34;02;21","to generalize synchrony."
"01;34;02;21","01;34;04;05","I think it's interesting"
"01;34;04;05","01;34;05;19","from this perspective."
"01;34;05;19","01;34;06;16","That"
"01;34;07;11","01;34;08;13","we"
"01;34;09;05","01;34;10;25","of we always."
"01;34;10;25","01;34;12;14","Divide"
"01;34;13;08","01;34;14;23","our environment"
"01;34;14;23","01;34;17;18","into entities like us."
"01;34;18;19","01;34;21;12","And then at least one entity."
"01;34;21;12","01;34;23;18","That's radically unlike us,"
"01;34;24;05","01;34;26;16","which we call the shared environment"

"01;34;28;10","01;34;29;12","the general environment"

"01;34;30;27","01;34;31;16","And"
"01;34;33;27","01;34;34;22","so we."
"01;34;34;22","01;34;36;28","Have this sense of a"
"01;34;38;06","01;34;41;14","social grouping of similar entities."

"01;34;43;10","01;34;44;06","Are commonly"

"01;34;52;14","01;34;54;12","Oh, and we're not very good"
"01;34;54;12","01;34;56;06","at predicting"
"01;34;56;19","01;34;58;00","and so on."
"01;34;58;08","01;35;00;23","And so we always have this kind of"
"01;35;01;18","01;35;03;14","open systems point of view."
"01;35;04;23","01;35;07;06","And of one of the."

"01;35;18;03","01;35;21;01","So it's where we put our waste"
"01;35;21;01","01;35;22;01","and it's, it's"
"01;35;22;01","01;35;23;18","where we get our free energy"

"01;35;26;02","01;35;26;17","Oh."
"01;35;28;03","01;35;29;26","So I,"
"01;35;30;16","01;35;31;04","I think it's."
"01;35;31;04","01;35;32;01","Interesting to."
"01;35;32;01","01;35;33;26","Think of all."

"01;36;02;10","01;36;04;12","The waste heat though, right?"
"01;36;05;15","01;36;06;10","Now."
"01;36;06;12","01;36;08;14","We've assumed our priorities"

"01;36;33;21","01;36;34;06","So I."
"01;36;34;06","01;36;35;21","Like this, this classical"

"01;36;42;13","01;36;43;05","Mike"

"01;36;48;18","01;36;48;28","I want to"

"01;36;52;26","01;36;53;28","so it may be"
"01;36;53;28","01;36;55;13","complete nonsense, but I'll float it"

"01;36;57;15","01;36;58;28","I think it's, it's relevant"
"01;36;58;28","01;36;59;28","and I've been thinking about it"
"01;36;59;28","01;37;02;27","this way. It occurs to me that,"
"01;37;02;27","01;37;03;18","you know,"
"01;37;03;18","01;37;05;22","this binary distinction between"
"01;37;06;22","01;37;09;05","there are agents, some of them like me,"
"01;37;09;05","01;37;10;03","some of them different,"
"01;37;10;03","01;37;11;06","maybe competitors, whatever,"
"01;37;11;06","01;37;11;22","but they're"
"01;37;11;22","01;37;12;16","there are some agents"
"01;37;12;16","01;37;14;05","that I can communicate with"
"01;37;14;05","01;37;15;15","or can I receive influence"
"01;37;15;15","01;37;16;15","or signals from."
"01;37;16;15","01;37;17;02","And then"
"01;37;17;02","01;37;18;13","and then there's this environment"
"01;37;18;13","01;37;19;08","which is, you know,"
"01;37;19;08","01;37;20;16","something that we assume or"
"01;37;20;16","01;37;21;01","I mean, some,"
"01;37;21;01","01;37;21;18","some cultures,"
"01;37;21;18","01;37;22;14","of course, don't assume that."
"01;37;22;14","01;37;22;23","But"
"01;37;22;27","01;37;25;13","but we can assume that it has very low"
"01;37;25;13","01;37;26;24","or zero agency,"
"01;37;26;24","01;37;27;21","meaning that it just"
"01;37;27;21","01;37;29;27","is this sort of dumb,"
"01;37;29;27","01;37;30;29","purposeless universe"
"01;37;30;29","01;37;32;01","and it's on us to sort of"
"01;37;32;01","01;37;33;18","figure out what it's doing right."
"01;37;33;18","01;37;35;00","So it occurs to me"
"01;37;35;00","01;37;36;17","that that distinction"
"01;37;36;17","01;37;38;14","maybe shouldn't be binary."
"01;37;38;14","01;37;39;05","And maybe"
"01;37;39;05","01;37;41;07","what we want to be thinking about"
"01;37;41;07","01;37;42;11","is as an agent,"
"01;37;42;11","01;37;44;28","when you are receiving something"
"01;37;45;19","01;37;47;05","from from what you think"
"01;37;47;05","01;37;48;06","is the outside,"
"01;37;48;06","01;37;49;25","you might want to estimate"
"01;37;51;16","01;37;52;04","what is"
"01;37;52;04","01;37;53;22","the agency on the other end for,"
"01;37;53;22","01;37;54;28","and you might want to do this"
"01;37;54;28","01;37;56;06","for the following reason. Right."
"01;37;56;06","01;37;57;18","And I started thinking about this"
"01;37;57;18","01;37;58;07","by imagining"
"01;37;58;07","01;37;59;02","what it would be like"
"01;37;59;02","01;37;59;21","to be"
"01;37;59;21","01;38;01;27","in an internal partition"
"01;38;01;27","01;38;03;16","or a chunk of a giant neural"

"01;38;04;24","01;38;05;27","You know, you live"
"01;38;05;27","01;38;06;22","if that's you,"
"01;38;06;22","01;38;08;18","you live in a very mindful universe."
"01;38;08;18","01;38;08;25","You know,"
"01;38;08;25","01;38;10;12","you could catch on to the fact that,"
"01;38;10;12","01;38;11;13","you know what I'm being I'm"
"01;38;11;13","01;38;12;14","being trained for something."
"01;38;12;14","01;38;13;11","You know the world like"
"01;38;13;11","01;38;14;17","there are bigger patterns here."
"01;38;14;17","01;38;15;12","And of course, it moves"
"01;38;15;12","01;38;16;23","in inscrutable ways and everything"
"01;38;16;23","01;38;17;20","because I can't"
"01;38;17;20","01;38;18;26","you know, I can't sort of"
"01;38;18;26","01;38;19;17","I can't understand"
"01;38;19;17","01;38;21;19","the whole pattern of what's going on."
"01;38;21;19","01;38;22;20","But I can definitely tell"
"01;38;22;20","01;38;23;14","that it's rewarding"
"01;38;23;14","01;38;24;05","me and punishing me"
"01;38;24;05","01;38;25;18","for specific behaviors. Right."
"01;38;25;18","01;38;26;08","And of course,"
"01;38;26;08","01;38;27;12","some people do feel that way"
"01;38;27;12","01;38;28;21","about the universe and very large"
"01;38;28;21","01;38;30;21","that there are patterns that are"
"01;38;30;21","01;38;31;18","that are not just"
"01;38;31;18","01;38;32;14","you know, not quote"
"01;38;32;14","01;38;33;26","unquote, just physics."
"01;38;33;26","01;38;34;26","And so"
"01;38;34;26","01;38;36;22","so the reason that the reason I think"
"01;38;36;22","01;38;37;27","and this extends to, you know,"
"01;38;37;27","01;38;38;29","we have supervised learning"
"01;38;38;29","01;38;40;04","and unsupervised learning."
"01;38;40;04","01;38;40;15","And again,"
"01;38;40;15","01;38;40;28","we think of"
"01;38;40;28","01;38;42;26","those is kind of binary things, right?"
"01;38;42;26","01;38;44;22","Is there some sort of intelligence"
"01;38;44;22","01;38;45;10","on the other end"
"01;38;45;10","01;38;46;21","telling you what's right and wrong"
"01;38;46;21","01;38;48;09","or is it just on you to abstract"
"01;38;48;09","01;38;49;25","patterns from the environment?"
"01;38;49;25","01;38;51;06","And the reason I think we"
"01;38;51;06","01;38;55;22","this matters is that if if if you are"
"01;38;56;24","01;38;57;04","trying to"
"01;38;57;04","01;38;57;18","learn from"
"01;38;57;18","01;38;58;05","the environment,"
"01;38;58;05","01;38;58;15","meaning there's"
"01;38;58;15","01;38;59;18","only one agent involved,"
"01;38;59;18","01;39;01;04","there's right there, that's you."
"01;39;01;04","01;39;01;24","There's one agent."
"01;39;01;24","01;39;02;05","And then there's"
"01;39;02;05","01;39;03;28","this sort of unthinking universe"
"01;39;03;28","01;39;04;19","around you,"
"01;39;04;22","01;39;07;04","then you are pretty much guaranteed"
"01;39;07;04","01;39;08;22","that whatever"
"01;39;08;26","01;39;11;06","whatever you can manage to infer to"
"01;39;11;06","01;39;12;17","it will be to your utility."
"01;39;12;17","01;39;14;15","It's on you to figure out, to learn"
"01;39;14;15","01;39;15;19","whatever you can."
"01;39;15;19","01;39;16;29","If there's another agent"
"01;39;16;29","01;39;17;23","on the other side"
"01;39;17;23","01;39;20;12","and you are being trained right, then"
"01;39;20;25","01;39;22;06","what are the odds that that agent"
"01;39;22;06","01;39;23;23","has your best interests at heart?"
"01;39;23;23","01;39;26;05","I mean, maybe, but maybe not."
"01;39;26;06","01;39;27;01","And so"
"01;39;27;01","01;39;27;29","if this is some sort"
"01;39;27;29","01;39;29;24","of supervised learning,"
"01;39;29;24","01;39;32;13","you have to ask yourself, what is it"
"01;39;32;13","01;39;33;19","that I'm being trained"
"01;39;33;19","01;39;36;05","and is it really what I what I want?"
"01;39;36;05","01;39;36;12","Right."
"01;39;36;12","01;39;38;15","Is this another kind of a whole thing"
"01;39;39;06","01;39;41;11","that you can imagine evolutionarily"
"01;39;41;11","01;39;43;18","that maybe to avoid"
"01;39;43;18","01;39;46;03","being hijacked by bye bye, bye"
"01;39;46;06","01;39;49;07","bye parasites, by by competitors, by"
"01;39;49;07","01;39;49;28","whoever"
"01;39;49;28","01;39;51;24","you don't really want to be trainable"
"01;39;51;24","01;39;52;14","too much."
"01;39;52;14","01;39;53;26","You want to learn,"
"01;39;53;26","01;39;54;13","but you don't really"
"01;39;54;13","01;39;55;16","want to be trained."
"01;39;55;16","01;39;58;17","And so maybe the idea then is that"
"01;39;59;01","01;39;59;24","what if what if"
"01;39;59;24","01;40;00;18","and this is okay,"
"01;40;00;18","01;40;01;12","this is where, you know,"
"01;40;01;12","01;40;02;25","I really haven't ever"
"01;40;02;25","01;40;04;07","talked to anybody about this yet."
"01;40;04;07","01;40;05;02","So this is this again,"
"01;40;05;02","01;40;06;28","could be a very immature stuff."
"01;40;06;28","01;40;08;02","But but what if"
"01;40;09;02","01;40;09;29","something like back"
"01;40;09;29","01;40;11;00","propagation or whatever?"
"01;40;11;00","01;40;12;20","What if that literally hurts?"
"01;40;12;20","01;40;14;20","What if as a as a right,"
"01;40;14;20","01;40;16;15","as an early creature"
"01;40;16;15","01;40;17;28","having some sort of error"
"01;40;17;28","01;40;19;10","function forced back"
"01;40;19;10","01;40;21;03","through your channels as opposed to"
"01;40;21;03","01;40;21;21","whatever you were"
"01;40;21;21","01;40;23;07","trying to generate yourself?"
"01;40;23;07","01;40;25;02","What if that's evolutionarily"
"01;40;25;02","01;40;26;22","designed to be unpleasant?"
"01;40;26;22","01;40;27;21","And what if"
"01;40;28;06","01;40;29;06","what you're trying to do"
"01;40;29;06","01;40;30;12","is avoid that happening?"
"01;40;30;12","01;40;31;12","You don't want to be trained."
"01;40;31;12","01;40;33;13","You want to learn on your own terms."
"01;40;33;28","01;40;35;00","And you could sort of"
"01;40;35;00","01;40;36;27","imagine the different layers"
"01;40;36;27","01;40;37;24","of a feedforward"
"01;40;37;24","01;40;38;28","artificial neural network"
"01;40;38;28","01;40;41;20","where the like the initial input layer"
"01;40;42;18","01;40;45;07","that that sort of creature"
"01;40;45;07","01;40;46;14","gets to see the world,"
"01;40;46;14","01;40;47;16","quote unquote, as it is."
"01;40;47;16","01;40;49;29","It gets the raw inputs the next layer"
"01;40;49;29","01;40;50;15","and certainly"
"01;40;50;15","01;40;51;16","the layers past"
"01;40;51;16","01;40;52;01","that, you know,"
"01;40;52;01","01;40;52;21","the ones on the right"
"01;40;52;21","01;40;54;12","that are abstracting,"
"01;40;54;12","01;40;56;06","they're getting all kinds of propaganda"
"01;40;56;06","01;40;58;11","filtered to them by the early layers"
"01;40;58;18","01;40;58;27","you know,"
"01;40;58;27","01;41;00;10","they don't get to see the real inputs."
"01;41;00;10","01;41;01;09","They get the C, whatever"
"01;41;01;09","01;41;02;17","the pre with the prior layers"
"01;41;02;17","01;41;04;00","think they should be seeing."
"01;41;04;00","01;41;05;18","And and so maybe"
"01;41;05;18","01;41;07;08","if you don't have a flat network"
"01;41;07;08","01;41;07;18","like this,"
"01;41;07;18","01;41;09;15","but maybe what you have is a,"
"01;41;09;15","01;41;11;13","you know, more biologically you have a"
"01;41;11;13","01;41;12;10","kind of a nested"
"01;41;13;23","01;41;15;13","multiscale kind of system."
"01;41;15;13","01;41;18;07","Maybe there's some sort of"
"01;41;18;07","01;41;20;06","incentive for the middle layers"
"01;41;20;06","01;41;22;11","to try to sort of crawl leftward"
"01;41;22;11","01;41;24;00","so that they have more raw access"
"01;41;24;00","01;41;25;16","to the real world"
"01;41;25;16","01;41;27;15","and not be trapped"
"01;41;27;15","01;41;29;08","being being fed by these other agents."
"01;41;29;08","01;41;29;17","Right."
"01;41;29;17","01;41;30;07","So again, you know,"
"01;41;30;07","01;41;31;20","this is all very qualitative stuff,"
"01;41;31;20","01;41;32;13","but you get the idea"
"01;41;32;13","01;41;34;00","that's that's kind of what"
"01;41;34;00","01;41;37;01","what what I was thinking about."
"01;41;39;03","01;41;39;18","Like"
"01;41;41;16","01;41;44;00","the in and then there."
"01;41;45;02","01;41;46;24","Mike, if you want to chat about this,"
"01;41;46;24","01;41;47;29","this is what I was doing for"
"01;41;47;29","01;41;49;22","about ten years, unleashing"
"01;41;49;22","01;41;50;28","and getting out of the lab"
"01;41;50;28","01;41;53;05","and getting passed to a model."
"01;41;53;05","01;41;55;06","So perhaps we should"
"01;41;55;06","01;41;56;18","add about this for a bit."
"01;41;56;18","01;41;58;28","I can I just a couple of things,"
"01;42;00;03","01;42;00;16","Chris."
"01;42;00;16","01;42;02;21","First of all, thank you for"
"01;42;03;15","01;42;04;20","I feel like I've come away"
"01;42;04;20","01;42;06;03","with a Munich Stein"
"01;42;06;03","01;42;08;16","volume worth of of coolness"
"01;42;08;16","01;42;09;15","for the last two weeks"
"01;42;09;15","01;42;10;01","since listening"
"01;42;10;01","01;42;11;22","to explain"
"01;42;11;22","01;42;12;24","these really complex,"
"01;42;12;24","01;42;14;06","complicated things to me"
"01;42;15;12","01;42;16;08","in ways that I can"
"01;42;16;08","01;42;18;04","actually understand"
"01;42;20;12","01;42;21;15","one of the things that I'm"
"01;42;21;15","01;42;24;02","I'm still kind of curious about is"
"01;42;24;24","01;42;26;20","once we let things out of the lab"
"01;42;26;20","01;42;28;14","and we keep them in that variability"
"01;42;28;14","01;42;30;15","routine, space,"
"01;42;30;26","01;42;31;09","and we're"
"01;42;31;09","01;42;32;21","and we don't want to be in conflict"
"01;42;32;21","01;42;35;12","with sort of the basic rules of"
"01;42;36;14","01;42;37;29","what quantum information tells us."
"01;42;37;29","01;42;39;04","I want to kind of go back for one"
"01;42;39;04","01;42;40;27","second to what Steven was"
"01;42;40;27","01;42;42;21","kind of closing the 40.1 with."
"01;42;42;21","01;42;43;22","And that is"
"01;42;43;22","01;42;46;02","what do we do when we look at things"
"01;42;46;02","01;42;48;06","in that sort of relational realm?"
"01;42;48;06","01;42;49;16","That a lot of"
"01;42;50;09","01;42;52;15","in indigenous cultures"
"01;42;53;08","01;42;55;23","sort of take up and try to"
"01;42;56;11","01;42;59;14","find themselves within and"
"01;43;00;25","01;43;02;07","kind of leading to this idea"
"01;43;02;07","01;43;03;02","that there's"
"01;43;03;04","01;43;04;13","there's a sort of a subject"
"01;43;04;13","01;43;06;04","matter generalist"
"01;43;06;04","01;43;07;21","that leads to a prediction"
"01;43;07;21","01;43;10;11","matter expert down the road."
"01;43;10;11","01;43;12;03","And I, I talked to Karl."
"01;43;12;03","01;43;12;11","I have"
"01;43;12;11","01;43;14;05","it was my question to Karl back in June"
"01;43;14;05","01;43;15;04","when he was"
"01;43;15;04","01;43;15;24","talking to us"
"01;43;15;24","01;43;16;29","in the Act of Inference lab."
"01;43;16;29","01;43;18;18","And so without getting into"
"01;43;18;18","01;43;21;02","any kind of conflict with the quantum"
"01;43;21;02","01;43;22;09","aspects of this,"
"01;43;24;04","01;43;25;12","what, what,"
"01;43;25;12","01;43;26;11","what do we take out"
"01;43;26;11","01;43;27;09","was with us"
"01;43;27;09","01;43;28;20","when we go on a bike ride"
"01;43;28;20","01;43;31;06","with with Chris Fields"
"01;43;31;06","01;43;33;02","that's that's quantum related,"
"01;43;33;02","01;43;34;21","that isn't in conflict with everything"
"01;43;34;21","01;43;36;04","we've talked about today"
"01;43;36;04","01;43;37;21","but gives us a better confidence"
"01;43;37;21","01;43;39;03","around the things that we"
"01;43;39;03","01;43;41;20","might encounter and predict."
"01;43;47;11","01;43;50;09","What do you take on your bike, Chris?"
"01;43;50;11","01;43;50;17","Yeah."
"01;43;50;17","01;43;52;09","What's in your quiver"
"01;43;53;12","01;43;53;26","yeah."
"01;43;53;26","01;43;55;13","A good. Question."
"01;43;55;13","01;43;56;04","Of"

"01;44;17;28","01;44;20;11","Is to shape our concepts where there"
"01;44;20;12","01;44;23;06","they are ways of shaping our concepts."

"01;44;48;10","01;44;49;18","Oh,"
"01;44;50;25","01;44;55;26","as literally as we're encouraged to do."
"01;44;55;26","01;44;56;15","And"
"01;45;00;14","01;45;02;15","the classical worldview,"
"01;45;02;15","01;45;03;23","I'll try to distinguish"
"01;45;03;23","01;45;04;27","the classical worldview"
"01;45;04;27","01;45;06;03","from classical physics,"
"01;45;07;16","01;45;09;15","because classical"
"01;45;09;15","01;45;13;06","physics by itself"
"01;45;13;07","01;45;14;19","again, going back to someone"
"01;45;14;19","01;45;16;14","local place."
"01;45;16;18","01;45;17;12","Oh."
"01;45;18;08","01;45;21;00","Is a physics of."
"01;45;21;00","01;45;23;02","Of atoms."
"01;45;24;09","01;45;26;17","Which are, which are, you know,"
"01;45;26;17","01;45;28;16","sort of elemental."
"01;45;28;16","01;45;29;09","Oh."
"01;45;29;16","01;45;31;05","It's not a physics of bounded"
"01;45;31;05","01;45;32;15","macroscopic objects."
"01;45;32;15","01;45;33;10","The boundaries"
"01;45;33;10","01;45;34;21","even in classical physics"
"01;45;34;21","01;45;36;24","are sort of arbitrary."
"01;45;37;13","01;45;39;16","And I think that's what quantum."
"01;45;40;01","01;45;42;05","Theory is trying to tell us to"
"01;45;43;06","01;45;43;29","is try to tell."
"01;45;43;29","01;45;45;24","It's that these, these are boundaries"
"01;45;45;24","01;45;47;10","that we draw."
"01;45;47;10","01;45;49;22","On our blankets."
"01;45;49;22","01;45;52;07","And I think this is in a sense, what."
"01;45;53;04","01;45;53;29","Our thinking."
"01;45;53;29","01;45;55;22","About the FP is trying to tell."
"01;45;55;22","01;45;56;24","It's not."
"01;45;57;06","01;45;58;04","That we have to."
"01;45;58;04","01;46;00;22","Take this notion that we're"
"01;46;00;22","01;46;03;07","blanketed entities seriously"
"01;46;04;09","01;46;06;04","when we think about what"
"01;46;06;04","01;46;08;05","we're interacting with,"
"01;46;08;05","01;46;10;17","which is everything but us."
"01;46;16;16","01;46;17;09","Daniel."
"01;46;20;23","01;46;23;11","In our closing minutes,"
"01;46;24;05","01;46;25;27","if we could just each give a thought,"
"01;46;25;27","01;46;28;00","this is really just a special"
"01;46;28;00","01;46;30;29","and very powerful conversation."
"01;46;31;09","01;46;34;04","Mike, with the back propaganda,"
"01;46;34;04","01;46;36;18","amazing experiments there."
"01;46;38;05","01;46;40;08","And no boundary"
"01;46;40;08","01;46;41;27","and quantum questions"
"01;46;41;27","01;46;43;11","touching on the work of like"
"01;46;43;11","01;46;44;06","Ken Wilbur."
"01;46;44;06","01;46;46;26","And I think it's just so powerful about"
"01;46;49;00","01;46;49;21","does someone have"
"01;46;49;21","01;46;51;14","the whole world in their hands"
"01;46;51;14","01;46;53;04","is not a good person?"
"01;46;53;04","01;46;54;25","Is it a bad person or thing?"
"01;46;54;25","01;46;56;17","What kind of thing is that?"
"01;46;56;17","01;46;58;12","Who's on the other side of this"
"01;46;58;12","01;46;59;22","video call?"
"01;46;59;22","01;47;01;11","Who's on the other side"
"01;47;01;11","01;47;03;09","of that other side?"
"01;47;03;09","01;47;05;19","What's the bigger picture?"
"01;47;06;16","01;47;09;00","And it really brings it home"
"01;47;09;04","01;47;10;01","that,"
"01;47;10;01","01;47;12;07","no, it's not just about electrons."
"01;47;12;23","01;47;15;16","This is something that is"
"01;47;15;16","01;47;17;06","across scales and systems."
"01;47;17;06","01;47;18;11","So really"
"01;47;18;11","01;47;20;23","just want to appreciate the paper"
"01;47;20;23","01;47;22;14","and hope that we continue"
"01;47;22;14","01;47;25;18","on this line of development."
"01;47;25;18","01;47;27;19","And I'll pass to Stephen."
"01;47;29;12","01;47;30;22","Thanks, Daniel."
"01;47;31;03","01;47;31;16","Yeah,"
"01;47;31;16","01;47;33;10","I was going to try this a little bit."
"01;47;33;10","01;47;34;12","Some of the threads with"
"01;47;35;13","01;47;36;12","this challenge of having"
"01;47;36;12","01;47;38;08","this false sense of certainty"
"01;47;38;08","01;47;40;26","in our culture, and"
"01;47;40;26","01;47;42;06","it does feel uncomfortable"
"01;47;42;06","01;47;44;13","to be trained,"
"01;47;46;09","01;47;47;12","but we do it in the West"
"01;47;47;12","01;47;48;10","because we're confident"
"01;47;48;10","01;47;51;17","that we've got this expert knowledge,"
"01;47;51;17","01;47;52;26","but then we suddenly find"
"01;47;52;26","01;47;53;27","that we don't know"
"01;47;53;27","01;47;55;03","as much as we do know"
"01;47;55;03","01;47;56;13","or we think we know"
"01;47;56;13","01;47;57;17","so that may be why"
"01;47;57;17","01;48;00;20","bottom up so organic, indigenous"
"01;48;01;12","01;48;02;19","kind of ways of being"
"01;48;02;19","01;48;04;05","or ways of sensing"
"01;48;04;05","01;48;06;10","can feel more holistic"
"01;48;06;10","01;48;07;04","so I think there might be"
"01;48;07;04","01;48;09;12","something quite powerful in that."
"01;48;09;12","01;48;11;03","So I like that come in."
"01;48;11;03","01;48;13;25","I think that ties together with"
"01;48;13;25","01;48;16;06","the challenges in practice"
"01;48;16;06","01;48;19;22","when we try to train up community,"
"01;48;19;23","01;48;21;17","especially if we're working inside"
"01;48;21;17","01;48;23;21","of our works in rural Africa"
"01;48;23;21","01;48;24;20","and the communities"
"01;48;24;20","01;48;26;23","that if they don't feel connected"
"01;48;26;23","01;48;29;20","to the the colonizing narrative,"
"01;48;30;08","01;48;31;24","it feels very oppressive."
"01;48;31;24","01;48;32;29","So there's,"
"01;48;32;29","01;48;33;06","you know,"
"01;48;33;06","01;48;34;23","there's a lot of good points"
"01;48;34;23","01;48;36;08","there around"
"01;48;36;10","01;48;37;00","where is there"
"01;48;37;00","01;48;39;07","coherence, where there's a decoherence,"
"01;48;39;07","01;48;41;28","and also where's the certainty"
"01;48;42;15","01;48;44;08","and where there's uncertainty."
"01;48;44;08","01;48;46;12","So thanks this is really helpful."
"01;48;46;13","01;48;49;07","And then I'll pass it over to Blue"
"01;48;53;14","01;48;54;11","Well."
"01;48;54;13","01;48;55;13","I've said enough."
"01;48;55;13","01;48;57;27","I think I'd like to hear from Mike"
"01;48;57;27","01;49;00;13","or Carl or Chris about where"
"01;49;00;15","01;49;01;29","where you're going or what"
"01;49;01;29","01;49;02;25","you're taking away,"
"01;49;02;25","01;49;05;07","or what are your final thoughts"
"01;49;05;07","01;49;06;02","about the discussion"
"01;49;06;02","01;49;06;15","we've had over"
"01;49;06;15","01;49;09;02","the last couple of weeks."
"01;49;10;09","01;49;11;04","I mean, I guess"
"01;49;11;04","01;49;11;13","I guess"
"01;49;11;13","01;49;12;08","the only thing I'll say"
"01;49;12;08","01;49;15;03","is that to me, I really like"
"01;49;15;24","01;49;19;12","this idea that it turns on its head,"
"01;49;19;21","01;49;20;12","this notion"
"01;49;20;12","01;49;21;20","that that you have this,"
"01;49;21;20","01;49;22;02","this, this"
"01;49;22;02","01;49;24;07","massive amount of mindless stuff,"
"01;49;24;07","01;49;25;28","and then somehow a little bit of mine"
"01;49;25;28","01;49;27;08","shows up at the end"
"01;49;27;08","01;49;29;05","that kind of turns it upside down."
"01;49;29;05","01;49;30;26","And and if that's the case,"
"01;49;30;26","01;49;32;13","then it becomes"
"01;49;32;13","01;49;33;19","then the scaling problem"
"01;49;33;19","01;49;35;09","is really, really interesting, right?"
"01;49;35;09","01;49;36;25","Is how you scale"
"01;49;36;25","01;49;38;12","how biology manages"
"01;49;38;12","01;49;39;09","to scale these things"
"01;49;39;09","01;49;40;10","so that they become"
"01;49;40;10","01;49;42;05","synergistic, synergistic and bigger"
"01;49;42;05","01;49;43;00","and bigger as opposed"
"01;49;43;00","01;49;43;14","to, you know,"
"01;49;43;14","01;49;45;03","just merely a bigger pile of rocks"
"01;49;45;03","01;49;46;24","than than the previous pile of rocks."
"01;49;46;24","01;49;48;20","And so that right."
"01;49;48;20","01;49;50;08","So so those are those mechanisms"
"01;49;50;08","01;49;51;17","and in particular in biology."
"01;49;51;17","01;49;52;12","And so"
"01;49;52;12","01;49;53;26","I look at it from from cells"
"01;49;53;26","01;49;55;06","getting together to be organisms"
"01;49;55;06","01;49;56;02","and solving problems"
"01;49;56;02","01;49;57;11","in the anatomical space."
"01;49;57;11","01;49;59;17","But but I think there we actually have"
"01;50;00;02","01;50;02;23","some pretty good alternative."
"01;50;02;27","01;50;03;06","Well,"
"01;50;03;06","01;50;04;07","although very, very,"
"01;50;04;07","01;50;05;14","very similar in many ways,"
"01;50;05;14","01;50;06;28","I see more free but alternative stories"
"01;50;06;28","01;50;08;14","to what happens in neuroscience"
"01;50;08;14","01;50;10;05","to try to understand how that scaling"
"01;50;10;05","01;50;11;00","actually works."
"01;50;11;00","01;50;12;21","So I'm super I'm just super, super"
"01;50;12;21","01;50;13;08","excited about that."
"01;50;13;08","01;50;14;19","And also the role of the observer"
"01;50;14;19","01;50;15;09","in all of this"
"01;50;15;09","01;50;16;20","and the idea that all of this"
"01;50;16;20","01;50;18;23","is based on various observers"
"01;50;18;23","01;50;19;14","observing each other."
"01;50;19;14","01;50;20;18","And I think that makes"
"01;50;20;18","01;50;22;25","it makes for a lot of progress"
"01;50;22;25","01;50;24;13","and fewer pseudo problems."
"01;50;24;13","01;50;25;21","When you when you look at it that way."
"01;50;31;14","01;50;32;12","Karl or Chris,"
"01;50;32;12","01;50;34;27","any final thoughts"
"01;50;39;27","01;50;40;12","well."
"01;50;40;12","01;50;42;00","I'll just thank you guys again"
"01;50;42;00","01;50;43;08","for putting us together."
"01;50;43;08","01;50;44;01","I thought this was"
"01;50;44;01","01;50;46;11","a fascinating conversation."
"01;50;46;11","01;50;49;16","And I'll"
"01;50;50;08","01;50;51;29","I'll throw one."
"01;50;51;29","01;50;52;27","More thing into it."
"01;50;52;27","01;50;53;26","I, I,"
"01;50;53;26","01;50;56;06","I think conversations like this are,"
"01;50;56;26","01;50;58;22","are evidence."
"01;50;58;22","01;50;59;21","Or."
"01;51;00;05","01;51;02;22","Oh, the, the kind of"
"01;51;02;22","01;51;05;04","disciplinary civilization"
"01;51;05;04","01;51;06;08","that's been"
"01;51;06;15","01;51;09;02","forced on to us by academic tradition"
"01;51;09;22","01;51;13;02","being an artifact and not necessarily"
"01;51;13;02","01;51;15;10","being all that useful."
"01;51;21;14","01;51;23;05","Thanks so much, Karl."
"01;51;23;05","01;51;23;22","We're going to leave you"
"01;51;23;22","01;51;25;14","with the final word"
"01;51;25;29","01;51;26;10","go ahead."
"01;51;26;10","01;51;28;28","Well, it has to be a because of the"
"01;51;30;25","01;51;31;12","more you lock"
"01;51;31;12","01;51;32;17","for putting this together"
"01;51;32;17","01;51;35;08","and for the brilliant"
"01;51;35;13","01;51;38;04","didactic and also challenging didactic"
"01;51;38;26","01;51;41;19","unpacking of some really challenging,"
"01;51;41;19","01;51;43;05","but I think revealing issues"
"01;51;43;05","01;51;45;00","and also the brilliant questions."
"01;51;45;00","01;51;46;12","And my final work"
"01;51;46;12","01;51;47;16","will be future pointing."
"01;51;47;16","01;51;50;00","I'm just taking off"
"01;51;50;00","01;51;51;12","taking up the slate of questions."
"01;51;51;12","01;51;51;27","You know,"
"01;51;52;06","01;51;52;26","having on"
"01;51;52;26","01;51;55;03","siloed conversations is useful."
"01;51;55;03","01;51;55;24","Just think"
"01;51;55;24","01;51;56;25","thinking about Mike"
"01;51;56;25","01;51;57;18","having the balls"
"01;51;57;18","01;51;58;28","to come out with his brand"
"01;51;58;28","01;52;01;04","new hypotheses of two years or so,"
"01;52;01;04","01;52;04;03","two days of my book, it's how I thought"
"01;52;04;03","01;52;05;04","it was really interesting"
"01;52;05;04","01;52;08;26","and just an example of putting things"
"01;52;08;26","01;52;10;01","into this kind of discussion"
"01;52;10;01","01;52;10;24","which are all going away"
"01;52;10;24","01;52;11;27","and think about."
"01;52;11;27","01;52;14;15","So my immediate thought was,"
"01;52;14;15","01;52;16;26","how on earth does the second layer"
"01;52;16;26","01;52;17;23","in a variational"
"01;52;17;23","01;52;19;03","to encode or something"
"01;52;19;03","01;52;21;01","doing back problem act?"
"01;52;22;08","01;52;23;21","And of course it can act if"
"01;52;23;21","01;52;25;14","if it's a recurrent neural network"
"01;52;25;14","01;52;27;23","and it can select which of the"
"01;52;28;14","01;52;31;01","the low level neurons or hidden"
"01;52;31;01","01;52;34;17","that as I know, are not hidden"
"01;52;34;17","01;52;36;19","units to listen to."
"01;52;37;13","01;52;38;24","And of course we come back again"
"01;52;38;24","01;52;40;27","exactly to attention"
"01;52;40;27","01;52;43;04","and selecting those sources"
"01;52;43;04","01;52;45;01","of precise information"
"01;52;45;01","01;52;46;02","and where you've got"
"01;52;46;02","01;52;47;19","a kind of internal action."
"01;52;47;19","01;52;50;02","So it's an interesting"
"01;52;50;02","01;52;50;29","and silly thought,"
"01;52;50;29","01;52;52;09","but just a nice example"
"01;52;52;09","01;52;53;29","of how talking together"
"01;52;53;29","01;52;55;07","can excite interesting"
"01;52;55;07","01;52;57;21","and potentially useful"
"01;52;57;21","01;52;58;26","or possibly silly."
"01;52;58;26","01;53;00;28","So we thought, well, again, thank you."
"01;53;02;07","01;53;03;00","Wonderful."
"01;53;03;00","01;53;05;14","I had a great time observing all of you"
"01;53;06;04","01;53;07;26","and hope to get to do more of it"
"01;53;07;26","01;53;09;07","in the future."
"01;53;10;04","01;53;12;27","Yep, we can have a dart three any time."
"01;53;13;09","01;53;15;04","Consider 40"
"01;53;16;24","01;53;18;12","in the"
"01;53;18;21","01;53;20;23","interim measurement interval"
"01;53;20;23","01;53;25;09","while Argus is digesting and"
"01;53;26;13","01;53;28;25","talk to you all since Thanks again."
"01;53;28;25","01;53;29;27","Thanks very much everyone."
"01;53;29;27","01;53;31;15","Thank you. Bye bye. It's great."
