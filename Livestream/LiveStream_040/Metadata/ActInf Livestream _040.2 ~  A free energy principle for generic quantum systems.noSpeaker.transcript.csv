"Unknown","00;00;28;12","00;00;57;27","Hello, everyone. This is Active Labs, live stream number 40.2 on March 24th. 20, 22. Welcome to the acting flap. We're a participatory online lab that is communicating learning and practicing applied active inference. This is a recorded in an archived live stream, so please provide us with feedback so we can improve our work here about your course. All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome."
"Unknown","00;00;58;03","00;01;10;29","We may actually have to change this to all cure for welcome and we'll follow video etiquette for livestream. Check out active inference dot org to learn more about the activities in the lab."
"Unknown","00;01;13;03","00;01;46;27","Today in 40.2, we are continuing to learn and discuss this awesome paper. A Free Energy Principle for generic quantum systems by Fields first in Glazebrook and Levin. And we're really appreciative to have several of the authors joining us today and in this data, we're just going to have introductions and then jump right in to several of the notes that we left for ourself from last time and see where else it goes."
"Unknown","00;01;46;27","00;02;18;07","And anyone can write a comment in the live chat and we'll just say hello again, pick up with some threads that were left unspooled in the dot one and see where we get in the dot two and how we continue going forward. So I'm Daniel, I'm a researcher in California, and I will pass it to Dean Morning. My name's Dean."
"Unknown","00;02;18;07","00;02;46;21","I'm in Calgary in Canada. My emphasis, I think, is on the practice part of active inference and seeing how it gets applied in in different contexts of situations. I'll pass it to Blue I am a Blue Knight. I'm an independent researcher in New Mexico, and I will be facilitating the discussion today. But let me pass it off to Stephen if he's still here."
"Unknown","00;02;46;21","00;03;16;20","Stephen, I hear your muted Stephen we still don't hear you. OK, thanks, Steve. We'll continue on to Dave Dave I don't see also left. OK, OK, let's continue let's go to the authors. We go so let's pass it to Mike first since we have audio this time."
"Unknown","00;03;21;06","00;03;42;12","Yes. Hi, yeah, this is Mike Levin. I do biology at Tufts trying to understand what what living systems are doing at all scales and how intelligence manifests in various unconventional embodiments across them. And they compete and cooperate across scales to give us the amazing phenomena that we see in biology."
"Unknown","00;03;44;19","00;04;18;24","Awesome. Thank you. Dave, would you like to say hello? Introduce yourself maybe no audio also. OK, how about Carl? Would you like to say hello? Yes, I would. Hello. I'm Carl. I'm one of the coauthors on the paper. I'm a neuroscientist from London. I have to confess, I'm a bit of a passenger and admirer of this paper, so I'm here to learn as much to as turns to questions."
"Unknown","00;04;19;10","00;04;50;14","So I'll pass it on to Chris who Hi, I'm Chris Fields. I'm also an independent researcher working sort of on the boundaries between physics and biology. And information science. And sort of convinced that those are all three the same actual discipline. So this is a paper that expands on that theme a little bit."
"Unknown","00;04;52;25","00;05;19;27","Great. Thank you. So I think where we left off last time was talking about how the FIP is asymptotically the principle of unitary. And maybe, Chris, would you mind leaving this off here? And if you want to point out a specific maybe formalism or place where we should start, I think it was the very last formalism the in the paper actually."
"Unknown","00;05;20;24","00;05;24;11","But maybe if you would talk us through that, that would be super appreciated."
"Unknown","00;05;29;16","00;06;43;08","OK, all right. Well, let's let's talk first informally just about the motivation for this idea and how it might make sense intuitively. And again, I'll go back to Cole's paper from 2019, the free energy principle for a particular physics which which the current paper is obviously modeled after in a certain way. And as we discussed last time I think of what Carl was able to show in particular physics was that the idea of the very intuitive idea of a thing of something that exists and importantly maintains its identity as a single system over time and what that means is that it's it can be measured by some other system of and it can be measured"
"Unknown","00;06;43;08","00;07;43;23","repeatedly and reliable of over time by some other system. So so thing this is associated with repeated measure of building and what Paul was able to show in in particular physics was that if we assume that something is a thing then we're effectively assuming that it has a stable non equilibrium, steady state density and therefore we're assuming that it has a more complex and therefore we can treat it as implementing active inference as of constantly predicting its own future existence and behaving so as to make that prediction come true to the extent that it can and how such behavior may be prevented or overcome by its environment."
"Unknown","00;07;44;28","00;08;24;18","So the environment of something may cause it to cease to exist. Oh, you know, the thing could be a marble sitting on a table and its environment could include a sledgehammer that's about to come down on top of it. And and destroy its thing. This but as long as the environment doesn't do that, the the object can continue to to execute active inference and maintain its mark all blanket by."
"Unknown","00;08;24;18","00;09;07;01","So do it. And of course it's Markov. It is what defines it as a separate entity, as a thing that's distinct from its environment. So let's translate all of that into quantum theory. Oh, in quantum theory we have this notion of interaction as measurement already, and we have a notion of interaction as information exchange. And so it's very natural to take this whole picture and add and make the notion of measurement over time."
"Unknown","00;09;07;02","00;09;39;08","Precise in this using this quantum theoretic formalism and quantum theory also gives us a a very natural implementation of a more called blanket of which in physics is called a holographic screen. And holographic screens were introduced back in the seventies to talk about black holes. Well, but a holographic screen is is just a reformulation of the concept of a mark of black."
"Unknown","00;09;39;13","00;10;12;23","That's that's a boundary that encodes information. And specifically it's a boundary between two systems that encodes all of the information that one system can have about the other. So it does just one of our work. It does it provides an information encoding boundary that gives the systems on the two sides, the identities for each other by distinguishing them."
"Unknown","00;10;14;06","00;10;55;05","And this notion of identity and quantum theory corresponds to severability. Severability just means lack of entanglement. So if the joint if you have a two things or a thing in its environment, then if they're not entangled you can talk about their status independently. If they are entangled, then you can't talk about their states independently. And so the idea of doing this goes way since thing this implies having some sort of conditionally independent state right now since that can actually be written down."
"Unknown","00;10;56;20","00;11;37;03","So all of this fits together rather nicely. And so if we go back to particular the physics of the idea of active inference how emerges from that paper as a fundamental underlying principle of physics that tells us what we mean by thing or system that's identifiable over time?"
"Unknown","00;11;39;08","00;12;20;28","So this is this becomes a very deep principle of deeper than Newton's laws, because Newton's laws actually talk about objects that are identifiable over time and the the the the free energy principle and the idea of active inference tells us what we mean when we talk about something being identifiable over time. So this is a if this is a fundamental principle of physics, then one would expect that there would have some relationship to the principle of utility, which is the most fundamental principle of quantum theory."
"Unknown","00;12;21;03","00;12;33;12","It is typically Axiom one, which one writes down. The axioms of quantum theory was was actually awarded by Norman's formulation back in the thirties."
"Unknown","00;12;36;08","00;13;05;26","Or forties, I can't remember which. So it's the principle of unitary. The principle of unitary is just the principle that in a closed system information is conserved. So information is neither created or destroyed in a closed system. So it's a fundamental conservation law, and it's exactly analogous to the principle of conservation of energy by the conservation of energy sources."
"Unknown","00;13;05;26","00;13;44;22","In a closed system, energy is either created or destroyed, it's conserved. So the principle of unitary just says this for information as well as energy. And we know that information and energy are very closely linked by by land ours principle or by Boltzmann definition of entropy or all of these other connections that make physics informational so how does the principle of active inference relate to the principle of unitary?"
"Unknown","00;13;44;24","00;14;21;17","What does it say about all of the conservation of information, or what does the conservation of information tell us about the principle of the principle of active inference or the free energy? Well, the first thing to note is that territory applies to closed systems. So so the environment pairs and active inference characterizes what the thing is doing in response to its environment."
"Unknown","00;14;22;04","00;14;57;24","And of course it also characterizes what the environment is doing in response to the thing. And another benefit of quantum theory is that it makes the symmetry between any system and its environment now manifest, makes it very explicit that it's already explicit in the free energy principle. I mean, the mark of black, it has two sides and of the the system acting on its environment is the same as the environment."
"Unknown","00;14;58;14","00;15;32;12","Sensing the system, and in the same way that the environment acting on the system is the same as the system, sensing its environment so interaction, physical interaction is information exchange in both frameworks and that it's perfectly symmetrical if the system remains identifiable over time, so does its environment to suggest its environment ceases to exist because its environment is defined with respect to it."
"Unknown","00;15;33;05","00;16;11;27","That's why we call it its environment. Oh, so so all of these all of these symmetries are built into both frameworks. So the free energy principle is fundamentally about prediction, right? Very variational free energy can be thought of as prediction error or potential prediction of so the free energy principle is about the system being able to predict next state of its own."
"Unknown","00;16;11;27","00;16;48;22","Markov Blanket and if it predicts the next state of its own, Markov like it perfectly, then VFI is minimized to zero and that's the asymptotic case. Perfect prediction. There is a question last time about what's asymptotic in the in the claim that the free energy principle is asymptotic with the principle of the unitary and the asymptotic state, as I think Blue pointed out last time, is perfect prediction so now let's translate all those to quantum theory."
"Unknown","00;16;48;22","00;17;32;09","And this is where the figure in the paper that shows the disk with the various triangles comes into play. I think that's figure six, but I've actually forgotten. Yeah, it's, it's that one so let's now introduce this idea of a Cure Elf, which is just a little package of predictive capability of cure. It means quantum reference. Ray, as we discussed last time, a reference frame is implemented computation that makes a measurement comparable across time."
"Unknown","00;17;33;14","00;18;07;02","So a meter stick, for example, implements a computation of length and it allows us to compare measurements of length across time because we assume that it's fixed. And of course we could use a meter stick because each of us has embedded in our brains a representation of life. In fact, we have a representation of a three the coordinate system without which your states would be useless."
"Unknown","00;18;07;27","00;18;48;02","So we can use external reference frames or meter sticks because we have internal reference frames like our representation of 3D space in our intuitive understanding length of that we assume stays fixed over time, and that allows our measurements of works to be comparable across time for us so now let's think about a cure of as a way of of something that implements activity rates or that enables a system to implement active inference by allowing it to compare its measurements over time."
"Unknown","00;18;48;14","00;19;31;24","Right. Prediction is meaningless if you can't compare your measurements over time of so let's ask what what would it be like for a system to be able to perfectly predict the next state of its modified blanket? The next state of its Markov blanket is a state that its environment has written by acting on so of our question of perfect prediction is what would it be like for a system to be able to perfectly predict the next actions of its environment and notice that the system isn't predicting the next state of its environment?"
"Unknown","00;19;31;24","00;19;44;02","It doesn't know the state of its environment, state of its environment. So the other side of our work is trying to predict the action of its environment on it, which is the only action of its environment as well."
"Unknown","00;19;46;23","00;20;36;22","And the only action of the environments that's detected so of its environment like it is characterized by curious, right? The situation is perfectly symmetrical between the system and its environment of so the question of predict the environment and the system could predict its environments actions perfectly only if it in the environment exactly. Share their cure else because the cure of not only interprets sensation, it gives meaning to action so it says what your action is going to be."
"Unknown","00;20;37;20","00;21;01;00","So if I use my meter stick to cut a two by four, my Q r f the meter stick is guiding my action. It's giving it meaning, it's making it repeatable in the same way that it makes my perceptions repeatable. And again, that's, that's why we use this things. We want to be able to act in repeatable ways as well as perceived in repeatable ways."
"Unknown","00;21;01;23","00;21;07;02","And if we can't act in repeatable ways, then again, the notion of prediction becomes meaningless."
"Unknown","00;21;09;05","00;21;47;23","So a perfect prediction corresponds to perfect cure F alone. So the question becomes, well, what is perfect cure of alignment correspond to and our Jim Glazebrook and another colleague, Antonino Marciano, who's a physicist a physicist in Shanghai, showed in a previous paper, but perfect, perfect cure for lying between a system and its environment is only possible if the system and environment are entangled."
"Unknown","00;21;49;10","00;22;31;27","So perfect cure on earth alone. But corresponds actually to the collapse of the bar blanket because it corresponds to the collapse of severability which means that the mess is no longer well defined because it's no longer in a condition where you're dependent state and you can see that if you think of what perfect cure if alignment means, it means that your actions correspond exactly to my predictions a conditional statement."
"Unknown","00;22;32;16","00;23;08;19","It's an exact state. So if I predict that you're going to do X, then you're going to do X, period. Oh, which means that your state is no longer independent of by state. Your state actually depends on my state and my state correspondingly actually depends on your state. If you predict that I'm going to do X, then I will do x that's what perfect prediction makes oh when we translate it into this."
"Unknown","00;23;09;02","00;23;52;04","Oh pure F based concept. So perfect prediction and of the collapse of super ability are the same thing so the asymptotic limit of the FP, which is perfect prediction corresponds to the collapse of severability. Well, the collapse of severability is just the entanglement and the principle of charity is the claim that any isolated system grows to its own devices."
"Unknown","00;23;52;04","00;24;39;13","It will evolve its state, which is the joint state of any two of its components, will evolve toward toward complete entanglement. It will evolve toward a pure state in quantum theoretic jargon, so it's in this sense that the SFP is asymptotically the principle of unitary. It's that if it's asymptotic condition is the same as the condition that the principle charity imposes on closed systems, i.e. on system environment combinations, where whenever I say environment, I just mean everything that exists."
"Unknown","00;24;39;13","00;25;18;27","That's not the system of interests so a system environment combination is always a closed system by definition. So so that's my introduction we can start a discussion. That's great. Thank you. Stephen, did you have a question? Yes, you can hear me OK. Thanks. And I was just going to ask. That's really helpful. There's a lot in there. Obviously, I was going to ask in terms of the pure units, heresy would that be what happens, say, at the electron or the kind of these normal quantum particle scales?"
"Unknown","00;25;18;27","00;25;51;22","And as you go to scales of that, it becomes more and more approximate. You have less of this and isotropic, you know, this this this quality of knowing an entanglement of. Well, that's that's a very deep question and it's a very good question. Let's think about the the the canonical entanglement experience experiment, the sort of bill EPR experiment of."
"Unknown","00;25;52;09","00;26;18;24","So I'll I'll draw it with my hands here so in the canonical experiment, you've got a source and it's located here in the, in the middle of my face and it produces an entangled pair of something photons or electrons or buckyballs or whatever you want. And they travel apart at the speed of light or something very close to it."
"Unknown","00;26;20;00","00;27;04;10","And at some point they encounter two symmetrically placed detectors and the detectors are operated by observers who are always called Alice and Bob. And these detectors measure something. And in the canonical experiment they measure spin and work. Alice and Bob each observe independently is a random distribution of spins. And if we think of this as a two dimensional experiment, then they they either measure sped up or sped down and some coordinate system so else."
"Unknown","00;27;04;12","00;28;01;23","Bob, each pick a Z axis that defines up. And with respect to their local Z axis, they see a random distribution of up to now. Things get interesting when Alice and Bob later get together and compare their results. And what they find is that whenever Alice observes, Bob observes down and vice versa, and so they conclude that their results are classically correlated but then it gets more interesting because what we allow Alice Bob to do is constantly alter the direction that they detect the spin in with respect to their own local Z axis."
"Unknown","00;28;02;26","00;28;54;19","So you can think of the spin detector as like a polarization filter, so like a pair of sunglasses and what else and Bob can do is randomly and independently change the tilt of their sunglasses of what they do this experiment and in, in real implementations of this experiment that this first implemented started by Allen aspect in his lab in Paris in the early 1970s and has since been repeated probably hundreds of times by different groups all over the world including the Chinese using a satellite to generate the entanglement pairs and measuring them thousands of a thousand or so kilometers apart."
"Unknown","00;28;57;07","00;29;25;11","So if you remember the speed of lights the footprint nanosecond so you've got a lot of nanoseconds in there you're a thousand kilometers apart to play with and the so the trick in this experiment is that Alice involved can change the direction of their detector within the time it takes for the entangled pair to get from the source to the detectors."
"Unknown","00;29;25;25","00;29;52;04","So if it takes ten nanoseconds to get from the source to the selectors, they have to be able to change their detectors within ten nanoseconds. So that's why you want detectors that are far apart so Alison. Bob, we do the experiment changing, randomly changing the directions that they're measuring with respect to their local Z axis. And then they get together again to compare their results."
"Unknown","00;29;53;16","00;30;35;08","And what they find is that of if Alice observes Bob, Bob will observe down, oh, even when they've been randomly and independently changing the directions of their detectors. So one way to put that is if Alice decides to rotate her detector 45 degrees, then Bob's result will automatically be rotated 45 degrees and it's symmetrical, so vice and vice versa."
"Unknown","00;30;35;28","00;31;16;09","So that's not classical correlation, that's classical correlation, that's robust against manipulation. So, oh, I was discussing this with Carl a while back, and I used this example of if you and I are a classic or classically correlated, then we may have the same beliefs about something. So we might both believe that the earth is round. That's classical correlation oh, now suppose someone convinces me that the earth is flat."
"Unknown","00;31;18;03","00;32;16;14","If, if that happens and you then believe that the earth is flat, that's entanglement, that's classical correlation, that's robust against manipulation. So it's it's correlation. No kidding. Oh, correlation. That that survives the environment. Doing something to and so now let's go back to this question. Is this is this an effect that only occurs in some microscopic domain and the answer is it's an effect that was first described by a theory that was intended to only describe a microscopic domain like quantum theory was developed to deal with nuclear and atomic and nuclear physics."
"Unknown","00;32;17;14","00;32;46;21","And so there was this idea of the quantum world, which is very small but the math, of course, applies across the board and trying to think of quantum theory, trying to think of classical physics as a limit, a mathematical limit of quantum theory always runs into problems. And the problems are always that numbers go to infinity that shouldn't be infinity."
"Unknown","00;32;47;25","00;33;19;22","So it's not really accurate to think of classical physics as some sort of mathematical limit. Like each bar goes to zero of quantum theory, because if each word goes to zero, lots of relevant energies go to infinity and this is this has been known for a long time. Nonetheless, it's it's constantly taught in this classical limit. Kind of framework that isn't really correct."
"Unknown","00;33;22;18","00;33;38;01","Of the so one point of doing bel EPR experiments of larger and larger distances is to demonstrate that quantum theory is not really a microscopic theory."
"Unknown","00;33;40;18","00;34;20;00","So if you think of an entangled state, an entangled state is one object. It's not two electrons that happen to have some mysterious relationship. It's one object that has one state. Remember what entanglement means is nonseverability non independence across any decompositional boundary. So an entangled pair is one thing. And what the Chinese were able to demonstrate was you can have one quantum object that's over a thousand kilometers long."
"Unknown","00;34;20;19","00;34;49;29","Now, that's not microscopic. That's big. Oh, a nice way to think about entanglement was introduced by Leonard Susskind quite a few years ago, and Rafael Baeza with their idea that an entangled pair is the same thing as an Einstein Rosen Bridge in space time and an Einstein roads and bridges a black hole and a white hole connected in the end."
"Unknown","00;34;50;28","00;35;21;22","Or you can think of it that way. It's it's a topological connection in spacetime that simply identifies two points in space time that would otherwise be considered state. So this emphasizes that if you have an entangled pair, there's no distance inside it. Oh, if you have two entangled electrons, for example, there a thousand kilometers apart, as far as they're concerned, they're right next to each other."
"Unknown","00;35;22;13","00;35;54;16","And in fact, as far as they're concerned, they're located at exactly the same point in space time. And that's what this air bridge notion emphasizes to us. Oh, there's really no separation here. That the separation is an artifact of our observational capabilities. It's not a characteristic of the individual to do it. So entanglement actually calls into question what the idea of distance even means it makes it forces it to be relative to us."
"Unknown","00;35;54;16","00;36;51;26","And that's that's that's why there's all this discussion of emergent spacetime in quantum gravity and quantum cosmology. Because if you think about things from a straight quantum theory point of view of space, time is an observable. It's just something it's something that's relative to how observations move. It's not an intrinsic property of anything. It's not pontic, as they say, so so let's go back to this question again of if we think about entanglement and we think about observation of and we think about entanglement as something that's observed by comparing observations made by different observers neither Alice nor Bob in that experiment can detect entanglement."
"Unknown","00;36;53;19","00;36;58;27","They only realize that there's an entangled state and they talk to each other after they've done the experiment."
"Unknown","00;37;02;08","00;37;45;12","Then this question of scale becomes a question about how observers interact and what observers can know about each other and about each other's experimental apparatus. So when I described the entanglement experiment, I said, Alice and Bob each have their own local Z axis and when they get together and they discuss their results and they compare their results, then they make a very important assumption, which is the assumption that their Z axes are comparable."
"Unknown","00;37;47;03","00;38;06;14","So if during the experiment Bob's Z axis was veering at random with respect to Alice's Z axis, then their results, comparing their results would be meaningless because they'd be measured with respect to completely different reference rooms."
"Unknown","00;38;09;16","00;38;56;16","Of So we have to make this assumption that they have the same Z axis. Now, interestingly enough, that assumption by itself tells you that Alice and Bob have to be tangled, or their Z axes have to be table so of the idea of entanglement kind of expands to take in all aspects of the experimental situation and says one starts unearthing these assumptions that we make to our talk about comparability between experiments."
"Unknown","00;38;57;19","00;39;36;01","So let's real we'll take back about half an hour and we see that the quantum reference frames are what make experiments comparable for an observer its similarity or comparability of quantum reference frames that make comparing experiments possible for two observers but if the two observers exactly share their cue, or else in a way that's robust against environmental manipulation, then they're entangled."
"Unknown","00;39;36;29","00;40;19;18","So we've kind of come full circle here. Oh, it's 11 can make this notion of entanglement as macroscopic as one works and again, this is in a sense, why, why quantum gravity and quantum cosmology or interest is what drives things like the Blackhole Information Paradox, which you may have read about. Of so. So, so we're now getting into in a sense, very fundamental physics."
"Unknown","00;40;19;18","00;40;59;00","How do we know what's the relationship between entanglement and the concept of spacetime? What's the relation between quantum theory and general relativity, of which is the big the big question in physics from one point of view. Oh, but the short answer is you can make entanglement as big as you want that's great. Thank you. That actually leads into a question that I had back way back when we were talking about entanglement quantum reference frames."
"Unknown","00;40;59;29","00;41;22;11","So I was just thinking like if I cannot perfectly predicts my own behavior, is my quantum reference frame like incompletely aligned with my own quantum reference frame? Like, I mean, maybe we will have the experience of, you know, predicting if I kick the ball in this way, I predict it'll go over there, but it doesn't actually go over there."
"Unknown","00;41;22;11","00;42;44;10","So like, I mean, we predict and we're off our prediction this is not accurate. So is it actually a temporal separation that that makes that happen? Or what do you think happens in those circumstances where my Q RF appears unaligned with my own cure of now? That's also that's also a beautiful deep question, and it points to something that I think of can and should be stated as a general theorem, which is no system can perfectly predict, can perfectly predict its own state oh, no system can observe its own state its own total state of so of so that situation is ubiquitous and unavoidable and one could phrase that by saying, oh, a system can"
"Unknown","00;42;44;10","00;43;33;26","have a a cure F or a better processor as one often uses that vocabulary that represents itself. So we all have a self representation of that's in a sense, metacognitive. We claim to know what we believe and things like that. But of course those beliefs are all of one very strange, two extremely incomplete of three useful for making predictions, but they're often wrong and you know, this this is this this point has had huge technological consequences."
"Unknown","00;43;34;03","00;44;09;29","I mean, think back to the history of artificial intelligence right in the seventies. Oh, there is the the huge new wave was expert systems and you know, people redefine themselves as knowledge engineers. If we're going to go out, interview experts and find out how experts did things coded up in computers, and soon we'd have artificial expert systems that did anything interesting and that whole business failed utterly."
"Unknown","00;44;11;22","00;44;51;06","It it was a complete disaster. It didn't work at all. Why the simple explanation for why is that experts can't tell you what they're doing expertize isn't verbal liable. And it's not just expert piano playing, is it? Verbalize, you know, expert systems engineering is verbalize expert computer programing is verbalize. Oh, and that's that's just an illustration of the fact that our better processors don't actually have a complete model of the rest of us, much less a model of the rest of us."
"Unknown","00;44;51;06","00;45;30;27","Plus the motor processor so it all it all comes back to this general principle that a system can't represent itself, and so it can't predict its own awesome so between this work, actually, I should ask Carl to comment on that tirade because he's also thought about this an extraordinary amount well, I'll certainly make the comment that that was marvelous."
"Unknown","00;45;30;27","00;46;00;26","You know, I'm glad this is being recorded because this should certainly be transcribed. And I know it's probably implicit in the paper, but it was so beautifully articulated and clear taking us through the issues. I really enjoyed them. And so I have loads of comments, but I will work with people's time going through all of them and that last issue is really interesting about some of the better process or the metacognitive aspects of a system being able to measure itself."
"Unknown","00;46;00;26","00;46;28;12","I think there's a fundamental observation that because you know, you can't measure yourself, the whole point of the particular physics paper was to say that, you know, yes, there can be two kinds of information geometries, if you like. And the big move is that one system can measure, i.e. infer by possessing or having a movement in some sort of information geometry."
"Unknown","00;46;28;25","00;46;59;00","Infer a belief update about something else. So at no point is there any room for it just then also start to be fair about it. So an inference that that is you know, that's a mathematical impossibility from from the random dynamical system perspective. I'm not so sure about the, the quantum perspective, but it sounds as though that's also true so that begs the question, and how on earth do we have the illusion that we know ourselves?"
"Unknown","00;47;00;06","00;47;26;16","And of course, you know, that is a little bit of a colloquial question because, you know, 99.9% of things don't actually think that they know themselves. So unless there's a particular phenotype, particle or species that boasts philosophers, I'm pretty sure that most of the things that exist don't have any any pretense to the thinking that they know themselves."
"Unknown","00;47;27;10","00;47;57;16","It's a really interesting point to get across. Anecdotally, you know, I spend a lot of time taking people through examples that probably go right back to things like idea, motor theory, that, you know, the way that we the way that we develop a sense of agency. I think that we have a sense of agency, you know, is a gift, an illusion, that is probably unique to only a small number of us and may not even be available to people with severe autism."
"Unknown","00;47;58;28","00;48;28;20","And, you know, the example of that literally in the past day just written down in a dramatic way, was that if you just take vanilla active inference under a mark of blanket and then you look at particular kinds of sparse structures where the active states of the mark of blanket or the holographic screen are hidden from the internal state."
"Unknown","00;48;28;20","00;49;06;28","So these are special kinds of systems have a particular sparse state where now the active states of the mark of the blanket are now become hidden from the internal states. And you can certainly license some entanglement. And I would I would later ask about the restricted entanglement and synchronization. So I would say entanglement or synchronization of the internal states such that the internal states have beliefs about their action, but those beliefs become beliefs about action as a hidden cause."
"Unknown","00;49;07;04","00;49;30;00","So that absolutely no notion from the inside that you caused that you're just representing the cause. So the example I have in mind is you're watching a little fish swimming around looking for food, gobbling up little bits of particles of food, and you think, oh, that's a very sort of artful fish with purpose and pragmatics and knows how to navigate its world."
"Unknown","00;49;32;14","00;49;58;28","But from the point of view of the fish, all that is happening is that the water and the particles are moving around it and a benevolent, nurturing and fortuitous way such that the water is delivering food particles to the fish's mouth. So from the fishes point of view, it has absolutely no awareness that it is the author or the agent that's causing this synchronization with the environment."
"Unknown","00;49;59;10","00;50;39;15","So know, the deeper question is how on earth do we have the illusion that we think we know our own our own agency, and how and when do we develop agency and you know, furthermore, it's not just agency about me, it's agency about other things. At what point do you say early neonatal neurodevelopment? Do we have these models of the world that enable us to distinguish between mother and self, you know, and at what point do we align our cure axis, if you like, with not mother but with the world?"
"Unknown","00;50;40;24","00;51;03;11","That enables us to now see Mother as an independent object. So that is something else that is an agent and you know, like I would then be well, perhaps if Mother is an agent, perhaps I am an agent. And I guess about that I am now the author of my agency and my actions. But that is such, you know, that's such a high level thing."
"Unknown","00;51;03;11","00;51;39;19","How much of it pertains to humans that's what that's what I said. I'd love to talk about the homologous of entanglement from the point of view of classical and perhaps I could bring up at this point could just a couple of things came came to my mind listening to this. One is that Josh Bongard had this amazing paper in I think it was about 26 or so where he had these robots and these they were they started out like a six legged starfish."
"Unknown","00;51;39;19","00;51;59;22","But the cool thing about it was that they didn't have an internal model of what they were and or what their shape is or how to move. And they basically had to flop around and make, make models of their own structure based on what happened to them, given various outputs that they generated. And eventually they would build a model of what happens and they would walk around and so on."
"Unknown","00;52;00;05","00;52;16;06","And two interesting things followed. One is that you could, unlike traditional robotics, you could rip off one of the legs and it would very soon revise the model and keep going in different ways. So they weren't tied to that particular self model, right? They would have to discover it from scratch, but it was still sort of plastic throughout their whole lifetime."
"Unknown","00;52;16;06","00;52;39;16","And they could they could get along. So they had that plasticity and the other thing is that and Chris Christoff, Adam, he wrote a nice kind of interpretation piece of this. He described they they spent lots of lots of time being completely inactive and basically running through quote unquote, mentally running through all the different things that they could do and what they think was going to happen before they actually moved."
"Unknown","00;52;39;16","00;53;00;13","And so you go Chris called that dreaming, you know, that they would basically sort of play out before, you know, and in between their actual motions where they would go around testing and they would actually sort of play this out internally and try to refine the model such that then when they do move, they would actually make movements that maximally sort of distinguished the different, different possible models and so on."
"Unknown","00;53;00;21","00;53;29;26","And so said that you can watch them dreaming about about their shape. So and then the other thing I just wanted to briefly mention this, this idea of when and how do you recognize that you are an agent and that actually you need to act for things to happen versus just having the environment do things. Do I suspect that one of the things that drives it very early on is this is this notion of stress, then I don't have a particular I don't have a theory of why stress feels stressful."
"Unknown","00;53;29;26","00;53;57;17","But but just on a purely functional level, I think that what happens in cells, you know, so very early, long before you get to humans or anything like that, I think that what you get is this this set of mechanisms that that evolved from things like stress about protein folding and so on. But then then basically scaled up to be stress about metabolic and stress about morphology and stress about behavioral issues and so on."
"Unknown","00;53;57;26","00;54;27;27","That basically is, is a system wide metric of the delta between what's going on and what you'd like to have going on, right? That the delta between your set point and what's happening now and what then. I think that drives a strengthening of this of, of the agency model because what will happen is as you as you as you slowly learn that you can do things that reduce the stress level it kind of solidifies this idea that it's actually at least some amount of it is up to you to make life better."
"Unknown","00;54;27;27","00;54;50;10","And so you then then act and then of course, we know that breaks down and sort of learn helplessness assays and so on. That's that's that that really is very traumatic for for all kinds of creatures that won't be long human can I can I speak to that because there's some great points that please. Yeah. So three really important things been brought to the table there."
"Unknown","00;54;51;23","00;55;25;23","So I'm bound to forget the third one. If I start the first one, I just want to say I'm coming back to this question about sort of a purist and alignment and that and one obvious answer that what could bring to the table is that learning is the alignment that you're at. So learning at all scales. We are talking here about developmental scales, for example, we're talking about robots that learn to repair themselves or learn that new QR codes we build them or child learning to make sense of its world."
"Unknown","00;55;26;08","00;56;16;21","Then you can look at the slow process of alignment of the cure and the things that are invariant over the faster time scales, of which there is classic motion exchange on our in the holographic screen of simply a movement from a state of its entanglement to a state of entanglement as you become better, better at predicting. But to become better predicting, you have to align your curating often to align the I think the sort of the robot examples are perhaps a nice illustration of that in the sense that these robots were equipped with the ability to learn about themselves because they had a lot in developmental psychology."
"Unknown","00;56;16;21","00;57;13;24","And indeed, I would imagine developmental robotics is motor public. It's basically, you know, soliciting outcomes, sensory outcomes in order to start to disambiguate between what did I call that? How did you cause that, you know, what parts are apparently under my control because yeah, that's a very anthropomorphic interpretation because their mind is so mind that's implicit but certainly the learning of the world models and the body model is probably the first thing that any artifact has to contend with because you see that in children, you're shaking their rattle to to solicit and actively solicit the conjunction of visual motion, proprioceptive feedback from the muscles causing the movement of the mobile or the rattle and the"
"Unknown","00;57;13;24","00;57;47;11","auditory. So soliciting conjunctions or correlations that are explainable and predictable in multiple modalities. So you may then ask, well, why on Earth what is the imperative for that kind of behavior? What drives action to solicit this opportunity to learn the the correlations and coincidences in the conjunctions? And that brings us to the second point."
"Unknown","00;57;50;04","00;58;32;10","That the these robots dreaming tell you immediately and at some level they have an internal model of the consequences of action. And that tells you immediately that you've got if you wanted to write that down from a point of view of classical active inference, you've got a belief structure on the inside that covers both the covers, both the external world and these hidden actions and the actions upon of the world and the consequences of those actions on the external states."
"Unknown","00;58;32;17","00;59;09;00","That's a very sophisticated generative model to have. And you're getting now into the world of planning is inference. So a thermostat, one doesn't have that, and yet these robots do have them. So it tells you that there are two natural kinds of particles on blankets or separable systems, at least two kinds, one of which is more like a thermostat and one of which is more like a sort of I was thinking a sort of homeostatic atmospheric, but certainly more like these sort of robots that can learn about about themselves."
"Unknown","00;59;09;09","00;59;35;05","And the key and the crucial distinction, I think, is that the agent has now started to represent the consequences of its actions, but without realizing it's its own actions. And so how we got to the level of the the metacognitive, I am aware, kind of kind of bias, but and interesting, it comes back to what I was said before about natural kinds, where once active states are hidden from the internal state."
"Unknown","00;59;35;05","01;00;02;04","So they have to be inferred you have to infer that they're not they're not they are opaque to the internal states. And as soon as you say that, then you're naturally talking about systems that can effectively engage in planning as a prince. So they have to have plans in their heads in order to act, which corresponds to this dreaming."
"Unknown","01;00;02;14","01;00;31;25","And from the point of view of the the frequently active inference. And then you ask, well, what are the objective functions or what are the principles of this faction that would apply to these kinds of plans? So when you work it through, then one important component of the sort of the package of or the actions in question is a drive to resolve uncertainty."
"Unknown","01;00;32;12","01;01;31;08","So we come back to this notion of the child soliciting proprioceptive extra to sensations that enable it to resolve uncertainty. And this is exactly the same principle behind the optimal basic design that we design experiments that are going to resolve the uncertainty to the greatest extent possible under our current internal also hypotheses about how the world works. And that brings me to the third great point about stress and the the really important place of stress and uncertainty and angst and not knowing what to do next or not knowing what's going to work and driving behavior because if a large chunk of the imperatives for planned action is to maximize information gain or minimize expected surprise"
"Unknown","01;01;31;08","01;02;22;17","or or reduce uncertainty, then you can see easily now why two situations of uncertainty and stress that will necessarily cause the most epistemic responses in order to drive the system or the in this instance, the agent to resolve that uncertainty. The final point now, and this is basically paraphrasing what Mike just said, if the system sees itself behaving more in times of greater uncertainty, it may learn that I now have the idea, oh, I am the kind of system or would behaving as if I have the kind of system that responds more when under stress and then you will become aware of that and then you can get into the psychiatric or psychological aspects of"
"Unknown","01;02;22;17","01;02;46;21","stress. You may not if you're just a protein, you might just show a sort of selection for flexibility in response. But that's I think the you know, the two fundamental mechanisms, the imperatives that are being fulfilled here in accord with basic conservation and also principles of least action from the classical perspective account for exactly the same kind of behavior."
"Unknown","01;02;46;29","01;03;19;13","I think the interesting thing about stress or uncertainty, they're not talking about the the content of implicit beliefs structures, but the the the second order statistics, the uncertainty that I think brings a whole level of analysis to the table because once you talk about uncertainty, and representations of uncertainty inside internal states, then from a psychological perspective, you start to talk about tension and consciousness from the point of view of an engineer."
"Unknown","01;03;19;13","01;03;49;13","We're talking about things like climate gain and getting the estimates of noise levels, if you like. Correct. And I'm not sure. Well, what where the if you like the. Well, let me ask from a quantum theoretic point of view, is uncertainty baked into that? Can you have a stressed quantum quantum formulation pull that out there? Well, stop talking now."
"Unknown","01;03;58;22","01;04;45;27","Yeah. Just to just to answer that question of if if one if one thinks about quantum theory of four with a Bayesian view of probability. Right. With the kind of subjective this notion of probability of which I mean, that point of view was really pioneered by Chris Fuchs. And now David Berman, for example, has taken it up and written some very good things about of then this notion of uncertainty, reduction of becomes the explanation for why you do experiments and build theories."
"Unknown","01;04;45;27","01;05;30;22","And and, you know, it all becomes very well aligned, I think with with the idea of active inference. In fact, we we wrote into that paper at the very end some remark about how this cubist perspective about quantum theory becoming a result, not an interpretation. When we think of of quantum theory is in a sense, a way of reformulating the idea of the inference of so I think and very consistent right now of a stressed, stressed quantum is stress."
"Unknown","01;05;30;22","01;06;13;14","Quantum system is just a system that gets observational outcomes and it doesn't expect so we have to think of such systems as having generative models and thinking about the generative model of an electron is a bit of a stretch, right? Because the electron is only characterized by mass charge and angular momentum so it can't really have expectations about much."
"Unknown","01;06;13;21","01;07;01;12","Right? Electron can have no expectations about the external electric field, for example. Oh, it can detect that. It can respond to it. But it can't predict it. And if we think about, oh, something like an electron, then we can focus in on this idea that having a generative model requires gears, having enough memory to keep a record of the most recent observation least the most recent one and if you want to have a good generative model, then you better have enough memory to keep a record of quite a number of observations."
"Unknown","01;07;02;25","01;07;40;14","And it's this memory resource that really simple things like electrons don't have so oh, they're, they're not great predictors. Oh, because they don't have the memory to allow being a great predictor. And as it was, both Carl and Mike were saying of insights, you have to have memory to be able to feel stress. You have to know that your predictions were wrong."
"Unknown","01;07;40;25","01;08;15;11","So you have to remember what your predictions were oh. So memory becomes a really key component of the theory. Oh, once you put it into this language, because the language in a sense forces you to to lay out assumptions about what the what the computational resources that are being required are that was it very coherent. But anyway, I just wanted to stress the role of memory here."
"Unknown","01;08;16;18","01;08;18;02","Perfect. So thank you, Carl."
"Unknown","01;08;20;15","01;08;52;10","Just to reinforce mentors that last point and just tell exactly the same story in a much more pragmatic way and the point of view as statistician. So I heard Chris say that basically that if I want to go beyond being a little electronic thermostat and I want to now infer the quality of how noisy all my senses, for example, my favorite senses, if I'm a thermostat that will require me becoming a little statistician."
"Unknown","01;08;52;25","01;09;17;04","And what does that mean? Well, basically, I'm going to be estimating the standard error or the the experimental variance. There's something quite important about that which which comes back exactly to the computational resources and memory. If you do a simple T test as a statistician on Excel experimental data, you necessarily have to acquire lots of data points and store them."
"Unknown","01;09;17;20","01;10;11;08","And of course, that is just the degrees of freedom associated with your T test or your F test. So the degrees of freedom score, the number of data points that you'll be able to remember, and you need a sufficient number in order to get a precise estimate of the uncertainty. So literally the degrees of freedom in classical statistics is literally a statistic that scores your confidence in the estimation of the standard error which is pulled over multiple observations, which is an attempt to estimate on average, if I observe with this kind of or I asked my questions or I wrote to my holographic screen, or I selected these sensory states, you know, what would on"
"Unknown","01;10;11;08","01;10;33;10","average, what would the uncertainty be associated with it? So I think it's a really important point about the computation resources, the degrees of freedom, literally in the sense of the degrees of freedom associated with your F test or the degrees of freedom you have available for the computing power to actually get up to these second order inference machines or takes on the second order inference."
"Unknown","01;10;33;20","01;11;01;00","So and I think that is particularly important when it comes back to Mike's observation about stress and uncertainty and these higher order ways of making sense of the world, but in this instance, making sense of sensations that are accrued over time, not about the content, but about the reliability or the precision of that content. So this is a really important point awesome."
"Unknown","01;11;01;18","01;11;38;20","So that kind of. Oh, Chris, go ahead. Yeah. Yeah. If I could just pick up on this and take it in, in yet another highly related direction. It's just to point out that all of these resources are energetically expensive. So if I'm going to devote space in my state space to recording memories, then that's only useful if I can defend those memories against entropy, if I can keep them from decaying."
"Unknown","01;11;39;23","01;12;08;23","So I've got to consume energy to write the memories I've got to consume energies to energy to maintain the memories. And then I have to consume energy to read the memories and consume energy to compare what I've read with what I see with my kind of current events, sensors. So as we start adding these computational resources to systems, the energy budget goes way up."
"Unknown","01;12;09;25","01;12;48;02","And it's it's another kind of thing to keep in mind as we think about these in terms of embodied forms, whether they're robots or organisms, that of these these entities are extracting this free energy that they have to have to run their computations and maintain their memories and all of that from the environment. So here's this is another input that in a sense is not sensory, but it's still having to flow through the bark of blanket."
"Unknown","01;12;48;02","01;13;35;24","It's still having to flow through the boundary between the system its environment and a lot of the system's actions on its environment, its expenditures of of of its own internal energy of are to acquire this free energy. So, you know, we we go out and shop for groceries, make breakfast or whatever, all that stuff that we have to do to keep all of these processes running so in terms of metabolism and cognition together in a way that they aren't often tied, but that they have to be to make sense of what's going on great."
"Unknown","01;13;36;08","01;14;03;03","So just on that point, something that we had written down as a question from last time and in terms of an electron having a generative model and discussing agency, we had talked about free choice and it was brought up in the paper several times, both in terms of like any physical system having free choice. If one physical system has free choice they all have free choice."
"Unknown","01;14;03;12","01;14;26;07","They generate like their noise generating things like free choice generates noise and both classical and quantum systems. And so I just was wondering if you could maybe say a few words about the difference in free choice in an electron and the difference in the truth between an electron and like a human or an animal or even a cell."
"Unknown","01;14;26;27","01;14;30;06","What is that difference? And is that also related to memory?"
"Unknown","01;14;37;22","01;15;16;27","How is that a question for me? The general question for anyone well, I'll make a couple of comments of one is of now, remember, in talking about the canonical entanglement experiment of part of the description is that Alice and Bob can alter the directions of their detectors however they want to at random, independently, whatever you want to call it during the experiment."
"Unknown","01;15;17;13","01;15;48;17","So that's the free choice assumption, or that's called in physics, the free choice assumption and what that assumption means, it's effectively an assumption of independence it means that there's not some common cause in the past that determines what they're going to do as they operate their detectors."
"Unknown","01;15;51;13","01;16;45;08","And one can reformulate quantum theory of in terms of what's called super determinism and super determinism is the idea that there is some common cause in the past that determines how experimenters are going to do their experiments. And in particular determines how Alice and Bob are going to rotate their detectors. In this EPR experiment, and how super determinism is kind of the ultimate, non-local hidden variable oh."
"Unknown","01;16;45;28","01;17;30;14","So yeah. Oh, it allows you to predict exactly what the entangled pairs are going to do. And in fact, it renders entanglement a classical effect, right? It just says these these kind of super classical correlations are preserved because there, there was no independence to begin with. Everything was determined from the very beginning. And if you think about because as mentioned last time, Newtonian physics is formulated by applause, it's a super determined, deterministic system."
"Unknown","01;17;32;02","01;18;02;17","Oh, so anything that happens anywhere in the universe instantly affects what's going on everywhere else in the universe. And the most the most current formulation of that is Birmingham. Quantum mechanics for the motion of any particle depends instantaneously on the motion of every other particle of the universe. And that's how Newtonian gravity worked right before Einstein imposed locality by making the speed of light finite."
"Unknown","01;18;03;26","01;18;46;18","So all of these things are interconnected assumptions about space, time, subjects, about the speed of communication, assumptions about super determinism, and assumptions about free choice it's that cluster of assumptions that the so-called free will theorem in physics is about theorems that have now a couple of them to do to Conway and Coker. And what those theorems show is that from a form perspective, oh, in physics, if you assume that some system has free choice."
"Unknown","01;18;46;21","01;19;12;06","So if you assume that some system is not subject to super determinism, then you have to assume that all systems have free choice in the sense that all systems are not subject to super determinism. So you can't limit super determinism to some little piece of the universe and say it only applies here it doesn't apply anywhere else, and in particular it doesn't apply to me."
"Unknown","01;19;13;03","01;19;18;11","I have free choice, even though nothing else does. That's mathematically inconsistent."
"Unknown","01;19;20;29","01;20;03;10","So that's, that's what, what the free choice assumption means. And it's in a strict physical context thank you. Very cool. You've do you have a question I was just going to ask a little bit more about the and the degrees of entanglement and whether that's different in terms of the observer's degrees and versus the like the mechanical nature of quantum mechanics, degrees I think you've answered that to some extent."
"Unknown","01;20;03;13","01;20;36;24","That's just just the way that that varying degrees of entanglement can be thought about. And whether that maybe ties into how the Hilbert space is is thought about that same time, yeah. This this assumption. All right. This question touches on why we do everything in the paper from the point of view of bipartite decomposition. So we always we always decompose into a system in its environment, in the paper."
"Unknown","01;20;39;27","01;21;39;26","And there are two reasons for that. One is to keep it simple and the other one is to enforce the mark called blanket condition so it's entirely commonplace to do physics in an open systems framework where we talk about how two systems we could call analysis. Bob, again, that are embedded in a common environment. And in that case, whenever you have a tripartite or greater some sort of multi particle kind of decomposition of the state space, you can talk about degrees of entanglement between different systems and you can, you know, cut up the state space anywhere you want to ask about the entanglement, entropy of some component of it."
"Unknown","01;21;41;08","01;22;33;16","Of and then you get these ideas of, of partial or they call it non-monogamous entanglement of and that's all well and good. It's, it's mathematically complicated, it's conceptual, very complicated. But in a sense it deeply violates the word called blanket condition of because in point of fact, each of us is an observer and of our goal is to just say, what does the world look like to an observer and from Alice's point of view of Bob, is the decomposition of her bar called Blanket."
"Unknown","01;22;35;05","01;23;01;19","Right. Alice has to actively disambiguate her incoming signals into signals that she attributes to Bob as an entity and signals that she attributes to the rest of the environment as an entity. So that's an active cognitive process. On Alice's part."
"Unknown","01;23;03;27","01;23;37;21","That's what the mark of the blanket condition, that's how the bar called blanket conditioned in a sense, forces us to think so of the mark of the condition itself, makes us take this idea of bipartite decomposition seriously. And again, you can think of this in terms of implicit assumptions about the sources of if you think in open systems terms."
"Unknown","01;23;37;21","01;24;12;22","And so you think of Alice Bob as as antic entities that are that are separate from each other by our assumption and separate from their environments by our priority assumption, then you systematically underestimate the amount of cognition that Alice and Bob have to be doing and so you systematically underestimate their energy consumption. And so you systematically underestimate their their uncontrolled effect on the environment."
"Unknown","01;24;13;03","01;25;18;06","Each generation of waste, heat acquisition of free energy resources and all the so it's not just a philosophical difference, it's a difference that leads you to make of genuinely alternative predictions about things like metabolic load. So that's why we do things in this bipartite framework to respect and work off a condition and to keep our assumptions about energy flow explicit and we take that to the latter sections in the paper about biological or cognition what are the implications for this for biological systems yeah."
"Unknown","01;25;18;27","01;26;19;21","Coral OK, well just to pursue that sort of thought experiment where you're trying to now say you wanted to use active inference, distinguishing Alice and Bob, observing a pair of electrons and remembering that the pair of electrons are one thing. So you've now got a tripartite with three mark of blankets in play and many of the issues, for example, the super determinism that allows some assumptions about the pure alignment between Bob and Alice to be in play, and also the discussion of how Alice has to have has to contextualize sensations from Bob under a belief for an internal model that Bob is indeed another mark of blanket and possibly a mark of Plunkett, very much"
"Unknown","01;26;19;21","01;27;12;00","like Alice. What you are saying is that two of these particles, Bob and Alice, have aligned QR X that could have been aligned historically under the soup, which I'd never heard of before. But I like the word at upper super determinism, and that may be a prerequisite to understand the experiments that we were taken through previously. When looking at the third mark of Plunkett, which would be the the electron or the two electrons, but for simplicity, so that from a biological perspective tells you something quite quite interesting in the sense that it starts to get to the if it's the case that you can basically carve up a bunch of states not in a bipartite"
"Unknown","01;27;12;02","01;27;40;18","way, but in a multi-party way. And that carving is by inserting Markov blankets to define the partition and the every, if you like, subset of that space now becomes interpreted as mark of bracket. So there are now no external states. All we have in play now are a set of internal states, each equipped with the holographic screen or mock of blanket states."
"Unknown","01;27;40;26","01;28;12;19","That are exchanging with other internal states. Then there's some really interesting questions about how that system will evolve. You know, from the point of view of the discussion we've been having, it's going to evolve under the principle of maturity to entanglement. So it's going to from from a classical perspective, if you allow me, it's going to tend to a state of a generalized synchronization where everything collapses onto the same synchronization manifold and everything is indistinguishable."
"Unknown","01;28;12;22","01;28;44;13","That's perfect mutual predictability. That's a communication of an elemental and fundamental. So so everything has basically everything is singing from exactly the same hymn sheet. That's the natural way of things. The free energy principle is just one way of describing that natural tendency. What would that look like? Cognitively? Well, it would look as if the mark of blankets we're trying to learn about each other, and to the extent that they can act on each other, they're going to try and solicit the kinds of outcomes that would enable them to learn about each other."
"Unknown","01;28;44;24","01;29;12;23","So we're now going to get a situation that is driven by the imperative towards mutual predictability and entanglement. That's an illusion. All that is actually happening is that the system is becoming entangled, but it will look as if all of these separate Markov blankets or sets of internal states are aligning in a mutually compatible way that curate so that they can exchange and protect each other."
"Unknown","01;29;12;29","01;29;35;28","And if there's, if you like, an odd man out, namely the pair of electrons, and then, you know, then there will be an asymmetry and there will be greater degrees of entanglement, the multiple levels, for example, if they're both observing a thermostat that the thermostat is not going to be very good at learning how to aligns with Bob and Alex, but they're all going to make the best job of it."
"Unknown","01;29;36;17","01;30;08;08","Ultimately, of course, we could culturally can establish construction, though they'll build better thermostats, become little robots, and then they can all live happily and communicate. So I think that's sort of the cognitive thing here comes again back to learning to live in your world as an apparent expression of the the inevitable progression to entanglement whereby we try to learn about each other under the plausible hypothesis that you are like me."
"Unknown","01;30;08;15","01;30;46;00","It's not necessarily true, but it is one hypothesis you can bring to the table. You never know whether it's true or not, but that's certainly one hypothesis that would work very nicely for Alex and Bob if they can develop a common language. So this notion of aligning curates between two blanketed systems particles that are sufficiently similar then just simply translates into learning to share the same narrative, to share the same language, in order to render everything mutually predictable."
"Unknown","01;30;46;00","01;31;08;14","So I know exactly what you're going to say next, and you know exactly what I'm going to say next. And we come now to this asymptotic limit of zero prediction error, zero reality and complete entanglement and that would be the or the object will have no Ukraines or Brexit. So if we could get there, but that would be the other direction of travel from from a biological perspective."
"Unknown","01;31;09;13","01;31;46;09","And just just to that, there are simulations of this from a purely classical perspective, stuff and what you normally do is start off with two systems that think they have strange attractors, usually a Lorenz attractor. So they think that the dynamics are generated by the act that they're autonomous. So the active states create stuff out there that has a chaotic aspect."
"Unknown","01;31;46;09","01;32;19;20","And I say that explicitly just because this sort of the notion of free will and choice in the classical domain usually reduces to sensitivity to two initial conditions, which strikes me as a whole analog of the super determinism game. Yeah. Can you go right back to the beginning and explain everything and in sort of classical dynamical systems, there are certain situations where you can't because you've got a sensitive situation conditions so that the space for free will and choice that certainly at what level."
"Unknown","01;32;19;23","01;32;52;13","But so I digress. So what you do is you basically put sort of two chaotic systems with sensitivity to initial conditions together, but they're not identical in the first instance. But if they can exchange sense through an active state so they can exchange across a shared holographic screen so we're now back to the bipartite situation, then they will naturally, if you think about it, they can't do anything else they will naturally come to a state of entanglement, i.e. in generalized synchrony."
"Unknown","01;32;52;22","01;33;15;28","And if you allow the parameters of the equations of motion that underwrite these chaotic dynamic dynamics to also maximize mutual predictability, in my strategy, then they will actually come to show an identical synchronization because they will learn to become like each other, just like Mike's robots. But in this instance, they're learning about the other person simply to make things predictable."
"Unknown","01;33;16;03","01;33;37;19","So then you will have a shared narrative, and in principle you should be able to evince a kind of I should mention that because I know Chris wanted to talk about we wanted to talk about, you know, quantum quantum physics. Is this basically a description of communication and language I don't think we can have time to do that, but I thought I'd see about it anyway."
"Unknown","01;33;40;07","01;33;46;23","The rest of you want to say a few words, quantum and language."
"Unknown","01;33;49;14","01;34;30;05","Oh, well, that was that was lovely, Carl. And I like the idea of this kind of simulation leading to to generalize synchrony. I think it's interesting from this perspective that we of we always divide our environment into entities like us. And then at least one entity that's radically unlike us, which we call the shared environment or the the open environment, the general environment or something like that."
"Unknown","01;34;30;26","01;35;26;09","And so we have this sense of a a social grouping of similar entities that are commonly exposed to this vastly dissimilar entity with which we don't share a common language. Oh, and we're not very good at predicting. Oh, and so on. And so we always have this kind of open systems point of view and of one of the functions of this vastly different system with which we don't share a common language is it's our free energy source and SEC so it's where we put our waste and it's, it's where we get our free energy for doing computation oh."
"Unknown","01;35;28;03","01;36;19;13","So I, I think it's interesting to think of all the situation of all kind of local synchrony or local entanglement or a local language community. All local shared predictability, all embedded in all this unpredictable chaotic and in a sense in principle chaotic because it's the waste them right. Now, we've assumed our priorities that we can't understand it because it's where we're putting all of our the thermodynamic entropy that we're creating now."
"Unknown","01;36;21;05","01;37;00;10","We've we've put ourselves in a conceptual bind almost automatically by being systems that have to generate this entropy and put it somewhere so I like this, this classical two quantum correspondence very much, and I think it works very nicely awesome. Mike Yeah. I want to I want to float an idea which is literally just a few days old, so it may be complete nonsense, but I'll float it anyway because I think it's, I think it's, it's relevant and I've been thinking about it this way."
"Unknown","01;37;00;17","01;37;22;14","It occurs to me that, you know, this binary distinction between there are agents, some of them like me, some of them different, maybe competitors, whatever. But there, there are some agents that I can communicate with or can I receive influence or signals from. And then and then there's this environment which is, you know, something that we assume or I mean, some, some cultures, of course, don't assume that."
"Unknown","01;37;22;14","01;37;55;25","But but we can assume that it has very low or zero agency, meaning that it just is this sort of dumb, purposeless universe, and it's on us to sort of figure out what it's doing right. So it occurs to me that, that that distinction maybe shouldn't be binary. And maybe what we want to be thinking about is as an agent, when you are receiving something from from what you think is the outside, you might want to estimate what is the agency on the other end for and you might want to do this for the following reason."
"Unknown","01;37;55;25","01;38;12;14","Right. And I started thinking about this by imagining what it would be like to be in an internal partition or a chunk of a giant neural net being trained. You know, you live if that's you, you live in a very mindful universe. You know, you could catch on to the fact that, you know what I'm being I'm being trained for something."
"Unknown","01;38;12;14","01;38;33;11","You know the world like there are bigger patterns here. And of course, it moves in inscrutable ways and everything because I can't you know, I can't sort of I can't understand the whole pattern of what's going on. But I can definitely tell that it's rewarding me and punishing me for specific behaviors. Right. And of course, some people do feel that way about the universe and by large that there are patterns that are that are not just you know, not quote unquote, just physics."
"Unknown","01;38;33;25","01;38;49;14","And so so the reason that the reason I think and this extends to, you know, we have supervised learning and unsupervised learning. And again, we think of those is kind of binary things, right? Is there some sort of intelligence on the other end telling you what's right and wrong or is it just on you to abstract patterns from the environment?"
"Unknown","01;38;49;25","01;39;12;16","And the reason I think this matters is that if if if if you are trying to learn from the environment, meaning there's only one agent involved, there's right there, that's you. There's one agent. And then there's this sort of unthinking universe around you. Then you are pretty much guaranteed that whatever whatever you can manage to infer to it will be to your utility."
"Unknown","01;39;12;16","01;39;33;19","It's on you to figure out, to learn whatever you can. If there's another agent on the other side and you are being trained right, then what are the odds that that agent has your best interests at heart? I mean, maybe, but maybe not. And so if this is some sort of supervised learning, you have to ask yourself, what is it that I'm being trained?"
"Unknown","01;39;33;19","01;39;55;08","And is it really what I what I want? Right. There's there's another there's it's kind of a whole thing that you can imagine evolutionarily that may be to avoid being hijacked. Bye bye, bye bye bye parasites. Bye bye, competitors. Bye. Whoever you don't really want to be trainable too much. You want to learn, but you don't really want to be trained."
"Unknown","01;39;55;16","01;40;22;27","And so maybe the idea then is that what if what if and this is OK, this is where, you know, I really haven't ever talked to anybody about this yet. So this is this again could be a very immature stuff. But but what if something like back propagation or whatever, what if that literally hurts? What if as a as a right, as an early creature having some sort of error function forced back through your channels as opposed to whatever you were trying to generate yourself?"
"Unknown","01;40;23;06","01;40;47;16","What if that's evolutionarily designed to be unpleasant? And what if what you're trying to do is avoid that happening? You don't want to be trained. You want to learn on your own terms. And you could sort of imagine the different layers of a feedforward artificial neural network where the like the initial input layer that that sort of creature gets to see the world, quote unquote, as it is."
"Unknown","01;40;47;16","01;41;03;16","It gets the raw inputs the next layer and certainly the layers past that, you know, the ones on the right that are abstracting, they're getting all kinds of propaganda filtered to them by the early layers you know, they don't get to see the real inputs. They get to see whatever the pre of the prior layers think they should be seeing."
"Unknown","01;41;04;00","01;41;29;08","And and so maybe if you don't have a flat network like this, but maybe what you have is a, you know, more biologically, you have a kind of a nested multi scale kind of system. Maybe there's some sort of incentive for the middle layers to try to sort of crawl leftward so that they have more raw access to the real world and not be trapped being being fed by these other agents."
"Unknown","01;41;29;08","01;41;53;05","Right. So again, you know, this is all very qualitative stuff, but you get the idea that's that's kind of what, what, what what I was thinking about the in and then there Mike, if you want to chat about this, this is what I was doing for about ten years unleashing and getting out of the lab and getting passed to a model."
"Unknown","01;41;53;05","01;42;29;15","So perhaps we should add about this for a bit. A can I just a couple of things, Chris. First of all, thank you for I feel like I've come away with a Munich stone volume worth of of coolness for the last two weeks since listening to explain these really complex, complicated things to me in ways that I can actually understand one of the things that I'm I'm still kind of curious about is once we let things out of the lab and we keep them in that variability retains space."
"Unknown","01;42;30;26","01;43;10;10","And we're and we don't want to be in conflict with sort of the basic rules of of what kind of information tells us. I want to kind of go back for one second to what Steven was kind of closing the 40.1 with and that is what do we do? And we look at things in that sort of relational realm that a lot of indulgent indigenous cultures sort of take up and try to find themselves within and kind of leading to this idea that there's there's a sort of a subject matter generalist that leads to a prediction matter expert down the road."
"Unknown","01;43;10;10","01;43;48;25","And I, I talked to Carl. I have it was my question to Carl back in June when he was talking to us in the active inference lab. And so without getting into any kind of conflict with the quantum aspects of this, what, what, what do we take out with, with us when we go on a bike ride with, with Chris Fields, that's that's quantum related, that isn't in conflict with everything we've talked about today, but gives us a better confidence around the things that we might encounter and predict what do you take on your bike, Chris?"
"Unknown","01;43;50;11","01;44;55;26","Yeah. What's in your quiver yeah. Good question of know once again, these these theoretical frameworks are languages and they their role is to shape our concepts or they're they are ways of shaping our concepts. And of I think the fundamental kind of lesson of quantum theory for us is to not take the boundaries we see. Oh, as literally as we're encouraged to do."
"Unknown","01;44;55;26","01;45;48;23","And the classical worldview, I'll try to distinguish the classical world view from classical physics, because classical physics by itself, again, going back to someone local place of is a physics of, of atoms which are, which are, you know, sort of elemental oh, it's not a physics of bounded macroscopic objects. The boundaries, even in classical physics, are sort of arbitrary and I, I think that's what quantum theory is trying to tell us to, is trying to tell us that these, these are boundaries that we draw on our blankets."
"Unknown","01;45;49;22","01;46;36;18","And I think this is in a sense what our thinking about the FP is trying to tell. It's not that we have to take this notion that we're blanketed entities seriously when we think about what we're interacting with, which is, you know, everything but us Daniel in our closing minutes, if we could just each give a thought, this is really just a special and very powerful conversation, Mike, with back propaganda, amazing thought experiment there."
"Unknown","01;46;38;05","01;47;02;17","And no boundary and quantum questions touching on the work of like Ken Wilbur. And I think it's just so powerful about does someone have the whole world in their hands? Is that a good person? Is it a bad person or thing? What kind of thing is that? Who's on the other side of this video call? Who's on the other side of that other side?"
"Unknown","01;47;03;09","01;47;33;01","What's the bigger picture? And it really brings it home that, no, it's not just about electrons. This is something that is across scales and systems. So really just want to appreciate the paper and hope that we continue on this line of developments. And I'll pass to Stephen Thanks, Daniel. Yeah, I was going to tie this a little bit."
"Unknown","01;47;33;10","01;48;09;12","Some of the threads with this challenge of having this false sense of certainty in our culture and how it does feel uncomfortable to be trained, but we do it in the West because we're confident that we've got this expert knowledge, but then we suddenly find that we don't know as much as we do know or we think we know so that may be why bottom up so organic, indigenous kind of ways of being or ways a sense in can feel more holistic so I think there might be something quite powerful in that."
"Unknown","01;48;09;12","01;48;44;08","So I like that comment and I think that ties together with the challenges in practice. When we try to train up community, especially if we're working, say we've, I've worked in rural Africa and the communities that if I don't feel connected to the, the colonizing narrative, it feels very oppressive. So there's, you know, there's a lot of good points there around where is there coherence, where is this decoherence and also where's the certainty and where there's uncertainty."
"Unknown","01;48;44;08","01;49;07;23","So thanks this is really helpful. And then I'll pass it over to Blue Well, I've said enough. I think I'd like to hear from Mike or Carl or Chris about where where you're going or what you're taking away, or what are your final thoughts about the discussion we've had over the last couple of weeks."
"Unknown","01;49;10;09","01;49;29;05","I mean, I guess I guess the only thing I say is that to me, I really like this idea that it turns on its head. There's this notion that that you have this, this, this massive amount of mindless stuff. And then somehow, you know, a little bit of mine shows up at the end that kind of turns it upside down."
"Unknown","01;49;29;05","01;49;48;20","And and if that's the case, then it becomes then the scaling problem is really, really interesting, right? Is how you scale, you know, how biology manages to scale these things so that they become synergistic, synergistic and bigger and bigger as opposed to, you know, just merely a bigger pile of rocks than than the previous pile of rocks. And so that right."
"Unknown","01;49;48;20","01;50;10;24","So so those those mechanisms and in particular in biology. And so, you know, I look at it from from cells getting together to be organisms and solving problems in the anatomical space. But but I think they're we actually have some pretty good alternative, although very, very, very similar in many ways. Isomorphic, but alternative stories to what happens in neuroscience to try to understand how that scaling actually works."
"Unknown","01;50;11;00","01;50;43;08","So I'm super I'm just super, super excited about that. And also the role of the observer in all of this and the idea that all of this is based on various observers observing each other. And I think that makes it makes for a lot of progress and fewer pseudo problems when you when you look at it that way, Carl or Chris, any final thought well, I'll just thank you guys again for putting this together."
"Unknown","01;50;43;08","01;51;26;09","I thought this was a fascinating conversation and, you know, if I fail to throw one more thing into it, I, I, I think conversations like this are, are evidence or oh, the, the kind of disciplinary civilization that's been forced onto us by academic tradition. Being an artifact and not necessarily being all that useful thanks so much, Carl. We're going to leave you with the final word go ahead."
"Unknown","01;51;26;09","01;51;55;03","Well, it has to be exciting because for you lot for putting this together and for the brilliant didactic and also challenging didactic unpacking of some really challenging, but I think revealing issues and also the brilliant questions. And my final word will be future pointing. I'm just taking off taking up the slate of questions. You know, having on siloed conversations is useful."
"Unknown","01;51;55;03","01;52;21;01","This think thinking about Mike having the balls to come out with his brand new hypothesis of two years or two days of my book. It's how I thought it was really interesting and just an example of putting things into this kind of discussion which we all can go and think about. So my immediate thought was how on earth does the second layer in a variational two encode or something doing backdrop act?"
"Unknown","01;52;22;08","01;52;47;12","And of course it can act if if it's a recurrent neural network and it can select which of the the low level neurons or hidden that as I know, are not hidden lab units to listen to. And of course we come back again exactly to attention and selecting those sources of precise information where you've got a kind of internal action."
"Unknown","01;52;47;19","01;53;12;27","So it's an interesting and silly thought, but just a nice example of how talking together can excite interesting and potentially useful or possibly silly. So any thoughts? But again, thank you. Wonderful. I had a great time observing all of you and hope to get to do more of it in the future. Yep, we can have a dart three any time."
"Unknown","01;53;13;09","01;53;31;15","Consider 40 in the interim measurement interval while our Argus is digesting and talk to you all soon. Thanks again. Thanks very much everyone. Thank you. Bye bye. Bye. It's great."
