"Unknown","00;00;11;14","00;00;38;18","All right. Hello and welcome, everyone. It's March. 17th. 2022. We're here in Acton. Five live stream number 40.1 discussing a free energy principle for generic quantum systems. Welcome to the Acton Flat. We're a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference. This is recorded in an archived live stream so please provide us with feedback so we can improve our work."
"Unknown","00;00;39;04","00;01;06;13","All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here. All Q RF and video etiquette for Livestream will be hopefully following to learn more about Active Lab. Head over to active inference dot org and for the rest of active stream. 40.1 on blue. Thanks for being the facilitator so. So in this stream today, our goal is to learn and discuss this paper."
"Unknown","00;01;06;24","00;01;32;09","We're going to do principle for generic quantum systems. Bakersfield Ecosystem, James Facebook and Michael Levin, and we have both Chris and Carl on the stream with us today. So we want to just start off briefly with doing some introductions. So my name is Blue Knight. I'm an independent researcher in New Mexico and I will pass it off to the first of all, Chris."
"Unknown","00;01;34;08","00;02;01;27","Hi. Good morning and thanks for attending this discussion. This is a paper about active inference and how to place the active inference framework in a quantum information theoretic setting. So what I thought I should do to introduce it is just give a little bit of the motivation for doing that."
"Unknown","00;02;05;01","00;02;44;21","Quantum information theory is an outgrowth of quantum theory that started in the seventies or or even you can take it back to the sixties if you wanted to. And its goal was to consider physical interactions as information exchange processes and to reformulate quantum theory in this way. And so it has a very natural kind of overlap with what Carl has been doing with the free energy principle in terms of of reformulating physics."
"Unknown","00;02;44;24","00;03;56;08","So essentially all of physics and information and decision theoretic terms. So why, why quantum theory? Why go to this theory that's often thought of as a theory only of very tiny objects that are moving very fast. And the reason is that it's scale free of and conceptually, quantum theory is very simple and it has one core hypothesis, which is the the principle of unitary and the principle of unitary is simply the idea that total information is conserved of so quantum theory is based on a conservation law, a proposed conservation law, conservation of information so what going to quantum theory really forces this to do is to take seriously the project that Carl spent a lot"
"Unknown","00;03;56;08","00;04;39;01","of time on in his particular physics paper in 2019 which is to understand what we mean when we say that we've observed a system multiple times. What we mean when we say we've interacted with the same object multiple times and it forces us to, or at least it encourages us to take that question seriously. And it provides a number of tools for talking about that question and we'll talk about that as we get into the paper."
"Unknown","00;04;40;12","00;05;10;12","But now that's in a sense our motivations to take this. Oh, very nice. Quite abstract. Oh, but in a sense, very fundamental toolkit that's based around the idea of conservation of information and apply it to this question of of active inference. So I'll let Carl pick it up from there."
"Unknown","00;05;16;29","00;05;50;15","But thank you. It's a great pleasure to be here. I have to say, I was hoping for a bit of a background, so it's a great opportunity from my point of view to hear a conversation of the participants in terms of how it's controlled scale. Three background. That's what I think is one of the most attractive and parsimonious benefits of taking a quantum perspective on this."
"Unknown","00;05;50;15","00;06;36;19","And so reminds people of looking at landscape. The assumption which I'm always drawn to and apply this to some fundamental questions which have actually been beautifully listed for us at the top here about things. So crucially how things coupled to other things in terms of measurement and observation. So I personally delighted and hungry to learn about how simple questions about the nature of things will we observe, measure and make inference about can be kept this fundamental in this fundamental or from this fundamental perspective, of quantum information."
"Unknown","00;06;36;28","00;06;58;21","We very nice. Thank you, James. Thanks for joining us. Would you like to introduce yourself and maybe say a few words about the paper or pick it up from there? Well, hello, you may call me Jim. Thank you."
"Unknown","00;07;01;14","00;08;00;23","You want you want a potted biography, do you? Anyway, I'm a retired academic and emeritus professor of Eastern Illinois University and adjunct associate professor the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and my background is global analytic geometry and some related areas. But in the last 617 years, I've been applying mathematical techniques to cognitive neuroscience and foundations of math, quantum biology, and more recently, quantum information as it relates to the free energy principle thank you, Stephen."
"Unknown","00;08;00;23","00;08;34;10","Do you want to maybe introduce yourself and give a thought about the papers, something you might remember? And I was curious about today. Yeah. Thank you. Hi, I'm Stephen Smith. I'm based in Toronto, and we just did a practice based, based social topographies and Community Development, and I had both backgrounds many years ago in chemistry. And I'm really curious about the way that this idea of some of scale three also ties somebody who seems to be very specific on scale."
"Unknown","00;08;34;20","00;09;09;16","I wear something that's highly contextual and highly bounded by degrees of freedom at a certain scale, and then how something could be inferred that's across all sorts of styles. So that's really excited. I'm curious about this particular piece of work great. Thanks. So do you have any other particular address or just looking forward to seeing the discussion? And anyone who's watching live can ask a question."
"Unknown","00;09;09;16","00;09;58;15","So I'm curious about how also, like Stephen said, the specificity of a given experiment interfaces with general aspects of the formalism and many other things. But we'll go go ahead though. Do you want to maybe start there? Do you guys want to speak to that scale deterministic aspect of the quantum Occupy hopefully I can say something here any information theory will start with some state space so some set of degrees of freedom that have some set of values."
"Unknown","00;09;59;29","00;10;39;06","And in the paper we restrict ourselves to finite state spaces because we're really interested in systems that only have access to finite energy. And so finite computational resources so one starts with a state space and in a sense the state space of when viewed from kind of the external perspective of the theorist whose defining it sets the scale, the problem of because in defining the state space, you're saying what the values are of the degrees of freedom."
"Unknown","00;10;40;12","00;11;28;29","And when you say what are the possible values, you are implicitly making some assumptions about resolution. So and making some assumptions about measurement. So for example, if we think about the canonical quantum system, which is a qubit just one, a particle with a spin of and we say the spin can be up or down then we've made an assumption about how how we can measure the spin and the most natural mathematical framework is a three dimensional ball of values or a sphere of values if you normalize them all."
"Unknown","00;11;29;05","00;11;34;22","And that's making an assumption that we can measure the spin in any one of three directions."
"Unknown","00;11;38;08","00;12;19;28","And so here we have imposed some possible values on this on this set of degrees of freedom. And so in a sense, we've set a scale for the problem of some of them. Really, if we're talking about interactions between human beings, well, clearly there are lots and lots of degrees of freedom that we can think of, but we typically think about only a tiny handful of degrees of freedom that have to do, for example, with verbal communication or visual communication or factory communication or some other kind of communication."
"Unknown","00;12;20;21","00;13;09;03","Then we always impose resolution restrictions. We can say this difference is detectable and these other differences aren't detectable. And whenever we make a decision like that, we're setting a scale. And when we characterize the information theory as scale three, we're just saying that the formal is doesn't change when the scale changes oh. So the formalism, the mathematical description remains exactly the same regardless of what scales we pick by choosing the possible values of the degrees of freedom that we're talking about, we don't change anything else about the way the theory works."
"Unknown","00;13;10;06","00;14;01;22","So that's that's all one scale free means. It doesn't mean that we've somehow abolished the notion of scale of that's part of our experience. So it's not something we're going to make go away. It's that we haven't changed the way the math works depending on the notion of scale. And, you know, the most the most notable previous example of that thing that we're not doing is the historical division of the world into kind of a quantum domain, a classical domain in the cosmological domain where you use three entirely different theories like quantum theory, classical physics and general relativity to talk about what's going on."
"Unknown","00;14;02;01","00;14;41;04","So that's not scale free there. You're you're radically altering the mathematical description to deal with different kinds of problems so that's what we're not doing, trying to use the same mathematical description to deal with all problems I think that's a really helpful description for us because so many times when we think about quantum, we think about the very, very, very small subatomic particles and so it's pretty amazing to see math that's interchangeable with my level of existence."
"Unknown","00;14;41;04","00;15;25;17","Like not just tiny little pieces of me being used from from quantum theory. What is there any other math that you know of or any other examples of math that's been interchangeable with classical and cosmology? And quantum scales ever before? Or is this maybe the first time that's ever been done so well know, if you look if you look back to all classical physics in the era of Newton or even I think the better representative is is classical physics is reformulated by Laplace in that area."
"Unknown","00;15;26;10","00;15;35;05","Electromagnetism wasn't really understood yet. So people were thinking about classical physics in terms of mechanical interactions and gravity."
"Unknown","00;15;37;14","00;16;18;06","But the idea at that point was that forces act instantaneously and forces of act with one over our squared dependance. That was the only force that was really understood. The force of gravity of forces were symmetrical. Right. Newton's second law, action and reaction and this theory was meant to be universal and so if you look at the structure of that theory, as various people have pointed out, Nicholas Dyson has written a couple of papers about this."
"Unknown","00;16;19;12","00;16;53;10","So it's an all local theory. And even even in the classes era, they realized that there is a deep issue with this theory that, you know, if a rock rolls downhill on the moon, then that immediately affects the state of everything on earth, in fact, immediately affects the state of everything in the universe. So that starts to look a lot like entanglement that states are not locally independent of."
"Unknown","00;16;54;02","00;18;09;10","And that that's the fundamental thing that Einstein attacked about classical physics in formulating the theory of relativity was to insist on non instantaneous forces, which just means forces transmitted by some carrier which we call light but light is really just a carrier of information. It could have been the neutrinos or something like that. Of so what Einstein did that was most revolutionary was to impose locality on physics and all of that in a sense, divided the world into realms that from a formal perspective, not just a practical perspective, could be treated independently and so it's no surprise that Einstein hated the idea of entanglement because entanglement was undoing precisely what he had done to, in"
"Unknown","00;18;09;13","00;18;43;17","his mind, repair physics so yeah, I mean, classical physics of the time of applause was formerly a scale free theory that's awesome. Thank you for the clarification there. So Einstein Einstein broke physics student. Did you have a question? Yeah, just just one question. So following from that is someone sort of thinking about how this might play out in other ways?"
"Unknown","00;18;43;26","00;19;22;23","Is it useful to think about things all the way up from the smallest and systems, all the way up, down from the biggest and classical it's been when they were trying to name things as systems so that is often I hear people talking systems, systems, systems only, but the use of things seems to be important as well. And I'm wondering if we should have seen this in our way of looking at the world oh, sure."
"Unknown","00;19;22;23","00;20;08;22","Correct. Yeah, OK. OK, well, this I think you're raising here a really interesting question. And so when we talk about things as as whole so beautifully emphasized in his 2019 paper we are implicitly talking about something that has an identity and that maintains that identity through time. And that's a deep philosophical assumption that's nearly always implicit. I mean people just don't talk about that assumption very much."
"Unknown","00;20;10;11","00;20;44;23","And when we, when we use the word system, we're I think often trying to speak a lot more loosely. But in fact our language doesn't let us speak more loosely if I talk about a system, then implicitly I'm saying I've got a particular state space. That's what a system is and if they talk about a different state space, then I'm talking about a different system."
"Unknown","00;20;46;07","00;21;19;29","So let's apply that to something interesting like embryology. Oh, I pick a set of degrees of freedom that are meant to be the degrees of freedom of the zygote. And of I then you know, a few days later have a set of degrees of freedom that are the degrees of freedom of some kind of early stage embryo but I want to say this is the same thing as the zygote."
"Unknown","00;21;20;27","00;22;17;16","Well, I'm now really abusing my notation, right? In a really serious way by saying that these two are the same thing, even though they have different state spaces. So of this is a I think this is a fundamental question for any science that bases itself on the notion of a state space, how to talk about moving between in different degrees of freedom and associating those things with with some kind of revolution of of a kind of metal thing that we regard as a single entity."
"Unknown","00;22;18;27","00;23;05;13","And this is this is one reason that at the beginning of this paper, we assumed that we have some single system that we divide into we draw a decompositional boundary. And the Decompositional boundary is basically arbitrary or it's completely arbitrary. But when we're we're doing something like embryology, we're looking at a decompositional boundary between the thing we're interested in the embryo and the rest of the universe, including us, that's getting bigger and bigger and bigger and oh, so we need it."
"Unknown","00;23;05;14","00;23;52;26","We need a way to talk about that sort of thing. And we just we applied that problem in this paper we we talk about a fixed decomposition. Oh, that that divides the entire universe. Into two parts that we can characterize the interaction between. But yes, underlying all of this is this much larger question of how we think about decompositional boundaries that are expanding with respect to some parameter that we call time and of course, that time is not any one's observable time because we're we're trying to talk about it at the level of the universe as a whole."
"Unknown","00;23;54;13","00;24;23;06","So we very quickly get into extremely deep questions so two things that came up there really for me is like, OK, you're thinking about the embryo. Suddenly that's like a system that's separate from one. But even like within the embryo, like where do you draw the line between the placenta and the embryo and when? So so like there's even some fuzzy blurring at the developmental scale."
"Unknown","00;24;23;17","00;24;53;02","And also really the notion of of time and time irreversibility and memory and encoding was just something I found absolutely fascinating about this paper. So so you mentioned that the quantum, the three energy principle for generic quantum systems does not imply like a spacetime background, like it doesn't need a spacetime background to operate, but then like brought time back in in terms of memory and encoding."
"Unknown","00;24;53;19","00;25;05;17","And I just wonder if if anybody maybe wants to speak a little bit more about that or help us understand how and why you don't need space or time for to work hmm."
"Unknown","00;25;15;18","00;25;41;27","I could talk about that a little bit if no one else wants to pick it up. OK, let me go back to the first thing you said, which was about boundaries and how hard it is, for example, to draw boundaries in something like embryology. Oh, there's another deep, deep assumption that we make that the boundaries that we draw on the world are somehow ontological or objective and observer, independent."
"Unknown","00;25;42;29","00;26;15;23","And so quantum theory and many other sort of theoretical approaches remind us constantly that that's a bad assumption that, oh, drawing, thinking of these boundaries, this object causes all kinds of formal problems. So for example, the associated beauty of the state space multiplication operator becomes invalid. So you can you have to throw out the whole vector space for this."
"Unknown","00;26;17;05","00;27;05;09","Oh, so I mean real problems of so, so boundaries are observer dependent and any formalism like this. So what do we mean by this universal time? It's a construct. It's, it's a theoretical convenience. And we map it on to our observable time, which is time measured by our clock. And since we're, we're the theorists, we can say, OK, we're going to privilege our clock and we're going to assume that our clock is somehow universal, even though we know that that doesn't make any sense."
"Unknown","00;27;13;04","00;28;03;14","And when we think of space time, I mean, the term background free comes from cosmology or quantum cosmology. And it's the idea that if we want to understand gravity or if we want to understand space time as an emergent phenomena, then we need a theoretical approach that doesn't build spacetime into it. But if we think of biology of how many organisms, what fraction of organisms have anything like our experience of space, to what extent is space part of the world of organisms that we're interested in?"
"Unknown","00;28;05;01","00;28;43;00","And to what extent is space as we see it, a construct of our ability to make certain kinds of measurements. And then in a strict quantum theoretic formalism, time is not an observable but distance is. So it's an observable like any other. So in a in a very strict sense, quantum theory is not a mechanical theory because it's not really about things going on in an independent space time."
"Unknown","00;28;51;10","00;29;18;13","Event to do with question. Yeah, I'd just like to comment on I say thanks for reference in State Spaces Systems. I think that's really helpful because I've been wrestling with this dynamical part of systems, which is really helpful to think in dynamics. But most or a lot of people, when they talk about systems, they just think about relationships between things and system dynamics."
"Unknown","00;29;18;13","00;29;47;21","I just flows as if it's like things being passed around rather than dynamical processes. So I think it's helpful to think about state space in that way to frame systems. And I'm, I'm just, yeah, I'm curious about how we have to be careful about people who use systems in those other ways and don't have a dynamic or concept of something which is linear."
"Unknown","00;29;48;06","00;30;08;23","Being taken into account is that it seems to be something that this approach really gives the ability to do so one way. Your thoughts on that Carl? Would you like to say something to that?"
"Unknown","00;30;10;28","00;30;11;03","Yeah."
"Unknown","00;30;15;03","00;30;39;24","Yeah, I'm not sure it's going to be deeply informed. So I'm as I'm listening, I'm sort of trying to translate all these beautiful ideas into a classical framework that I'm much more comfortable with. So the last point is on the classical perspective, absolutely fundamental. I mean, you start with a large valve or a random dynamical system that is just cast in terms of flow operators or movement operators."
"Unknown","00;30;40;09","00;31;05;12","That you can fix with time if you want to. But just to reinforce Chris's point, you know, time and space are both constructs and they're just explanations for what? Well, for these flow operators. So if they're slow operators have a dynamics, then implicitly you've got a rate of change with respect to something, which is time. But that's quite a big move."
"Unknown","00;31;06;09","00;31;36;10","And so putting things in terms of mappings I think is absolutely fundamental. So Steve, your point was that when you need to think about systems make processes or systems from the point of view of mappings usually associated some time. I get the impression from working with Chris and Jim that you know that there is an order level sequential aspect."
"Unknown","00;31;36;10","00;32;00;26","So just coming back to the question, where did memory get into the game? You know that there has to be, there has to be, there can still be sequences or sets of things that have to constitute a memory, but it doesn't have to have the attribute of of time in the sense that we would understand a flow from the point of view of a differential equation."
"Unknown","00;32;01;10","00;32;40;06","So I'd like to have the I'd like to hear some of Chris and Jim's comments on that while I'm talking, though, just the importance of time as a construct, it does strike me that, you know, that takes there's a lot of heavy lifting if we just abandon the notion of some universal clock time in relation to what I would from a classical perspective, read the scale free aspect of but I'm thinking here of the re normalization group."
"Unknown","00;32;40;24","00;33;22;17","So I'm interested to know if you know and I'm sure there is if there is a renomination group or the apparatus of the Republican Action Group in quantum physics. But from my perspective, that, that that notion of having a scale free approach is exactly what is the aspiration of any and in particular, the free energy principle approach would have when trying to account for the progressive increase in the scale of a system, but preserving exactly the same dynamics, the same Lagrangian is the same."
"Unknown","00;33;22;17","00;33;53;12","So again, from a classical perspective, the same the same functional forms for the the things that are concerned. So to reiterate Chris's fundamental point earlier on that we're not talking about a commitment to a particular scale, very, very small or very, very big. What we're talking about is a commitment to the same functional forms and the apparatus and the mathematics that underwrite the know the dynamics, if you like, on at any given scale."
"Unknown","00;33;53;21","00;34;24;06","And then that calls that into question how would you get from one scale to the other? And I would add one thing that sort of jumps out to you when you when you look at the are the reorganization group in relation to summarizing dynamics of random differential systems, is that you get this time dilation or this you move from one scale to another time scale."
"Unknown","00;34;25;06","00;34;51;24","So I'm I'm coming back to the point that, you know, when you talk about time, what scale, what scale, what time are you talking about? Are you talking about evolutionary time? Are you talking about, you know, the time that the fetus is enjoying its mother's womb or are you talking about the time scale appropriate for the the fluxes of ions or your cell membrane?"
"Unknown","00;34;52;25","00;35;22;15","So the deeper question here is how does 11 time relate to another of the people that I know who are interested in this issue from the point of view of the perception of time or time as a construct usually fall back on information rights. They usually fall back on the the rate of belief updating or the amount to which you have moved in some public space, typically statistical manifold."
"Unknown","00;35;23;17","00;35;49;28","From a classical point of view, I think you say rate with respect to what I consider some time at which time and what you end up where you end up as well. OK, I can't talk about any absolute information rate, but I can certainly talk about the number of moves I make at one scale per number of moves, I make it another scale."
"Unknown","00;35;50;23","00;36;53;27","Even we could be doing that in our heads. You know, when we very high scales say from the point of view of a generative model in our hands, dealing with things that unfold very slowly in relation to fast updating much closer to our sensory organs or actuators, and that it does make sense to actually talk about how much of I'd move, how far have I moved in terms of an information that in my belief, updating in and at a higher level of a hierarchy or a higher scale in relation to the so the number of moves or how far I have moved so OK, now that's what I'm doing little we got somebody chatting away."
"Unknown","00;36;53;29","00;37;25;00","That's all good. Jim, do you want to mute if you're have background noise please OK. Or you can just it'll be it'll be muted on watching OK, continue. Please continue. Oh my. That little response was very rambling because there are so many just I come out of the house so I have 20 minutes. I want to pass that to Chris and Jim."
"Unknown","00;37;25;00","00;38;50;10","Now you step up to get their take on how comfortable they would be by taking the notions of normalization group as applied to integral formulations in candidates and systems, and whether that has any hammerlock or any currency and a truly background free quantification now I don't know well, basically I think what Carl is proposing concerning the re normalization group and of course there is something to be investigated and but I mean consonant with the call concerning the aspect of memory from the informational point of view and may I speak about the specifics of our construction, namely the cone cone diagram which then benefits a distributed Yeah, I'll be there."
"Unknown","00;38;50;11","00;39;04;29","Hello. Yep. Continue. Jim, I think if you could mute or just. Yeah, yeah, that's all good."
"Unknown","00;39;07;02","00;40;24;18","We're going to be looking at the cone co cone maybe just Chris or Carl. You can give a first pass. Like, what is this being shown? And also, how does it relate to active inference oh, hello. OK, welcome back to continue with the question uh, local distraction. Um, yes. OK, well now you see at the beginning of the paper when we discussed discussed the holographic screen which underlies the mock blanket you have and these preparation measurement operations which feed into the diagram diagram 14 of which the lower part emanating from the prime is a memory write system so as the the top part is picking up information from the measurement and preparation operations and there"
"Unknown","00;40;24;18","00;41;15;04","is a memory rights system being implemented from the opposite direction. And one thing I would like to say about the individual classifier files that we haven't sort of fully mentioned in the paper that an individual classifier can be the result of an algebraic operation on onto other classifiers. These algebraic operations can be of the types such as concurrency and or also currents."
"Unknown","00;41;15;12","00;42;10;08","For example, when you have a system of trains going through a system of stations and the the classifiers in question can be combined to that extent and also by choice. So I think the scope for what is happening informationally in diagram 14 is quite significant and the originally two spaces were applied to such areas as as concurrency and higher dimensional automata and and also we can look at the possible possible Ristic case."
"Unknown","00;42;10;29","00;42;58;11","And there are ways of interpreting diagram 14 in terms of the graph network two. So I know this doesn't exactly answer Karl's questions, but I want to say that there is the mechanism there for the memory. Right? So and this is of course influential when you see that active inference leads to minimizing the variational free energy principle that if you have any questions about those diagrams, please ask me."
"Unknown","00;42;59;04","00;43;02;25","Perhaps Chris can elaborate on what I'm saying."
"Unknown","00;43;07;11","00;44;15;15","Well, let me make a background comment here of which in a sense goes to one reason that we're using this quantum theoretic formalism. If we if we think of everything in terms of, of, of a quantum theoretic formalism and instead of a classical formalism, then the only place that there is any classical information in this system is actually on the boundary between the two interacting components so of the original, I don't know whether it's figure one or the, the, the very original idea in the paper is that we, we have some closed system which we can think of as the universe as a whole or the universe of interest as a whole."
"Unknown","00;44;16;12","00;44;48;12","And it's in some quantum state and if we divided into two and we make the assumption that the joint state after the division is separable, that we've divided it in a place where the interaction of the system with itself is weak enough that we can think of the two hands independently of the two components independently, then we have this natural sense of classical information written on that boundary."
"Unknown","00;44;48;22","00;45;55;25","And that's the sense of classical information that one encounters in the holographic principle in cosmology. And it's it's in that sense of classical encoding that this boundary serves as a Markov blanket. But since the boundary is the only locus anywhere of classical information in this formal description, then any classical memory has to be resident on that boundary and of this actually brings to mind a picture which was not included in this paper, but that I'm using in a subsequent paper with Mike Lovett, which really is is just thinking of this boundary using a pie chart and as we pointed out in this paper of another kind of classical information is the classical free energy flow"
"Unknown","00;45;56;14","00;46;32;16","that powers information processing. So this this actually isn't the right picture, but oh, and so one can immediately carve off a large chunk of the boundary and say, OK, this is just thermodynamic exchange. These bits aren't useful to anybody. Of they're they're the bits that are being used burned as power. Yeah. This is a better picture for that of and then there's a chunk of the pie chart that we can think of as perception."
"Unknown","00;46;32;16","00;47;00;10","And another chunk of the pie chart that we can think of as action. But then some other piece of the pie chart has to be allocated to memory or there's no internal time, right? Having an internal clock and having a memory are the same concept if I don't have any memory at all, then I have no awareness of the passing of time and I have no internal clock."
"Unknown","00;47;01;27","00;47;37;18","So when Jim talks about that, our previous current co current diagram. Oh, a memory right operation. It's a memory right. Operation on the boundary. And of course the the opposite partner in the interaction oh my memory segment of the boundary from my point of view. Oh, might be my partner's perceptions segment of the boundary or might overlap with my partner's perception segment of the boundary."
"Unknown","00;47;37;27","00;48;13;00","I have no idea how my interaction partner cuts up the boundary from their point of view, so. Oh this is yeah, that, that's what this picture sort of illustrates. Oh, so this question of, of what is the memory also becomes observer independent, which, which gets back to this question of time. The relationship of time to a local clerk, the relationship of a local clock to memory."
"Unknown","00;48;14;01","00;48;56;21","So whenever we talk about time as observed by someone, oh, we're making reference to a local clock and a memory resource and of course an energy flow that powers that memory resource and prevents it from decay. Oh, and tropically. So this we keep circling back to this abstraction of the universal time. The parameter rises, the universal dynamics. Oh, but you know, this this formalism, like any such formalism, requires that concept as a theoretical construct."
"Unknown","00;48;57;24","00;49;10;22","But at least it doesn't confuse it with the, the experienced type of any particular observer which has to be representative. It's very different in this very distinct way."
"Unknown","00;49;12;29","00;49;40;29","On some things. So I think that is a perfect segway into a question that was asked by France. Such thing in the live chat. And also Mike Levin has joined us. I don't know if he's able to talk. He says it's having some Internet issues. Mike, did you want to say hello? Before I ask this question, if you can mm."
"Unknown","00;49;42;09","00;50;07;09","OK, I'll ask the question and then we'll see if Mike figures out how to unmute and say hi. So Brian's asks, how does the definition of a thing that maintains its identity over time scale with time scales or over scale with time scale? So how does the definition of a thing and its identity over time scale with time scales well, I still don't get it."
"Unknown","00;50;07;22","00;51;02;11","For example, I would call something a thing if it persisted for some time with respect to my observational time scale. So in other words, can quantum theory say something about how to set temporal observer limited boundaries of defining a thing? There's a lot in there I guess. So how is the definition of one? First off, blue. Yeah, we see many ways, some that are actually implicitly scale friendly or scale free, like the hierarchical parametric models in SPM, statistical parametric modeling that's separating like in a multi scale experimental design from an experimentalists perspective into signal and noise, including the combinatorial interactions in a classical parametric state space."
"Unknown","00;51;02;22","00;51;29;22","And there's also the Bayesian identification of parameters, which also is just as was brought up scale implies choosing what the state space is. And so what statistical variance gets partitioned into the noise term or the kind of ripple term and what gets partitioned into the wave term, into the signal, into the regression slope rather than the variance term."
"Unknown","00;51;30;04","00;52;19;29","These kinds of variance partitioning questions can be approached in a instantaneous sense like descriptive statistics, even if it's about time series. And I think a theme that we're hearing brought up is that taking repeated measurements seriously brings in a whole host of essentially cognitive features, like as well as information theoretic perspective dependance all of these features that are tucked under the rug or down projected onto in a special case, if we just assume a synchronous universe or a synchronous regression, it's a totally different scenario."
"Unknown","00;52;20;21","00;53;09;13","But considering this quantum statistical background helps us deal with the cognitive modeling and also take the consequences of action and into account because action is implied in the measurement, preparation, recording, experimental or active inference cycle it was just so subtle in the paper. We said all inference in the scheme is active inference, but the paper was about quantum and the FP so thanks for that bounce off what that you just said very quickly, there is a sense I think, about the nature of action."
"Unknown","00;53;09;20","00;53;58;06","I thought I was so I thought that you just mentioned that ties in with this is if memory happens via that being some action and then the action defines the memory scale. There's some I think that makes that that that starts to define a scale. So I'm curious that if there's something different between this the temporality of a thing maintaining its thinness and the sort of temporality of actions by systems of things, because I think things can only act to maintain their thinness, but they then if they start doing things with others, they become a system."
"Unknown","00;53;58;10","00;54;35;22","So I suppose you've got where, where that action still starts to come into the equation or am I mistaken there can I address that briefly? Oh, well, I think a bit of the the relevant fable here is the symbol of the to drugs who are walking home from the bar, leaning on each other, and if they're lucky, they manage to keep each other upright oh yeah."
"Unknown","00;54;37;02","00;55;25;06","If if, if we, if we think of an observer in an environment and so we draw a boundary between the observer and the environment and we think about the observer's interaction with its total environment then we've divided the boundary up as we were talking about earlier into a pie chart where, you know, a large fraction of the bits are fuel, and so they're uninformative and there's a perception space in an action space and a memory space and so on."
"Unknown","00;55;27;29","00;56;04;16","Though, let's think about what happens when the observer identifies a thing embedded in the environment. So the observer has now segmented or centered the the perception part of the space into a part that includes bits that represent the state of this thing and the rest of the perception space, which are bits the represent the background that the thing is embedded in."
"Unknown","00;56;04;16","00;56;57;20","So the things in environment of and so the question becomes what does it mean to say that that thing remains but retains its thing as its identity over time for that observer oh well, that means that that observer is able to maintain this distinction between bits that communicate information about the thing, the bits that communicate information about the things, environment so this becomes a cognitive question about the observer so it's the question how does a thing maintain its identity?"
"Unknown","00;56;59;11","00;57;39;10","Is replaced in this way by the question, how does an observer of a thing maintain the things identity for himself or for itself? How does the observer of maintain the ability to lock in on this thing as distinct from the environment and of so let's let's go to an example, right? Think about motor babbling in an infant. So here is this infant she's lying her back."
"Unknown","00;57;40;14","00;58;15;19","She's waving her arms and legs around. And what she's doing in this motor babbling is figuring out the relationship between the motor system and the visual system. So among other things, she's figuring out that somehow that something that she sees some visual stimulus is actually part of her body. It's a hand and that at a certain moment she begins to be able to control what this hand is doing using visual and motor feedback."
"Unknown","00;58;17;00","00;58;57;08","So here's here's a living example of an observer of fixing the identity of an object and what we're trying to do here in a sense is use this as a is is to insist on thinking about being hood always in this observer specific way. So another psychologist raised his hand. So let me turn it over completely to him to carry on with or contested or give a different perspective no, I do."
"Unknown","00;58;57;08","00;59;28;28","I don't want to contest it. I want to fully endorse that. And if you just look at the free energy principle, as classically formulated, it is exactly along the lines of the the thing that's being an attribute of the observer. So if you just start off with the notion of a mark of blanket that really defines thing, does how is the mark of a blanket defined when it's defined by the conditional independence between the dynamics on the inside versus the outside?"
"Unknown","00;59;29;15","01;00;05;02","And of course, those dynamics are not observable once they're on the inside. From the outside by definition. And so you're immediately imputing some magical observer that could actually recognize that independence before you've even defined what a thing is. So I just wanted to tiptoe in in an abstract and possibly even philosophical way and reinforce this notion. That thing that's does, you know, is an attribute of something that could possibly observe it, even from the classical perspective."
"Unknown","01;00;05;07","01;01;01;15","Of the free energy principle predicated on the notion of a mark or blanket that is in turn defined in terms of conditional independence or disentanglement that example of the of motor babbling I think is again, a lovely illustration of observation underwriting thing. That's and in this instance, you're a highly anthropomorphic sized thing that's made with selfhood. You know, to, to develop the hypothesis or the explanation for my holographic screen or my all the information on my mark or blanket, that a plausible parsimonious explanation is that I am a thing, I am a self, I am me is actually, you know, takes months if not years to fully actually arrive at as you are an infant,"
"Unknown","01;01;01;15","01;01;25;08","slowly discovering that I am different from mom and perhaps mom is different from the back, her background, and ultimately perhaps I am something like mom. So yeah, there's the emergence of things I think is quintessentially observer dependent, both mathematically and in terms of developmental psychology."
"Unknown","01;01;31;03","01;02;10;00","Thank you oh, come on, Adam. So let's try to lower my hand. It does that by itself, I think. Oh, I love this technology, so maybe I will just put this back to Carl. Maybe you were talking earlier before Jim started talking about the rate of information flow and the rate of belief updating and so I just wonder, I'm thinking about this actually just in terms of human information."
"Unknown","01;02;10;00","01;02;32;28","Like, are we really bombarded with more information now than we used to be? And is this like influencing our rate of cultural change, cultural evolution? Because as a culture like to update our beliefs more often, do you think that these two things are proportional, the rate of information flow and the rate of belief updating so something I've been thinking about."
"Unknown","01;02;33;19","01;02;58;11","Yes. No, I'm sure that's absolutely right and right. I think at every scale of analysis. So you could look at it from a point of view of culture and the availability of information on social media and globalization as a cultural scale. You could also, I think, bring us back to motor babbling. You know, the degree of updating an infant has to do."
"Unknown","01;02;59;17","01;03;26;21","It's clearly going to be much greater than somebody of my age. So, you know, time will a year in the life of an infant will not be the same as a year in the life. I you know, I think that that is a direct reflection of the degree of belief updating. Interesting about that question touches upon the sort of separation of time scales, which I think underwrites everything that we're talking about here."
"Unknown","01;03;28;03","01;04;07;04","So, yeah, just stand step back again and go back to some of Chris's earlier observations about the the limits of the the paper in question. It was really at any given but not specified scale where we could assume that we didn't have to worry about the separation of time scales. From the point of view of a cognitive neuroscientist, for example, what we're talking about is inference, where inference in this instance would be read as a kind of reading and writing onto this holographic screen."
"Unknown","01;04;07;04","01;04;44;23","Or if you want to perspective the, you know, the updating of active and sensory states on them on the mark of Plunkett. But under the assumption that they're the other things that change at a slower timescale are not changing, and those other things might not be might be, for example, at a slower timescale, they might be learning. So you've got this notion that the formalism at hand, the reading and writing at hand, from the quantum information theoretic perspective could be a very good metaphor for inference."
"Unknown","01;04;45;06","01;05;11;08","You know, over a short time period, where there where things are not changing very quickly from the point of view of the things to be learned. So within the few seconds or minutes of the life of the zygote acknowledging that you could apply the same apparatus and the same mechanics at a slower timescale that would account for the transition from a zygote to it to annihilate as it learns."
"Unknown","01;05;11;18","01;05;39;01","So the difference between inference and learning, I think is is a nice commonsensical example of the separation of time timescales. So when you ask about cultural information available, I think you're probably talking about a scale of learning and absolutely, you know, when we learn, we update our beliefs. That will be from a classical perspective. It's testable manifold that holds those beliefs."
"Unknown","01;05;39;01","01;06;38;03","And we're literally moving over that. And with respect to another scale, and then the degree of belief update and the degree of asking questions, the degree of read writing will certainly be, you know, be a function of the amount of reading or writing that's going on. And I can imagine that somebody somebody who has access to Wikipedia on use of social media is doing a lot more read writing that I will say in the 1960s OK you moved but to me blue yes to you so Karl you made a fascinating point about connecting the motor babbling and taking it into the informational and the belief updating domain into the adults where we're a kind of"
"Unknown","01;06;38;03","01;06;42;11","motor babbling on social media in a way that has different dynamics than before."
"Unknown","01;06;44;29","01;07;06;17","And people often give the example of like, well, a year feels longer for a seven year old because it's a seventh of their life. But then for the eight year old, it's an eighth of their life. So that piece of the pie is smaller versus bigger, and that is implicitly the fallacy of the observer independent time, as if there was a linear chart that was being linearly divided by some static observer."
"Unknown","01;07;06;29","01;07;35;17","Whereas another way to look at that or an alternative model is like the rate of development or experiences or change or novelty or continue to explore and all of these different ways that all these muted on the left strips. That's all this that rate of belief updating could set that internal kairos, that biological time like that biological information geometry."
"Unknown","01;07;36;08","01;08;13;13","And so it connects the cognitive sciences and also the statistical perspectives that have been discussed to this time question, which as also brought up earlier, there's so much work in so-called dynamical modeling and it just makes me think about how there was a movement from the observer, independent, synchronous into the relativistic, which propelled poured in almost like prepared the partition to exist so that all these other domains, like the holographic principle, could come into play."
"Unknown","01;08;14;01","01;08;51;23","So my question for any of the authors is where does the Q R F come into play and how does this relate to discussion of pluralism and poly Central City ask the question Jim, did you answer? Well, um, I wonder if you can bring up a diagram there in the paper. Uh, let's see. Sure. Yes, it's diagram three for one."
"Unknown","01;08;51;23","01;10;20;01","There you have a configuration that relates the Q RF to the totalitarian diagrams. And we say here that that C and well, here we focus on co deployable observers when this diagram commutes and this is interesting, of course, when the diagram doesn't compute and then you have a kind of intrinsic, uh, context utility. So I think what this is saying is that and so there are certain elements of information represented by the logic of the distributed system in question that are kind of ambiguous or rather they're manifest in classifiers and infant Wolff isms that aren't defined or the code limits the bold C at the top there does not exist."
"Unknown","01;10;21;00","01;11;10;11","So this is a very useful criteria, I think, to distinguish between sort of empirical models, which the best part are based on co deployable variables and what happens when quantum context chirality occurs. That is diagram 34 doesn't compute so there is some sort of discrepancy there in the mechanism of the quantum reference frame relative to the dynamics of the Markov blanket or the holographic screen underlying it."
"Unknown","01;11;10;11","01;11;48;17","So there is some kind of distortion in meaning that results in this sort of intrinsic contextual 80 I don't know if that's a satisfactory answer at all, but when this breaks down, I haven't seen that before. It sounds good. I'm sorry, this is not local district it's all yours. But Chris, did you want to add on to that or make another comment?"
"Unknown","01;11;49;24","01;12;34;28","Oh, well, I wanted to go back a little bit to the basics of what a quantum reference frame is, because this is a concept that is both very familiar. And I think a little bit unfamiliar of the term was only coined back in the 1990s when, oh, the, the idea of, of a quantum measurement was associated with, with the idea of of the, the units in which the measurement is made."
"Unknown","01;12;34;28","01;13;15;14","And what are the requirements for of a measurement being meaningful. And we're going to get right back to the same issues we've been talking about with respect to time and thickness of, but a reference frame is just a way of giving meaning to an outcome and it's, it's what allows outcomes to be compared. So if I have an apparatus like a meter stick, I can go around and measure lengths."
"Unknown","01;13;16;20","01;13;55;02","And as long as I believe that my meter stick maintains its identity, as long as I believe that my meter stick remains the same thing, then I can compare the lengths that I measured. But if I don't believe my meter stick remains the same thing that I did these lengths comparisons are meaningless. So the notion of of a reference frame is is intimately tied up with this notion of meaning which in a in this free energy principle context is really a notion of actionability."
"Unknown","01;13;56;14","01;14;46;21","How can I use what something means to guide my actions in my decision making so of this notion of a cure f o becomes a notion of, of giving of giving an outcome value that I obtain and write in memory comparability with other outcome values that I maintain and write in memory and we're very used to as human beings, we have this incredibly complicated sensory inferential apparatus that involves many, many degrees of freedom and many, many values that are distinguished all."
"Unknown","01;14;47;05","01;15;17;17","So I think if we want to think about something like the role of, of reference frames in perception, it's it's better to think in terms of something like E coli oh. And of the so think of a much simpler kind of system that can measure fewer things by E coli to measure concentrations of salt and sugars of various kinds."
"Unknown","01;15;18;22","01;16;07;00","And those concentrations are meaningful to it. Those concentrations allow it to make decisions because its internal biochemistry assigns them an actionable meaning so of comfort taxes in E coli works all because the level of phosphorylation of a particular chemical remains reasonably constant. That's the reference frame and concentration levels can be compared to each other as long as that phosphorylation state remains reasonably constant, that reference frame is meaningful."
"Unknown","01;16;07;25","01;16;46;08","And so killer taxes make sense because e coli has, if you will, a slow clock o the phosphorylation state of g y of the signs that that confers meanings upon its outcomes so now we can spool back to what Jim was saying about co deployable reference frames of reference frames that I can use at the same time that I can obtain information from simultaneously have to commute."
"Unknown","01;16;47;02","01;17;21;06","This is what Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is about. Oh, and if I can't use them at the same time, it's because they don't compute. If I use them in different orders, I get different answers. And what that means is that by switching reference frames, I'm effectively changing the, the calibration, I'm effectively changing the meaning, the oversight and so I think that's a very beautiful place to see."
"Unknown","01;17;21;06","01;17;54;08","This is the paper, a paper that we reference here from Savanth Zephyr and several called the Snow Queuing Experiment. The paper is called of Snow Queen is Evil and Beautiful Oh came out a few years ago. And basically this paper is demonstrating quantum contextual and human decision making and it's doing it by exploiting differences, context dependent differences and the meanings of words."
"Unknown","01;17;55;13","01;18;32;15","So it's, it's it's perfectly pointing out this relationship between meaning and co deployability that hits and hits context dependance and human cognition. So that's that's a paper I very much recommend reading thank you so much. How well did you want to comment on that? Also more, if I may. I'm aware that Steve knows the question, but just to follow up on that, beautiful deconstruction."
"Unknown","01;18;34;13","01;19;33;09","This is more of a question, but I'm going to state it as an observation. And this notion of the QR effort as being fundamentally getting measurements right on metrics right would be understood from the point of view of inference technically as getting an internally consistent metric. Correct. And the metric we're talking about is a Fisher information metric. So if you look at all reading or writing or action and sensation from a classical perspective as just trying to minimize some divergence or some prediction error, what you are saying is that you are trying to find an internally consistent metric in an information space that makes sense of your active sampling, querying the world."
"Unknown","01;19;34;10","01;20;10;27","So it just sounded to me as if Christmas was exactly getting the measure of measuring stick, at least behaving consistently. You'll never know whether it's changing its length or at least if it behaves consistently in relation to what you can see of the world. The way that you can query that world actively, then that's good enough. And that of course is one way of simply stating that the name of the game and active inference is just to minimize your prediction that away you now reading prediction error as a real divergence."
"Unknown","01;20;11;04","01;20;49;17","And of course the the information that or the amount, the measurement of movement, the metric is just a pathological infinitesimal changes in count. I've seen from a mathematical perspective on the perspective of information geometries. There's a beautiful link here between aligning your QR reps and getting your generative model right to make the most sense in the sense of minimizing or making as internally consistent as possible or your information metrics awesome."
"Unknown","01;20;49;27","01;21;57;01","Thank you. Before we go to Stephen's question, we have a question or two from the from Andrew. Again, in the live chat, he asks, Does the existence of a holographic screen slash markup like it automatically yield a statistical manifold for the belief state of the agent? And is there a canonical normalization procedure for a quantum mechanical system? If there is one, how would the screaming translate into the statistical manifold oh, I could take one crack at that, which is if if I'm course grading something if we think of this in terms of cure Fs of then I'm deploying a different reference frame with lower resolution."
"Unknown","01;21;58;11","01;22;53;19","So the in a sense what's being re normalized is my representation of the units of that I use to distinguish states of the world of. So if if I have a meter stick of that's made of stainless steel that has. Mm. Indicated on it, then I could go around and make measurements in millimeters of that. If I cast grain to a meter stick that only has half centimeters indicated on it, then I've lost a factor of five and resolution of course grained by a factor of five."
"Unknown","01;22;54;22","01;23;59;00","And so I've, I've in effect rounded off all my outcome values and now by my function of comparing outcome values is, is differently defined because it has to work at this lower resolution. And if I want to compare my previous values to my later values, I have to incorporate this explicit round of function to by comparison of values because I've changed my Q R of so so of course greening of which which of course couples to scale changing from the very beginning of our conversation of can be thought of as a transition from oh a very well a cure F with some grain size to a cure for a similar degree of freedom with the"
"Unknown","01;23;59;00","01;25;02;17","different grain size. Oh, and that has ripple effects through everything, including the the free energy cost of memory. If I if I'm reading two bit numbers into memory, then that's a lot less expensive. Than writing five bit numbers into memory. So of this raises the another aspect of this question of re normalization, which is of course, how does it influence how can I use it to solve the tradeoff problems that arise if I'm an organism with a limited fuel supply, which of course I am going about the world trying to gather of preferentially to gather the information that's going to be most useful to me at the lowest possible cost."
"Unknown","01;25;04;13","01;26;03;11","So again, we get back to this key issue of in in all of active inference of balancing of the risk of exploration against the reward of new information. Oh, and of course, screening is is intimate to that and it involves the choice I make of the tools that I'm going to use to make measurements and how that choice impacts my need to allocate computational resources and energy resources to what I'm doing to to the to the complex task of getting new information while at the same time surviving other things then as, oh, college."
"Unknown","01;26;03;11","01;26;32;24","You want to speak to that first perhaps people should ask that I can come back to what I just said. Yeah, I'll make a note and then Carl, it'll be great to have you respond to that. And Stephen, to your question. So to transpose it into statistical parametric mapping, the true classics, there's a mapping from the measured voxels which are being defined by the resolution of the EEG or the MRI machine."
"Unknown","01;26;33;03","01;27;01;10","That's the holograph, that's like what the experimental apparatus is providing is the measurements. Those are the oh, in our partially observable Markov decision process, it's the predicted value in the regression. And that space, you know, if it's 128 channels in the EEG and they're getting this sampling rate, that is the state space that's being discussed and that's being transposed or mapped or connected to a different statistical space with different features."
"Unknown","01;27;01;26","01;27;33;12","And rather than the voxels there's like the mapping on to results. So Carl, that's why I would appreciate if this is true or not, but those are the resolution elements and that it can be like a core screening. And in that stretch meter stick and different space, there's a lot more statistical inference options available that are just not accessible at all from the voxel core screening, which is noisier here."
"Unknown","01;27;33;20","01;28;00;07","And there's a signal enrichments in the course screening to the Russell's that's appropriate. And then that gets juxtaposed with the contrasts which is the experimental design of the scientist. Like you couldn't differentiate A versus B category if you only tested A. So the experimental design and that's where like the statistics actually comes into play. And then just as Chris said, there's the organism with limited food supply."
"Unknown","01;28;00;16","01;28;29;25","And then there's like the scientist with limited time attention, computer storage processor time funding, maybe 7 billion people like it just there's plausibility. And so that's where this operational co deployment connects with experimental design. And so many of the patterns and analogies exist in the purely classical domain. Of the parametric statistics like SPM in the classical physics and the flow and the information flow area that's coming into play."
"Unknown","01;28;30;04","01;28;36;15","And also these more recent in quantum areas. So Carl would love to hear your thoughts on that."
"Unknown","01;28;41;00","01;29;13;03","Yes, of course, I'm mindful of Stephen's discoveries and Albert and perhaps I'll speak to that and then Stephen can ask a question about it. Yes. I think, you know, these questions and your responses are touching on something really fundamental. So just to answer the question from the point of view of mark of language, yes, it does automatically yield a statistical manifold, or at least it looks as if there is a statistical manifold."
"Unknown","01;29;13;26","01;29;59;00","If you can observe the the behavior of the thing that you are observing. And the second thing question, which we've been focusing on, the core screening, I think that's a really fundamental thing. I would argue not not to conflate too much the notion of rate normalization, which would be I think more a question of how you get from one scale to another scale with the notion, of course, screening, which is which could be read just simply as the degree of quantization or choosing the right resolution element, the right course grading on a given cue or at any given scale you could argue that you could contextualize it."
"Unknown","01;29;59;06","01;31;00;24","But I think there's a there's a more fundamental argument here, and that's the argument that there will be, from a statistical perspective, an optimal course screening for any given holographic screen or exchange over a mark of Plunkett. And that's the one that statistically maximizes the marginal likelihood which you could, if you like, relate to this sort of getting the measurements as internally consistent as possible, maximizing the predictability of the next measurement you make that goes hand in hand with a maximization of the marginal likelihood or minimization of the variation free energy that is important to remember because the marginal likelihood can always be expressed as accuracy minus complexity where complexity scores the degrees of freedom"
"Unknown","01;31;01;05","01;31;35;02","you're burning up. If you remember about the the the the bits on the on the holographic screen, you do need energy and to, to from a classical perspective represent and what that translates to in a very simple way in terms of probability distributions and functionalized is that in maximizing the marginal likelihood or the evidence for your aligned or model of the world, you are to maintain a certain degree of accuracy trying to minimize complexity."
"Unknown","01;31;35;02","01;32;02;25","So you're using a few degrees of freedom your course grading to the extent you can get away with while maintaining an accurate account of the of, say, the sensory states or the perceptual space on your holographic screen. And if you now from the point of view of active inference, just think about, well, what would that sort of accuracy complexity look like in terms of the consequences of action?"
"Unknown","01;32;02;25","01;32;37;08","You get exactly what Chris was talking about, which was the the expected complexity and being the risk usually. And I mean risk in the sense of an economist or basin decision theorist, it is literally mathematically the same thing. The expected accuracy now becomes a sort of expected utility or the the expected low gets the likelihood, the expected likelihood that you would get if you if you committed to this kind, of course grading."
"Unknown","01;32;37;18","01;33;09;12","So this course grading is absolutely fundamental. It's really interesting to go back to they all the sources where well, the course screening starts to make a difference. And I'm thinking here coming back to Daniel's notion of resolution elements, you know, you find in Slovenia filtering in the match filtering theorem, there is an optimal level of smoothing or blur rate for any given kind of data about which you want to make an inference or you want to simulate."
"Unknown","01;33;10;10","01;33;41;13","You see this and formulations of universal computation that themselves are based upon sort of induction that get you right back to more complex incomprehensibility. So you see it in the drive that underwrites all formulations of universal computation to maximize compression by minimizing the complexity of your of your message passing and getting as efficient and as simple as you can."
"Unknown","01;33;41;22","01;34;32;12","And of course, the best way to make your account as simple as possible is to course grade it. And I think you also see it in the sort of the different levels of cognition in psychology and in neurophysiology, in the sense that the higher level, more efficient ways in which we align our curies, so optimize our generative models always lead you to a very coarse grade colonization of the world so for example, I represent, I'm sure in my brain on some neuro populations, the fact that I am in my study, I do not represent not in terms of very fine grained x, y, z coordinates down to the millimeter I represented."
"Unknown","01;34;32;12","01;35;17;10","No, I'm in my study. I carved the world out its joints and those joints basically demarcate the the kind of course grading I bring to the table. There are all sorts of arguments you can pursue here to to vindicate this, the very existence of receptive fields tiling a sensorium in a way that is covered by discrete quantities or receptive fields tells you immediately that the way the brain represents stuff on the inside, the if you can look at it through brain imaging, is in this quanta sized fashion, this coarse grained fashion, and those that coarse graininess and the size and the deployment and the organization of those receptive fields has been optimized at many different"
"Unknown","01;35;17;17","01;35;46;16","temporal scales. So, you know, I just give you a few takes on course grading of something absolutely fundamental to the structure of a Toyota model or to the way that we we align our Curies to make sense of all of the stuff on the holographic screen, or at least when when we are when we are reading from that sense, making that sense Great."
"Unknown","01;35;47;03","01;36;37;25","Thank you, Stephen. Yeah. Thanks, nurse. This is really cool. There was going to come back a little bit to now in the past and the idea that you mentioned about the way that we interface or the assumptions of the interface, that it changes how we we resolve the thing and the background situation situated in this of that thing so and so it's like and so that could then also and this is a question in a way is how can that also because if the way that that thing and the assumptions are made sense but the meaningful inference, the action policy selection and the way things are thought about how can that itself change the way"
"Unknown","01;36;37;25","01;37;02;04","the brain or the way that organisms look at the what things are? For instance, in the modern world we do see everything is things. We calm things up. We see things as set for like an individual separate. Whereas if you go back to sort of indigenous approaches, time for them was cyclical or followed the river going down a hill or so."
"Unknown","01;37;02;04","01;37;45;19","There was a there was a complexity focus in a way. It was almost like the mountain kind of problem of finding the landscape of meaning rather than defining the thing and what it is and carving it so I'm curious around, is this how much is the way that the quantum reference field is translated into thinking about what that thing is and how that compares to, say, all Western cognitive frames, which kind of we measure everything because we can because basically we can control our environment so heavily, we we can make things very accurate."
"Unknown","01;37;46;05","01;38;28;19","Whereas in the past it might have been, you know, the Kalahari Bushmen or the people in the middle of the Amazon that somehow go with the landscape of complexity so that the way that that is understood is going to be different. So I'm just curious about how you think about that ways of knowing great question. I wonder also if that person to the individuality of of temporal scales, like you mentioned, the cyclical time."
"Unknown","01;38;28;19","01;38;57;09","And back to Francis question maybe earlier about how a thing over time that sees a thing over time scales with the scale of the time or with the cyclical nature of the time or it reminds me back of when we had Chris and Sharna here talking about like flattening time. Maybe that was just Shana's talk, but yeah. Anyway, I don't know."
"Unknown","01;38;57;09","01;39;32;21","Do you guys anybody have any temporal comments just that there's an analogy to the synchronization of clocks, which is a huge part of computer science and of quantum and other areas. That question of synchronizing clocks seems to have some relationship to cognitive model, not naive congruence in terms of synchronization, but in terms of like a time zone coordinate action."
"Unknown","01;39;33;12","01;40;08;09","So if we're in the same time zone, then there's a comparability but for cognitive states. And so I think that will be something awesome to explore in next week's session. And of course in the long run about what that kind of semantic and rhetorical and narrative alignment that isn't congruence but reflects a broader frame which actually the differences within the frame are the search through that field."
"Unknown","01;40;10;22","01;41;04;17","Thinks that. And in the interest of of temporal comments, I think maybe does everyone just want to go around and give a final thought and maybe an idea of what they would like to see in next week's discussion? And we will start with Steven Yeah. Thanks. Lots of lots of interesting things. I suppose I'm curious about this the way the collapsing of the quantum reference frame might scale differently, what might the assumptions that lead to the collapse to inform different scales of interactions and mixing and blending of behavior and yeah, digestion, a lot of stuff that's come up."
"Unknown","01;41;04;17","01;41;16;23","So yeah, thank you for the opportunity to sort you awesome. Daniel, anything you want to see happen next week?"
"Unknown","01;41;19;16","01;42;05;12","We always think of the dot zero. It's kind of like dropping into the skate park or the bathtub. And so that was like a microcosm of all the threads that get brought together. And then in DART one, I feel like we opened up so many areas of possible connection. And so I'll just look forward to the second repeated measurements of this semantic or regime of attention space and see how the continued interaction and engagement updates our generative model past the dot to even awesome Carl or Chris."
"Unknown","01;42;05;12","01;42;09;17","Do you want to give a thought about what we'd like to unpack in the next discussion?"
"Unknown","01;42;16;07","01;42;46;27","Should I go first? Well, Chris thinks of something very cool to say, and so following on from down to a certain extent, that's Stephen's question as well. I'd like to hear about the principle of being thority entanglement and its relationship to this notion of synchronization and the mutual alignment of pure efforts between things that are coupled so of coming to the regimes of attention."
"Unknown","01;42;46;27","01;43;39;12","I think that could be a very transparent link. Then in the sense that contextualizing your Q r f, I think for a cognitive neuroscientist would be getting your attentional set right and possibly a implicit course grading that comes along with a particular attentional set and taking that that notion to attending to others and synchronizing and communicating and living in a universe that is also composed of things like me Think Bring brings some fundamental questions about classically generalized synchronization, quantum theoretically entanglement and enabling that entanglement in the right kind of way via aligning your curious and getting the course grating right in sympathy with your partner."
"Unknown","01;43;39;20","01;44;12;01","So I'd like to hear about the principle unity entanglement and how it relates to classical notions of communication, mutual inference and generalized synchrony well, thanks for stealing. What I was going to say I was also going to say how there's one like the final concluding part of the paper. It talks about how the MVP is asymptotically to the principle of unitary, and I really would like to dove into that more and maybe any potential implications of that."
"Unknown","01;44;12;16","01;45;14;01","And now Chris gets gets the final and cleverest word OK, just this will be terribly clever of what I was going to do was to recommend a lovely people buy a lexigram ball that we refer to in this paper. Oh, and of the the closing sentence of that paper is that physics is really about languages. And I think this ties in nicely to some of the issues that Steven was raising in his last question, which I found very interesting about how how do conceptual schemes evolve at the cultural level and I enjoy hearing about the whole issue of reference frame synchronization or reference frame alone and how that relates to entanglement."
"Unknown","01;45;14;19","01;45;58;24","This this really is a question about language. And that that paper by Alexi Grunwald, I think makes this point very, very beautifully. So that that would be a nice thing to look at at some point of, let's say this is that's probably a newer paper. But him the one I was referring to is titled something like, oh, how device free How Device Independent Methods Change the nature of Physical Theory or something like that was published in studies and history and philosophy of science of 20, 17 or something like that."
"Unknown","01;45;59;18","01;46;29;18","OK, anyway, thank you very much for this yeah. This was very interesting and engaging and really appreciated everyone's participation and blues facilitation, so we'll look forward to seeing anyone just drop in or out when works for you next week. At the same time in number 40.2. So till the next measurement. Thank you. Take care."
