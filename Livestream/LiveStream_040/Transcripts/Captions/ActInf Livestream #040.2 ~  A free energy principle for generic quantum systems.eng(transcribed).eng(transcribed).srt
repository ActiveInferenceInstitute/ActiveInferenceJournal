00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,519
stream number 40.2

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,719
on march 24th 2022

7
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,960
welcome to the actin flap we're a

8
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,960
participatory online lab that is

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,719
communicating learning and practicing

10
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,800
applied active inference

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,960
this is a recorded in an archived live

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,719
stream so please provide us with

13
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,360
feedback so we can improve our work

14
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,440
hear about your qrf

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,440
all backgrounds and perspectives are

16
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,280
welcome we may actually have to change

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,520
this to all qrf are welcome

18
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,840
and we'll follow video etiquette for

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,600
live streams

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,680
check out

21
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,799
activeinference.org to learn more about

22
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,960
the activities in the lab

23
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,119
today in 40.2 we are continuing to learn

24
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,360
and discuss this awesome paper a free

25
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,360
energy principle for generic quantum

26
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,200
systems by

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,920
uh

28
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,479
fields fristen glazebrook and levin and

29
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,439
we're

30
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,119
really appreciative to have several of

31
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,759
the authors joining us today

32
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,200
and

33
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,479
in this

34
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,640
dot two we're just going to have

35
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,520
introductions and then jump right in to

36
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,360
several of the

37
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,360
notes that we left for ourselves from

38
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,479
last time

39
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,600
and

40
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,680
see where else it goes and anyone can

41
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,840
write a comment in the live chat and

42
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,360
we'll just

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,200
say hello again

44
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,399
pick up with some threads that were left

45
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,119
unspooled in the dot 1 and see where we

46
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,280
get in the dot 2 and how we continue

47
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,479
going forward

48
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:03,439
so

49
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,759
i'm daniel i'm a researcher in

50
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,200
california

51
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,479
and i will pass it to dean

52
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,440
morning my name is dean i'm in calgary

53
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,000
in canada my emphasis i think is on the

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,319
practice part of active inference and

55
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,360
seeing how

56
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,760
it gets applied in in different contexts

57
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,280
and situations

58
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,120
i'll pass it to blue

59
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,080
i am blue knight i'm an independent

60
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,319
researcher in new mexico and i will

61
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,560
be facilitating the discussion today but

62
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,239
let me pass it off to oh steven if he's

63
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,040
still here stephen are you here

64
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,679
oh you're muted stephen

65
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,080
we still don't hear you

66
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,640
okay thanks stephen we'll continue on to

67
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,640
dave

68
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,879
dave i don't see also left okay okay

69
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,959
let's continue let's pass it down

70
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,920
to the authors we go so uh let's pass it

71
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,239
to mike first since you have audio this

72
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,239
time

73
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,000
yes i uh yep this is mike levin

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,440
um i do biology at tufts trying to uh

75
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,760
understand what uh what living systems

76
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,920
are doing at all scales and how uh

77
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,319
intelligence manifests in various um

78
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,120
unconventional uh embodiments across uh

79
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,640
who then and they compete in and

80
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,319
cooperate across scales to give us the

81
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,319
amazing phenomena we see in biology

82
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,480
awesome thank you

83
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,799
uh dave would you like to say hello

84
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,599
introduce yourself

85
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,319
maybe no audio also

86
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,560
okay how about

87
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,159
carl would you like to say hello

88
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,720
yes i would hello

89
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,840
i'm carl uh i'm one of the co-authors on

90
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,920
the paper i'm a neuroscientist from

91
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,560
london um i have to confess i'm a bit of

92
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,959
a passenger and admirer on this paper so

93
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,519
i'm here to learn as much to

94
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,839
as to answer questions so i'll pass it

95
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,799
on to chris who's

96
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,440
hi i'm chris fields i'm also an

97
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,600
independent researcher

98
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,240
uh working sort of on the boundaries

99
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,720
between physics and biology and

100
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,479
information science and

101
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,320
sort of convinced that those are all

102
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,000
three the same actual discipline

103
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,800
so

104
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,600
this is a paper that expands on that

105
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,320
theme a little bit

106
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,479
great thank you

107
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,600
so i think where we left off last time

108
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,560
was talking about how

109
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,720
the fep is asymptotically the principle

110
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,440
of unitarity and maybe chris would you

111
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,759
mind leading us off um here and if you

112
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,720
want to

113
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,720
point out a specific

114
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,840
maybe formalism or um place where we

115
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,680
should start i think it was the very

116
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,280
last formalism in the in the paper

117
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,400
actually

118
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,320
um but maybe if you would talk us

119
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,680
through that that would be super

120
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,240
appreciated

121
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,320
okay

122
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,440
um well let's let's talk first

123
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,199
informally

124
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,680
just about

125
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,639
the motivation for this idea and how it

126
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,320
might make sense intuitively

127
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,880
and again i'll go back to

128
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,000
carl's paper from 2019 a free energy

129
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,039
principle for a particular physics

130
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,440
which which the current paper is

131
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,360
obviously modeled after in a certain way

132
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,639
and

133
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,840
as we discussed last time i think

134
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,720
what

135
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,120
carl was able to show in particular

136
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,800
physics

137
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,520
was that the idea

138
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,400
of

139
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,080
the very intuitive idea of a thing

140
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,120
of something that

141
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,479
exists

142
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,520
and

143
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,560
um

144
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,639
importantly maintains its identity

145
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,680
as a single system

146
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,360
over time

147
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,160
and what that means is that it's it can

148
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,560
be measured by some other system

149
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,160
and

150
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,400
it can be measured repeatedly and

151
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,280
reliably

152
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,560
over time by some other system so so

153
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,880
thingness is associated with repeated

154
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,520
measurability

155
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,120
and what

156
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,360
carl was able to show in

157
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,520
in particular physics was that if we

158
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,120
assume that something is a thing

159
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,000
then we're effectively assuming that it

160
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,599
has a stable

161
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,400
non-equilibrium steady state density

162
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,160
and therefore we're assuming that it has

163
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,360
a markov blanket and therefore we can

164
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,800
treat it

165
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,000
as

166
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,160
implementing active inference

167
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,160
as

168
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,199
constantly predicting its own future

169
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,800
existence

170
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,199
and behaving so as to make that

171
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,280
prediction come true

172
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,520
to the extent that it can't

173
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,639
and

174
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,840
uh

175
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,479
such behavior may be

176
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,879
prevented or overcome by its environment

177
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,800
so the environment of something

178
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,280
may cause it to cease to exist

179
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,840
you know the thing could be a marble

180
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,599
sitting on a table

181
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,759
and its environment could include a

182
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,599
sledgehammer that's about to come down

183
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,199
on top of it

184
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,759
and and destroy its thinness

185
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,800
but as long as

186
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,680
the environment doesn't do that

187
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,479
uh

188
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,120
the the object can

189
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,639
continue

190
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,000
to uh

191
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,479
to execute active inference

192
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,720
and maintain its mark on blanket by so

193
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,759
do it

194
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,919
and of course it's markov blanket is

195
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,160
what defines it

196
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,279
as a separate entity as a thing

197
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,880
that's distinct from its environment

198
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,039
so let's translate all of that into

199
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,838
quantum theory

200
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,160
in quantum theory we have this

201
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,959
uh

202
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,839
notion of interaction as measurement

203
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:50,880
already

204
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,880
and we have a notion of interaction as

205
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,680
information exchange already

206
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,399
so

207
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,360
it's very natural to

208
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,120
take this whole picture and

209
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,240
and make the notion of measurement

210
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,040
over time precise in this

211
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,640
using this quantum theoretic formalism

212
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,680
and quantum theory also gives us a

213
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,920
a very natural implementation of a

214
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,880
markov blanket

215
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,360
which in physics is called a holographic

216
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,959
screen

217
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,160
and holographic screens were introduced

218
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,279
back in the

219
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,959
70s to talk about black holes

220
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,040
but a holographic screen

221
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,200
is is just a reformulation of the

222
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,040
concept of a markov blanket it's it's a

223
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,480
boundary that encodes information

224
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,480
and specifically

225
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,279
it's a boundary between two systems that

226
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,000
encodes all of the information that one

227
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,279
system can have about the other

228
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,519
so

229
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,440
it does

230
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,160
just what a mark on blanket does it

231
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,399
provides an information encoding

232
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,839
boundary

233
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,200
that gives

234
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,600
the systems on the two sides of it

235
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,760
identities for each other by

236
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,000
distinguishing them

237
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
and this notion of identity and quantum

238
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,880
theory corresponds to separability

239
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,880
inseparability just means lack of

240
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,640
entanglement

241
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,040
so if the joint

242
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,880
if you have a two

243
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,480
things

244
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,600
or a thing in its environment

245
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,880
then

246
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,440
if they're not entangled

247
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,959
you can talk about their states

248
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,440
independently if they are entangled then

249
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,800
you can't talk about their states

250
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,160
independently

251
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,440
and so the idea of thing this goes away

252
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,279
since thingness

253
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,600
uh implies having some sort of

254
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,160
conditionally independent state right a

255
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,600
nest density

256
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,640
that can actually be written down

257
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,880
so all of this fits together rather

258
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,880
nicely

259
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,640
and

260
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,480
so if we go back to

261
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,959
particular physics

262
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,959
of

263
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,160
the idea of

264
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,640
active inference

265
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,839
emerges

266
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,519
from that paper as a fundamental

267
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,519
underlying principle of physics

268
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,040
that

269
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,480
that tells us what we mean

270
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,320
by

271
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,360
think

272
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,120
or system

273
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,040
that's identifiable over time

274
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,240
so this is this becomes a very deep

275
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,839
principle

276
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,519
uh

277
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,680
deeper than newton's laws because

278
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,240
newton's laws actually talk about

279
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,360
objects that are identifiable over time

280
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,480
and

281
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,920
the

282
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,320
the the free energy principle and the

283
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,959
idea of active inference tells us what

284
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,800
we mean

285
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,480
when we talk about something being

286
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,360
identifiable over time

287
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,760
so if this is a if this is a fundamental

288
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,320
principle of physics then one would

289
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,920
expect

290
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,920
that would have some relationship to the

291
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,079
principle of unitarity

292
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,000
which is the most fundamental principle

293
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,120
of quantum theory and is typically axiom

294
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,920
one when one writes down the axioms of

295
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,200
quantum theory

296
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,079
uh

297
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,639
was was axiom one and von neumann's

298
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,800
origin back in the

299
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,279
thirties

300
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,639
uh or forties i can't remember which

301
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,320
so what's the principle of unitarian the

302
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,920
principle of unitarianity is just the

303
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,760
principle that in a closed system

304
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,760
information is conserved

305
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,880
so information is neither created or

306
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,240
destroyed in a closed system

307
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,440
so it's a fundamental conservation law

308
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,160
and it's exactly analogous to the

309
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,519
principle of conservation of energy

310
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,000
right the conservation of energy says in

311
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,160
a closed system energy is neither

312
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,959
created nor destroyed it's conserved

313
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,800
so the principle of unitarianity just

314
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,760
says this for information as well as

315
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,079
energy and we know that information and

316
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,160
energy are very closely linked

317
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,639
by by landauer's principle or by

318
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,320
boltzmann's

319
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,240
definition of entropy

320
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,880
or all of these other connections that

321
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,959
make physics informational

322
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,920
so

323
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,040
how does

324
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,120
the principle of active inference relate

325
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,440
to the principle of unitary what does it

326
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,839
say

327
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,360
about of

328
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,680
the conservation of information or what

329
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,600
does the conservation of information

330
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,240
tell us about the principle of the

331
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,079
principle of active entrance or the free

332
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,839
energy principle

333
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,680
well the first thing to know is that

334
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,120
unitarity applies to closed systems

335
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,480
so so thing environment pairs

336
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,959
and

337
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,320
active inference characterizes what the

338
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,800
thing is doing in response to its

339
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,000
environment

340
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
and of course it also characterizes what

341
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,320
the environment is doing in response to

342
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,320
the thing

343
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,800
uh and another benefit of quantum theory

344
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,440
is that it makes this symmetry between

345
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,120
any system and its environment how

346
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,880
manifest

347
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,199
makes it very explicit

348
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,240
uh but it's already explicit in the free

349
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,920
energy principle i mean the markov

350
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,800
blanket has two sides

351
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,120
and

352
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,800
the

353
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,160
the system

354
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,880
acting on its environment is the same as

355
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,560
the environment

356
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,959
sensing the system

357
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:01,760
and

358
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,680
in the same way that the environment

359
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,600
acting on the system

360
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,839
is the same as the system sensing its

361
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,279
environment

362
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,519
so interaction physical interaction is

363
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,560
information exchange in both frameworks

364
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,199
and and it's perfectly symmetrical

365
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,320
if the system remains identifiable over

366
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,839
time so does its environment

367
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,880
to exist its environment ceases to exist

368
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,120
because its environment is defined with

369
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,959
respect to it

370
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,240
that's why we call it its environment

371
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,560
um

372
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,839
so so all of these all of these

373
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,759
symmetries are built into both

374
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,759
frameworks

375
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,480
so um the free energy principle is

376
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,600
fundamentally about prediction

377
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,440
right vfe

378
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,000
variational free energy can be thought

379
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,320
of as prediction error or potential

380
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,800
prediction error

381
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,720
so

382
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,079
the free energy principle is about

383
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,519
the system being able to pre

384
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,639
the next state of its own markov blanket

385
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,120
oh and if it predicts the next state of

386
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,600
its own markov blanket

387
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,440
perfectly

388
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,639
then vfe is minimized to zero and that's

389
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,160
the asymptotic case perfect prediction

390
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,759
there's a question last time about

391
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:30,639
what's

392
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,680
asymptotic in the in the claim that

393
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,959
the free energy principle is

394
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,399
asymptotically the principle of

395
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,279
unitarity and the asymptotic

396
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,279
state as i think blue pointed out last

397
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,040
time is perfect prediction

398
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,920
so and now let's translate all this to

399
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,240
quantum theory and this is where the

400
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,720
figure in the paper that shows the disc

401
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,880
with the various triangles

402
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,959
uh comes into play i think that's figure

403
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,519
six but i've actually forgotten

404
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,399
uh

405
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,000
yeah it's it's that one

406
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,599
so

407
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,520
let's

408
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,079
now introduce this idea of a qrf which

409
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,640
is just a little package of predictive

410
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,720
capability

411
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,319
uh qrf means quantum reference frame as

412
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,599
we discussed

413
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,918
last time a reference frame is

414
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,720
implemented computation

415
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,280
that makes a measurement comparable

416
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,440
across time

417
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,600
so

418
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,960
a meter stick for example implements a

419
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,200
computation of length

420
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,520
and it allows us to compare

421
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,559
measurements of length across time

422
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,440
because we assume that it's fixed

423
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,240
and of course we can use a meter stick

424
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,880
because each of us has embedded in our

425
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,240
brains

426
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,960
a representation of length

427
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,200
in fact we have a representation of a 3d

428
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,000
coordinate system

429
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,480
without which meter states would be

430
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,760
useless

431
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,559
so we can use external reference frames

432
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,320
like meter sticks because we have

433
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,480
internal reference frames like our

434
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,039
representation of 3d space

435
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,039
and our intuitive understanding of

436
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,120
length

437
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,000
that we assume stays fixed over time and

438
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,080
that allows our measurements of length

439
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,559
to be comparable across time for us

440
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,760
so

441
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,559
now let's think about a qrf

442
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,679
um

443
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,320
as a way of of

444
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,160
as something that implements active

445
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,039
entrance or that enables a system to

446
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,600
implement active inference by allowing

447
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,320
it to compare its measurements over time

448
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,640
right prediction is meaningless

449
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,080
if you can't

450
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,200
compare your measurements over time

451
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,840
um

452
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,120
so and let's ask what what would it be

453
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,000
like

454
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,160
for a system to be able to perfectly

455
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,559
predict

456
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,799
the next state of its markov blanket

457
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,400
well the next state of its markov

458
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,600
blanket

459
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,080
is a state that its environment has

460
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,440
written by acting on it

461
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,600
so

462
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,760
our question of perfect prediction is

463
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,679
what would it be like for a system to be

464
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,000
able to perfectly predict the next

465
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,480
actions of its environment and notice

466
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,160
that the system isn't predicting the

467
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
next state of its environment it doesn't

468
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,240
know the state of its environment state

469
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,679
of its environments on the other side of

470
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,600
the marcon blanken what it's trying to

471
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,000
predict is an action of its environment

472
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,280
on it

473
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,880
which is the only action of its

474
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,080
environment that's relevant

475
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,919
uh and the only action of the

476
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,520
environments that's detectable

477
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,400
so

478
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,919
um its environment like it is

479
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,720
characterized by qrfs

480
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,640
right the situation is perfectly

481
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,480
symmetrical between the system and its

482
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,480
environment

483
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,280
um

484
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,280
so the question of produce

485
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,000
is its environment

486
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,520
and the system can predict its

487
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,720
environment's actions perfectly

488
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,320
only if it in the environment exactly

489
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,679
share

490
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,280
their qrfs

491
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,280
because the qrf

492
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,720
not only

493
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,159
interprets sensation it gives meaning to

494
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,679
action

495
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,400
so it says what your action is going to

496
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,520
be

497
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,760
so if i use my meter stick to cut a 2x4

498
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,200
my qrf the meter stick is guiding my

499
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,600
action it's giving it meaning it's

500
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,840
making it repeatable

501
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,000
in the same way that it makes my

502
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,559
perceptions repeatable and again that's

503
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,400
that's why we use these things we want

504
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,559
to be able to act in repeatable ways as

505
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,600
well as perceive in repeatable ways

506
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,159
and if we can't act in repeatable ways

507
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,919
then again the notion of prediction

508
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,960
becomes meaningless

509
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,640
so

510
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,400
perfect prediction corresponds to

511
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,120
perfect qrf alignment

512
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,600
so the question becomes now what does

513
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,039
perfect qrf alignment correspond to

514
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,480
and

515
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,799
um

516
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,520
jim glaisberg and another colleague

517
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,919
antonino marciano

518
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,200
who's a physicist

519
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,240
physicist in shanghai

520
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,400
showed in a previous paper

521
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,840
that perfect

522
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,080
perfect qrf alignment between a system

523
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,760
and its environment

524
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,919
is only possible if the system and

525
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,280
environment are entangled

526
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,559
so

527
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,159
perfect qrf alignment corresponds

528
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,320
actually to the collapse

529
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,480
of the markov blanket

530
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,880
because it corresponds to the collapse

531
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,880
of separability

532
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,280
which means that the ness is no longer

533
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,880
well defined

534
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,960
because it's no longer in a

535
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,400
conditionally independent state

536
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,480
and you can see that

537
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,880
if you think of what perfect qrf

538
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,799
alignment means

539
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,400
it means that

540
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,320
your actions correspond exactly

541
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,840
to my predictions

542
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,480
a

543
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,480
conditional statement

544
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,880
it's an exact same

545
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,440
so if i predict that you're going to do

546
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,480
x then you're going to do x period

547
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,679
which means that your state is no longer

548
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,760
independent of my state

549
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,840
your state actually depends on my state

550
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,000
and my state correspondingly actually

551
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,919
depends on your state

552
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,039
if you predict that i'm going to do x

553
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,000
then i will do x

554
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,840
that's what perfect prediction means

555
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,640
uh

556
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,960
when we translate it into this

557
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,159
uh

558
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,679
qrf based concept

559
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,480
so perfect prediction and

560
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,840
of

561
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,400
the collapse of separability are the

562
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,799
same thing

563
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,520
so

564
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,720
the

565
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,320
asymptotic

566
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,039
limit of the fep which is perfect

567
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,559
prediction

568
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,480
corresponds to the collapse of

569
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,320
separability

570
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,000
well the collapse of separability is

571
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,559
just entanglement

572
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,360
and

573
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,080
the principle of unitarity

574
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,200
is the claim that any

575
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,559
isolated system

576
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,200
left to its own devices

577
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,039
uh will evolve its state which is the

578
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,520
joint state of any two of its components

579
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,279
will evolve toward

580
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,320
toward uh complete entanglement it'll

581
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,799
evolve toward a pure state in

582
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,720
in quantum theoretic jargon

583
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,480
so uh it's in this sense that the fep is

584
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,080
asymptotically the principle of

585
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,600
unitarian

586
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,039
it's that

587
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,000
it

588
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,159
its asymptotic condition is the same

589
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:25,919
as the condition that the principal

590
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,840
unitarity imposes on closed systems i.e

591
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,799
on

592
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,400
system environment

593
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,640
combinations

594
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,919
where

595
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,240
whenever i say environment i just mean

596
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,000
everything that exists that's not the

597
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,880
system of interest

598
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,240
so a system environment combination is

599
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,679
always a closed system by definition

600
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,640
so so that's my introduction and

601
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,080
we can start on discussion

602
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,559
that's great thank you stephen did you

603
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,240
have a question yes you can hear me okay

604
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,240
excellent i was just gonna ask that's

605
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,919
really helpful uh there's a lot in there

606
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:06,880
obviously

607
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,279
i was gonna ask in terms of

608
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,480
the pure unitarity would that be what

609
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,480
happens say at the

610
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,480
electron or the kind of

611
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,960
these normal quantum particle scales and

612
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,960
as you go

613
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,520
to scales above that you it becomes more

614
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,159
and more approximate you have less of

615
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:28,000
this uh

616
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
isotropic you know this this this

617
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,480
quality of knowing

618
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,360
and entanglement

619
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:37,919
um

620
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,240
well that's that's a very deep question

621
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,799
and it's a very good question uh let's

622
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,080
think about

623
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,120
the

624
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,600
the canonical entanglement experience

625
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,600
experiment the sort of bell epr

626
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,279
experiment

627
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,240
um

628
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,880
so i'll i'll draw it with my hands here

629
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,440
so in the canonical experiment

630
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,880
you've got a source

631
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,880
and it's located here in the in the

632
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,120
middle of my face

633
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,120
and it produces

634
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,679
an entangled pair of something photons

635
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,559
or electrons or bucky balls or whatever

636
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:13,760
you want

637
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,360
and they travel

638
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,400
apart

639
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,080
at the speed of light or something very

640
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,919
close to it

641
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,559
and at some point

642
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,120
they encounter two symmetrically placed

643
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,080
detectors and the detectors are operated

644
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,480
by observers who are always called alice

645
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,720
and bob

646
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,159
and

647
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,279
these detectors measure something and in

648
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,120
the canonical experiment they measure

649
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,439
spin

650
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,559
and

651
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,080
what

652
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,679
alice and bob

653
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,480
each observe independently

654
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,720
is a random

655
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,640
distribution of spins

656
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,840
and if we think of this as a

657
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,840
two-dimensional experiment

658
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,039
then

659
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,640
um

660
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,960
they they either measure spin up or spin

661
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,840
down in some coordinate systems so

662
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,240
alice and bob each pick a z-axis that

663
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,720
defines up and with respect to their

664
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,279
local z-axis they see a random

665
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,559
distribution of up and down

666
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,360
now

667
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,159
things get interesting

668
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,679
when alice and bob later get together

669
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,279
and compare their results

670
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,159
and what they find is that whenever

671
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,399
alice observes up

672
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:36,559
bob observes down and vice versa

673
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,320
and

674
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,720
so they conclude that their results are

675
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,080
classically correlated

676
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,559
but then it gets more interesting

677
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,120
because what we allow alice and bob to

678
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,320
do

679
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,760
is

680
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,039
constantly

681
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,720
alter

682
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,720
the direction that they

683
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,720
detect the spin in

684
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,720
with respect to their own local z-axis

685
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,960
so you can think of the spin detector as

686
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,440
like a polarization filter so like a

687
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,200
pair of sunglasses

688
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,159
and

689
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,960
what allison bob can do is

690
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,440
randomly and independently change the

691
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,799
tilt of their sunglasses

692
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,080
while they do this experiment

693
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,880
and in in real implementations of this

694
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,760
experiment it was first implemented

695
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,279
sorry

696
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,880
by

697
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,799
um

698
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,919
alan aspect in his lab in paris in the

699
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,039
early 1970s

700
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,120
um

701
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,880
and has since been repeated probably

702
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,799
hundreds of times by different groups

703
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,880
all over the world including the chinese

704
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,720
using a satellite to generate the

705
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,120
entangled pairs and measuring them

706
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,320
thousands of

707
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,480
a thousand or so kilometers apart

708
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,679
so if you remember the speed of lights

709
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,000
a foot per nanosecond so you've got a

710
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,919
lot of nanoseconds in there if you're a

711
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,360
thousand kilometers apart to play with

712
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,678
and

713
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,000
the so the the trick in this experiment

714
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,320
is that alice involved can change the

715
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,279
direction of their detector

716
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,760
within the time it takes for the

717
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,320
entangled pair to get from the source to

718
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,760
the detectors

719
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,559
so if it takes 10 nanoseconds

720
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,559
to get from the source to the detectors

721
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:31,760
they have to be able to change their

722
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,080
detectors within 10 nanoseconds

723
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,840
so that's why you want detectors that

724
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,559
are far apart

725
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,360
so

726
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,440
alice and bob redo the experiment

727
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,440
changing randomly changing the

728
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,520
directions that they're measuring

729
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,399
uh with respect to their local z-axis

730
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,880
and then they get together again to

731
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,440
compare their results

732
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,799
and what they find is

733
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,039
that

734
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,679
if alice observes up

735
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,320
bob will observe down

736
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,360
uh

737
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,000
even when they've been randomly and

738
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,159
independently changing

739
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,600
the directions of their detectors

740
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,640
so

741
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,880
one way to put that is

742
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,399
if alice decides to rotate her detector

743
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,880
45 degrees

744
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,240
then bob's result will automatically be

745
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,919
rotated 45 degrees

746
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,880
and it's symmetrical so vice and vice

747
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,440
versa so that's not classical

748
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,200
correlation

749
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
that's classical correlation that's

750
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,200
robust against manipulation

751
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,360
so

752
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,960
i was discussing this with carl a while

753
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,159
back

754
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,880
and i used this example

755
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,519
of if you and i are classic or

756
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,840
classically correlated then we may have

757
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,679
the same beliefs

758
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,279
about something so we might both believe

759
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,679
that the earth is round

760
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,279
that's classical correlation

761
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,039
now suppose someone convinces me that

762
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,000
the earth is flat

763
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,360
if

764
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,919
if that happens and you then believe

765
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,760
that the earth is flat that's

766
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,279
entanglement

767
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,200
that's classical correlation that's

768
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,559
robust against manipulation

769
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,240
so it's it's correlation no kidding

770
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,600
uh

771
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,320
correlation that that survives the

772
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,399
environment doing something to you

773
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,799
and

774
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,399
so

775
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:49,760
uh

776
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,000
now let's go back to this question is

777
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,320
this is this an effect

778
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,120
that only occurs in some microscopic

779
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,120
domain

780
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,720
and

781
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,760
the answer is it's an effect that was

782
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,399
first described by a theory that was

783
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,960
intended to only describe a microscopic

784
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,960
domain right quantum theory was

785
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,799
developed to deal with nuclear and

786
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,360
atomic and nuclear physics

787
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,840
and so there's this idea of the quantum

788
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,120
world which is very small

789
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,919
but the math of course applies across

790
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,559
the board

791
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,240
and

792
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,480
trying to think of quantum

793
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,480
theory trying to think of classical

794
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,480
physics as a limit

795
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,600
a mathematical limit of quantum theory

796
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,559
always runs into problems and the

797
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,640
problems are always the numbers go to

798
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,840
infinity that shouldn't be infinity

799
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,640
so

800
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,919
it's not

801
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,559
really accurate to think of

802
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,159
classical physics as some sort of

803
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,640
mathematical limit like h bar goes to

804
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,880
zero

805
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,240
of

806
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,480
quantum theory because if h bar goes to

807
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,799
zero lots of relevant energies go to

808
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,360
infinity

809
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,640
um

810
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,399
and this is this has been known for a

811
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:11,679
long time

812
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,320
nonetheless it's it's constantly taught

813
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,519
in this

814
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,120
classical limit

815
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,200
kind of framework that isn't really

816
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,600
correct

817
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,360
um so one

818
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,640
point of of

819
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,039
doing bell epr experiments at larger and

820
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,640
larger distances

821
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,519
is to demonstrate that quantum theory is

822
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,840
not really a microscopic theory

823
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,600
so

824
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,600
if you think of an entangled state an

825
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,960
entangled state is one object

826
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,519
it's not two electrons that happen to

827
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,320
have some mysterious relationship it's

828
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,760
one object that has one state

829
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,720
remember what entanglement means is

830
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,200
non-separability non-independence

831
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,880
across any decompositional boundary

832
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,719
so an entangled pair is one thing

833
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,760
and

834
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,199
what the chinese were able to

835
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,800
demonstrate

836
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,679
was you can have one quantum object

837
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,560
that's over a thousand kilometers long

838
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,119
now that's not microscopic that's big

839
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,239
uh

840
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,079
a nice way to think about entanglement

841
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,280
was introduced by leonard soskin

842
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,280
quite a few years ago

843
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,918
and raphael busso

844
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,960
with their idea that

845
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,960
an entangled pair is the same thing as

846
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,239
an einstein rosen bridge in spacetime

847
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,040
and an einstein rosen bridge is a black

848
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,639
hole and a white hole

849
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,800
connected end to end

850
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,599
or you can think of it that way it's

851
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,960
it's a

852
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,119
topological connection in space time

853
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,839
that simply identifies two points in

854
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:01,520
space time that would otherwise be

855
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,599
considered distinct

856
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,200
so this emphasizes that

857
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,599
if you have an entangled pair there's no

858
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,880
distance inside it

859
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,680
if you have two entangled electrons for

860
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,440
example that are a thousand kilometers

861
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,480
apart

862
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,480
as far as they're concerned they're

863
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,320
right next to each other

864
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,560
and in fact as far as they're concerned

865
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,560
they're located at exactly the same

866
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,880
point in space time

867
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,520
and that's what this er bridge notion

868
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,680
emphasizes to us

869
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,839
uh there's really no separation here

870
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:37,920
that the separation is an artifact of

871
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,800
our observational capabilities it's not

872
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,000
a characteristic of the entangled state

873
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,240
so entanglement actually calls into

874
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,800
question what the idea of distance even

875
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,640
means

876
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,359
uh it makes it it forces it to be

877
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,599
relative to us and that's that's that's

878
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,119
why there's all this discussion of

879
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,119
emergent space time in quantum gravity

880
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,359
and quantum cosmology

881
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,160
because if you think about things from a

882
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,359
straight quantitary point of view

883
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,680
space time isn't observable it's it's

884
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,200
just something it's

885
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,440
it's something that's relative to how an

886
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,200
observation is made it's not an

887
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,599
intrinsic property of anything it's not

888
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,040
antique as they say

889
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,200
so

890
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,920
let's go back to this question again

891
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,359
uh

892
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:31,280
if we think about

893
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,599
entanglement

894
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,280
and we think about observation

895
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,720
and we think about entanglement as

896
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,760
something that's observed by comparing

897
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,839
observations made by different observers

898
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,000
right neither alice nor bob in that

899
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,520
experiment can detect entanglement

900
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,359
they only realize that there's an

901
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,200
entangled state when they talk to each

902
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,799
other after they've done the experiment

903
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,280
then

904
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,320
this question of scale

905
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,119
becomes a question about how observers

906
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,320
interact

907
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,280
and what observers can know

908
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,359
about each other

909
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,599
and about each other's experimental

910
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,000
apparatus

911
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,720
so when i described the

912
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,720
the entanglement experiment

913
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,599
i said alice and bob each have their own

914
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,880
local z-axis

915
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,280
and when they get together and they

916
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,839
discuss their

917
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:36,480
results

918
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,280
and they compare their results

919
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,119
then they make a very important

920
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,040
assumption which is the assumption that

921
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,960
their z axes are comparable

922
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,599
so if during the experiment

923
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,119
bob's z-axis was varying at random with

924
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,280
respect to alice's z-axis

925
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,560
then

926
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,480
their results comparing their results

927
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,920
would be meaningless

928
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,079
because they'd be measured with respect

929
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:08,320
to completely different reference frames

930
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,440
so we have to make this assumption that

931
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,040
they have the same z axis

932
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,520
now interestingly enough

933
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,800
that assumption by itself

934
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,280
tells you that alice and bob have to be

935
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,640
entangled

936
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:29,520
or their z axes have to be entangled

937
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,839
so

938
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:34,640
um the idea of entanglement

939
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,079
kind of

940
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,680
expands

941
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,640
to

942
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,680
take in all aspects of the experimental

943
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,280
situation

944
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,280
as soon as one starts unearthing

945
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,480
these assumptions that we make

946
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,720
to

947
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,680
talk about comparability between

948
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,599
experiments

949
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:58,640
so

950
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,359
let's reel the tape back about half an

951
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,040
hour

952
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,000
and we see that the quantum reference

953
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
frames are what make experiments

954
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,839
comparable for

955
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,640
an observer

956
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,359
it's similarity or comparability of

957
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,160
quantum reference frames that make

958
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,040
comparing experiments possible for two

959
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,599
observers

960
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,480
but

961
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,200
if the two observers exactly share their

962
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,119
qrfs

963
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,119
in a way that's robust against

964
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,359
environmental manipulation then they're

965
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:36,800
entangled

966
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,160
so we've kind of come

967
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,040
full circle here

968
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,800
it's one

969
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,599
one can make this notion of entanglement

970
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,440
as macroscopic as one likes

971
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,760
and

972
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:55,599
again this is um

973
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,240
in a sense why why quantum gravity and

974
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,720
quantum cosmology are interesting

975
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,200
um it's what drives things like the

976
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,000
black hole information paradox which

977
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,200
you may have

978
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,280
read about

979
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,839
um

980
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,880
so so so we're now getting into

981
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,839
in a sense very fundamental physics how

982
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:21,040
how do we

983
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,839
uh

984
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,359
what's the relationship between

985
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,359
entanglement and the concept of

986
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,119
space-time what's the relationship

987
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,200
between quantum theory and general

988
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,960
relativity

989
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,560
um

990
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,040
which is you know the big the big

991
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,440
question in in physics from one point of

992
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,880
view

993
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,839
oh

994
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,440
but the short answer is you can make

995
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,720
entanglement

996
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,759
as big as you want

997
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,440
that's great thank you um that actually

998
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,200
leads into a question that i had back

999
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,880
way back when we were talking about

1000
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,480
entanglement and quantum reference

1001
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,520
frames

1002
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,119
um so

1003
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,880
i was just thinking like

1004
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,319
if i cannot perfectly predict my own

1005
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:07,599
behavior

1006
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,160
is my quantum reference frame like

1007
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,560
incompletely aligned with my own quantum

1008
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,640
reference frame like i mean maybe we've

1009
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,280
all had the experience of you know

1010
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,119
predicting if i kick a ball in this way

1011
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,640
i predict it'll go over there but like

1012
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,640
it doesn't actually go over there so

1013
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,960
like i mean we predict and we're off our

1014
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,520
prediction is is not accurate so

1015
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,839
is it like the actually a temporal

1016
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,079
separation that that like makes that

1017
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,960
happen or or what do you think happens

1018
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,680
in those circumstances where my qrf

1019
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:42,078
appears unaligned with my own qrf

1020
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,839
now that's also that's also a beautiful

1021
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,599
deep question

1022
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:50,640
and

1023
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,319
it it points to something that i think

1024
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,760
can and should be stated as a general

1025
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,359
theorem

1026
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:00,960
which is

1027
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,720
uh no system can perfectly predict can

1028
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,640
perfectly predict its own state

1029
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,680
uh

1030
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,760
no system can observe its own state

1031
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,560
its own total state

1032
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,560
so

1033
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,839
so that

1034
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:27,440
situation is

1035
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:33,040
ubiquitous and unavoidable

1036
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:34,480
and

1037
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,240
uh one could phrase it by saying

1038
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,560
oh

1039
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,880
a system can have a

1040
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,400
a qrf or a meta processor as

1041
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,119
one often uses that vocabulary

1042
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:56,160
that represents itself so we all have a

1043
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,480
self representation

1044
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,880
that's in a sense metacognitive

1045
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,720
we claim to know what we believe and

1046
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,359
things like that

1047
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,599
but of course those beliefs are all

1048
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:15,119
one very coarse-grained uh two extremely

1049
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,119
incomplete

1050
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,480
of

1051
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,560
three useful for making predictions but

1052
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,960
they're often wrong

1053
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,200
and

1054
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,040
you know this is this is uh

1055
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,160
this point this point has had huge

1056
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,480
technological consequences i mean think

1057
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,000
back to the history of artificial

1058
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
intelligence

1059
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,760
right in the

1060
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,359
70s

1061
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:42,319
uh

1062
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,960
there was the the huge new

1063
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,680
wave was expert systems

1064
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,560
and

1065
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,200
you know ai people redefined themselves

1066
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,880
as knowledge engineers who were going to

1067
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,839
go out and

1068
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,839
interview experts and find out how

1069
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:57,920
experts did things and coded up in

1070
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,560
computers and soon we'd have

1071
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,480
you know artificial expert systems that

1072
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,800
did anything interesting

1073
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,839
and

1074
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:06,839
that

1075
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:11,440
whole business failed utterly

1076
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,920
right it was a complete disaster it

1077
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,359
didn't work at all

1078
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,119
why

1079
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,440
well the simple explanation for why is

1080
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,560
that experts can't tell you what they're

1081
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,880
doing

1082
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,400
expertise isn't verbalizable

1083
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,560
and it's not just expert piano playing

1084
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,240
is it verbalizable

1085
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,839
you know expert systems engineering is

1086
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,359
verbalizable expert computer programming

1087
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:39,839
isn't verbalizing

1088
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:40,880
uh

1089
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,520
and that's that's just an illustration

1090
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,520
of the fact that our meta processors

1091
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,760
don't actually have a complete model of

1092
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,119
the rest of us

1093
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,440
much less a model of the rest of us plus

1094
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,160
the metaprocessor

1095
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,160
uh so it all it all comes back to this

1096
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,400
general principle that a system can't

1097
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,119
represent itself and so it can't predict

1098
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,839
its own behavior

1099
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,520
awesome

1100
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,880
so between this work

1101
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,200
actually i should ask carl to comment on

1102
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,960
that tirade

1103
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,960
because he's also thought about this an

1104
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,240
extraordinary amount

1105
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:28,880
well i'll certainly make the comment

1106
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,240
that um that was marvellous you know

1107
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,839
i'm glad this has been recorded because

1108
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,240
this should certainly be transcribed and

1109
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,079
i know it's probably

1110
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:41,040
um implemented in the paper but it was

1111
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,599
so beautifully articulated and clear

1112
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:45,920
taking us through the issues i i really

1113
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,200
enjoyed that um so i have loads of

1114
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,560
comments but i won't i won't waste

1115
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,400
people's time uh going through all of

1116
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,119
them

1117
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:55,680
that last issue is is um really

1118
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,520
interesting about the meta processor or

1119
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,520
the metacognitive aspects or a system

1120
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,880
being able to measure itself i mean

1121
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,880
there's a fundamental observation there

1122
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,920
of course you know um you can't measure

1123
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,000
yourself

1124
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,079
the whole point of the

1125
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,400
particular physics paper was to say that

1126
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,319
you know yes there can be two kinds of

1127
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:17,280
information geometries if you like

1128
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,480
and the big move is that one system can

1129
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,200
measure i.e infer

1130
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,000
by possessing or having a movement on in

1131
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,800
some sort of information geometry

1132
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,160
infer

1133
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:34,240
and belief update about something else

1134
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,280
so at no point is there any room for it

1135
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,240
they also start to infer about its own

1136
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,440
inference

1137
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,880
that that is

1138
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,160
you know that's a mathematical

1139
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,000
impossibility from from the random

1140
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,680
dynamical system perspective i'm not

1141
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,520
sure about the uh the quantum

1142
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,960
perspective but it sounds as though

1143
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,119
that's also true so that begs the

1144
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:56,000
question and how on earth do we have the

1145
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,079
illusion um that we know ourselves um

1146
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,400
and of course you know

1147
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,640
it's a little bit of a um a colloquial

1148
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,839
question because you're 99.9 of things

1149
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:09,760
don't actually think that they know

1150
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,520
themselves so unless there's a

1151
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,079
particular phenotype particle

1152
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,319
or species

1153
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,880
that boasts philosophers i'm pretty sure

1154
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,839
that most of the things that exist

1155
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,680
don't have any

1156
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,760
any pretense to thinking that they know

1157
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,200
themselves

1158
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,280
it's a really interesting um point to

1159
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,400
get across

1160
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,920
anecdotally

1161
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,760
you know i spend a lot of time

1162
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,119
um taking people through examples

1163
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:38,559
they'll probably go right back to things

1164
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:41,119
like idea motor theory um

1165
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,280
that you know the way that we

1166
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,079
um the way that we develop a sense of

1167
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,240
agency and think that we have a sense of

1168
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,040
agency you know is a gift an illusion

1169
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,680
that is probably unique to only a small

1170
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,880
number of us and may not even be

1171
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,880
available to people with say severe

1172
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:57,920
autism

1173
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:58,880
um

1174
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,079
and

1175
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:01,920
you know the example that i've literally

1176
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,240
in the past day just written down in a

1177
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:08,480
didactic way was that if you just take

1178
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,359
um

1179
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:11,920
vanilla active inference under a markov

1180
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,319
blanket

1181
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:15,440
and then

1182
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,440
you

1183
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,240
look at particular kinds of sparsity

1184
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,680
structures where

1185
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,480
the active states of the markov blanket

1186
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,720
or the holographic screen

1187
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,640
are hidden from the internal state so

1188
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,119
these are special kinds of systems

1189
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:32,839
i have a particular

1190
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:36,640
sparsity where now the active states of

1191
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,119
the markov blanket are now become hidden

1192
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,440
from the internal states

1193
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,920
and you can certainly license

1194
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,720
some

1195
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,559
entanglement

1196
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:49,280
and i would um i'm gonna later ask about

1197
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,640
the relationship between entanglement

1198
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,880
and synchronization so i'll say

1199
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,200
entanglement or synchronization

1200
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,480
of the internal states such that the

1201
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,280
internal states have beliefs about

1202
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,920
the their action but those beliefs

1203
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,240
become beliefs about action as a hidden

1204
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,960
cause so there's absolutely no notion

1205
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,440
from the inside that you cause that

1206
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,599
you're just representing the cause so

1207
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:17,119
the example i have in mind is you're

1208
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:19,359
watching a little fish swimming around

1209
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,200
looking for food gobbling up little bits

1210
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,680
and particles of food and you think oh

1211
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,160
that's a very sort of artful fish with

1212
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,800
purpose and pragmatics and knows how to

1213
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,319
navigate its world um

1214
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:34,720
but from the point of view of the fish

1215
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,200
all that is happening is that the water

1216
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,760
and the particles are moving around it

1217
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,520
in a benevolent

1218
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,400
nurturing and fortuitous way such that

1219
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,160
the water is

1220
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,160
delivering food particles to the fish's

1221
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,160
mouth so from the fish's point of view

1222
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,040
it has absolutely no awareness that it

1223
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,920
is the author or the agent that's

1224
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,079
causing this synchronization with the

1225
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,079
environment so

1226
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:02,480
you know the the deeper question is how

1227
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,079
on earth do we have the illusion that we

1228
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:06,640
think we know our own our own agency and

1229
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,960
how would and when do we develop agency

1230
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,559
and you know

1231
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,720
furthermore

1232
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,960
it's not just agency about me it's

1233
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,520
agency about other things at what point

1234
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,640
do our uh in our say early neonatal

1235
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,160
neurodevelopment

1236
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,440
do we have these models of the world

1237
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,000
that enable us to

1238
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,880
distinguish between mother and self you

1239
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,319
know and at what point do we

1240
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:37,599
align our qrs if you like

1241
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:40,720
with not mother but with the world

1242
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,680
that enables us to now see mother as an

1243
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,079
independent object uh so that is

1244
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:49,119
something else that is an agent

1245
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:49,920
and

1246
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,079
you know the idea would then be well

1247
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:54,480
perhaps if mother is nature perhaps i am

1248
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,960
an asian and then you know

1249
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,440
that i am now the author of my agency

1250
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,599
and my actions but that is such a you

1251
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:03,440
know that's such a high level thing i

1252
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,079
imagine it only pertains to you know

1253
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:08,160
to humans

1254
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,520
that's what that's what i had said i'd

1255
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,480
love to talk about um

1256
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,720
the homologues of entanglement from the

1257
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,280
point of view of classical

1258
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,960
perhaps i've spoken enough at this point

1259
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:26,000
um just a couple things uh came came to

1260
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,480
my mind uh listening to this um what one

1261
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,040
is that uh josh bongard had this uh

1262
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,880
amazing uh paper and uh i think it was

1263
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,920
about in 2006 or so where he had these

1264
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,599
robots and these they were they started

1265
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,920
out like a six-legged starfish but the

1266
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,200
the cool thing about it was that they

1267
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,920
didn't have an internal model of what

1268
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,680
they were and or what their shape is or

1269
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,520
how to move and they basically have to

1270
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,880
flop around and make make models of uh

1271
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,640
their own structure based on what

1272
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,640
happened to them given various outputs

1273
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,319
that they generated and eventually they

1274
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:58,480
would build a model of what happens and

1275
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,720
they would walk around and so on and two

1276
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,480
interesting things followed one is that

1277
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,480
you could unlike traditional robotics

1278
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,240
you could rip off one of the legs and

1279
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,839
they would very soon revise the model

1280
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:09,520
and keep going in different ways so they

1281
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,680
weren't tied to that particular self

1282
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,880
model right they would have to discover

1283
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,559
it from scratch but it was still sort of

1284
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,000
plastic throughout their whole lifetime

1285
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,200
and they could they could get along so

1286
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,880
they had that plasticity and the other

1287
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,200
thing is that and um chris christophe

1288
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,200
adami wrote a nice uh kind of uh

1289
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,440
interpretation piece of this he he

1290
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,319
described they they spent lots of um

1291
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:30,319
lots of time being completely inactive

1292
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:32,400
and basically running through uh

1293
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,160
quote-unquote mentally running through

1294
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,760
all the different things that they could

1295
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,119
do and what they think was going to

1296
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,599
happen uh before they actually moved and

1297
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:40,800
so you go

1298
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,800
chris uh call that uh dreaming you know

1299
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,480
that they would basically sort of play

1300
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,720
out uh before you know in between their

1301
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,839
actual motions where they would go

1302
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:49,440
around testing it they would actually

1303
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,680
sort of play this out internally and try

1304
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,839
to refine the model such that then when

1305
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:55,599
they do move they would actually make

1306
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:57,839
movements that uh maximally sort of

1307
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:59,200
distinguish the different different

1308
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,119
possible models and so on anything you

1309
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:02,240
know you said that you can watch them

1310
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,040
dreaming about about their shape um so

1311
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,240
and then the other thing i just wanted

1312
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:10,079
to briefly mention this this idea of uh

1313
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,000
when and how do you recognize that

1314
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,599
you're an agent and that actually you

1315
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,680
need to act for things to happen versus

1316
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:16,960
just having the environment do things

1317
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,760
too i suspect that one of the things

1318
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,480
that drives it very early on is this is

1319
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,960
this notion of stress and i don't have a

1320
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,000
particular

1321
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,119
uh

1322
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:28,880
i don't have a theory of why stress

1323
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,040
feels stressful but but just on a purely

1324
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,119
functional level i think that what

1325
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:36,079
happens in in cells you know so so very

1326
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:37,920
early long before you get to humans or

1327
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,839
anything like that i think that what you

1328
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:42,720
get is this um

1329
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,960
this is a set of mechanisms that that

1330
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,000
evolved from things like uh stress about

1331
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,920
protein folding and so on but then then

1332
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,160
basically scaled up to be stress about

1333
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,720
metabolics and stress about morphology

1334
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,040
and stress about behavioral issues and

1335
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,680
and so on that basically is a is a

1336
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,960
system-wide metric of um

1337
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,119
the delta between what's going on and

1338
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:06,880
what you'd like to have going on right

1339
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,640
the delta between your set point and

1340
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,119
then what's happening now and what then

1341
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:13,200
i think that drives a strengthening of

1342
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,000
this uh of of the agency model because

1343
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,400
what will happen is as you as you as you

1344
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,319
slowly learn that you can do things that

1345
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:22,640
reduce the stress level it kind of

1346
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,319
solidifies this idea that it's actually

1347
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:26,640
at least some amount of it is up to you

1348
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,800
to make life better and and so you then

1349
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,480
then act and of course we know that

1350
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,680
breaks down and sort of learn

1351
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,440
helplessness assays and so on that's

1352
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,359
that's that that really is is very

1353
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:37,359
traumatic for for all kinds of creatures

1354
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:40,319
well be long human

1355
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,720
can i can i speak to that because

1356
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,200
there's some great points there please

1357
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,640
yeah um so three really important uh

1358
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,720
things being brought to the table there

1359
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:51,680
um

1360
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,559
so

1361
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:54,319
i'm bound to forget the third one if i

1362
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:55,920
start the first one i just want to so

1363
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,839
i'm coming back to blue's um

1364
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:00,559
question about sort of a um qrs and

1365
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,400
alignment and that and

1366
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,119
you know one obvious sounds that um what

1367
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:06,720
could bring to the table is that

1368
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,680
learning is the alignment of the qrs so

1369
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,400
learning at all scales you know and

1370
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,400
we're talking here about developmental

1371
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,319
skills for example we're talking about

1372
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,480
robots that learn to repair themselves

1373
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,520
or learn their new qrfs and if we remove

1374
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,119
a limb or a child

1375
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:24,400
learning to

1376
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,240
make sense of its world

1377
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:30,480
then um you can look at the slow process

1378
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,440
of alignment of the qrs the things that

1379
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,920
are invariant over the faster time

1380
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,400
scales of at which there is

1381
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:42,400
classification exchange on or in

1382
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,680
the holographic

1383
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,400
screen as simply

1384
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,400
a um movement from a state of um

1385
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,839
disentanglement to a state of

1386
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:55,119
entanglement um as you become better and

1387
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:56,559
better at predicting but to become

1388
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,319
better at predicting you have to align

1389
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:00,000
your qrs you have to

1390
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,240
to align that um i think the sort of the

1391
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,559
robot example is a perfect uh a nice

1392
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,160
illustration of that

1393
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,920
in the sense that these robots were

1394
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:08,960
equipped

1395
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,280
with um the ability to learn about

1396
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,880
themselves and of course the you know

1397
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,920
the analog um in developmental

1398
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,520
psychology and indeed i would imagine

1399
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,359
developmental neurobotics

1400
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:22,400
um is motor babbling it's basically you

1401
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,440
know

1402
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,640
soliciting

1403
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:25,839
um

1404
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:27,599
outcomes

1405
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:30,799
sensory outcomes in order to start to

1406
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:32,880
disambiguate between what did i call

1407
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,040
that or did you cause that you know what

1408
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,160
parts are apparently under my control

1409
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,240
but of course you know that's a very

1410
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,000
anthropomorphic interpretation there's

1411
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,720
no minus or minus implicit but certainly

1412
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,599
the learning of the world models and the

1413
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:50,400
body models um is probably the first

1414
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,040
thing that any artifact has to contend

1415
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,040
with because you see that in children

1416
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,610
you're shaking their rattle to to

1417

[Music]

1418
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,319
solicit and

1419
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:04,160
actively solicit

1420
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,359
the conjunction of visual motion

1421
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:09,440
um proprioceptive feedback from the

1422

muscles causing the movement of the

1423
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:15,200
mobile or the rattle and the auditory so

1424
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,680
soliciting uh conjunctions or

1425
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,319
correlations that are explainable and

1426
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:22,160
predictable

1427
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,319
in multiple modalities

1428
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:27,520
so you may then ask why on earth what is

1429
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,799
the imperative for that kind of behavior

1430
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:32,960
what drives action

learn

1433
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:41,280
the

00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,680
the correlations and the coincidences

1435
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,079
and the conjunctions um and that brings

1436
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:49,599
us to the second point um

1437
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:51,359
[Music]

1438
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,839
these robots

1439
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:56,160
dreaming tell you immediately that at

1440
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,359
some level

1441
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:01,119
they have an internal model

1442
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:04,400
of the consequences of action

1443
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,079
and that tells you immediately that

1444
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:07,280
you've got

1445
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,559
if you wanted to write that down from

1446
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:09,920
the point of view of classical active

1447
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,599
inference you've got a

1448
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:12,480
um

1449
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,760
a belief

1450
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,040
structure

1451
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,119
on the inside

1452
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,040
that covers both

1453
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,400
the

1454
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,359
covers both the external world

1455
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:26,319
and these hidden actions and the actions

1456
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:28,559
upon the of the world and the

1457
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:31,280
consequences of those actions on the

1458
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,960
external states that's a very

1459
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,359
sophisticated generative model to have

1460
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:37,119
and you're getting now into the world of

1461
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:39,599
planning as inference so a thermostat

1462
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,000
won't work doesn't have that and yet

1463
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,319
these robots do have them so it tells

1464
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:47,520
you that there are two natural kinds of

1465
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,000
particles that mark off blankets

1466
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,280
[Music]

1467
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,079
um at least two kinds of one of which is

1468
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,760
more like a thermostat and one of which

1469
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,160
is more like um

1470
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,640
a sort of um i was thinking sort of like

1471
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,559
an ashby um

1472
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:04,960
homeostat or alistar but certainly more

1473
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,119
like these sort of uh robots that can

1474
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:10,000
learn about about themselves and the cue

1475
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:10,880
and the

1476
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,400
crucial distinction i think is that the

1477
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,240
agent has now started to represent the

1478
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,960
consequences of its actions but without

1479
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,799
realizing it's its own actions we still

1480
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:22,480
haven't got to the level of the other

1481
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,119
metacognitive i am aware kind of kind of

1482
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:26,559
artifact

1483
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:29,119
and interesting it comes back to

1484
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:31,280
what i was saying before about natural

1485
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,599
kinds where one's active states are

1486
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:35,280
hidden from the internal state so they

1487
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,040
have to become inferred

1488
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,640
you have to infer them they don't

1489
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,680
they're not they are opaque to the

1490
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,000
internal states and as soon as you say

1491
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
it like that then you're naturally

1492
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,280
talking about systems that um

1493
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,319
can effectively uh

1494
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:54,960
engage in planning as imprints so they

1495
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,520
have to have plans in their heads

1496
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,760
uh in order to act which you know

1497
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,280
corresponds to

1498
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,359
to this dreaming um from the point of

1499
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:04,880
view of the

1500
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,000
uh the

1501
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,680
active inference

1502
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,920
um then you ask what are the objective

1503
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,280
functions

1504
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,680
um or what are the principles of least

1505
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,200
action that would

1506
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,640
um

1507
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:17,680
apply

1508
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,599
to these kinds of plans and when you

1509
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:20,880
work it through

1510
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,920
then one important component of

1511
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,200
the

1512
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,680
sort of the pathogens or the actions in

1513
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:28,720
question

1514
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:29,520
is

1515
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:32,319
a drive to resolve uncertainty

1516
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:34,559
so we come back to this notion of the

1517
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:36,880
child soliciting proprioceptive

1518
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,580
extraceptive

1519
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:39,920
[Music]

1520
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,480
sensations that enable it to resolve

1521
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,559
uncertainty and this is exactly the same

1522
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:46,240
principle behind the optimal bayesian

1523
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,799
design that we design experiments

1524
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:50,240
that are going to resolve the

1525
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,559
uncertainty to the greatest extent

1526
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:54,559
possible under our current internal

1527
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:56,640
models or hypotheses about how the world

1528
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,599
works

1529
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,520
and that brings me to the third great

1530
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:00,720
point

1531
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,559
about stress

1532
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:03,280
and

1533
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,240
the

1534
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:07,359
the really important

1535
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,119
place of stress and uncertainty and

1536
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:13,440
angst and not knowing what to do next or

1537
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,839
not knowing what's going to work

1538
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:19,359
in driving behavior because if a large

1539
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:21,760
chunk of the imperatives

1540
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:22,640
or

1541
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,880
planned action

1542
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,240
is to maximize information gain

1543
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,520
or

1544
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,400
minimize expected surprisal or reduce

1545
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,920
uncertainty then you can see easily now

1546
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,400
why it is situations of uncertainty and

1547
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,280
stress that will necessarily

1548
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,119
cause the most

1549
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:44,559
epistemic

1550
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:47,599
responses in order to drive the system

1551
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:49,119
or the the

1552
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:51,359
in this instance the agent

1553
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:53,680
to resolve that uncertainty

1554
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,520
the final point now and this is

1555
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,359
basically paraphrasing what mike just

1556
01:01:57,359 --> 01:01:58,240
said

1557
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,640
if the system sees itself

1558
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,400
behaving more

1559
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,079
in times of greater uncertainty it may

1560
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,839
now learn that

1561
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:10,240
and and now have the idea oh i am the

1562
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,680
kind of system

1563
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,599
or i am behaving as if i am the kind of

1564
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:16,720
system that responds more when under

1565
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,000
stress

1566
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,520
and then you'll become aware of that and

1567
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,359
then you can get into the psychiatric or

1568
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:23,359
psychological aspects of stress you may

1569
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:25,359
not if you're just a pro gene you may

1570
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:27,599
just show a sort of um

1571
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:29,440
sort of selection for selectability like

1572
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,240
response um but there's you know the i

1573
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,640
think that you know the two fundamental

1574
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,400
mechanisms the imperatives that are

1575
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,039
being fulfilled here in accord with

1576
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:40,880
basic conservation laws or principles of

1577
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,480
least action from the classical

1578
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,520
perspective um are account for exactly

1579
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,200
the same kind of behavior i think the

1580
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,480
interesting thing about stress and

1581
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,839
surgery though is that we're not talking

1582
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:50,799
about

1583
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:51,599
um

1584
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:55,119
the um the content of implicit belief

1585
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:57,760
structures but the the the second order

1586
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,160
statistics the uncertainty

1587
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,319
and that's i think you know brings a

1588
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:04,000
whole level of analysis to the table

1589
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,400
because once you talk about uncertainty

1590
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,039
and representations of uncertainty

1591
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:11,920
um in say internal states

1592
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:12,720
um

1593
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,720
then from a psychological perspective

1594
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,240
you can start to talk about tension and

1595
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,559
consciousness um from the point of view

1596
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:19,920
of an engineer we're talking about

1597
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,760
things like calm and gain and get

1598
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,079
getting the estimates of noise levels if

1599
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:27,839
you like uh correct um

1600
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:28,559
and

1601
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:30,480
i'm not sure what

1602
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:31,359
what

1603
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:32,240
where

1604
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:35,119
the if you like the well

1605
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:37,920
let me ask um from a quantum theoretic

1606
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,839
point of view

1607
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:41,839
is uncertainty baked internet can you

1608
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:44,400
can you have a stressed quantum

1609
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,720
quantum formulation

1610
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,799
i'll put that out there well stop

1611
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:52,200
talking now

1612
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,799
yeah just uh just to answer that

1613
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:02,000
question

1614
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,240
uh

1615
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,760
if if when if one

1616
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,880
thinks about quantum theory

1617
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,480
of

1618
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,119
from with a bayesian view of probability

1619
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:16,400
right with a

1620
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,240
kind of subjectivist notion of

1621
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,240
probability

1622
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,440
um

1623
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,319
which

1624
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:23,920
i mean that

1625
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,520
point of view was really pioneered by

1626
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,799
chris fuchs and and now david merman for

1627
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:31,599
example has taken it up and

1628
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:34,079
written some very good things about it

1629
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:35,520
um

1630
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,839
then this notion of uncertainty

1631
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:40,640
reduction

1632
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,319
of

1633
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:44,400
becomes the explanation for why you do

1634
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,680
experiments and build theories and and

1635
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:50,319
it all becomes very well aligned i think

1636
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:52,799
with with

1637
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:55,760
the idea of active inference and in fact

1638
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:56,880
we

1639
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,079
we

1640
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:00,319
wrote into that paper at the very end

1641
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:02,079
some remark about

1642
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:03,760
uh

1643
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:06,079
this cubist perspective about quantum

1644
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:08,000
theory becoming a result not an

1645
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,160
interpretation

1646
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,079
when we think of of

1647
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:14,799
quantum theory is in a sense a way of

1648
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:16,720
reformulating the idea of active

1649
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:17,839
inference

1650
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:20,160
out

1651
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,400
so i think they're very consistent

1652
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,520
right

1653
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,680
uh

1654
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:29,119
a stressed a stressed quantum is

1655
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:30,240
uh

1656
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,400
stress quantum system is just a system

1657
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,359
that gets

1658
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:35,200
uh observational outcomes that it

1659
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,839
doesn't expect

1660
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:40,960
so you know we

1661
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,440
we have to think of

1662
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,839
such systems as

1663
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:49,280
having generative models

1664
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,839
and thinking about

1665
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:55,759
the generative model of an electron

1666
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:57,920
uh is a bit of a stretch

1667
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,200
right because

1668
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,760
the electron

1669
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,400
is only characterized by mass charge and

1670
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,160
angular momentum

1671
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:07,920
so

1672
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,240
it can't really

1673
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,039
have

1674
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:13,920
expectations about much right an

1675
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,799
electron can have no expectations about

1676
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:21,280
the external electric field for example

1677
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,920
it can detect that it can respond to it

1678
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:29,520
but it can't predict it

1679
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,319
and

1680
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:33,839
if we think about

1681
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:36,880
something like an electron

1682
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,000
then

1683
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,520
we can focus in on this idea that having

1684
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:44,400
a generative model

1685
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,079
requires having enough memory

1686
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:49,280
to

1687
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:51,440
keep a record of the most recent

1688
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,640
observation at least the most recent one

1689
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:55,920
and if you want to have a good

1690
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,520
generative model then you better have

1691
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,760
enough memory to keep a record of quite

1692
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,720
a number of observations

1693
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,079
and

1694
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:07,839
it's this memory resource

1695
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:10,799
that really simple things like electrons

1696
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:14,000
don't have

1697
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:14,960
so

1698
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:15,920
uh

1699
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:18,000
they're they're not great

1700
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,920
predictors

1701
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,839
um

1702
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:23,599
because they don't have the memory to

1703
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:25,039
allow

1704
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:27,440
being a great predictor

1705
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:30,640
and as as both

1706
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,559
carl and mike were saying

1707
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:33,599
um

1708
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:35,520
in a sense you you have to have memory

1709
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:38,160
to be able to feel stress

1710
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,680
you have to know that your predictions

1711
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,760
were wrong so you have to remember what

1712
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:44,960
your predictions were

1713
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:49,520
so memory becomes a really key component

1714
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,599
of the theory

1715
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:52,480
how

1716
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,119
once you put it into this

1717
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:57,440
language

1718
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,359
because the language in a sense forces

1719
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:01,039
you to

1720
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:03,200
to lay out assumptions about what the

1721
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,839
what the computational resources that

1722
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:06,960
are being

1723
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:10,000
required are

1724
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,880
that wasn't very coherent but anyway i i

1725
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,880
just wanted to stress the role of memory

1726
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,479
here

1727
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:19,839
perfect thank you carl

1728
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,719
yeah just to reinforce and endorse that

1729
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:26,560
last point um and uh just tell exactly

1730
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,439
the same story in a much more pragmatic

1731
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:32,319
way the point of view a statistician so

1732
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:35,040
i heard chris say that basically

1733
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:38,158
that if i want to go beyond being a

1734
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:40,960
little electron or a thermostat and i

1735
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:44,960
want to now um infer the quality of how

1736
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,198
noisy are my sensors for example my

1737
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:49,759
thermo sensors if i'm a thermostat that

1738
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:51,439
will require me becoming a little

1739
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:53,520
statistician and what does that mean

1740
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,359
well basically i'm going to be

1741
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:58,319
estimating the standard error or the um

1742
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:00,238
the experimental variance there's

1743
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:02,238
something quite important about that you

1744
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:04,399
know which which

1745
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:06,719
comes back exactly to the computational

1746
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:09,600
resources and memory if you do a simple

1747
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,679
t-test as a statistician on some

1748
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:14,158
experimental data you necessarily have

1749
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:16,719
to acquire lots of data points and store

1750
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:17,520
them

1751
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,399
and of course that is just the degrees

1752
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:23,600
of freedom associated with your t-test

1753
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:26,399
or your f-test so the degrees of freedom

1754
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:28,560
score the number of data points that

1755
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,198
you'll be able to remember and you need

1756
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:33,759
a sufficient number in order to get a

1757
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:36,560
precise estimate of the uncertainty so

1758
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,399
literally the degrees of freedom in

1759
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:41,439
classical statistics is literally

1760
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:45,198
a statistic that scores your confidence

1761
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:48,158
in the estimation of the standard error

1762
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:50,000
which is pooled over

1763
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,158
multiple observations

1764
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:54,960
which is an attempt to estimate on

1765
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:58,640
average if i observe with this kind of

1766
01:09:58,640 --> 01:09:59,920
or i

1767
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:02,320
i asked my questions or i wrote to my

1768
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:06,080
holographic screen and i or i um

1769
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:09,199
solicited these sensory states um you

1770
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:09,920
know

1771
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:10,960
what would

1772
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,760
on average what would the uncertainty be

1773
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,520
associated with it so i think it's a

1774
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:16,960
really important point about the

1775
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,800
computational resources the degrees of

1776
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,960
freedom literally in the sense of the

1777
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,960
degrees of freedom associated with your

1778
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:25,360
f test all the degrees of freedom you

1779
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:27,600
have available for the computing power

1780
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,080
to actually get up to these second order

1781
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,560
inference machines or takes on on second

1782
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,440
order inference so and i think that is

1783
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,199
particularly important when it comes

1784
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:39,199
back to mike's observation about stress

1785
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:42,080
and uncertainty and these higher order

1786
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,400
ways of making sense in the world but in

1787
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:47,040
this instance making a sense of

1788
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:50,159
sensations that are accrued over time

1789
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:51,840
not about the content but about the

1790
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,920
reliability of the or the precision of

1791
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,440
that content so this is a really

1792
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,839
important point

1793
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,600
awesome

1794
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:06,320
so that kind of oh chris go ahead

1795
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:09,120
if i could just pick up on this and and

1796
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,080
take it in yet another highly related

1797
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,120
direction

1798
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,440
it's just to point out that that all of

1799
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:18,000
these resources are energetically

1800
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,760
expensive

1801
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:23,120
so if i'm going to devote

1802
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:29,280
space in in my state space to recording

1803
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,600
memories

1804
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:32,480
then

1805
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,800
that's only useful if i can defend those

1806
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,960
memories against entropy

1807
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,679
if i can keep them from decaying

1808
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:42,320
so i've got to consume energy to write

1809
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:44,080
the memories i've got to consume

1810
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:46,480
energies to energy to maintain the

1811
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:47,840
memories

1812
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,520
and then i have to consume energy to

1813
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,120
read the memories

1814
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,840
and consume energy

1815
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:55,199
to compare

1816
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:58,480
what i've read with what i see with my

1817
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,040
kind of current event sensors

1818
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:02,159
so

1819
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:05,040
as we start adding these computational

1820
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,840
resources to systems the energy budget

1821
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,760
goes way up

1822
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:10,880
and

1823
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,440
uh it's it's another

1824
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,199
kind of

1825
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:18,159
thing to keep in mind as we think about

1826
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:20,880
these in terms of embodied forms whether

1827
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,280
they're robots or organisms

1828
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:25,519
that

1829
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:30,640
these these entities are extracting

1830
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:33,360
this free energy that they have to have

1831
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,280
to run their computations and maintain

1832
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,960
their memories and all that from the

1833
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,800
environment

1834
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:42,159
so here's this is another input that in

1835
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:44,719
a sense is not sensory

1836
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:46,800
but it's still having to flow through

1837
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,800
the markov blanket and still having to

1838
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,800
flow through the boundary between the

1839
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,719
system and its environment

1840
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:53,840
and

1841
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:56,159
a lot of the systems actions on its

1842
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:57,280
environment

1843
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:01,440
it's expenditures of of um of its own

1844
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:04,320
internal energy

1845
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:07,679
are to acquire this free energy

1846
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:09,520
so you know we

1847
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,520
we go out and

1848
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,679
shop for groceries make breakfast or

1849
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:14,880
whatever

1850
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,199
uh that's stuff that we have to do to

1851
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:18,400
keep all these

1852
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:21,360
processes running

1853
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,400
so it ties metabolism and cognition

1854
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,199
together in a way that they aren't often

1855
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:29,360
tied but that they have to be to make

1856
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:33,320
sense of what's going on

1857
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:36,239
great

1858
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:39,600
so just on that point um something that

1859
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:40,880
we had

1860
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,960
written down as a question from last

1861
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,560
time

1862
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:47,040
and in terms of

1863
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,600
an electron having a generative model

1864
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,920
and discussing agency we had talked

1865
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,159
about free choice and it was brought up

1866
01:13:54,159 --> 01:13:55,280
in the paper

1867
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,600
several times both in terms of like any

1868
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,000
physical system having free choice if if

1869
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
one physical system has free choice they

1870
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,400
all have free choice they generate like

1871
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:07,360
their their um noise generating things

1872
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,040
like free choice generates noise in both

1873
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,600
classical and quantum systems and so i

1874
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,120
just was wondering if

1875
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:16,239
you could maybe say a few words about

1876
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:18,400
the difference in free choice

1877
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:21,679
in an electron and the difference in

1878
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:23,760
between between an electron ends like a

1879
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:26,880
human or an animal or even a cell

1880
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,880
what is that difference and is that also

1881
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:32,000
related to memory

1882
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,400
uh

1883
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:41,280
is that a question for me

1884
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:42,960
a general question

1885
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:45,600
for anyone

1886
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,800
well i'll make a couple of comments

1887
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,040
uh

1888
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,840
one is

1889
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:54,880
uh

1890
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:57,199
remember in talking about the canonical

1891
01:14:57,199 --> 01:14:59,600
entanglement experiment

1892
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:00,480
um

1893
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:02,719
part of the description is that alice

1894
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:05,199
and bob can

1895
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:06,560
alter

1896
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:10,640
the directions of their detectors

1897
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,400
however they want to at random

1898
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:13,760
independently

1899
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:15,760
whatever you want to call it

1900
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:18,159
during the experiment so that's the free

1901
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:20,480
choice assumption or that's called in

1902
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:24,480
physics the free choice assumption

1903
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:25,360
and

1904
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:29,600
what that assumption means

1905
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,239
it's effectively an assumption of

1906
01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:33,679
independence

1907
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:35,280
it means

1908
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:39,280
that there's not some common cause in

1909
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,840
the past

1910
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:46,400
that determines what they're going to do

1911
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:50,400
as they operate their detectors

1912
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:55,799
and one can reformulate

1913
01:15:56,159 --> 01:15:58,480
quantum theory

1914
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:01,120
of in terms of what's called super

1915
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:04,000
determinism

1916
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:07,440
and super determinism

1917
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,920
is the idea that

1918
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:15,120
there is some common cause in the past

1919
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:16,159
that

1920
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:18,159
determines

1921
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:21,840
how experimenters are going to do their

1922
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,400
experiments

1923
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:27,840
and in particular determines how alice

1924
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,480
and bob are going to rotate their

1925
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:35,199
detectors in this epr experiment

1926
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:37,519
and

1927
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,800
super determinism is kind of the

1928
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:44,719
ultimate non-local hidden variable

1929
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:45,920
wow

1930
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:47,120
so

1931
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:49,520
it

1932
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:52,640
it allows you to predict exactly what

1933
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:55,120
entangled pairs are going to do and in

1934
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:58,800
fact it renders entanglement a classical

1935
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,000
effect

1936
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,760
right it just says these these

1937
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:07,120
kind of super classical correlations

1938
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:09,040
are present

1939
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,880
because there

1940
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:14,400
there was no independence to begin with

1941
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,560
everything was determined from the very

1942
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:18,320
beginning

1943
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:21,280
and if you think about

1944
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,840
as as mentioned last time newtonian

1945
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:27,440
physics is formulated by laplace

1946
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:30,000
it's a super determinant deterministic

1947
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,320
system

1948
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:35,520
so anything that happens anywhere in the

1949
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:36,719
universe

1950
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:38,719
instantly affects what's going on

1951
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:41,600
everywhere else in the universe

1952
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,600
and the most the most

1953
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:46,880
current formulation of that is bromine

1954
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,640
quantum mechanics where the motion of

1955
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:50,000
any particle

1956
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,320
depends instantaneously on the motion of

1957
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,800
every other particle in the universe

1958
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:57,440
and that's how newtonian gravity worked

1959
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:00,640
right before einstein imposed locality

1960
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:03,679
by making the speed of light finite

1961
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,280
so all of these things are

1962
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,360
interconnected assumptions about space

1963
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:09,199
time assumptions about the speed of

1964
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:11,280
communication assumptions about super

1965
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:12,640
determinism

1966
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:15,360
and assumptions about

1967
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:18,000
free choice

1968
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,760
it's

1969
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,560
that cluster of assumptions

1970
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:25,280
that the so-called free will theorem in

1971
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:27,520
physics is about or theorems there are

1972
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:29,120
now a couple of them

1973
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,600
due to conway and cocon

1974
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,679
and

1975
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:36,719
what those theorems show is that

1976
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:40,920
from a formal perspective

1977
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,719
in physics if you assume that some

1978
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:47,520
system has free choice so if you assume

1979
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:49,840
that some system

1980
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:53,120
is not subject to super determinism

1981
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,600
then you have to assume that all systems

1982
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:58,000
have free choice in the sense that all

1983
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,920
systems are not subject to super

1984
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:02,239
determinism so you can't limit super

1985
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:04,239
determinism to some little piece of the

1986
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:05,280
universe

1987
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:08,239
and say it only applies here uh it

1988
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:10,159
doesn't apply anywhere else

1989
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:12,960
and in particular it doesn't apply to me

1990
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,719
i have free choice even though nothing

1991
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:16,000
else does

1992
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,239
that's mathematically inconsistent

1993
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:23,440
so that's that's

1994
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:26,080
what what the free choice assumption

1995
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:28,560
means is in a strict

1996
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:31,679
physical context

1997
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:34,840
thank you very

1998
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:39,440
cool new zealand do you have a question

1999
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,719
i was just going to ask a little bit

2000
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:45,440
more about the um the degrees of

2001
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:47,679
entanglement and

2002
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:49,360
whether that's

2003
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,760
different in terms of the observers

2004
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:54,159
degrees and

2005
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:56,560
versus the like

2006
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,480
the mechanical nature of quantum

2007
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,640
mechanics degrees

2008
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:01,600
um

2009
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:02,800
i think you've answered that to some

2010
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,480
extent but

2011
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:06,400
just just the way that that

2012
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,400
varying degrees of entanglement can be

2013
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,239
thought about and whether that maybe

2014
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:12,800
ties into how the hilbert space

2015
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:17,880
is is thought about at the same time

2016
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,719
yeah this this assumption

2017
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:27,520
or this question touches on uh why we do

2018
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:28,960
everything in the paper from the point

2019
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:32,320
of view of a bipartite decomposition

2020
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,719
so we always we always decompose into a

2021
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:38,400
system in its environment in the paper

2022
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,920
um

2023
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:40,719
and

2024
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:43,040
there are two reasons for that

2025
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:46,560
one is to keep it simple

2026
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,719
and the other ones to enforce the more

2027
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:51,840
called blanket condition

2028
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:54,080
so

2029
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,239
it's

2030
01:20:56,239 --> 01:20:58,400
entirely commonplace

2031
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,360
to do physics in an open systems

2032
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:02,719
framework

2033
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:04,560
where we talk about

2034
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,880
um

2035
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:09,040
two systems we can call them alice and

2036
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:11,199
bob again

2037
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:12,800
that are embedded in a common

2038
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:15,120
environment

2039
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,239
and

2040
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:18,719
in that case whenever you have

2041
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:21,520
a tripartite or greater

2042
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:23,760
some sort of multi-particle kind of

2043
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:26,400
decomposition of the state space

2044
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:27,920
you can talk about degrees of

2045
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:29,360
entanglement

2046
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:31,600
uh between different systems

2047
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,520
and you can you know

2048
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,280
cut up the state space any way you want

2049
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,679
to and ask about the entanglement

2050
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:41,199
entropy of some component of it

2051
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:43,440
um

2052
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:46,159
and you and you get these ideas of

2053
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:47,280
partial

2054
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,040
or they call it non-monogamous

2055
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:51,120
entanglement

2056
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,560
um

2057
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:55,280
and that's all well and good it's it's

2058
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,199
mathematically complicated it's

2059
01:21:57,199 --> 01:22:00,000
conceptually complicated

2060
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,880
but in in a sense it deeply violates the

2061
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:06,320
markov blanket condition

2062
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:10,080
because in point of fact each of us is

2063
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,800
an observer

2064
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:14,480
and

2065
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,480
our goal is to

2066
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:19,280
to say what does the world look like to

2067
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:22,320
an observer

2068
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:27,440
and from alice's point of view

2069
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:28,400
of

2070
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:29,600
bob

2071
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:35,120
is a decomposition of her markov blanket

2072
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,040
right

2073
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,400
alice has to

2074
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:41,920
actively disambiguate

2075
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:43,040
of

2076
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:45,920
her incoming signals

2077
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:49,040
into signals that she attributes to bob

2078
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:51,360
as an entity

2079
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:54,000
and signals that she attributes to the

2080
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,360
rest of the environment as an entity

2081
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:00,320
so that's an active cognitive process on

2082
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:03,120
alice's part

2083
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:05,520
uh that's what the markov blanket

2084
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:07,120
condition

2085
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:09,040
that's halamar called blanket condition

2086
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:12,960
in a sense forces us to think

2087
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:14,560
so

2088
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:19,120
the marco blanket condition itself

2089
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:21,920
makes us take this idea of bi heart

2090
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:24,400
decomposition seriously

2091
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,080
and

2092
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,080
again you can think of this

2093
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:31,199
in terms of of implicit assumptions

2094
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:34,599
about resources

2095
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:37,840
if you think in open systems terms and

2096
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,960
so you think of alice and bob as

2097
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:41,760
as

2098
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:45,280
antic entities that are that are

2099
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,440
separate from each other

2100
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:50,000
by a priori assumption

2101
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
and separate from their environments by

2102
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,719
operatory assumption

2103
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:57,360
then you systematically underestimate

2104
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:59,440
the amount of cognition that alice and

2105
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:01,280
bob have to be doing

2106
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,679
and so you systematically underestimate

2107
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:05,679
their energy consumption

2108
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:08,400
and so you systematically underestimate

2109
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:09,280
their

2110
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,360
their uncontrolled

2111
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:14,080
effect on the environment i.e generation

2112
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:15,360
of waste heat

2113
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,520
acquisition of free energy resources and

2114
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,040
all that

2115
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,560
so

2116
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,480
it's not just a

2117
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:25,440
philosophical difference

2118
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:26,480
it's

2119
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:31,040
a difference that leads you to make

2120
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:33,840
genuinely alternate predictions about

2121
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:37,440
things like metabolic load

2122
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:39,040
so

2123
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,400
that's why we

2124
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:43,520
do things in this bipartite framework to

2125
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,840
respect the mark on blanket condition

2126
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:48,080
and to

2127
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:50,239
keep our assumptions

2128
01:24:50,239 --> 01:24:54,839
about energy flow explicit

2129
01:24:58,239 --> 01:24:59,280
can we

2130
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:02,159
take that to the latter sections in the

2131
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:07,360
paper about biological cognition

2132
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,880
what are the implications for this for

2133
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:14,000
biological systems

2134
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:21,199
yeah carl

2135
01:25:23,199 --> 01:25:24,840
well

2136
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:27,760
um just to pursue that sort of thought

2137
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,679
experiment where you're trying to now

2138
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:31,199
say you wanted to use active inference

2139
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:33,760
to stimulate alice and bob observing a

2140
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:35,760
pair of electrons and remembering that

2141
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:38,480
the pair of electrons are one thing so

2142
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,960
you've now got a tripartite

2143
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:43,520
with three markov blankets in play

2144
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:47,280
um and many of the issues for example um

2145
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:49,840
the super determinism that allows some

2146
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:51,760
assumptions about the

2147
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:55,440
qrf alignments between bob and alice

2148
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:57,600
to be in play

2149
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:58,880
and also

2150
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:00,800
the discussion of

2151
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:01,600
how

2152
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,040
um

2153
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:06,719
alice has to have uh has to

2154
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:09,040
contextualize

2155
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:11,760
sensations from bob

2156
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:14,960
and under a belief or an internal model

2157
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:17,280
that bob is indeed another markov

2158
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:19,120
blanket and possibly a markov blanket

2159
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:21,280
very much like alice

2160
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:23,840
what you are saying is that two of these

2161
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:27,440
particles bob and alice have aligned qrs

2162
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:29,040
that could have been aligned

2163
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:31,600
historically uh under the super which i

2164
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:32,960
never heard of before but i like the

2165
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:36,000
word apple super determinism um and that

2166
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,239
may be a prerequisite to understand the

2167
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:40,080
experiments that we were taking through

2168
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:41,600
uh previously when looking at the third

2169
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,679
markov blanket which would be the uh the

2170
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:45,360
electron um

2171
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:46,960
uh or the two electrons but for

2172
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:50,800
simplicity um so um that from a

2173
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,639
biological perspective tells you

2174
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:54,400
something quite um

2175
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:57,600
uh quite interesting in the sense that

2176
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:00,320
um it starts to get to

2177
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,080
um

2178
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,360
the

2179
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:07,520
if it's the case that you can basically

2180
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:11,120
carve up a bunch of states not in a

2181
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:14,080
bipartite way but in a multipartite way

2182
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:17,920
and that carving is by inserting

2183
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:19,670
markov blankets

2184
01:27:19,670 --> 01:27:20,880
[Music]

2185
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:22,880
to define the partition

2186
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:26,320
under every um if you like subset of

2187
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:27,600
that space

2188
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:29,360
now becomes internal to its own markov

2189
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:31,199
blanket so there are now no external

2190
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:33,360
states all we have in play now

2191
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:36,560
are a set of internal states each

2192
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:39,199
equipped with a holographic screen or

2193
01:27:39,199 --> 01:27:41,600
markov blanket states they're exchanging

2194
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:44,000
with other internal states then there's

2195
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,360
some really interesting questions about

2196
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:49,120
how that system will evolve um you know

2197
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:50,719
from the point of view of the discussion

2198
01:27:50,719 --> 01:27:52,239
we've been having

2199
01:27:52,239 --> 01:27:54,080
it's going to evolve and under the

2200
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:56,960
principle of unitarity to entanglement

2201
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:59,040
so it's going to from the from a

2202
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:00,560
classical perspective

2203
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:03,600
um if you allow me it's going to tend to

2204
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:06,639
a a state of um

2205
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:08,320
generalized synchronization where

2206
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:09,760
everything collapses onto the same

2207
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:11,440
synchronization manifold and everything

2208
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,280
is indistinguishable there's perfect

2209
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:15,199
mutual predictability there's a

2210
01:28:15,199 --> 01:28:16,800
communication of an elemental and

2211
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:18,800
fundamental sort so everything has

2212
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:21,120
basically in everything is singing from

2213
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:23,920
exactly the same hymn sheet that's the

2214
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:25,760
natural way of things the free energy

2215
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,440
principle is just one way of describing

2216
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,440
that natural tendency

2217
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,120
what would that look like cognitively

2218
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:33,120
well it would look as if the markov

2219
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:34,719
blankets were trying to learn about each

2220
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:36,159
other and to the extent that they can

2221
01:28:36,159 --> 01:28:38,880
act on each other they're going to

2222
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,400
try and solicit

2223
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,719
um the kinds of outcomes that would

2224
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:44,880
enable them to learn about each other so

2225
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:47,199
we're now going to get a situation that

2226
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:49,440
is driven by the imperative towards

2227
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:52,000
mutual predictability and entanglement

2228
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,159
um that's an illusion

2229
01:28:54,159 --> 01:28:55,679
you know all that is actually happening

2230
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:57,440
is that the system is becoming entangled

2231
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:59,120
but it will look as if

2232
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:02,000
all of these separate um

2233
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,480
markov blankets or um

2234
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:07,520
sets of internal states are aligning

2235
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:10,400
in a mutually compatible way they're qrs

2236
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,320
so they can exchange and predict each

2237
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:14,560
other and if there's if you like an odd

2238
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:17,679
man out namely the pair of electrons um

2239
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:19,440
then you know then there will be an

2240
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,520
asymmetry and there will be graded

2241
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:24,960
degrees of entanglement um you know for

2242
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:27,120
multiple levels for example um if

2243
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:28,880
they're both observing a thermostat then

2244
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:30,159
the thermostat's not going to be very

2245
01:29:30,159 --> 01:29:32,639
good at learning how to align it's qrs

2246
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:34,560
with bob and alice but you know they're

2247
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:36,480
all going to make the best job of it

2248
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,400
ultimately of course with good cultural

2249
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,560
economic construction they'll they'll

2250
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:42,080
build better thermostats and become

2251
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:43,920
little robots and then they can all live

2252
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:46,480
happily and communicate so i think that

2253
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:48,000
sort of the cognitive

2254
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,120
thing here

2255
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:51,280
comes again back to

2256
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:53,679
learning to live in your world

2257
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:56,800
as an apparent expression

2258
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:58,800
of the

2259
01:29:58,800 --> 01:29:59,600
the

2260
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,320
inevitable progression to entanglement

2261
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:05,120
whereby we try to learn about each other

2262
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:07,440
under the plausible hypothesis that you

2263
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,600
are like me it's not necessarily true

2264
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,040
but it you know it's one hypothesis you

2265
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,639
can bring to the table you never know

2266
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:14,320
when it's true or not

2267
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:16,560
but that's certainly one hypothesis that

2268
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,639
would work very nicely for alice and bob

2269
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:20,880
if they can develop a common language so

2270
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:25,440
this notion of aligning qrfs between two

2271
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:27,360
blanketed systems

2272
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:28,960
particles

2273
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:32,480
that are sufficiently similar

2274
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:36,639
then just simply translates into

2275
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:39,760
learning uh to share the same narrative

2276
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:42,159
to share the same language

2277
01:30:42,159 --> 01:30:44,080
in order to render

2278
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:46,159
everything mutually predictable so i

2279
01:30:46,159 --> 01:30:47,520
know exactly what you're going to say

2280
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:48,960
next and you know exactly what i'm going

2281
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,800
to say next and we come now to this

2282
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:53,760
asymptotic limit of zero prediction

2283
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:55,840
error zero free energy and complete

2284
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,320
entanglement and that would be the your

2285
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:00,639
the object would have no ukraines or

2286
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:03,360
brexits or or anything if we can get

2287
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:04,320
there

2288
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,320
but that would be the other direction of

2289
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:09,600
travel from a biological perspective

2290
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:11,760
just just to that there are simulations

2291
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:13,520
of this from a purely classical

2292
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:14,840
perspective

2293
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:18,320
um and what you'd normally do

2294
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,480
is start off with um

2295
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:21,600
two

2296
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,760
systems um

2297
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:24,880
that

2298
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:28,480
think they have um strange attractors

2299
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:30,480
usually a lorentz attractor

2300
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:33,440
so they think that their dynamics um

2301
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:34,159
are

2302
01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:37,040
generated by their act their autonomous

2303
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:40,159
or their active states um creates stuff

2304
01:31:40,159 --> 01:31:44,960
out there that um has

2305
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:47,280
a chaotic aspect and i i i say that

2306
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:49,440
explicitly just because this sort of the

2307
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:51,840
notion of free will and choice in the

2308
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,159
classical domain usually reduces to

2309
01:31:54,159 --> 01:31:56,080
sensitivity to initial conditions which

2310
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:58,159
strikes me as a homolog of the super

2311
01:31:58,159 --> 01:31:59,840
determinism game

2312
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,679
can you go right back to the beginning

2313
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:02,480
and

2314
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:04,800
explain everything um

2315
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:07,280
and in sort of classical dynamical

2316
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:09,120
systems there are certain situations

2317
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:10,400
where you can't because you get a

2318
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:13,280
sensitivity to initial conditions um so

2319
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:15,920
that would leave space or uh free will

2320
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:18,400
and choice at certainly

2321
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,320
you know at one level but sorry i

2322
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:21,520
digress

2323
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:23,360
so what you do is you basically put sort

2324
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:25,600
of two chaotic systems with sensitivity

2325
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:28,480
to initial conditions together

2326
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:30,080
but they're not identical in the first

2327
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,320
instance but if they can exchange

2328
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:34,000
sensory inactive states or they can

2329
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,560
exchange across a shared holographic

2330
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:37,520
screen

2331
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:40,239
so now back to the bipartite situation

2332
01:32:40,239 --> 01:32:42,560
then they will naturally in fact if you

2333
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:44,320
think about they can't do anything else

2334
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:46,320
um they will naturally

2335
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:49,760
come to a state of entanglement i.e in

2336
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:51,199
if um

2337
01:32:51,199 --> 01:32:53,600
generalized synchrony and if you allow

2338
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:56,639
the parameters of the equations of

2339
01:32:56,639 --> 01:32:58,239
motion that underwrite these chaotic

2340
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:01,920
dynamic dynamics to also maximize mutual

2341
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:03,920
predictability or minimize free energy

2342
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:05,520
then they will actually come to show an

2343
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:07,440
identical synchronization because they

2344
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:09,600
will learn to become like each other

2345
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:11,679
just like mike's robots

2346
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:13,040
but in this instance they're learning

2347
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:14,960
about the other person simply to make

2348
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:16,960
things predictable so then you will have

2349
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:19,840
a shared narrative and in principle um

2350
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:21,120
you should be able to

2351
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:22,639
a kind

2352
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:24,719
i i mentioned that because i know chris

2353
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:26,880
wanted to talk about language we wanted

2354
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:28,960
to talk about you know

2355
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,040
quantum physics is just basically a

2356
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:32,800
description of of communication and

2357
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:35,120
language uh i don't think we're gonna

2358
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:36,560
have time to do that but i thought i'd

2359
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:39,390
slip that in anyway

2360
01:33:39,390 --> 01:33:42,600
[Music]

2361
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,520
chris did you want to say a few words

2362
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:48,560
quantum and language

2363
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:51,920
uh well that that was that was lovely

2364
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:54,639
carl when i i i

2365
01:33:54,639 --> 01:33:57,679
like the idea of this kind of

2366
01:33:57,679 --> 01:33:58,560
uh

2367
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:01,440
simulation leading to to generalize

2368
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:02,560
synchrony

2369
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:04,480
i think it's interesting from this

2370
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:07,360
perspective that

2371
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:09,040
we

2372
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:10,080
uh

2373
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:13,199
we always divide

2374
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:16,000
our environment into

2375
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,560
entities like us

2376
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:21,679
and then at least one entity that's

2377
01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:24,000
radically unlike us

2378
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,560
which we call the shared environment or

2379
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,800
the the open environment for the general

2380
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:30,840
environment or something like that

2381
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:33,920
and um

2382
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:37,840
so we have this sense of a

2383
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:42,080
a social grouping of similar entities

2384
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:43,040
uh

2385
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:46,239
that are commonly exposed to this vastly

2386
01:34:46,239 --> 01:34:48,639
dissimilar entity

2387
01:34:48,639 --> 01:34:50,800
with which we don't share a common

2388
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:53,040
language

2389
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:56,560
and we're not very good at predicting

2390
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:58,159
and so on

2391
01:34:58,159 --> 01:35:01,440
and so we always have this kind of

2392
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:04,719
open systems point of view

2393
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:05,760
and

2394
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:06,639
uh

2395
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:08,880
one of the functions of

2396
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:09,920
this

2397
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:12,239
vastly different system with which we

2398
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:14,800
don't share a common language is it's

2399
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:17,920
our free energy source and sink

2400
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:20,960
so it's where we put our waste heat

2401
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:23,040
and it's it's where we get our free

2402
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:26,719
energy for doing computation

2403
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:30,400
um so i

2404
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:33,760
i think it's interesting to think of

2405
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:36,239
this situation of

2406
01:35:36,239 --> 01:35:39,199
uh kind of local

2407
01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:42,080
synchrony or local entanglement or a

2408
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:45,360
local language community

2409
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:49,840
local shared predictability

2410
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:52,960
embedded in

2411
01:35:53,199 --> 01:35:55,600
this unpredictable

2412
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:57,840
chaotic

2413
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:59,440
and in a sense

2414
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:02,239
in principle chaotic because it's

2415
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:03,920
the waste heat dump

2416
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:05,360
right

2417
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:06,560
now

2418
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:09,040
we've assumed a priority that we can't

2419
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:11,040
understand it because it's where we're

2420
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:12,000
putting

2421
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,920
uh all of our

2422
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:15,520
the thermodynamic

2423
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,960
entropy that we're creating

2424
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:21,040
uh

2425
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:21,840
we

2426
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:23,760
we put ourselves in a

2427
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:26,960
conceptual bind almost automatically by

2428
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,679
being systems that that have to generate

2429
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:33,600
this entropy and put it somewhere

2430
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:36,080
so i like this this classical to quantum

2431
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:38,159
correspondence very much and i i think

2432
01:36:38,159 --> 01:36:41,280
it works very nicely

2433
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:42,400
awesome

2434
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:44,638
mike

2435
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:49,679
yeah um i want to i want to float an

2436
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:52,560
idea which is literally just a few days

2437
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:54,639
old so it may be a complete nonsense but

2438
01:36:54,639 --> 01:36:56,239
i'll float it anyway because i think

2439
01:36:56,239 --> 01:36:57,360
it's uh

2440
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:59,199
i think it's it's it's relevant and i've

2441
01:36:59,199 --> 01:37:00,560
been thinking about it this way it

2442
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:02,320
occurs to me that

2443
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:04,960
um you know this this binary distinction

2444
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:08,560
between uh there are agents some of them

2445
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,159
like me some of them different maybe

2446
01:37:10,159 --> 01:37:11,679
competitors whatever but there are there

2447
01:37:11,679 --> 01:37:13,760
are some agents that i can communicate

2448
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:15,440
with or can i receive influence or

2449
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:17,440
signals from and then and then there's

2450
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:19,040
this environment which is you know

2451
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:20,880
something that we assume or i mean some

2452
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,159
some cultures of course don't assume

2453
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:24,639
that but but we can assume that it has

2454
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:27,280
very low or zero agency meaning that it

2455
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:30,400
just is this sort of dumb un purposeless

2456
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:31,920
universe and it's on us to sort of

2457
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:34,239
figure out what it's doing right so it

2458
01:37:34,239 --> 01:37:36,560
occurs to me that that that distinction

2459
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:39,280
maybe shouldn't be binary and maybe what

2460
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:41,840
we want to be thinking about is as an

2461
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:43,600
agent when you are

2462
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:46,639
receiving something uh from from what

2463
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:48,800
you think is the outside you might want

2464
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:51,600
to estimate uh

2465
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:54,000
what is the agency on the other end and

2466
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,040
you might want to do this for the

2467
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:56,880
following reason right and i started

2468
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:58,400
thinking about this by imagining what it

2469
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:01,119
would be like to be in an internal

2470
01:38:01,119 --> 01:38:03,360
partition or a chunk of a giant neural

2471
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:05,760
net being trained you know you you live

2472
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:07,520
if if that's you you live in a very

2473
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:08,960
mindful universe you know you could

2474
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:10,639
catch on to the fact that you know what

2475
01:38:10,639 --> 01:38:11,920
i'm being i'm being trained for

2476
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:13,360
something you know the world like there

2477
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:14,800
are bigger patterns here and of course

2478
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,239
it moves in inscrutable ways and

2479
01:38:16,239 --> 01:38:17,760
everything because i can't you know i

2480
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:18,719
can't sort of

2481
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:20,800
i can't understand the whole pattern of

2482
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,320
what's going on but i can definitely

2483
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:23,520
tell that it's rewarding me and

2484
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:25,280
punishing me for specific behaviors

2485
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:26,960
right and of course some people do feel

2486
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:28,560
that way about the universe and at large

2487
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:30,480
that there are patterns that

2488
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:32,320
that are not just you know not quote

2489
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,719
unquote just physics and so

2490
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:36,880
so the reason the reason i i think and

2491
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:38,000
this extends to you know we have

2492
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,679
supervised learning and unsupervised

2493
01:38:39,679 --> 01:38:41,360
learning and again we think of those as

2494
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:43,199
kind of binary things right is there

2495
01:38:43,199 --> 01:38:45,040
some sort of intelligence on the other

2496
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:46,560
end telling you what's right and wrong

2497
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:48,159
or is it just on you to abstract

2498
01:38:48,159 --> 01:38:49,920
patterns from the environment and the

2499
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:52,880
reason i think we this matters is that

2500
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:56,159
if if uh if if you are

2501
01:38:56,159 --> 01:38:58,000
uh trying to learn from the environment

2502
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,440
meaning there's only one agent involved

2503
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:01,119
there's right there's that's you there's

2504
01:39:01,119 --> 01:39:02,560
one agent and then there's this sort of

2505
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:05,600
unthinking universe around you then you

2506
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:08,159
are pretty much guaranteed that whatever

2507
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:11,040
uh whatever you can manage to infer to

2508
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:12,880
it will be to your utility it's on you

2509
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:14,800
to figure out you to learn whatever you

2510
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:15,520
can

2511
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:17,280
if there's another agent on the other

2512
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:19,760
side and you're being trained right

2513
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:21,760
then uh what are the odds that that

2514
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:23,600
agent has your best interests at heart i

2515
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:27,280
mean maybe but maybe not and so if this

2516
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:29,760
is some sort of supervised learning

2517
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:31,679
you have to ask yourself

2518
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:33,920
what is it that i'm being trained and is

2519
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:36,159
it really what i what i want right

2520
01:39:36,159 --> 01:39:38,080
there's another there's kind of a whole

2521
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:39,040
thing

2522
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:41,600
that you can imagine evolutionarily that

2523
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:45,199
maybe to avoid uh being hijacked by um

2524
01:39:45,199 --> 01:39:48,159
by by by parasites by by you know

2525
01:39:48,159 --> 01:39:50,560
competitors by whoever you don't really

2526
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:52,800
want to be trainable too much you you

2527
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:54,400
want to learn but you don't really want

2528
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:56,960
to be trained and so maybe

2529
01:39:56,960 --> 01:39:59,679
the idea then is that uh what if what if

2530
01:39:59,679 --> 01:40:01,280
and this is okay this is where you know

2531
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:02,719
i really haven't even

2532
01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:04,400
talked to anybody about this yet so this

2533
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,800
is again could be a very amateuric stuff

2534
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:09,840
but but what if uh something like back

2535
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:11,600
propagation or whatever what if that

2536
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:14,560
literally hurts what if as a as a right

2537
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:17,520
as an early creature having some sort of

2538
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:19,840
error function forced back through your

2539
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:21,600
channels as opposed to whatever you were

2540
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:23,520
trying to generate yourself what if

2541
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:25,760
that's evolutionarily designed to be

2542
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:28,639
unpleasant and what if uh what you're

2543
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:30,400
trying to do is avoid that happening you

2544
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:32,239
don't want to be trained you want to

2545
01:40:32,239 --> 01:40:33,920
learn on your own terms

2546
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:36,000
and you could sort of imagine the

2547
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,679
different layers of a feed-forward

2548
01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:40,239
artificial neural network where the like

2549
01:40:40,239 --> 01:40:42,639
the initial input layer

2550
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:43,440
that

2551
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:44,320
that

2552
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:46,400
sort of creature gets to see the world

2553
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:48,239
quote-unquote as it is it gets the raw

2554
01:40:48,239 --> 01:40:50,639
inputs the next layer and certainly the

2555
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:52,320
layers past that you know the ones on

2556
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:54,639
the right that are abstracting they're

2557
01:40:54,639 --> 01:40:56,719
getting all kinds of propaganda filtered

2558
01:40:56,719 --> 01:40:58,800
to them by the early layers you know

2559
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,159
they don't get to see the real inputs

2560
01:41:00,159 --> 01:41:01,679
they get to see whatever the pre of the

2561
01:41:01,679 --> 01:41:03,920
prior layers think they should be seeing

2562
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:06,400
and and so maybe if you don't have a

2563
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:08,080
flat network like this but maybe what

2564
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:09,360
you have is a

2565
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:11,280
you know more biologically you have a

2566
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:13,119
kind of a nested um

2567
01:41:13,119 --> 01:41:15,920
uh multi-scale kind of system maybe

2568
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:18,239
there's some sort of uh

2569
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:20,480
incentive for the middle layers to try

2570
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:22,639
to sort of crawl leftward so that they

2571
01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:25,520
have more raw access to the real world

2572
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:28,400
and not be trapped uh being being fed by

2573
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:30,000
these other agents right so again you

2574
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,520
know this is all very qualitative stuff

2575
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:33,440
but you get the idea that's that's kind

2576
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:35,199
of what uh what what what i was thinking

2577
01:41:35,199 --> 01:41:37,440
about

2578
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:41,520
nice

2579
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:44,800
dean and then daniel

2580
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:46,880
mike if you want to chat about this this

2581
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,960
is what i was doing for about 10 years

2582
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:50,880
unleashing and getting out of the lab

2583
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:51,840
and

2584
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:54,400
getting past the toy model so perhaps we

2585
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:55,119
should

2586
01:41:55,119 --> 01:41:57,920
chat about this for a bit can i just

2587
01:41:57,920 --> 01:41:59,440
a couple of things

2588
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:02,159
uh chris first of all thank you

2589
01:42:02,159 --> 01:42:04,800
for uh i feel like i've come away with a

2590
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:08,400
munich stein volume worth of of coolness

2591
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:10,080
for the last two weeks just listening to

2592
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:12,719
you explain these really well

2593
01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:14,639
complicated things to me

2594
01:42:14,639 --> 01:42:16,480
uh in ways that i can actually

2595
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:17,679
understand

2596
01:42:17,679 --> 01:42:20,000
um

2597
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:22,239
one of the things that i'm i'm still

2598
01:42:22,239 --> 01:42:24,960
kind of curious about is

2599
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:26,800
once we let things out of the lab and we

2600
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:28,880
keep them in that variability retained

2601
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:30,719
space

2602
01:42:30,719 --> 01:42:32,080
and we're and we don't want to be in

2603
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:34,960
conflict with sort of the basic rules of

2604
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:36,400
of

2605
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:37,920
what quantitative information tells us i

2606
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:39,360
want to kind of go back for one second

2607
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,800
what stephen was

2608
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:43,040
kind of closing the 40.1 with and that

2609
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:46,000
is what do we do when we look at things

2610
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,320
in in that sort of relational realm that

2611
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:49,520
a lot of

2612
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:50,400
um

2613
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:53,199
indulge indigenous cultures

2614
01:42:53,199 --> 01:42:56,639
sort of take up and try to find

2615
01:42:56,639 --> 01:42:58,159
themselves

2616
01:42:58,159 --> 01:43:00,480
within and

2617
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:02,239
i'm kind of leading to this idea that

2618
01:43:02,239 --> 01:43:04,320
there's there's a sort of a subject

2619
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:06,000
matter generalist

2620
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:09,440
that leads to a prediction matter expert

2621
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:12,080
down the road and i i talked to carl i

2622
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:13,760
have it was my question to carl back in

2623
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:15,040
june when he was

2624
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:16,639
talking to us in the active inference

2625
01:43:16,639 --> 01:43:18,800
lab and so without getting into any kind

2626
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:21,040
of conflict with the quantum

2627
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:22,800
aspects of this

2628
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:26,800
um what what what do we take out with

2629
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:29,280
with us when we go on a bike ride with

2630
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:31,119
with chris fields

2631
01:43:31,119 --> 01:43:33,440
that's that's quantum related that isn't

2632
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:34,960
in conflict with everything we've talked

2633
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:37,040
about today but gives us a better

2634
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:39,040
confidence around the things that we

2635
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:42,239
might encounter and predict

2636
01:43:47,199 --> 01:43:50,239
what do you take on your bike chris

2637
01:43:50,239 --> 01:43:53,440
yeah what's in your quiver

2638
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:57,599
yeah good question uh

2639
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:04,760
no

2640
01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:08,239
once again these these theoretical

2641
01:44:08,239 --> 01:44:10,880
frameworks

2642
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:14,000
are languages

2643
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,280
and

2644
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:17,119
they

2645
01:44:17,119 --> 01:44:19,920
their role is to shape our concepts or

2646
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:22,400
their they are ways of shaping our

2647
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:24,960
concepts

2648
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:26,400
and

2649
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:28,799
um

2650
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:34,600
i think the the fundamental

2651
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:37,920
kind of lesson of

2652
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:41,280
quantum theory for us

2653
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:43,920
is to

2654
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:49,839
not take the boundaries we see

2655
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:52,159
as

2656
01:44:52,159 --> 01:44:57,920
literally as we're encouraged to do in

2657
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:03,119
the classical worldview i'll try to

2658
01:45:03,119 --> 01:45:04,960
distinguish the classical worldview from

2659
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:07,360
classical physics

2660
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:08,800
because

2661
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:12,639
classical physics by itself

2662
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:14,719
uh again going back to someone like

2663
01:45:14,719 --> 01:45:16,480
laplace

2664
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:18,239
um

2665
01:45:18,239 --> 01:45:19,679
is

2666
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:22,480
a physics of of

2667
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:24,159
atoms

2668
01:45:24,159 --> 01:45:26,560
which are which are you know

2669
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:28,400
sort of elemental

2670
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:29,440
uh

2671
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:31,040
it's not a physics of bounded

2672
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:33,440
macroscopic objects the boundaries even

2673
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:35,040
in classical physics are sort of

2674
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:37,280
arbitrary

2675
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:39,920
and i i think that's what quantum

2676
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:43,040
theory is trying to tell us to

2677
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:44,880
is trying to tell us that these these

2678
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:47,280
are boundaries that we draw

2679
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:49,679
on our blankets

2680
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:53,040
and i think this is in a sense what

2681
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:55,440
uh thinking about the fep is trying to

2682
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:57,119
tell us that

2683
01:45:57,119 --> 01:45:59,520
that we have to take this notion that

2684
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:00,719
we're

2685
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:04,159
blanketed entities seriously

2686
01:46:04,159 --> 01:46:06,320
when we think about what we're

2687
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:08,000
interacting with

2688
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,040
which is

2689
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:13,159
you know everything but us

2690
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:18,799
daniel

2691
01:46:20,719 --> 01:46:22,159
in our

2692
01:46:22,159 --> 01:46:25,119
closing minutes um if we could just each

2693
01:46:25,119 --> 01:46:26,960
give a thought this is really just a

2694
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:27,920
special

2695
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:28,880
and very

2696
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:32,080
powerful uh conversation uh mike with a

2697
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:34,080
back propaganda

2698
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:37,199
amazing thought experiment there

2699
01:46:37,199 --> 01:46:38,159
um

2700
01:46:38,159 --> 01:46:41,840
and uh no boundary and quantum questions

2701
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:44,080
touching on the work of like ken wilbur

2702
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:46,800
and i think it's just so powerful about

2703
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:48,880
um

2704
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:50,400
does someone have the whole world in

2705
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:53,280
their hands is that a good person is it

2706
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:55,520
a bad person or thing what kind of thing

2707
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:58,320
is that who's on the other side of this

2708
01:46:58,320 --> 01:46:59,679
video call

2709
01:46:59,679 --> 01:47:01,920
who's on the other side of that other

2710
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:03,199
side

2711
01:47:03,199 --> 01:47:04,880
what's the bigger

2712
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:06,480
picture

2713
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:09,920
and it really brings it home that

2714
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:12,639
no it's not just about electrons

2715
01:47:12,639 --> 01:47:15,440
this is something that is

2716
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:17,920
across scales and systems so

2717
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:20,239
really just wanted to appreciate the

2718
01:47:20,239 --> 01:47:22,880
paper and hope that we continue on this

2719
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:25,360
line of development

2720
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:28,559
and i'll pass it to stephen

2721
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:30,960
uh thanks daniel

2722
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:32,719
yeah i was going to tie this a little

2723
01:47:32,719 --> 01:47:35,280
bit some of the threads with

2724
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:36,800
this challenge of having this false

2725
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:40,719
sense of certainty in our culture and

2726
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:43,440
it does feel uncomfortable to be

2727
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:44,960
trained

2728
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:46,159
um

2729
01:47:46,159 --> 01:47:47,679
but we do it in the west because we're

2730
01:47:47,679 --> 01:47:49,360
confident that we've

2731
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:52,159
got this expert knowledge but then we

2732
01:47:52,159 --> 01:47:54,159
suddenly find out we don't know as much

2733
01:47:54,159 --> 01:47:56,320
as we do know or we think we know

2734
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:58,480
so that may be why bottom up sort of

2735
01:47:58,480 --> 01:47:59,679
organic

2736
01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:01,199
indigenous

2737
01:48:01,199 --> 01:48:04,000
kind of ways of being or ways of sensing

2738
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,639
can feel more holistic so i think there

2739
01:48:06,639 --> 01:48:08,560
might be something quite

2740
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:11,040
powerful in that so i like that thread i

2741
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:13,600
think that ties together with um

2742
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:15,119
the challenges

2743
01:48:15,119 --> 01:48:19,119
in practice when we try to train up

2744
01:48:19,119 --> 01:48:21,119
communities especially if we're working

2745
01:48:21,119 --> 01:48:23,520
say if i've worked in rural africa

2746
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:25,840
and communities there that if they don't

2747
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:27,520
feel connected to the

2748
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:28,800
colonizing

2749
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:30,159
narrative

2750
01:48:30,159 --> 01:48:32,800
it feels very oppressive so there's

2751
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:34,560
you know there's a lot of good points

2752
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:36,239
there around

2753
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:38,080
where is there coherence where there's

2754
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:40,960
decoherence and also where's their

2755
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:42,320
certainty

2756
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:45,199
and where there's uncertainty so thanks

2757
01:48:45,199 --> 01:48:47,679
this is really helpful and

2758
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:51,119
i'll pass it over to blue

2759
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:54,320
well

2760
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:56,560
i've said enough i think i'd like to

2761
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:59,840
hear from mike or carl or chris about

2762
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:01,920
where where you're going or what you're

2763
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:04,400
taking away or or what what are your

2764
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:05,840
final thoughts about the discussion

2765
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:09,520
we've had over the last couple of weeks

2766
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:11,679
i mean i guess i guess the only thing

2767
01:49:11,679 --> 01:49:14,560
i'll say is that uh to to me i i really

2768
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:15,679
like um

2769
01:49:15,679 --> 01:49:19,280
this idea that it it turns on its head

2770
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:21,440
this this notion that that you have this

2771
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:23,840
this this massive amount of uh mindless

2772
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:25,280
stuff and then somehow you know a little

2773
01:49:25,280 --> 01:49:26,960
bit of mind shows up at the end that

2774
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:29,360
that kind of turns it upside down and

2775
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:32,239
and if that's the case then it becomes

2776
01:49:32,239 --> 01:49:34,159
then the scaling problem is is really

2777
01:49:34,159 --> 01:49:35,840
really interesting right is how how you

2778
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:38,239
scale you know how how biology manages

2779
01:49:38,239 --> 01:49:39,599
to scale these things so that they

2780
01:49:39,599 --> 01:49:42,000
become synergist synergistic and bigger

2781
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,599
and bigger as opposed to you know just

2782
01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:45,440
merely a bigger pile of rocks than the

2783
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:47,599
previous pile of rocks and so

2784
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:49,520
that uh right so so those those

2785
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:51,440
mechanisms and in particular in biology

2786
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:53,119
and and so you know i look at it from

2787
01:49:53,119 --> 01:49:54,560
from cells getting together to be

2788
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:56,080
organisms and solving problems in the

2789
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:58,400
anatomical space but but i think there

2790
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:01,440
we actually have uh some pretty good

2791
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:04,480
um alternative although very very very

2792
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:05,920
similar in many ways isomorphic but

2793
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:07,760
alternative stories to what happens in

2794
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:09,440
neuroscience to try to understand how

2795
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:11,520
that scaling actually works so i'm super

2796
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:13,199
i'm just super super excited about that

2797
01:50:13,199 --> 01:50:14,639
and also the role of the observer and

2798
01:50:14,639 --> 01:50:16,239
all of this and the idea that all of

2799
01:50:16,239 --> 01:50:18,639
this is based on various observers

2800
01:50:18,639 --> 01:50:19,920
observing each other and i think that

2801
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:22,800
makes it it makes for a lot of progress

2802
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:24,639
and and fewer pseudo problems when you

2803
01:50:24,639 --> 01:50:27,599
when you look at it that way

2804
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:36,199
carl or chris any final thoughts

2805
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:41,920
well i'll i'll just thank you guys again

2806
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:43,679
for putting this together i thought this

2807
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:46,320
was a fascinating conversation

2808
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:47,440
and

2809
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:49,678
uh

2810
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:51,199
you know if i'll

2811
01:50:51,199 --> 01:50:53,920
could throw one more thing into it i i i

2812
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:56,880
think conversations like this are

2813
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:58,639
are evidence

2814
01:50:58,639 --> 01:51:00,000
for

2815
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,199
uh

2816
01:51:01,199 --> 01:51:02,639
the kind of

2817
01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:06,400
disciplinary siloization that's been

2818
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:09,679
forced onto us by academic tradition

2819
01:51:09,679 --> 01:51:12,159
being an artifact and not

2820
01:51:12,159 --> 01:51:16,598
necessarily being all that useful

2821
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:22,719
thanks so much

2822
01:51:22,719 --> 01:51:23,840
carl we're going to leave you with the

2823
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:25,360
final word

2824
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:27,040
oh good well

2825
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:29,520
it has to be a thank you doesn't it um

2826
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:30,880
but

2827
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:32,800
you lot for putting this together and

2828
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:35,360
and for the brilliant uh

2829
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:37,520
didactic and also challenging uh

2830
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:40,960
directed uh unpacking of some really um

2831
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:43,040
challenging but i think revealing issues

2832
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:45,679
and also the brilliant questions um my

2833
01:51:45,679 --> 01:51:48,080
final word will be future pointing i'm

2834
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:50,719
just taking off um taking up the sleeves

2835
01:51:50,719 --> 01:51:53,599
of chris's you know that having unsiloed

2836
01:51:53,599 --> 01:51:55,760
conversations is useful just think

2837
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:58,000
thinking about mike having the balls to

2838
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:59,599
come up with his brand new hypothesis

2839
01:51:59,599 --> 01:52:02,080
that's two years old so two days of my

2840
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:03,440
apologies

2841
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:05,040
so i thought it was really interesting

2842
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:06,800
i'm just a nice

2843
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:09,280
example of putting things into this kind

2844
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:10,639
of discussion which we're all gonna go

2845
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:13,119
and think about so my immediate thought

2846
01:52:13,119 --> 01:52:16,480
was um how on earth does the second

2847
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:18,639
layer in a variational auto encoder or

2848
01:52:18,639 --> 01:52:20,480
something doing backprop

2849
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:21,520
act

2850
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:24,159
um and of course it can act if if it's a

2851
01:52:24,159 --> 01:52:25,920
recurrent neural network and it can

2852
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:29,920
select which of the um the lowest level

2853
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:32,159
neurons or hidden there sorry not the

2854
01:52:32,159 --> 01:52:34,560
non-hidden layer um

2855
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:37,760
units uh to listen to um and of course

2856
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:40,880
we come back again exactly to attention

2857
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:43,840
and selecting those sources of precise

2858
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:46,320
information and where you've got a kind

2859
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:49,199
of internal action so

2860
01:52:49,199 --> 01:52:51,040
an interesting and silly thought but

2861
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:53,040
just a nice example of how talking

2862
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:56,560
together can excite interesting and

2863
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:58,800
potentially useful or possibly silly

2864
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:02,159
silly thoughts but again thank you

2865
01:53:02,159 --> 01:53:04,639
wonderful i had a great time observing

2866
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:07,440
all of you um and hope to get to do more

2867
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:10,080
of it in the future

2868
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:13,199
yep we can have a dot three anytime

2869
01:53:13,199 --> 01:53:14,480
consider

2870
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:16,719
40 um

2871
01:53:16,719 --> 01:53:18,639
in the uh

2872
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:20,719
inter measurement interval

2873
01:53:20,719 --> 01:53:23,360
while our igus is

2874
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:24,880
digesting

2875
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:28,639
and uh talk to you all soon thanks again

2876
01:53:28,639 --> 01:53:30,560
thanks very much everyone thank you bye

2877
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:34,199
bye it's great

2878
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,080
you
