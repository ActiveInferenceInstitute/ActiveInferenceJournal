00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,439
all right hello and welcome this is

3
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,960
active lab live stream number 40.0 it's

4
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,160
march 10th 2022.

5
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,200
welcome to the active lab we're a

6
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,440
participatory online lab that is

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,760
communicating learning and practicing

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,000
applied active inference you can find us

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,640
at the links here on the slide

10
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,640
this is recorded in an archived live

11
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,160
stream so please provide us with

12
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,960
feedback so that we can improve our work

13
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,960
all backgrounds and perspectives are

14
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,199
welcome and we'll be following video

15
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,920
etiquette for live streams

16
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,840
check out

17
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,040
activeinference.org to learn more about

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,520
the lab

19
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,960
all right

20
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,320
in today's number 40.0 the goal is to

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,479
learn and discuss

22
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,159
this very cool paper that was published

23
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,840
on archive on december 30th

24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,400
2021 a free energy principle for generic

25
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,280
quantum systems by chris fields carl

26
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,000
fristen james f glazebrook and michael

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,280
levin

28
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,240
and

29
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,000
just like every video

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
it's going to be just a conversation

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,720
going over some parts of the paper it's

32
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,119
not a review or a final word

33
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,000
and if anything it's um a cry for help

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
or at least a cry for participation

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,840
because there's so many areas where

36
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,920
somebody with different experience or

37
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,360
more knowledge about any of these

38
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,479
domains could connect some dots or

39
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,560
give some useful comments or critiques

40
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,680
so

41
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,159
especially with this video

42
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,200
though blue and i had help from our

43
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,840
colleague jason larkin with many of the

44
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,400
details there's just so much to unpack

45
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,280
so

46
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,440
we'll try to make this a

47
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,599
useful dot zero

48
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,280
and then we're really looking forward to

49
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,040
the dot one and

50
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,800
dot two and so on when we'll be able to

51
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,959
really go into some of these directions

52
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,000
so

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,160
i hope if you're watching live or

54
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,319
between now and the dot one

55
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,400
check out the paper and listen to this

56
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,879
discussion that we'll have now and ask

57
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,560
some questions because this is just

58
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,800
the beginning of a few new threads

59
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,720
probably more than the answering of

60
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,200
questions especially to any desired

61
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,640
level of like completeness or

62
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,959
applicability so it's just the beginning

63
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,879
that's what the dot zero is about it's a

64
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,080
new decade 40.0 so

65
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,680
um

66
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,680
we'll just uh introduce yourself and

67
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,640
then go through a bunch of the paper

68
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,959
and yeah thanks again to jason for a lot

69
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,720
of help in blue

70
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,440
for awesome work on the slides too okay

71
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,319
so

72
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,360
um

73
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,959
i'm daniel i'm a researcher in

74
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,760
california and i'll pass to blue as

75
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,000
facilitator

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
blue knight i'm a researcher in new

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,080
mexico and i have to shout out to daniel

78
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,040
too because you're always saying thank

79
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,879
you to me but you know we all have to

80
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,560
say thank you to you for providing the

81
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,239
affordances to be here and you know

82
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,799
discuss these awesome questions um big

83
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,840
paper i am uh excited to delve into this

84
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,840
i think it will you know start a lot of

85
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,720
new trails so i think um

86
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,040
and also to bring back mike levin and to

87
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,040
bring back chris fields um and to bring

88
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,440
back carl firsten back to the active lab

89
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,680
to discuss the dot one with us hopefully

90
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,080
um okay so is there anything particular

91
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,000
that you are excited about daniel or do

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,080
you want to just power through it let's

93
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,599
get let's jump in

94
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,599
all right

95
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,200
so this paper really was trying to unite

96
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,159
um

97
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,720
the quantum principles and the free

98
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,280
energy principles so quantum mechanics

99
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,000
and kind of delving into that and we

100
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,640
will see some threads carry over from

101
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,238
the last time that we had chris fields

102
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,000
on here maybe the last time we had mike

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,720
levin on here also um so how is the free

104
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,160
energy principle related to quantum

105
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,639
mechanics what does the fvp gain from

106
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,560
quantum what does quantum gain from the

107
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,680
fep

108
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,440
are we using the fep now to model

109
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,479
quantum systems and why are we pursuing

110
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,240
this intersection so this was kind of

111
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,960
like

112
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,440
the big questions kind of maybe we can

113
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,120
start to answer with this paper

114
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,560
um so

115
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,240
we are here

116
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,320
daniel what's this map about

117
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,120
um

118
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,520
it's a question we're gonna probably ask

119
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,280
ourselves multiple times so we can

120
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,440
insert it like a little emoji

121
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,520
but we can think of

122
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,560
among the axes of variation or

123
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,560
variability that we're going to explore

124
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,320
or where we're going to tune our regime

125
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,080
of attention or what perspectives we're

126
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,840
going to take it's going to be like

127
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,600
along two axes

128
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,240
ranging from on the right side fep

129
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,000
active like

130
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,479
to the left side which is like pre or

131
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,440
non

132
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,600
active slash fep

133
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,080
it's the x axis and the y axis

134
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,560
is the continuum between

135
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,039
quantum which we'll probably nuance and

136
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,639
hear many perspectives of what isn't

137
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,479
isn't quantum but just to summarize it

138
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,600
by saying quantum and not quantum like

139
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,400
pre or non-quantum approaches and so

140
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,000
quantum fep

141
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,639
is in the upper right corner

142
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,800
and we can think of it as being like

143
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,520
connected in different ways

144
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,000
to quantum non-fep in the top left the

145
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,520
blue and then fep but from a non-quantum

146
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,840
perspective like

147
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,440
all pre now

148
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,840
fap active in green

149
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,360
and then what are all the other

150
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,720
connections

151
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,280
and so who's right who's wrong who's

152
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,240
useful

153
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,080
where's their pragmatic value where is

154
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,639
their epistemic value what are we really

155
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,240
talking about do we agree on the

156
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,600
phenomena

157
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,039
where where is their agreement or

158
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,639
disagreement

159
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,880
where are we in this complex landscape

160
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,680
so i think in mechanics we refer to it

161
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,560
as classical mechanics and quantum

162
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,039
mechanics so now we will be this is like

163
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,120
the dividing point maybe between

164
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,120
classical fep and quantum fdp perhaps

165
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,720
let's see where it goes

166
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,360
so the aims and claims of the paper

167
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,759
there are pretty much three and we'll

168
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,919
revisit these at the summary because

169
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,280
we're going to just give you

170
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,199
a broad overview of the summary of

171
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,039
results right now

172
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,800
given the standard free choice

173
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,199
assumption the intuitive ideas of an

174
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,440
agent or information gathering and using

175
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,199
system igus

176
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,440
can be fully formulated within

177
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,840
background independent scale-free

178
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,560
quantum information theory

179
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,680
the second claim is that fep can be a

180
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,840
quantum theoretic formulation that

181
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,639
renders it applicable to generic quantum

182
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,400
systems and do you want to read the last

183
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,280
one daniel uh three when formulated as a

184
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,599
generic principle of quantum information

185
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,080
theory the fpp is asymptotically

186
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,319
equivalent to the principle of unitarity

187
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,080
cool do you want to read the first

188
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,759
section of the abstract

189
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,960
all right

190
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,840
the free energy principle or fpp

191
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,479
states that under suitable conditions of

192
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,120
weak coupling random dynamical systems

193
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,199
with sufficient degrees of freedom will

194
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,319
behave so as to minimize an upper bound

195
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,479
formalized as a variational free energy

196
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,560
on surprisable also known as

197
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,080
self-information

198
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,400
this upper bound can be read as a

199
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,879
bayesian prediction error

200
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,680
equivalently its negative is a lower

201
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,080
bound on bayesian model evidence also

202
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,720
known as marginal likelihood in short

203
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,680
certain random dynamical systems events

204
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,280
a certain kind of self-evidencing

205
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,240
so here we reformulate the fep in the

206
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,319
formal setting of space-time

207
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,639
background-free scale-free quantum

208
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,199
information theory we show how generic

209
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,120
quantum systems can be regarded as

210
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,479
observers

211
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,080
which with the standard freedom of

212
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,479
choice assumption become agents capable

213
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,199
of assigning semantics to observational

214
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,240
outcomes

215
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,559
we show how such agents minimize

216
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,159
bayesian prediction error in

217
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,760
environments characterized by

218
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,080
uncertainty insufficient learning and

219
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,240
quantum contextuality

220
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,240
we show that in its quantum theoretic

221
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,959
formulation the fep is asymptotically

222
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,519
equivalent to the principle of unitarity

223
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,600
based on these results we suggest that

224
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,760
biological systems employ quantum

225
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,640
coherence as a computational resource

226
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,800
and implicitly as a communication

227
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,160
resource

228
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,839
we summarize a number of problems for

229
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,200
future research particularly involving

230
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,360
the resources required for classical

231
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
communication and for detecting and

232
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,920
responding to quantum context switches

233
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,480
it's like okay cool what does it mean

234
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,279
how will it be useful

235
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,600
yeah um so we're gonna unpack a lot of

236
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,839
this and hopefully give everyone a good

237
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,080
framework with which to kind of go

238
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,760
forward into the dot one and dot two

239
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,120
maybe a little bit of background

240
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,560
understanding um the paper is very beefy

241
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,959
so we'll do our best to kind of

242
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,200
lay the framework down

243
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,160
they give us a good road map so there's

244
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,320
five sections the introduction

245
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,320
physical interaction as information

246
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,640
exchange and several subsections within

247
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,880
that repeated measurements and system

248
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,240
identification and subsections the fep

249
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,200
for generic quantum systems and the

250
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,560
discussion

251
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,480
and i think that they actually outline

252
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,320
what's in each section so we'll give you

253
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,240
that outline overview as we go through

254
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,959
the paper as well

255
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,200
so just we're going to use we're going

256
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,320
to actually reuse some slides from actin

257
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,399
stream number 17

258
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,839
that was when we had chris fields

259
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,399
presenting information flow in context

260
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,480
dependent hierarchical bayesian

261
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,519
inference

262
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,360
i think contextuality is like an

263
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,800
underlying thread that's pretty

264
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,160
important here today so chris kind of

265
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,880
lays that out in the um in that paper

266
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,600
and so if you want to get into

267
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,160
that and dive deeper into two spaces and

268
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,519
channel theory which we'll talk about a

269
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,360
little bit but um

270
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,680
yeah that's there so use that for a

271
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,720
resource

272
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,839
just

273
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,920
one foreshadowing here

274
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,360
the two pieces that they claimed in this

275
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,800
paper as their goals was to

276
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,200
connect contextuality to category theory

277
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,959
and shoe spaces

278
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,160
and then connect that yellow formulation

279
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,120
to hierarchical bayesian inference

280
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,760
more looking like the statistical models

281
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,760
and so this paper is kind of building a

282
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,720
category theory bridge with bayesian

283
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,360
graphs and statistics and category

284
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,600
theory and then that's probably going to

285
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,519
hinge over to a few other areas

286
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
cool so we can jump right into the

287
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,640
introduction

288
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,519
um

289
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,640
here and we're just going to highlight

290
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,320
some keywords as we go through the

291
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,079
authors didn't really give keywords for

292
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,000
the paper um which i'm kind of grateful

293
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,320
for because there's so much so many

294
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,760
other things to unpack here so they um

295
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,760
highlight some things about the fep in

296
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,600
the words of the authors

297
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,200
since its introduction is a theory of

298
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,040
brain function the variational free

299
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,200
energy principle has been extended into

300
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,320
an explanatory framework for systems at

301
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,200
all scales the fep is the statement that

302
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,160
any measurable bounded and

303
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,880
macroscopically

304
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,800
system will behave to satisfy these

305
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
requirements requirements

306
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,599
what else daniel

307
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,079
it was just cool how they brought in the

308
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,279
fep

309
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,040
as being the overarching level as

310
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,600
describing how these particles

311
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,480
do

312
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,040
two things which is possess internal

313
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,639
dynamics that are conditionally

314
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,000
independent

315
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,600
from the environment

316
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,079
and performing this self-evidencing

317
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,279
feature

318
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,200
by returning to some non-equilibrium

319
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,240
steady state and so just which parts of

320
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,839
the fep they entered in at or emphasized

321
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,760
which we can assume are

322
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,120
setting the stage up in their mind best

323
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,760
for the interfacing or the on-ramping

324
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,200
into quantum

325
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,959
where somebody interested in like a

326
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,519
system or integration other than quantum

327
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,639
might take a different approach

328
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,680
cool i think that they borrow also from

329
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,680
our particular physics and we're going

330
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,160
to talk about particles and they talk

331
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,000
more about particles in the discussion

332
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,600
and maybe we can have a deeper

333
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,279
conversation about those in the dot one

334
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,880
and dot two but they say the markov

335
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,440
boundary of any particle

336
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,600
um that's an open exchange with external

337
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,600
states via its markov boundary

338
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,279
underwrites conditional independence

339
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,200
between its internal states and the

340
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,360
external states of its environment by

341
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,360
localizing and thereby restricting

342
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,760
information exchange

343
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,920
so the markov boundary separates

344
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,519
internal and external states by

345
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,320
mediating their exchange we've seen that

346
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,639
before

347
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,839
cool so what is active inference daniel

348
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,440
can you break it down for us two cents

349
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,440
overview

350
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,920
that blanket that blue just described

351
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,519
with the insulation

352
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,639
incoming statistical dependencies can be

353
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,639
interpreted as perception

354
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,959
and outgoing statistical dependencies

355
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,440
can be interpreted as control

356
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,600
and depending on the situation and

357
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,800
what's zero and what's not zero that can

358
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,120
have a lot of dynamics that are similar

359
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,480
to some other

360
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,440
classic settings in decision making

361
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,040
gambling

362
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,880
experimentation

363
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,160
quantum

364
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,440
measurement

365
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,760
in this paper

366
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,240
very cool

367
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,600
uh so what is quantum theory

368
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,639
um

369
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,480
this is cool just some pictures and it's

370
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,160
connected in

371
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,880
to many many different uh fields so

372
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,040
there's a cool kind of concept map of

373
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,199
where quantum theory intersects

374
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,000
um but you know the quantum theory here

375
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,800
is the idea that that

376
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,040
all physical systems can including the

377
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,880
environment can be considered observers

378
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,639
that act on their surroundings to

379
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,199
prepare them for subsequent observations

380
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,000
that's

381
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,680
become common in quantum theory

382
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,519
replacing the wave function collapse

383
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,440
postulate of traditional quantum

384
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,240
mechanics with interaction induced

385
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,160
decoherence which is like the

386
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,440
dissipation of quantum coherence this is

387
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,360
like the thing that generates classical

388
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,639
information

389
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,720
and they say indeed while quantum theory

390
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,560
was originally developed and it's still

391
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,160
widely regarded as the theory

392
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,639
specifically applicable at the atomic

393
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,920
scale and below

394
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,320
since the work of wheeler feynman and

395
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,880
douche dutch douche

396
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,560
it has over the past few decades been

397
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,959
reformulated as a scale-free information

398
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,880
theory and is increased increasingly

399
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,760
viewed

400
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,600
as a theory of the process of

401
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,360
observation itself

402
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,000
so um yeah i think like when we think

403
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,600
about quantum we think about the

404
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,199
observer at least i do like i think

405
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,959
about the observer phenomenon just the

406
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,600
act of observing a system changes the

407
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,120
system

408
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,639
so that's kind of a fundamental thing

409
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,920
that comes to my mind what comes to your

410
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,360
mind daniel when you think about quantum

411
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,800
theory

412
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,720
uh

413
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,279
if reading that leaves me uncertain

414
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,040
whether we're talking about like organic

415
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,040
chemistry and the pi orbitals and

416
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,000
covalent bonding and emission and all of

417
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,800
those things that particles do

418
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,079
which is what it sounds like they're

419
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,480
talking about in this orange part

420
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,560
a theory specifically applicable to the

421
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,279
atomic scale and below

422
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,199
and then this blue part makes it sound

423
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,680
like they're opening it up into a much

424
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,279
larger space so i think we'll probably

425
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,320
learn a lot about that what does quantum

426
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,639
mean here are we talking about electrons

427
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,320
and protons

428
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,800
or is this something that is like

429
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,839
bayesian inference in that it's scale

430
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,160
free or scale a priori or scale friendly

431
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,719
or something like that

432
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,639
nice scale independence

433
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,199
so we're gonna jump right in so section

434
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,680
two they talk a lot about physical

435
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,839
interaction as information exchange and

436
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,160
that's something i wonder also like is

437
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,839
you know we have the classical mechanics

438
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,079
and do the laws of quantum always apply

439
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,399
or at some scale are they you know not

440
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,240
applicable or can we

441
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,040
extend them into some like theory of

442
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,560
everything like are we getting there

443
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,920
maybe

444
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,799
but here in this section they say that

445
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,799
they use the category theoretic

446
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,799
formalism of channel theory

447
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,039
to formalize the operational semantics

448
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,359
of natural languages so they develop a

449
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,079
generic formal representation of quantum

450
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,679
reference frames and show how the

451
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:22,880
non-commutativity of quantum reference

452
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,400
frames induces quantum contextuality and

453
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,200
i had fun really digging into this

454
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,120
at a level that i felt comfortable

455
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,480
explaining it

456
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,960
so i'm excited to see if i if i

457
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,240
fungal it or how it goes let's see

458
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,280
okay

459
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,039
what is quantum

460
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,080
wow

461
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,760
when physical interaction is used

462
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,840
information exchange why is it quantum

463
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,080
becomes obvious the fundamental quantum

464
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,640
quantum of information is one bit one

465
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,640
unit of entropy

466
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,360
that one system exchanges for another so

467
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,679
one bit one quantum of information is

468
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,600
the answer to one yes or no

469
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,640
question

470
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,360
that is quantum

471
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,679
do you want to add anything here daniel

472
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,919
this is the block text is from

473
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,200
the paper

474
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,360
and just one

475
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,120
piece that will be interesting to

476
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,600
explore is just how does time and

477
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,120
temperature

478
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,840
come together

479
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,200
like

480
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,600
i had just heard or thought more about

481
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,960
the space required for storage and

482
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,559
not really seen it as much connected to

483
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,360
the speed of obtaining

484
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,840
that yes or no answer

485
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,320
at different temperatures

486
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,880
and what that might mean for

487
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,679
biological or for digital systems

488
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,320
but i'm sure that's a very

489
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:52,590
um

490
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,919
[Music]

491
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,840
foregone conclusion maybe working with a

492
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,080
quantum device but

493
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,320
new to me and jason was like oh yeah of

494
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,640
course that's the case

495
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,080
and they they talk a lot so

496
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,840
foreshadowing they're gonna um you know

497
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,360
really present this within like a

498
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,240
facetime independent context which is

499
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,760
kind of cool and then like link it back

500
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,160
to time which that kind of gets

501
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,240
a little interesting

502
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,640
all right

503
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,760
so

504
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,280
moving on

505
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,760
uh hilbert spaces

506
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,360
um

507
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,440
so

508
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,360
daniel do you want to say a bunch about

509
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,960
this or what do you want to say about

510
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,080
this and then i'm going to highlight

511
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,480
some stuff

512
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,039
i'll just read what they

513
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,919
um wrote

514
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,880
oh here's the the red part is was our

515
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,880
comments on what they wrote people can

516
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,480
pause it to read what they wrote the

517
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,799
hilbert spaces contain all states

518
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,840
described as a vector

519
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,840
and this is one way that qubits are

520
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,480
constructed

521
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,480
by relating two levels of a system like

522
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,480
electrons in a ground or excited

523
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,159
superposition

524
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,799
and then the collapse

525
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,520
into one or those other

526
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,640
bands

527
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,640
and so that's more of like a

528
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,760
uncertainty to discrete transition

529
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,600
but then in the limit of high

530
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,840
temperature there's a lot of blur

531
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,840
or experimental factors that can be

532
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,520
modeled as blur

533
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,440
that results in a smoother distribution

534
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,159
of outcomes

535
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,120
and

536
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,200
[Music]

537
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,400
here this hilbert space

538
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,440
is describing how the experiment is set

539
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,440
up and the information that's being

540
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,559
modeled

541
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,120
at a given time

542
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,640
so the state of

543
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,600
that this space consists of the options

544
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,480
for

545
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,360
is like the just the experiments space

546
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,480
including

547
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,880
the total target system and the observer

548
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,039
maybe

549
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,280
so i like this quote at the end that as

550
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,559
fuchs put it

551
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,480
infinite dimensional hilbert spaces are

552
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,480
from an information perspective merely a

553
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,000
useful artifice

554
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,760
permitting computation with differential

555
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,159
equations and they they contain all this

556
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,640
possible states in an experiment as

557
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,320
vectors so

558
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,360
um

559
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,159
there's more to read about that um

560
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,080
and also the mathematical notation if

561
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,679
you're curious

562
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,679
about cats and bras and some of these

563
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,840
brackets that we had to to dig through

564
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,039
to

565
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,400
find solid ground

566
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,000
yeah okay so the principle of unitarity

567
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,840
is the principle that observable

568
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,000
information like energy is neither

569
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,480
created nor destroyed by physical

570
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,080
processes

571
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,840
and i thought that this was interesting

572
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,320
so time reversal symmetry

573
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,240
is essential for the conservation of

574
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,360
information

575
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,840
so a system is time reversal symmetric

576
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,159
if its equations of motion allow perfect

577
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,200
prediction

578
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,919
of the starting point based on knowing

579
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,760
the state of the system at any given

580
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,640
time

581
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,760
so like if you know time whatever x time

582
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,280
steps you can still

583
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,440
say something about the starting system

584
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,120
because you can run it forward and

585
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,120
backward in time i mean there were some

586
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,960
cool things like about if you pulled up

587
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,280
a mirror that's that's like enables the

588
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,200
time reversal so some things go forward

589
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,520
but like the spin of an electron is spun

590
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,760
backwards in time right so it's like

591
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,080
those kinds of things um

592
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,600
like our some things are parallel and

593
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,760
some things are opposite in time

594
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,559
reversal symmetry but um anyway i

595
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:37,760
thought that was interesting and

596
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,280
fundamental so kind of the principle of

597
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,120
an eternity and also because we're going

598
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,640
to talk about time

599
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,600
in a cool way i think

600
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,440
um okay

601
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,679
so

602
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,840
yeah

603
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
unitary do you want to say about unitary

604
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,760
daniel i said a little bit so let me

605
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,120
pick out some things here that you want

606
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,720
to talk about

607
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,240
okay

608
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,960
this was all with just jason

609
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,440
helping us and again it's like an

610
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,039
opportunity for anyone who's familiar

611
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,159
with these

612
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,480
to uh formalisms to help us a little bit

613
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,080
more through but just to pick up on one

614
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,840
point just

615
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,360
as blue mentioned like we're doing

616
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,520
experiments where it doesn't matter what

617
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,520
time we started at

618
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,559
in a sense like it may matter in the

619
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,320
sense that the different times lead to

620
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,000
different results but

621
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,840
a statistical framework for observation

622
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,080
that can

623
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,559
cut through some of the parts of the

624
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,640
experimental context

625
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,799
that are not relevant

626
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,799
to compare different events that happen

627
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,080
a different time

628
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,520
in a unified statistical framework

629
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,200
and so that was what led to this

630
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,159
principle of unitarity that the total

631
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,240
probability distribution is preserved

632
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,240
with like a mass of one

633
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,760
so that there can be information

634
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,679
evolution but it's happening in a

635
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,120
certain space

636
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,120
where there's a certain invariance that

637
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,520
allows useful computation to happen

638
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,840
cool

639
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,400
oh yeah conservation of probability so

640
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,960
that's something that maybe came up um

641
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,799
like the probability that a particle is

642
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,880
somewhere like it's somewhere there's a

643
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,080
hundred percent probability that the

644
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,360
particle is somewhere so it didn't

645
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,200
disappear so that was another kind of

646
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,000
interesting point we were talking um

647
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,919
before this

648
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,000
i mean that's kind of what how you get

649
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,919
the conservation of observable

650
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,720
information as well

651
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,480
um

652
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,880
okay

653
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,080
separability and holographic

654
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,559
encoding

655
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,880
okay this one

656
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,000
just to

657
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,640
uh briefly look at a previous slide i

658
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,880
think this was from 32

659
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,799
we were looking at sparsely coupled

660
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,000
systems

661
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
from a matrix perspective and so the

662
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,799
dense coupling of like subunits one

663
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,039
through six with each other was mainly

664
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,880
like within the click of the red or the

665
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,720
blue but then there's these off

666
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,400
diagonals that reflect the sparse

667
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,640
coupling of denser clicks

668
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,400
and so

669
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,120
in section 2.3 of this paper

670
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,159
they're

671
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,559
also talking about

672
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,679
coupling

673
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,840
patterns in systems

674
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,000
specifically ones that have a

675
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,720
separability

676
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,279
so like one of those blocks could be the

677
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,279
experimental system the quantum computer

678
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,480
and the other one of the blocks could be

679
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,799
the experimenter and then there could be

680
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,559
sparse connectivity reflecting the

681
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,799
experimental apparatus

682
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,039
but that was being approached from a

683
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,480
quantum holographic angle

684
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,520
also setting up for a markov blanket

685
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,760
take

686
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,039
cool so one sentence on this

687
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,320
page that i think is important is

688
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,240
underlined here the entanglement entropy

689
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,000
is a mutual information measure that

690
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,039
detects quantum correlation or coherence

691
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,360
between a and b

692
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,520
um and so

693
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,080
that defines separability and if either

694
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,240
a system is separable or it's entangled

695
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,840
so separable states are also called

696
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,240
decoherent and entangled states are also

697
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,120
called coherent so just just point out

698
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,799
as we go forward and kind of dive a

699
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,120
little bit deeper into the math it it's

700
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,960
kind of like if it was parametric

701
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,880
classical statistics we would say

702
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,960
uncorrelated or correlated if it was

703
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,480
information theory we'd say no

704
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,960
information or yes it gives information

705
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,720
bayesian graph yes it has causal

706
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,400
influence or no it doesn't and then this

707
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,760
is the quantum take yes it's entangled

708
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,400
or no it's not entangled

709
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,720
also don't forget conditional dependence

710
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,039
or conditional independence so where

711
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,760
where is it conditionally dependent um

712
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,880
and we know that like the markov blanket

713
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,880
can help to define conditional

714
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,640
dependence um when we've looked at

715
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,760
active inference in the past

716
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,000
yeah

717
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,799
um okay cool so

718
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:05,919
where do you want to talk about the

719
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,440
hamiltonian

720
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,760
or not at all what do you want to say

721
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,400
not at all okay

722
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,120
so there's one cool thing that i want to

723
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,480
point out here

724
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,320
um you know we talked about like which

725
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,880
interactions strong interaction

726
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,559
different time frames and how these are

727
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,279
going to vary as we go forward um but

728
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,360
but here i really just wanted to point

729
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,679
out that that this h of a b is like the

730
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:30,799
hamiltonian so we're talking about

731
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,200
matrices separability interacting

732
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,120
matrices conditional dependence just on

733
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,559
the last slide um and so the

734
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,559
interaction between the hamiltonian of

735
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,200
the matrix can be decomposed

736
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,080
into this h a b where this is like the

737
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,399
interaction between a and b

738
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:52,240
so ajb can be looked at as we go forward

739
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,200
as the energetic interaction between

740
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,080
matrix a and matrix b state a state b

741
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,799
position a position b or um they give it

742
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,720
to us in a very generic form so i didn't

743
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,240
really know how to apply that going

744
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,240
forward but maybe if the authors were

745
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,440
listening they'll come in and rescue us

746
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,120
um that's the only thing i really wanted

747
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,720
to point out from from that side

748
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,840
and then this is kind of cool so

749
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,919
this this equation six which we just

750
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,080
looked at um which is the energetic

751
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,760
interaction between a and b

752
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,760
um this is physical interaction which i

753
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,880
guess is

754
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,320
that could be physical interaction

755
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,760
between a and b that also be energy

756
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,559
right matter equals nc squared

757
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,399
physical interaction equals

758
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:38,159
thermodynamics times yes or no questions

759
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,159
so it's cool the authors say this

760
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,840
formulation emphasizes what quantum

761
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,080
theory is about the process of obtaining

762
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,200
information obtaining information from b

763
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,600
requires in particular that a acts on b

764
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,919
by asking questions as wheeler puts it

765
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,640
no question no answer all inference in

766
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,480
this framework is active inference

767
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,399
equation 6 does not allow

768
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,320
passive perception to be a physical

769
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,720
process

770
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,679
super interesting agreed from a lot of

771
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:06,799
angles

772
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,640
it almost takes it

773
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,720
to a level we haven't seen

774
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,640
from just saying well perceptual

775
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,120
inference even the generative type so

776
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,640
not just the signal processing but even

777
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,399
a predictive processing

778
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,240
generative

779
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,000
framework for perception that doesn't

780
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,720
take action into account is incomplete

781
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,559
hence the motivation for active

782
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,600
inference and this is

783
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,919
somehow escalating that

784
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,360
into

785
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,200
saying that all inference in this

786
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,679
framework is active inference and i

787
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,679
wonder if that's because like a frame is

788
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,000
always needed some kind of generative

789
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,919
model is always needed

790
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,520
as a recognition model dual for any

791
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,600
observation so if you're in the business

792
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,520
of making observations you're in the

793
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,360
business of generative model

794
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,640
modification

795
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,159
one way or another

796
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,440
or you're not the kind of thing that

797
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,679
does either of those but they might come

798
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,440
into play

799
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,520
in the minimal active entity or the

800
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,279
thing that can be modeled as a minimal

801
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,960
active entity

802
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,559
and so

803
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,559
there's a lot of interesting areas and i

804
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,919
think it's also quite interesting with

805
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,080
the natural language equation

806
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,840
so how should we read that dot

807
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,600
thermodynamics

808
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,399
what

809
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,799
yes no questions and then

810
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,880
times or what does it mean

811
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,480
yeah there's the category theory like

812
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,120
that that dot operator i forgot how to

813
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,640
read it

814
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,640
so hopefully um it'll be rescued

815
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,120
um but yeah i i read it at times because

816
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,520
you know i'm old school

817
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,240
so

818
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,440
going back to that same equivalent

819
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,200
i thought that this was important it

820
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,440
involves no assumptions about space-time

821
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,760
objects or motions it is strictly

822
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,120
topological

823
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,279
given separability it identifies a

824
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,039
boundary fancy b

825
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,880
between a and b

826
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,159
at which

827
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,679
the energy interaction physical

828
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,679
interaction between a and b is defined

829
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,360
so i guess that would be like a space

830
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,880
well i guess it's not space it's not

831
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,279
space it's not time it's a physical it's

832
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,760
an energy interaction hiv

833
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,679
um anyway yeah

834
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,120
and this is the markov blanket fancy b

835
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,399
holography connection which is that all

836
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,039
the information that is making the

837
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,600
sparse connectivity of a and b

838
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,039
we're talking about systems that have

839
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,000
like this screen slash blanket slash

840
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,240
experimental apparatus

841
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,919
fancy b

842
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,720
and the properties of it for a system

843
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,480
that might be making

844
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,039
classical like measurements

845
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,039
or maybe it's making quantum

846
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,279
measurements so

847
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,600
implicitly the prior work

848
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,279
had been thinking about what was on the

849
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,120
other side of that

850
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,519
experimental apparatus

851
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,440
from a classical or from a non-quantum

852
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,760
perspective we'll see

853
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,559
and this is taking it more into asking

854
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,880
what kind of mathematics would be needed

855
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,399
to look at it if it were a quantum

856
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,840
system that were being investigated

857
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,640
cool

858
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,200
and i think that takes us into

859
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,559
figure one

860
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,360
so here daniel was foreshadowing doing a

861
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,559
great job of the holographic screen

862
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:21,360
so this is a holographic screen fancy b

863
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,760
separating systems a and b with an

864
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,039
interaction

865
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,399
h a b

866
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,720
given by equation six and so

867
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,519
this

868
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,000
says that this this screen can be

869
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,120
realized

870
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,039
by an ancillary array of non-interacting

871
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,440
qubits that are alternately prepared by

872
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,000
a and then measured by b

873
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,720
uh qubits are depicted as the spheres

874
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,679
here

875
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,919
um and there's no requirement that a and

876
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,240
b share preparation and measure

877
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,919
measurement bases

878
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,039
so these are uh quantum reading

879
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,440
or quantum reference springs so this is

880
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,440
like they share the ability to prepare

881
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,279
or measure that would be like quantum

882
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,320
reference frame and we're going to get

883
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,159
into the quantum reference frames just

884
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,159
here in a couple slides um i think with

885
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,360
a pretty good example

886
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:09,200
cool

887
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,640
anything to add or do you want to like

888
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,880
unpack it with the next couple slides

889
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,200
um just thinking about this as like a

890
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,080
quantum holograph is sort of

891
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,480
the generalization maybe

892
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,559
of thinking about this in the classical

893
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,519
information what if this were

894
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,760
the chat between blue and i so we could

895
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,440
have different perspectives different

896
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,760
reference frames different semantics

897
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,080
but if we're not in the same chat room

898
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,919
then we're not in the same chat room

899
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,320
that's like the holographic screen or

900
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,399
the observable that's getting passed

901
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,960
between these two systems a and b

902
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,320
and they don't have to be two people it

903
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,159
could be like a person and some other

904
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,919
system on the other side of the

905
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,480
holograph slash information channel

906
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,559
and the whole question

907
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:53,600
is

908
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,519
what kind of math describes that

909
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,480
classical information channel case

910
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,399
and how is that similar or different or

911
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:02,159
compatible or whatever

912
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,080
with thinking about it not as a

913
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,640
information bit from a standard

914
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,239
probability distribution but like a

915
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,359
quantum information bit with a complex

916
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,560
statistical distribution

917
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,560
nice

918
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,359
um

919
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,079
so they describe the holographic screen

920
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,359
actually um

921
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,760
as they say the holographic screen fancy

922
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,560
v

923
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,560
has an obvious interpretation in the

924
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,159
language of the free energy principle

925
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,639
and active inference it implements the

926
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,960
markov blanket that separates

927
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,679
from b so we've seen the markov blanket

928
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,679
before and you know mentioned it here

929
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,918
but but i think that they are going to

930
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,918
you know implement this holographic

931
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,599
screen as this markov blanket um yeah

932
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,918
perfect cool

933
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:49,760
oh and then the quantum reference frame

934
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,639
fun

935
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,320
so uh

936
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,239
here they say we show in particular that

937
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,639
the fvp emerges naturally in any setting

938
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,119
in which an agent or particle deploys

939
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,440
quantum reference frames namely physical

940
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,839
systems that give observational outcomes

941
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,480
and operational semantics to identify

942
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,560
and characterize the states of other

943
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,640
systems in this environment

944
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,200
and and so this was kind of a cool um

945
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,280
figure that i that i pulled down

946
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,440
so it's like a man

947
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,880
on the train

948
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,920
to the man the train is moving and to

949
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,000
the person on the train the man is

950
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,240
moving right and so it depends on your

951
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,599
perspective

952
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,040
and this is this is

953
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,599
kind of what a quantum reference frame

954
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,320
is getting at here so um this says

955
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,079
quantum features such as quantum

956
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,640
superposition are only defined relative

957
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,720
to an observer when we look at the train

958
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,320
from the point of view of an observer

959
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,320
standing on the platform the train looks

960
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,320
in a quantum superposition of different

961
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,720
positions however an observer sitting on

962
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,720
the train sees the observer on the

963
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,359
platform and the ball in a quantum

964
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,720
superposition so it's a cool

965
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,640
illustration of just kind of how things

966
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,480
look differently depending where you're

967
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,800
standing

968
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,880
okay this is awesome i like how you

969
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,599
brought in the art and the images are a

970
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,200
little subtly different but then in a

971
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,680
way that really makes one think

972
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,839
and the classical case would be what if

973
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,560
both of them were moving or still

974
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,960
and then they only got to get a

975
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,839
frame update once every two seconds or

976
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,440
once every five seconds so then there'd

977
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,040
be like still an uncertainty

978
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,839
distribution but it'd be a classical

979
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:27,839
parametric statistics or information

980
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,320
theory uncertainty about location

981
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,000
and that's going to be the big question

982
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,760
how is that

983
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,760
variance estimation that we've already

984
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,280
been exploring

985
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,280
and that type of inference related to

986
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,359
quantum information where there's

987
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,119
something a little bit

988
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,240
bigger and more complex or different

989
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,720
than just simply low sampling rate

990
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,280
leading to positional uncertainty of a

991
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,520
massive train that's not subject to

992
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,880
so-called quantum effects

993
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,839
cool

994
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:01,359
um

995
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,680
did you want to what so this is kind of

996
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,880
cool do you want to unpack this slide

997
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,040
here daniel

998
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,640
i'm just looking forward to what the

999
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,800
free choice assumption means

1000
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,839
in

1001
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,440
setting but

1002
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,040
we just highlighted what is this all

1003
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,640
going to say about free choice this

1004
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,200
specific slide but also the broader

1005
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,720
discussion

1006
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,720
so i i agree too i think the free choice

1007
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,520
aspect is cool um here the authors say

1008
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,240
provided a and b are separable assuming

1009
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,240
that there are no super determinist a

1010
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,240
priori correlations

1011
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,119
um

1012
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,680
z a and z b what is the z i'm not sure

1013
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,960
what the z is

1014
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,000
oh

1015
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,320
choices of z

1016
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,480
so the z is the choice the choice of a

1017
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,960
and the choice of b are uncorrelated

1018
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,280
this is the free choice assumption free

1019
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,440
choice is often claimed to be essential

1020
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,160
to science as a practice

1021
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,079
if it characterizes any bounded system

1022
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,599
consistency with quantum theory and

1023
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,160
special relative relativity together

1024
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,000
requires that it must characterize all

1025
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,800
systems so free choice of a basis

1026
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,200
introduces quantum noise that is

1027
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,599
indistinguishable observationally from

1028
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,440
classical noise and and noise is going

1029
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,160
to become important here um as we move

1030
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,119
toward the end of the a and z

1031
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,720
so

1032
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,520
yeah

1033
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,119
anyway that's cool

1034
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:19,400
okay

1035
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,499
[Music]

1036
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,759
nice

1037
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,560
so here they talk about um the z-axis in

1038
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,079
figure one i should have pasted figure

1039
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,280
one in here

1040
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,200
um they say that the z axis is a

1041
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,839
reference frame free choice of the axis

1042
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,440
generalizes the free choice of the

1043
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,200
reference frame encoding each qubit on

1044
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,000
the

1045
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,440
holographic screen fancy beat right

1046
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,480
so um yeah

1047
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,240
and the part in red looking forward to

1048
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,359
unpacking

1049
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,599
a qrf cannot therefore be fully

1050
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,240
specified by any finite bit string it is

1051
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,160
non-fungible in the terminology of

1052
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,839
citation 40.

1053
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,160
it's the quantum active

1054
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,079
nft crossover

1055
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,079
that we all needed

1056
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,320
we have it but we need to explore it and

1057
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,800
find out what it means

1058
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,200
super cool um

1059
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,960
and they say that they consider a and b

1060
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,359
to be isolated during the time interval

1061
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:20,480
between

1062
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,119
preparation and measurement steps um and

1063
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,760
i think that we'll get into that

1064
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,800
um

1065
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,720
in a little bit more like preparation

1066
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,960
and measurements as we talk about time

1067
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,800
and memory and coding

1068
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,839
um

1069
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,920
yeah and that's what this um

1070
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,119
nine formalism is roughly describing

1071
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,119
something like that

1072
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,480
there's yes

1073
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,520
yeah

1074
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,760
what is happening with it

1075
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,000
so it says the idea of a computation um

1076
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,119
is this so you have uh bits

1077
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,680
that have one time step going to bits at

1078
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,160
another time step and then you have the

1079
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,640
um markov blanket in one time step going

1080
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,160
to another markup blanket at t plus one

1081
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,480
and then this is it za is that free

1082
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,000
choice that's in there

1083
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,440
oh

1084
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,680
no it's if so i'm not sure what that one

1085
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,040
is but

1086
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,240
yeah we can we can unpack that more i uh

1087
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,160
i will unpack some of the later math but

1088
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,960
um

1089
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,240
this i think it's just important to

1090
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,480
establish the quantum reference frame

1091
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,240
anyway yeah that's good cool okay

1092
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,200
um

1093
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,240
next where are we

1094
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,920
ah here we go see i'm gonna start to

1095
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,839
unpack some math now when i when i start

1096
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,319
to roll out the variables here we go

1097
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:37,680
okay

1098
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,960
so

1099
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,480
we will be interested in what follows in

1100
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,920
quantum systems considered to be

1101
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,680
observers that deploy one or more

1102
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,520
distinct quantum reference frames to

1103
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,520
measure particular subsets of the bits

1104
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,839
encoded on their boundaries slash markup

1105
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:53,760
blankets um and yes these will d

1106
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,760
effectively decompose the holographic

1107
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,800
green fancy b into disjoint sectors that

1108
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,480
we will label e for the observed

1109
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,319
environment f for the unobserved

1110
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:05,200
environment and y for the memory sector

1111
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,480
prospectively

1112
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,960
so um yeah we're gonna we're gonna break

1113
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,240
that out

1114
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,839
um

1115
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,839
i think

1116
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:16,000
yeah attention also so they really talk

1117
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,440
about the sectors

1118
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,599
as a sense right like so i have like my

1119
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,040
vision sector my hearing sector my taste

1120
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,800
sector right and so like i'm making

1121
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,480
observations of my environment with all

1122
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,280
these like my temperature sensing sector

1123
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,960
so there's all of these different ways

1124
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,960
um you know to observe the environment

1125
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,280
with different sectors

1126
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,839
so yeah cool it's kind of like saying

1127
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:39,680
you win some you lose some

1128
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,040
you don't play

1129
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,560
every game

1130
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,079
it's kind of like whatever space we're

1131
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,760
talking about here which happens to be

1132
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,440
this boundary that has all these

1133
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,960
interesting properties

1134
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,040
there's some that are being observed

1135
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,359
some that are being unobserved and a

1136
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,800
special sector that gives continuity of

1137
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,880
information in some way through time

1138
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,119
yeah

1139
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,760
um so this is cool here free choice of a

1140
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,800
decomposition of a holographic screen

1141
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,839
fancy b

1142
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,680
interceptors with different quantum

1143
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,240
reference frame induced semantics is

1144
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,079
indicative of agency

1145
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,400
so i like that and i'm curious to um

1146
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,760
unpack that maybe a little bit more

1147
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,599
something for to ask the authors about

1148
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:26,960
in the dot one

1149
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,520
yeah or also all non-trivial agents are

1150
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,359
cognitive systems that engage in active

1151
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:32,400
inference

1152
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,440
what

1153
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,119
is non-trivial

1154
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,400
who

1155
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,400
like how do we escape or how do we

1156
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,400
escape this infinite

1157
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,839
multi-perspective

1158
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:45,440
multi-scenario universe or do we just

1159
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,359
have a way of working with that

1160
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,119
i do think that they get into

1161
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,520
non-trivial here in a little while um

1162
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,760
but yeah they say a non-trivial agent is

1163
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,920
a system with internal dynamics that

1164
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,400
breaks the swap symmetry of its boundary

1165
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,400
markov blanket holographic screen

1166
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,920
however they're going to start to use

1167
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,760
these things interchangeably so i'm just

1168
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,280
going to keep saying holographic screen

1169
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,400
fancy b

1170
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,800
um but but i guess if your internal

1171
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,839
dynamics don't break the swap symmetry

1172
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:14,640
or

1173
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,319
right like if your internal dynamics are

1174
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:17,599
it are

1175
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,720
um trivial or like not relevant

1176
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,640
um or if you don't if they don't have an

1177
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,359
effect on the boundary maybe that's that

1178
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:27,119
becomes trivial

1179
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:28,720
yeah wondering if that's the mirror

1180
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,800
versus adaptive active inference

1181
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,960
boundary that we've discussed or what

1182
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,880
what this maps to

1183
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,359
where does this kick in or not so we'll

1184
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:38,720
explore it though

1185
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,480
it totally seems like it's definitely

1186
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,720
the mirror versus active inference

1187
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,200
that's how i interpreted it as i was

1188
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,280
reading it so

1189
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,520
it sounds like that to me oh

1190
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,359
and okay now we're gonna head into some

1191
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,359
17 related

1192
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:56,720
information because they're going to

1193
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,280
turn this discussion from qrfs

1194
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,359
as reference frames

1195
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,680
to channel theory

1196
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,440
which is going to enable this context

1197
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,520
switching discussion that's important

1198
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,920
later so this is brought up

1199
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,160
in number 17

1200
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,880
and 17.1 is where we had chris fields

1201
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,760
and

1202
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,760
uh great discussion there so continue

1203
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,200
blue

1204
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,240
cool

1205
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,359
um yeah so

1206
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:25,440
channel theory of quantum reference

1207
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,720
frames

1208
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,640
so i think we've said channel theory is

1209
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,960
an application of category theory

1210
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,160
to two spaces and i'm not gonna read the

1211
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,000
paper here but i'm going to go back to

1212
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,480
some of the slides that we used from 17

1213
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,240
because i think that we kind of

1214
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,240
unraveled it there in a way that was

1215
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,640
maybe digestible more so than reading

1216
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,640
you know equations off of a paper

1217
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,119
um so this is the true space

1218
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,839
daniel what's a two space so k is a set

1219
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,880
a are objects x are attributes

1220
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,240
a two space

1221
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,599
fancy a

1222
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,680
over the set k

1223
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,200
is the relationship

1224
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,520
between the objects a

1225
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,280
and their attributes x

1226
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,640
i thought of it just like a computer

1227
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,599
function

1228
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:13,760
like in python or any language that's

1229
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,880
just taking in three kinds of data

1230
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,119
the set the objects and the attributes

1231
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,640
so

1232
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,240
describing

1233
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,599
a large variety of things

1234
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:28,560
but it's just kind of integrating those

1235
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,040
three types of data

1236
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,760
in a principled way

1237
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,560
and

1238
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,400
enabling transformations between

1239
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,000
different representations that might

1240
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,240
look very different or allow for

1241
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,000
different implementations but also

1242
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,520
commonly use

1243
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,680
like all of this information or even

1244
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,760
just a subset of the information because

1245
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,200
that just throws out information which

1246
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,440
you can always do

1247
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,440
i really like the python example so like

1248
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,640
if k is the python dictionary a are the

1249
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,920
keys and x are the values like you can

1250
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,000
describe the relationship between the

1251
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,680
keys and the values

1252
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,839
with a chew space like that is that what

1253
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:07,839
the shoe space does so like you could

1254
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:10,560
say you know your keys are apple orange

1255
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,960
banana and your values are red orange

1256
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,920
yellow and so then the two spaces

1257
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,200
how you describe that relationship color

1258
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,040
something like that

1259
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,560
cool okay

1260
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,440
so going into channel theory and how two

1261
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,760
spaces um

1262
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,599
work how channel theory works so it says

1263
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:32,000
in channel theory two transforms become

1264
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,520
isomorphisms

1265
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,599
which are natural maps between

1266
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:36,960
classifiers

1267
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,560
so classifiers link tokens to types that

1268
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,280
encompass them like for a stoplight a

1269
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,680
set of tokens would be red

1270
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,240
green and yellow so that is the set of

1271
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,640
tokens

1272
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,200
i think this just builds one level on

1273
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,040
what you described which is instead of

1274
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,440
just the data structure

1275
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,000
of just saying this is what the function

1276
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,760
is requesting or this is why it's being

1277
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,680
stored in memory this is like saying

1278
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,200
we're going to interpret some of these

1279
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,640
edges and relationships as classifier

1280
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,880
mappings or infomorphisms like

1281
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,200
information sharing or statistical

1282
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,760
dependencies or some other type of

1283
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,920
informational edge

1284
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,520
but on that

1285
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,839
space that we've been discussing

1286
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:26,640
yes so so they take it to um a

1287
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,640
diagrammatic level where at the center

1288
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,079
it's almost looks like a pyramid so

1289
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:31,359
there's a c

1290
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,839
um and this this core c is the

1291
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,319
information channel this is the

1292
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:39,040
infomorphism that allows semantic

1293
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,720
information and this i thought it was

1294
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,480
very cool that it's very different from

1295
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,559
shannon information it's not just bits

1296
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:47,200
it's like the meaning behind the bits um

1297
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,720
like you can say you know you can see

1298
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,079
the word um

1299
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,079
bank and are they talking about a

1300
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,160
riverbank um the bank that holds your

1301
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,319
money or like a bank shot in pool like

1302
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,640
there's some underlying

1303
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,040
i i would dare to say context

1304
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,680
that is important for not just the

1305
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,920
letters b a and k in that order so it's

1306
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,079
not just the tokens in the particular

1307
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:11,280
order but it's like the semantic context

1308
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,960
that allows transmission between

1309
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,920
classifiers so i look at this like a

1310
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,760
shared memory so like if we look at the

1311
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,559
classifier a1 here which would be

1312
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,240
stoplight the tokens are red green and

1313
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,200
yellow

1314
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,079
classifier a2 would be motorist actions

1315
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,119
the tokens would be stop go forward or i

1316
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:30,800
say proceed slowly but it's really get

1317
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,079
out of the intersection right like

1318
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:34,319
that's what yellow means um and then

1319
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:35,839
there's other classifier types could be

1320
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,160
like pedestrian actions child's game

1321
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,280
actions like when you're playing red

1322
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,200
like green light do you run do you stop

1323
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,200
like freeze um

1324
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,280
so or do you walk right so there's all

1325
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,359
these different um

1326
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,319
classifiers that can then map via a core

1327
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:52,160
information channel c

1328
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,000
shared memory semantic information

1329
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,599
between those

1330
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,760
classifiers

1331
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,200
cool okay

1332
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,559
so

1333
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:03,440
going on they build

1334
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,920
from this pyramid they invert the

1335
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,680
pyramid um to form this cone cocoon

1336
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,119
diagram

1337
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:12,800
so

1338
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,359
they say

1339
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:16,880
that

1340
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,200
a commuting finite cone

1341
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,200
diagram is made of a cone which is the

1342
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,599
upright pyramid and a cocoon which is

1343
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:26,800
the inverted pyramid on a finite set of

1344
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,720
classifiers

1345
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,359
um it

1346
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:34,240
illustrates commutativity so

1347
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,599
specifically these operators

1348
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:38,319
g12

1349
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,880
g23 like you can go all the way out to

1350
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,440
the set like there's a commutativity or

1351
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,079
like a um

1352
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:50,240
superimposability commutativity between

1353
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,319
with a shared infomorphism if that makes

1354
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:54,559
sense it also captures this more subtle

1355
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,079
duality between

1356
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,640
processes um it enables object files

1357
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,359
tokens and histories to be viewed not as

1358
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:04,000
tokens but as types that organize

1359
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,400
um respectively trajectory components

1360
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,000
features and feature-based singular

1361
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,640
categories and and make them mutually

1362
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,880
consistent collections so like where you

1363
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,720
have all of those um

1364
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,559
classifiers they are they're

1365
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:18,559
consistent across the board

1366
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:20,400
so you can use them to map and unmap

1367
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,400
right

1368
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,280
if i can just give a take on this

1369
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,079
so g12 is saying that there's a

1370
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:29,680
relationship between

1371
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,640
a1 and a2 it could be like appending by

1372
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,640
one row or maybe changing one little bit

1373
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,480
through time or having some ability to

1374
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,160
translate like a state machine or

1375
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,760
something like that

1376
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:40,800
let's just

1377
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,240
say that there's some relationship and

1378
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,240
then there's also these f functions that

1379
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,440
allow the a's to be part of a shared

1380
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,079
context like the pedestrian scene that

1381
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:51,520
makes sense

1382
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,480
and then

1383
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,680
that is shaped like a cone

1384
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,800
and then

1385
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,920
that is kind of like sense making

1386
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,880
that semantics is making sense and then

1387
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,920
this cocon or the diamond shape

1388
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,880
is where there's c and d who are both

1389
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,720
like cognitive

1390
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,520
sense making frames

1391
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,000
and then now they're having a shared

1392
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,599
holograph

1393
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:20,800
a or shared access

1394
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,800
and then it's that

1395
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,359
is a different object with a different

1396
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:28,078
geometry

1397
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,640
yeah that would be like i'm looking at

1398
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,800
the same set of classifiers that you're

1399
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,720
looking at and we both see we both know

1400
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,079
what they mean we both know that red

1401
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:37,440
means stop and

1402
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,960
um greedy means go

1403
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,119
semantically exactly

1404
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:44,000
right right or red could mean apple

1405
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,440
depending on depending on where you're

1406
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,040
going with that right so it could be it

1407
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,839
could be an inside joke

1408
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:50,559
yeah

1409
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:54,160
um okay cool so there's the cone cocoon

1410
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,480
hopefully that was um unpacked with some

1411
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,000
level of uh

1412
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,599
intelligibility

1413
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:01,040
so

1414
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,640
now we can move into figure two

1415
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,920
where they attach this cone cone diagram

1416
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,480
to measurement operators

1417
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,440
any set of measurement operators

1418
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,319
that

1419
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:15,760
are

1420
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,280
used to measure

1421
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,720
the um states on the

1422
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,880
boundary that defines

1423
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,960
the relationship between a and b this

1424
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,770
hiv between system a and system b

1425
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:28,880
[Music]

1426
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,520
were the scientists we cared about r

1427
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,400
context c we're system a we're making

1428
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,400
measurements from our perspective of a

1429
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,599
screen

1430
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:40,000
and we're setting the context of

1431
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,240
interpreting those observations in this

1432
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,800
situation

1433
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,800
totally um i could definitely be

1434
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,079
standing on the other side of that

1435
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:49,680
holographic screen making my

1436
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,760
measurements from d from the inverted

1437
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,200
from the upside down pyramid but they

1438
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,359
would be left and right pointing

1439
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:57,280
measuring onto the same screen if i was

1440
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,520
system b and you were system a in that

1441
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,720
kind of context

1442
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:03,839
cool

1443
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:05,520
anything else to add

1444
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,040
no

1445
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,640
awesome

1446
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,599
okay um so this is just some more i

1447
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:13,280
think this slide talking about the cone

1448
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,119
cone

1449
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:16,240
diagram

1450
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,079
but but something that's

1451
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:19,920
to point out that there's the dual

1452
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,240
construction that is when it commutes i

1453
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,720
think i did say that already so when the

1454
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,599
infomorphisms on the same classifiers

1455
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:29,280
where all the arrows are reversed when

1456
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,760
it's reversible then that's a commuting

1457
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,240
cone cone diagram

1458
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,400
so non-community is the opposite of that

1459
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,359
right so we're going to talk about

1460
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:39,920
non-commutativity as we go forward

1461
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,160
and here what's one thing that i think

1462
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,640
is happening hopefully is like we have

1463
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,079
been discussing this in the context of

1464
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:47,599
two different observers having the same

1465
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,800
semantics from the same screen c and d

1466
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,200
and then they say if c equals d or c

1467
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,200
prime equals d prime

1468
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,800
then

1469
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,440
you can sort of draw another

1470
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,520
consistent world and this is sort of

1471
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:04,160
like a recognition semantics

1472
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,160
and then the outcome is like an

1473
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,800
operational or generative semantics in a

1474
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,240
different way because it's like

1475
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,400
generating the observations or something

1476
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,400
like that but there's going to be like a

1477
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,480
duel between the diamond and the

1478
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,200
hourglass

1479
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,520
nice

1480
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,119
cool

1481
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:25,839
okay

1482
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:28,240
um all right here we go

1483
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,640
more of this um

1484
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,200
commutativity so so here they talk about

1485
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,240
commutativity as bayesian coherence now

1486
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,520
we talked a little bit about quantum

1487
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,280
coherence earlier but there's this

1488
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,119
they're bringing this notion of bayesian

1489
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,000
coherence up so viewing commutativity

1490
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,599
and bayesian

1491
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:47,359
coherence as fundamental to the

1492
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:49,760
definition of measurement like if i

1493
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,119
measure the

1494
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,040
length of the salamander and daniel

1495
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,480
measures the length of the cylinder

1496
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,480
salamander there there we could get the

1497
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,599
same answer or not um so

1498
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:01,520
and hence also to the definition of

1499
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:05,040
preparation or action on the environment

1500
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,960
so this suggests this born rule

1501
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,760
which is that's what you blew up daniel

1502
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,680
don't know what it is let's learn about

1503
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,040
it

1504
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,400
yeah

1505
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:20,960
okay yeah that was that one's um right

1506
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,799
let's learn that let's let's let the

1507
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:24,559
authors unpack that one for us

1508
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:27,040
yeah oh yeah that's the rule

1509
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,880
so here blow it up again for me oh i'll

1510
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,920
blow it up actually myself

1511
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,200
so

1512
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,240
yeah too far

1513
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:42,160
so they say the probability of obtaining

1514
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,839
x

1515
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:47,359
to state x is the sum of

1516
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:48,720
observations over states is that

1517
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,000
observations in the states i should have

1518
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,920
defined these then the probability of

1519
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,520
obtaining

1520
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,440
a measurement is it a measurement as an

1521
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,079
observational outcome

1522
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:00,000
uh in the description for coherently

1523
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,040
assigning amplitudes to components

1524
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,280
okay so anyway we can let the authors

1525
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,960
unpack that one for us i can't do it

1526
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,040
all right repeated measurements and

1527
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,200
system identification so this is section

1528
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,720
three moving on

1529
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,119
we develop in section 3 a generic formal

1530
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:19,280
description of how one quantum system

1531
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,280
identifies another quantum system as a

1532
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,240
persistent entity a thing so here

1533
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,240
they're going to talk about thingness

1534
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,240
and measures records and compares its

1535
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,559
states by deploying

1536
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:33,200
deploying specific sequences of quantum

1537
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,520
reference frames and so like how do i

1538
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,280
know that daniel is a different thing

1539
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,880
than me right

1540
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,200
um yeah that's cool sometimes i think

1541
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,319
we're the same thing because we're doing

1542
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,960
the same thing at the same time

1543
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,400
is there a thing

1544
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,920
is there a group thing

1545
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,280
that's a group thing

1546
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,040
our consensus

1547
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,160
we're having a thing at my house

1548
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,359
that's it

1549
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:57,040
all right

1550
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,920
um so they break this section so these

1551
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,559
sections get really awesome so memory

1552
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:04,240
time and course grading

1553
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,319
the idea that a system must possess a

1554
00:57:07,319 --> 00:57:08,880
quasi-non-equilibrium steady state

1555
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,359
solution to its density dynamics and

1556
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:13,520
hence be restricted to trajectories in

1557
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,839
its classical configuration space that

1558
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:18,400
do not diverge exponentially over time

1559
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,799
in order to be observable as a thing

1560
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:23,280
immediately raises the issues of time as

1561
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,400
the measurable duration and of memory as

1562
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,920
persistent over measurable time

1563
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,880
and so that they show in this figure

1564
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,880
that the agent a

1565
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,720
can only detect changes in

1566
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,799
the nest density and employ them as

1567
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:43,760
bases for inference if actions

1568
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,640
and actions if a can write time ordered

1569
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:47,680
records

1570
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,599
to subsequently read from the memory

1571
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:52,839
sector y so here the memory sector is y

1572
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:55,520
um the environment is e

1573
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,599
and this g i j

1574
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:58,960
here i think it's better done in the

1575
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,480
next one oh yeah perfect we have the

1576
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,520
next screen right here yep um so eij is

1577
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,839
this um a time clock a time step

1578
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:10,559
from one memory that's the dynamics of

1579
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,040
internal time internal clock that's what

1580
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,480
it is of

1581
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,119
the agent

1582
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,359
um

1583
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:21,040
we talked already about the different

1584
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,960
parts of the screen and how some are

1585
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,119
being observed some are unobserved and

1586
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:27,440
then there's the memory sector and here

1587
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,960
like the um unobserved environment

1588
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,040
is the

1589
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,760
biggest set i think it's like

1590
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,880
mostly at least in this image

1591
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,200
and so one question is just what does

1592
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,079
this represent in terms of our computers

1593
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:46,480
or our sensory apparatus

1594
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,480
and how is it related to some of the

1595
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,240
work that they like cited and some

1596
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,280
related

1597
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,400
work

1598
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,880
about attention and bayesian graphs

1599
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,839
this is a cool representation also like

1600
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:03,119
notice that your observations are

1601
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:05,520
different and not overlapping with from

1602
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,520
your memory

1603
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,520
like if your old memory the new

1604
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,520
information isn't coming in

1605
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,559
if you're not paying attention to

1606
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:14,559
anything it can't have an effect like

1607
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:17,200
that type of thing

1608
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,520
right and so this is an illustration of

1609
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,359
quantum reference frames required to

1610
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:23,760
write a readable memory of an observed

1611
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,359
environmental state

1612
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:26,240
e

1613
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,799
so e and y read the state from e and

1614
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:30,960
write it to y respectively

1615
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,640
and the clock is a time quantum

1616
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,640
reference frame that defines the time

1617
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,480
coordinate a so

1618
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,680
at the time step you read the

1619
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,040
environment and then you write it to

1620
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,079
memory

1621
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:41,200
y

1622
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,799
cool

1623
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:45,040
little perception action loop with

1624
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,839
memory

1625
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:49,839
yeah

1626
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:53,359
okay four yep in a loop sorry cool

1627
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:54,400
awesome

1628
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,040
the figure four

1629
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:57,839
um

1630
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:01,680
it's a memory read write cycle

1631
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:02,720
defining

1632
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:06,160
one tick from i to j of the environment

1633
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,119
so

1634
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:09,920
here it's like you

1635
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,000
read from the environment

1636
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,400
measure or read measure and then write

1637
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,240
prepare so like you prepare for the next

1638
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,119
time

1639
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:19,119
step

1640
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:20,880
all quantum reference frames and the

1641
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,799
comparison functions are implemented by

1642
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:25,440
the quantum dynamics ta which is the big

1643
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,760
block arrow

1644
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,640
so if this were like an eeg headset that

1645
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,839
was measuring at 100 hertz 100 times per

1646
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:36,799
second that would be like 100 classical

1647
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,960
information reads per second and then

1648
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,960
you could do signal processing

1649
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,720
i think this is kind of like

1650
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:46,000
the time step is the sampling frequency

1651
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,480
of the experimental apparatus that's

1652
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:52,160
defined by this partitioning

1653
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,640
of the blanket fancy b

1654
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,200
holograph and then sub sectors

1655
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,680
with these different interpretations of

1656
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,760
being like observed unobserved or memory

1657
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,599
components

1658
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:05,200
and and the authors say here they say

1659
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:09,200
formally we think of this pa

1660
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,440
as the weighted sum of all possible

1661
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,400
paths

1662
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,559
from the boundary boundaries

1663
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:16,559
from the boundary the fancy b at one

1664
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:18,799
state to the boundary the fancy b at the

1665
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:21,280
next state so that is the internal

1666
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,400
dynamics are how the holographic screen

1667
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,000
is shifted from

1668
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,319
t to t plus one

1669
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:30,640
and also this is where there's the cone

1670
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,960
so the the b are like those that line of

1671
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,400
a's that are all lined up and then now

1672
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,119
it's bottlenecking this is the hourglass

1673
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:39,599
and then going back out

1674
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:41,040
yes

1675
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:42,079
yes

1676
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:44,079
should superimpose those

1677
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:48,480
um figures for next time yep

1678
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:52,160
um yeah all right then memory time and

1679
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,520
course grading

1680
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,599
so the internal dynamics that operate on

1681
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:57,039
those states to maintain a

1682
01:01:57,039 --> 01:01:59,520
non-equilibrium steady state density

1683
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,160
are spatially localized inside of the

1684
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,400
boundary

1685
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,079
and the boundary represents a hilbert

1686
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:09,359
space where we talked earlier um and

1687
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:12,000
it's not a physical space-time

1688
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
decomposition

1689
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,920
so the boundary b is all those little

1690
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:20,799
spheres still

1691
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:22,720
what is memory

1692
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,559
we'll discuss it

1693
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:26,720
yeah and importantly they say figure

1694
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,240
four illustrates an important

1695
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,079
distinguishing distinction between

1696
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,160
classical and quantum representations of

1697
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,599
dynamics

1698
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:35,760
um classical physics assumes a space

1699
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,359
time in betting

1700
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:39,039
and the

1701
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:42,000
quantum does not

1702
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,680
interesting

1703
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,440
yeah i'm curious about the self

1704
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,880
evidencing that they mention here also

1705
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,359
i'll have to ask them about that

1706
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:57,598
okay

1707
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,880
okay cool

1708
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,559
learning and generative models i'll let

1709
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:02,559
you take this one away

1710
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:03,680
um

1711
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:04,960
this kind of

1712
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,799
took us almost briefly out of the

1713
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:08,799
quantum but just

1714
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:11,119
to give an example of a simpler thing

1715
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:12,880
that this is like an elaboration or a

1716
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:15,039
generalization of a bayesian approach

1717
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:16,880
like calm and filtering

1718
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,799
which is just taking it's like a

1719
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:21,520
dragging an estimate through time as new

1720
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,280
information comes in

1721
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,200
and so that's what's happening in a

1722
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,440
sense here with formalism 27 there's a

1723
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,359
prior and a posterior

1724
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:31,280
and that's moving forward so it's kind

1725
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:34,079
of like using this dragging

1726
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:35,359
filter

1727
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:37,119
through time

1728
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:38,880
if that were classical information and

1729
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,319
then there's something different

1730
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:41,680
happening with quantum

1731
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:42,960
and that's that that piece that we're

1732
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,200
gonna keep on returning to but this is

1733
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,640
like a bayesian

1734
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,240
analog

1735
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,720
and now the math is

1736
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:51,680
being

1737
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:56,440
used to describe these quantum systems

1738
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,200
yes okay moving on section 3.3

1739
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,359
identifying and measuring systems

1740
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:05,039
embedded in e

1741
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:06,720
so we've so far considered only

1742
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,280
observers a that measure the states of

1743
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,520
their observed environments e without

1744
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,400
decomposing

1745
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,559
e into systems that have their own

1746
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,640
specific states

1747
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,319
and the question of how an observer

1748
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:19,680
distinguishes a system from the

1749
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,119
environment

1750
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:23,520
in which s is embedded

1751
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:26,960
is central to classical cybernetics so i

1752
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,839
think that that's um important like

1753
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:31,359
are the other agents do they matter are

1754
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:32,720
they just part of the environment like

1755
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,000
there's always that

1756
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,760
um question of of you know is is it its

1757
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:40,400
own thing that other person over there

1758
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,480
or it's just my perception of my

1759
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,160
environment

1760
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,480
and the second part there is like it's

1761
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,799
um that sort of entity niche

1762
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:51,039
differentiation or delineation and then

1763
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:54,079
under the rubric of object persistence

1764
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:56,640
the conceptuality of thickness

1765
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,079
to cognitive and developmental

1766
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:00,000
psychology so that's like children with

1767
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,960
peek-a-boo and so it's like what

1768
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:06,880
connects the child playing peek-a-boo

1769
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,520
to the cybernetic entity differentiating

1770
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,200
causes

1771
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,200
and how does quantum

1772
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,200
with its observer

1773
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:18,240
based relationality

1774
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:21,959
connect those areas

1775
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:24,720
so here they use a special

1776
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,559
delineation for an environment that

1777
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:29,520
indicates the remainder of e when other

1778
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:32,319
systems in the environment are removed

1779
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:34,319
and the question of how an observer

1780
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:36,079
distinguishes an external system from

1781
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:38,640
its surrounding environment prior to and

1782
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,720
as a precondition for measuring some

1783
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,079
state of interest

1784
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:44,079
is um not something that people

1785
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:46,640
traditionally address because it is

1786
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,359
thermodynamically and computationally

1787
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:51,039
difficult demanding

1788
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:54,559
special requirements on the observers

1789
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:58,720
cool

1790
01:05:58,720 --> 01:05:59,680
all right

1791
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,599
so figure 5 shows us the system i think

1792
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,280
it just shows us like

1793
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,319
pretty much where we are systems s

1794
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:09,200
you know here you have a and b

1795
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,680
identifying

1796
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,680
requires identifying some proper

1797
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,160
component r that maintains a constant

1798
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,160
state or a density of time average

1799
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:21,039
samples as the pointer state

1800
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:22,880
of

1801
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,720
pi right so

1802
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,079
you need a pointer to point to the

1803
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:27,200
system

1804
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,240
um

1805
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,160
or density of time average samples of

1806
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,079
interest varies oh so like as this goes

1807
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:35,440
to attention right so what is your

1808
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,680
what are you pointing to

1809
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,680
oh another way i was kind of seeing this

1810
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:42,559
one was um this the

1811
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,160
it's like a clock hand so this could be

1812
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,160
like a time scenario or it could be

1813
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:48,079
quantum with like the spin or with the

1814
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:49,760
angle in a complex field or something

1815
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,920
like that but you can decompose the

1816
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,000
total system s

1817
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,680
into the time invariant part which is

1818
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:57,920
like your python data structure and

1819
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,680
that's like saying here's the the

1820
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,680
structure of the variables

1821
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,359
and then just like the variables

1822
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:05,440
themselves that are time variant which

1823
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,359
is like the clock hands so they'll be

1824
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:08,799
like the body of the clock that's time

1825
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:10,000
invariant

1826
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,240
and then there's the parts that are time

1827
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,160
varying

1828
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,520
i don't know how that

1829
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:17,520
r and p

1830
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:20,000
and s partitioning connects back but

1831
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,640
that's what this kind of looks like

1832
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:23,920
yeah

1833
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,240
i'm also kind of unsure about

1834
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,960
the pointer states and but i think it's

1835
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:32,960
the interest varies right so um

1836
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,480
yeah

1837
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,079
which i think i think that points to

1838
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:38,240
attention like as your interest as your

1839
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,559
point of focus shifts like what are you

1840
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:42,400
pointing to because like as you look

1841
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:43,280
here

1842
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,799
in one direction there's a set of

1843
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:46,240
variables that are there in that

1844
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,160
direction like this wall that corner

1845
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,920
this refrigerator or whatever and then

1846
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:52,160
as you shift here your

1847
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,760
interest or attention is shifting to a

1848
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,240
new set of variables but you still know

1849
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,599
that that other set of variables is

1850
01:07:57,599 --> 01:07:59,280
there that goes to the object permanence

1851
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,960
that we were just talking about before

1852
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,720
so like i know that refrigerator was in

1853
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,720
my first point of view but it's not in

1854
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:05,839
my second point of view but i know that

1855
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:08,160
it's still there um that that to me kind

1856
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,680
of is how how i think about this the

1857
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,078
pointer

1858
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:14,079
uh it'll be for the authors to maybe

1859
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:16,799
unpack this one a little bit more for us

1860
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:17,920
um

1861
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,920
oh okay we did talk about the markov

1862
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,839
colonel versus the marco blanket daniel

1863
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:25,839
you you so eloquently explain it to me

1864
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:29,679
just one possibility is the blanket is

1865
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:31,600
the set of states that insulate the

1866
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,120
internal and the external making them

1867
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,719
conditionally independent and then the

1868
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:37,439
markov kernel could be like that applied

1869
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:39,198
through time

1870
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:41,759
and it's kind of like a arima model you

1871
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:43,439
could have like a temporal depth of an

1872
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:45,679
auto regression and then the temporal

1873
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:49,198
depth of the markov kernel through time

1874
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:51,600
would be like what time steps

1875
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,719
are able to

1876
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:57,520
carry forward

1877
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,719
but let's discuss that with people who

1878
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,198
know better

1879
01:09:03,198 --> 01:09:04,238
yes

1880
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:07,679
cool okay good um

1881
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:10,158
all right so non-commutativity

1882
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:12,080
uh context switching

1883
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,679
so we talked about

1884
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:15,198
non-commutativity we talked about what

1885
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:16,799
commutativity means and so

1886
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:18,799
non-commutativity would be

1887
01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:21,279
the opposite of that um

1888
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:24,640
so here they say as emphasized by bohr

1889
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:27,600
100 years ago a finite quantum of action

1890
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,000
partitions the set of all possible

1891
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,158
quantum measurement operators into a set

1892
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:35,198
of complementary non-commuting pairs the

1893
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:37,198
most well-known being position and

1894
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:38,880
momentum so if you're trying to measure

1895
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,719
the position of a particle you can't

1896
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:43,920
simultaneously measure the momentum of

1897
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,839
the particle at the same time so that's

1898
01:09:46,839 --> 01:09:48,399
non-commutativity

1899
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:50,399
yes and so

1900
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:53,920
why does context switching matter

1901
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,679
they say an observable

1902
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:57,920
an observer a capable of switching

1903
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,080
between non-commuting quantum reference

1904
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,480
frames must to maintain an operable

1905
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,640
memory implement a clock that is

1906
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:07,520
invariant under basis rotations

1907
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:08,480
on

1908
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:09,920
the energy between a and b or the

1909
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:12,239
physical interaction between a and b if

1910
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:14,719
measurements made at clock ticks i and j

1911
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:17,280
do not commute however the corresponding

1912
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,440
clock operations will not commute

1913
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,920
um so

1914
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:23,920
non-commutativity forces ta which is

1915
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,560
time or the time

1916
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,960
step that it takes to record a memory to

1917
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:30,960
be unidirectional and hence memory

1918
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,679
records to be encoded irreversibly with

1919
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:36,560
an accompanying expenditure

1920
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,239
so the internal clock thus defines ta as

1921
01:10:40,239 --> 01:10:42,400
entropic time i thought that was super

1922
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,640
interesting so it's not like actual time

1923
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,280
but it's like time that you paid entropy

1924
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:50,080
for like time that entropy was expended

1925
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,199
for

1926
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:54,000
i'm on the clock

1927
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:58,400
time requiring work right or

1928
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:04,000
something to that end

1929
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,440
all right

1930
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,199
uh

1931
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:10,000
cool so context switching between

1932
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,080
non-commuting quantum reference frames

1933
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:14,000
like position and momentum

1934
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,080
while holding the other

1935
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,560
quantum reference frame constant so

1936
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,960
that's the one that's constant is here

1937
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,880
the one that's ref

1938
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:25,280
in this figure 34 or equation what is

1939
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:26,960
this thing it's a diagram that's what it

1940
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,520
is so in this diagram number 34

1941
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:32,719
um these different pointer sectors u and

1942
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:33,440
v

1943
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,360
could be like the different um

1944
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,120
non-computing

1945
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,880
and then you have overlapping but

1946
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:41,760
mutually communicating operators

1947
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:45,199
in a canonical canonical context switch

1948
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:46,960
so

1949
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:49,440
that's like someone could be standing

1950
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:52,000
not at the

1951
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,640
train platform or on the train and be

1952
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,880
observing both of those people

1953
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,400
i suppose

1954
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,400
different frame a bigger a bigger

1955
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,560
context they each have their own local

1956
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,719
coherence but it's interoperable so it's

1957
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:06,960
part of a bigger umbrella which is like

1958
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:09,760
the big c at the top

1959
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:10,640
cool

1960
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:12,400
okay okay

1961
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,440
good

1962
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,400
so

1963
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,040
that's diagram 34. if it fails to

1964
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,960
commute

1965
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,880
then the observables are

1966
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,400
non-co-deployable

1967
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,400
so that's like position and momentum

1968
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,280
those are

1969
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,440
non-co-deployable

1970
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:31,120
observables so non-commutativity in the

1971
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:34,000
in diagram 34

1972
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,520
has been specified in terms of

1973
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,040
non-existence of a consistently

1974
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:39,360
definable joint probability distribution

1975
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:40,640
of conditionals

1976
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:42,159
so that's like the conditional

1977
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:43,760
independence right

1978
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,760
this non-co-deployable

1979
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,080
co-deployability of observables amounts

1980
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:51,280
to the occurrence of intrinsic quantum

1981
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:53,760
contextuality in relationship to that

1982
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:56,320
diagram so this goes really back it

1983
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:57,760
speaks a lot to

1984
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:00,400
what um chris talked to us about when we

1985
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,960
did number 17.

1986
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:06,320
so let's get notes on this stuff

1987
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:07,840
yeah for sure

1988
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:08,960
um

1989
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,080
so they say in 4.2 below that context

1990
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:13,120
switching

1991
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:15,679
increases variational free energy by

1992
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:19,120
generating prediction errors um and like

1993
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:21,760
if you're in one context and you have a

1994
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:22,880
prediction

1995
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:24,320
and then you move to another context

1996
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,080
with the same prediction your outcome's

1997
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:27,040
going to be

1998
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:29,280
different so it increases very

1999
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,199
variational free energy

2000
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:33,520
which makes minimizing very variational

2001
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,199
free energy and complying with the fvp

2002
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:38,000
more difficult so like going from my

2003
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,320
same generative model from one context

2004
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,480
to another context to another context

2005
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,320
makes it hard

2006
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,159
but can lead to radically better

2007
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:47,520
generative models so you're always

2008
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,280
updating your gen your model becomes

2009
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,360
more generalizable generalizable under

2010
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,840
different contexts

2011
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,719
so yes quant context switching poses a

2012
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:58,960
fundamental challenge to any classical

2013
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:02,600
formulation of the fep and a fundamental

2014
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,640
explanation i've not heard that before

2015
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,280
for quantum formulation

2016
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,080
um

2017
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:09,840
i wonder if this provides like some

2018
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:12,400
evidence for us having a shared reality

2019
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:14,960
and i i've um brought that up a couple

2020
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:16,719
different times too

2021
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:18,480
here

2022
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:21,199
cool it's the fact thing or expression

2023
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:25,678
which is to be explained or explicated

2024
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:30,080
nice okay now let's get to the paper

2025
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,920
what do you think blue

2026
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:34,159
we're finally here um

2027
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:36,800
we made it this is the best part

2028
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:39,120
uh yeah the fvp for generic quantum

2029
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,040
systems so all that background was to

2030
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:44,000
lead you here to the um to this place

2031
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,199
where we are now so how the fep emerges

2032
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:49,120
in this setting um and we're gonna look

2033
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,440
at its asymptotic behavior um

2034
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,199
considering how it addresses the

2035
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:54,320
fundamental

2036
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,640
problem that's posed by quantum context

2037
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:59,040
switches

2038
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,560
all right

2039
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:03,199
we're getting there

2040
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:04,960
all right

2041
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,600
you want to take this one

2042
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,360
we're going to go into more detail so

2043
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:10,640
that we can

2044
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:14,159
get a lot more in to this dot zero but

2045
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:16,320
we've seen the variational free energy

2046
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:19,679
in the context of perceptual inference

2047
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:21,520
where there's a surprisal and a

2048
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:24,000
divergence term that gets bounded so

2049
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,600
this is kind of like the snapshot

2050
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,640
question given the incoming sensory

2051
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,000
observations

2052
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,719
how should i update my generative model

2053
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:34,400
it's learning it's like a perceptual

2054
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:37,799
common filter

2055
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,120
yes

2056
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:43,360
it doesn't have action involved

2057
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:44,880
nice

2058
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:47,679
um they have this formulation of

2059
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:49,679
prediction error

2060
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:52,640
and they this is actually from um

2061
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:55,520
section 3.2 it's a representation of the

2062
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,280
prediction error of

2063
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,440
system a or agent a

2064
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:02,880
so this e-r-e-k

2065
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,719
so k we'll just let's go through these

2066
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:08,159
black ones first so k is the internal

2067
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:10,880
time clock so agent a's internal time

2068
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:14,000
clock ta it counts it it ticks it up

2069
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,880
so fancy b is the holographic screen

2070
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:19,360
pb is the dynamics of the interaction

2071
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:21,520
partner b

2072
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:24,960
and then this m sub e with respect to k

2073
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,120
is the observable behavior of the

2074
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:29,040
holographic screen fancy b

2075
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:33,280
localized to the sector e up to time t a

2076
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:36,239
equals k so like up to up leading up

2077
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:39,440
into this point um so is the observed

2078
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:41,040
environment just to connect it to the

2079
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,960
previous formalism e is the observed

2080
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:46,880
environment that is it so here this m a

2081
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:50,800
e this is the agent a's generative model

2082
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:53,760
of the action of the undo un known

2083
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,560
dynamics pb

2084
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:59,440
with respect to time i think oh yeah

2085
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,679
on the markup or the markup boundary

2086
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:04,400
holographic screen fancy b in sector e

2087
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,800
the environment that we looked at

2088
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,400
which is kind of like saying you only

2089
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,880
need to have a generative model on where

2090
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:15,880
you're expecting to find observations

2091
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,360
if you're going to measure just the

2092
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,360
thermometer you make a generative model

2093
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,199
with just a thermometer and that's how

2094
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:24,560
you get the cone cocon diamond

2095
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,080
hourglass

2096
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,640
that isn't like with extraneous or

2097
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:32,480
redundant or incompatible elements

2098
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:35,199
so here this um equation prediction

2099
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:37,360
error it's like er sub

2100
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:38,960
parenthesis k

2101
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,400
um this is the

2102
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:43,360
agent's agent a's total reducible

2103
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:46,480
uncertainty about agent or system b

2104
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:49,440
at time t a equals k

2105
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,120
so so this is like

2106
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,440
the uncertainty about another system

2107
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:55,040
within the environment that's why the

2108
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,199
system separation that we saw in figure

2109
01:17:57,199 --> 01:17:58,480
5 was important so if we're going to

2110
01:17:58,480 --> 01:17:59,600
define us

2111
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:00,880
we're going to look at how other systems

2112
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:03,040
interact on the holographic screen and

2113
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:05,360
then we're going to think about what can

2114
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:07,120
we predict what that system is doing or

2115
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,640
not like the environment's not doing

2116
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:09,840
anything because it's just sitting there

2117
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,679
it's the environment but

2118
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:13,920
that's at any given time step snapshot

2119
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:16,719
um so it is therefore an upper bound on

2120
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:19,920
the surprise um reprisal analogy to f of

2121
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,000
pi that we just looked at earlier that

2122
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,440
daniel mentioned the upper bound on

2123
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:24,960
surprise

2124
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:27,280
cool okay here we go getting into how

2125
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:29,440
the quantum does the fvp

2126
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,040
all right

2127
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,320
so

2128
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,719
a generic quantum system a

2129
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:38,400
will act so as to minimize er sub x for

2130
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:41,280
each deployable quantum reference frame

2131
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,440
x so

2132
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:45,679
a system a has different deployable

2133
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:46,880
quantum reference frames that's

2134
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:48,719
analogous to a sense i have hearing

2135
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:52,080
vision taste smell temperature sensing

2136
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:54,159
etc many different deployable quantum

2137
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:56,000
reference frames and

2138
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,440
i will minimize

2139
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,760
my total reducible uncertainty

2140
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,760
at each time step for each quantum

2141
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,600
reference frame

2142
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:04,560
yes

2143
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,000
still there

2144
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,440
cool

2145
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:09,360
okay

2146
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,520
so a trivial agent can be viewed as

2147
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,520
executing a trivial quantum reference

2148
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:14,320
frame

2149
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:17,440
as only exercising choice of basis for

2150
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:19,440
writing to and reading from

2151
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,360
the holographic screen fancy b as a

2152
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:27,519
whole and so satisfies the fep trivially

2153
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:30,080
okay

2154
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:32,080
let's have a let's have a round table on

2155
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:33,840
what that means

2156
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:37,320
we should do it

2157
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:38,960
yeah

2158
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:40,719
four point two

2159
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:43,760
that's it or forty point one we'll be

2160
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:46,719
there's equation forty nice

2161
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:48,560
there it is

2162
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:49,600
all right

2163
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:51,600
so

2164
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,199
the authors say uncertainty and

2165
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:55,040
prediction error and hence variational

2166
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,280
free energy is generated in the current

2167
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,480
formalism

2168
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:01,600
by system a's in principle ignorance of

2169
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:04,640
both the state of b and the dynamics p

2170
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:07,679
of b of its interaction partner b

2171
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:10,400
as the bits a reads from

2172
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,239
the boundary fancy b

2173
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:13,600
are written by

2174
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:17,040
p b this is like the the agent or system

2175
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,400
b is writing

2176
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,719
to the boundary

2177
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:23,040
so a's ability to predict the future

2178
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,280
states of its observable sectors and

2179
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:29,360
hence to minimize that er sub x for each

2180
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,440
quantum reference frame x

2181
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,120
through equation 40 which we just looked

2182
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,560
at and we're going to look at it again

2183
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,480
depends on its ability to predict the

2184
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:37,600
behavior

2185
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:40,639
of pb locally on each observable sector

2186
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:42,400
so i have to

2187
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:44,080
be able to predict how daniel's going to

2188
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:46,320
smell how he's going to look so so my

2189
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,320
ability if i'm looking at my other

2190
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,080
agents in the environment

2191
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:52,159
over each what temperature he's going to

2192
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:53,440
be is he going to have cold hands or

2193
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,199
cold feet or something like that

2194
01:20:55,199 --> 01:20:57,120
but my ability to minimize my

2195
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,199
variational free energy over another

2196
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:00,480
system in the environment

2197
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,639
depends on my ability to predict their

2198
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:05,360
behavior writing to the environment

2199
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,120
on all of those quantum reference

2200
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:08,480
sectors

2201
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,800
good enough good enough

2202
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:11,760
okay

2203
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,520
an animal for example must employ its

2204
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,360
available senses hence its observable

2205
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:17,840
sectors to predict the nutritional value

2206
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,280
of food

2207
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:20,639
okay

2208
01:21:20,639 --> 01:21:23,040
here we go

2209
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,600
so

2210
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,120
this is where i got it gets a little

2211
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:30,639
fuzzy for me

2212
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:32,800
so

2213
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:35,920
uh i was good up until this point

2214
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:38,320
um they say the weak interaction limit

2215
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:41,440
that allows separability between a and b

2216
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:42,719
is significant

2217
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:43,760
so

2218
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:45,440
h a b which is

2219
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:47,760
the physical interaction between a and b

2220
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:50,400
and hence the boundary the holographic

2221
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,000
screen between a and b

2222
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,800
must have significantly lower dimension

2223
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,719
than

2224
01:21:56,719 --> 01:21:59,440
the physical location of b and hence the

2225
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:01,199
observable dynamics of b

2226
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:04,239
if the weak interaction limit is to hold

2227
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:06,800
um my brain is melting now

2228
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,480
all the way down

2229
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:09,440
so

2230
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,440
yeah anyway what do you think do you

2231
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:13,199
have any thoughts on that

2232
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:16,159
um not sure if it means that the sparse

2233
01:22:16,159 --> 01:22:18,480
coupling has to be sufficiently sparse

2234
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,800
it has to be a lot lower dimension than

2235
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,159
the system

2236
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:25,040
otherwise it's um

2237
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:28,480
not appropriately

2238
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:30,080
bottlenecked

2239
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:32,000
so there's a lower dimensional interface

2240
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,600
that's like sparse coupling it's

2241
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:36,960
physical interaction in the h

2242
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:39,199
frame and it's the holograph slash

2243
01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:42,400
markov blanket with the fancy b

2244
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,639
but if the interaction is with the h and

2245
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:46,719
that's kind of what we'll

2246
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:48,400
discuss like are we talking about

2247
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,639
physical interactions of quantum systems

2248
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:52,239
or we're talking about any mechanistic

2249
01:22:52,239 --> 01:22:54,239
interaction between any mechanistic

2250
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:56,000
system or are we talking about

2251
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,159
statistical edges statistical

2252
01:22:58,159 --> 01:23:01,440
interactions like an interaction term

2253
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:04,560
between two different systems

2254
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,080
um and so just what i've written down

2255
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:07,120
here kind of

2256
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:09,280
paraphrases what they said uh up there

2257
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,280
so the ability for a system a to predict

2258
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:13,280
the dynamics of system b depends on the

2259
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,679
dynamic complexity of the interaction

2260
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:17,440
between system b

2261
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:19,840
um which is pb on the holographic screen

2262
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:22,480
so what is b writing to the holographic

2263
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,480
screen like what is my refrigerator

2264
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:26,639
writing to the holographic screen um i

2265
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:28,480
would say that's a trivial system right

2266
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:29,840
it's like outputting a little bit of

2267
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,760
heat it keeps my food a little bit cold

2268
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:34,400
most of the time so i can with pretty

2269
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:37,120
good reliability predict the dynamics of

2270
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:39,679
my refrigerator i have less ability to

2271
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:41,600
predict the dynamics of daniel or my

2272
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,360
children who are like total agents of

2273
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:44,719
chaos right

2274
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:46,480
so but but

2275
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,560
like i want to minimize my uncertainty

2276
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:49,760
i'm pretty certain about what my

2277
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:51,840
refrigerator is doing i don't know what

2278
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,760
my kids are doing when i leave the room

2279
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:55,040
um yeah

2280
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:57,199
so that that kind of made sense to me

2281
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:58,080
but

2282
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,239
the schrodinger's cat to blue's children

2283
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:02,800
pipeline

2284
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,320
we just got there

2285
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:08,320
um anything else to out here dana

2286
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:11,120
no let's

2287
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:14,159
moving forward okay so here is

2288
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:16,560
a little diagram of what it looks like

2289
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,239
for me to predict the dynamics of my

2290
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:19,600
refrigerator

2291
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,320
so so this is figure 6 a

2292
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,400
um it says the trivial agent

2293
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:27,120
in figure 6 a look like a noise source

2294
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:29,920
to a so yes my refrigerator is a source

2295
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:31,520
of noise it just like it actually

2296
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:34,159
literally makes noise um and you know

2297
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:35,840
puts out a little bit of heat

2298
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:38,719
so it says emission of hawking radiation

2299
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:40,320
from a black hole provides perhaps the

2300
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,719
most pure example of such a noise source

2301
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:44,159
while the dimension inside the black

2302
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:46,239
hole can be arbitrarily large the

2303
01:24:46,239 --> 01:24:48,239
internal dynamics are uncoupled from the

2304
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:49,840
classical information encoded on the

2305
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,760
horizon and hence have no classical

2306
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:54,400
computational power

2307
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,400
yes

2308
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,000
okay maybe refrigerator has more

2309
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,760
computational power than a black hole i

2310
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:02,080
don't know

2311
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:05,600
okay

2312
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,880
okay

2313
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:10,159
we move on here we go forward

2314
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:12,719
so the more interesting parts of a's

2315
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:15,120
option space for prediction are shown in

2316
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,719
panel b c and d

2317
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:18,960
where b is non-trivial

2318
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:21,679
if b is non-trivial it deploys at least

2319
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:24,320
one quantum reference frame

2320
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:28,400
x of b like so that's sector x of b

2321
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:31,120
acting on sector x b

2322
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:31,920
uh

2323
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:34,960
as discussed in section 2.5 b sectors

2324
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:37,280
must be mutually decoherent

2325
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:39,520
so the action of the dynamics

2326
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:42,639
on the sector of b is independent of

2327
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:44,880
action elsewhere is this independence

2328
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,960
that makes prediction possible

2329
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:50,320
if x of b does not overlap any sector

2330
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:51,120
um

2331
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:54,000
for a b will appear trivial so like if

2332
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,719
the green cone is totally removed from

2333
01:25:56,719 --> 01:25:58,800
what the red cone is like

2334
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:01,520
it's a trivial thing like if you know my

2335
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:03,120
kids aren't here right now they're not

2336
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:06,719
immediately acting on my environment um

2337
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:07,679
so

2338
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:10,080
they're trivial i guess or

2339
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,440
this made me think about like if if

2340
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:13,120
someone was speaking a language that you

2341
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:15,840
didn't understand semantically

2342
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,760
not even in the queues and in the

2343
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:20,080
metadata like there's kind of speaking

2344
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,639
past each other even though you're

2345
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:24,960
sharing a screen

2346
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,639
but that's like an intentional

2347
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:28,719
informational interpretation

2348
01:26:28,719 --> 01:26:30,719
and this is in a quantum interpretation

2349
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:33,760
about the shared semantic frame ranging

2350
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:35,360
from identical

2351
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:39,199
to overlapping to disjoint

2352
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:42,719
so in in a disjoint um

2353
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:44,080
way i'm trying to think of what else

2354
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:45,120
would be there so like a different

2355
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,880
language is good but like

2356
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:48,400
what about something like radiation

2357
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:49,760
emission right like so something's

2358
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,760
emitting radiation but i can't perceive

2359
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,040
that radiation so like the thing

2360
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:55,040
emitting radiation doesn't appear like

2361
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,800
it's impacting my environment at all so

2362
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,639
maybe something like that

2363
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:00,800
and i'd like maybe unobserved

2364
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,600
the part of of be the holograph that's

2365
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:04,719
not

2366
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:07,520
in the observed or memory sector

2367
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,199
yeah like that

2368
01:27:09,199 --> 01:27:10,880
um okay cool

2369
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:12,560
so

2370
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,239
the interesting cases are the ones in

2371
01:27:14,239 --> 01:27:16,159
which a and b's observable sectors

2372
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:17,199
overlap

2373
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:19,360
in this case intuitively in which a and

2374
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:22,000
b can see each other and hence interact

2375
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,159
in the ordinary non-technical sense of

2376
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:25,679
that term

2377
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:29,600
in panel b sector xb fully contains

2378
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:30,960
xa

2379
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:32,880
um

2380
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,639
yeah

2381
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:36,800
okay so let's go here let's look at the

2382
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,719
at the whole figure now so we saw all

2383
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:41,760
the ones trivial and non-trivial okay so

2384
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:44,159
a is a trivial agent so they're not

2385
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:45,760
putting out any

2386
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:49,600
um b encodes a sector that contains xa

2387
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:50,960
but is bigger

2388
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:52,880
so i like to think about this as like um

2389
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:54,159
a teacher so we're going to get into

2390
01:27:54,159 --> 01:27:55,440
like teaching and learning so this is

2391
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,280
like a teacher that knows more than the

2392
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:58,840
student can pick up

2393
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:01,120
maybe um

2394
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:04,560
in that kind of way so the bits on xb

2395
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:07,120
but outside xa encode non-local hidden

2396
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:09,440
variables for a

2397
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:12,480
and then in diagram c the sectors of x a

2398
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:15,679
and x b overlap the areas of non-overlap

2399
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:19,280
become noise sources so here it's like

2400
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:21,040
um you know

2401
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:24,239
i can understand you when you speak

2402
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:26,080
english but not when you speak chinese

2403
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:27,520
so like when you're speaking chinese we

2404
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:29,120
have this non-overlapping

2405
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,159
frame

2406
01:28:30,159 --> 01:28:32,800
anyway how do you think of that dan

2407
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:36,320
um this is just speculative but um

2408
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:39,280
in the case of b so we're the observer

2409
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:40,800
investigator a

2410
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,600
so in the case of of frame b there's so

2411
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,280
much information like in the linear

2412
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:47,679
regression data set by quantum that

2413
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:49,679
there's basically anywhere we look we

2414
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:51,840
can totally get all the information so

2415
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:53,440
it looks like there's non-local hidden

2416
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:54,960
variables because it's like super

2417
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:58,239
determined in the case of c

2418
01:28:58,239 --> 01:29:00,880
the regression has like an r squared of

2419
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:03,360
0.5 or something or 0.6

2420
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:07,040
and so some of it lines up semantically

2421
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:09,760
but if we of course had the perfect

2422
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:12,239
attention or the perfect observation

2423
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:13,920
we would be able to make a better

2424
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:16,560
regression

2425
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:19,120
but then like i'm just trying to take

2426
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:21,040
the linear regression

2427
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:24,639
normal information framework and then

2428
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:26,480
that's where having people familiar with

2429
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:27,679
quantum

2430
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:29,760
will be really helpful and i hope they

2431
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,920
find this discussion and

2432
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:33,239
upcoming

2433
01:29:33,239 --> 01:29:36,960
1.1.2 as like just the introduction of

2434
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:40,560
hopefully some bi-directional exchange

2435
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:42,159
because this may be

2436
01:29:42,159 --> 01:29:44,320
something where active inference is

2437
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:49,440
complementary isomorphic incompatible

2438
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,360
like let's not lose

2439
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,120
touch with the active inference thread

2440
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:54,159
and then

2441
01:29:54,159 --> 01:29:56,320
also how is this relating to quantum and

2442
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:57,520
that's how we're going to get up in that

2443
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:00,639
quadrant where they both are

2444
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:03,360
yeah so in d

2445
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:06,080
where the um

2446
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:10,320
sector of x is equal to the sector of or

2447
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:13,280
sorry the sector x of a is equal to the

2448
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:15,120
sector x of b

2449
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:16,960
um so that means that the quantum

2450
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:18,719
reference frame is identical it's an

2451
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:20,639
identical frame like we're we are

2452
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:22,159
sharing a quantum reference we're both

2453
01:30:22,159 --> 01:30:23,760
standing on the platform or we're both

2454
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:26,719
on the train um and so that sector a is

2455
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:28,880
equal to sector b any variational free

2456
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:30,639
energy there between a and b is

2457
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:32,880
generated by insufficient learning it's

2458
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:35,920
not like we both can't see the train

2459
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:37,520
or we both can't see the platform

2460
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:39,520
because we're in the same place but um

2461
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:41,520
so there's somebody there is doing some

2462
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,840
insufficient learning

2463
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,840
if this is the case then you just simply

2464
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,600
need to sample more

2465
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:49,679
but you already have the right scope and

2466
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:53,679
you're not at risk of over sampling

2467
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:57,520
but it's a little bit more quantum

2468
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:59,440
cool

2469
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:00,880
and that brings us to this beautiful

2470
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:02,719
formulation in

2471
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:04,880
equation 41.

2472
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:07,520
variational free energy equals noise

2473
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:10,960
plus insufficient learning

2474
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:13,760
so noise is capturing that bottom left

2475
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:14,639
part

2476
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:16,320
that we just discussed and insufficient

2477
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,639
is capturing the d case

2478
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:20,400
and so

2479
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:23,599
if it was uh

2480
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:26,080
more and more overlapping

2481
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:29,120
then you want more and more sampling

2482
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:31,600
but less and less overlapping is going

2483
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:34,320
to require less and less learning or

2484
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:37,280
learning will be less and less helpful

2485
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:38,639
so how is this

2486
01:31:38,639 --> 01:31:40,639
compatible incompatible with the actin

2487
01:31:40,639 --> 01:31:43,280
framings that we've seen for vfe

2488
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:44,960
and efe

2489
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:47,040
and then how is this compatible or

2490
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:48,239
similar to

2491
01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:51,280
some of the formalisms and the framings

2492
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:53,040
that are really familiar to

2493
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:54,960
statisticians into quantum information

2494
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:56,360
scientists

2495
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:59,420
[Music]

2496
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:01,760
and i would also like to like

2497
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:03,280
know what teachers think so if you're a

2498
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:05,760
teacher and you're watching this

2499
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,080
like like what what is your take on that

2500
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:10,000
do you minimize free energy

2501
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,280
by minimizing

2502
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:12,400
noise and

2503
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:15,199
you know maximizing learning or or yeah

2504
01:32:15,199 --> 01:32:16,639
like that okay

2505
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:17,600
um

2506
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:20,320
cool so asymptotic behavior of the fvp

2507
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:23,280
so we have these two formulations

2508
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:24,800
surprise loan divergence which we've

2509
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,480
seen before

2510
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:28,320
in a similar way many times and then

2511
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:31,120
noise plus insufficient learning so now

2512
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:33,440
we want to say how is it minimized how

2513
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:35,520
does an agent act in accordance with the

2514
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:37,760
fep

2515
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,600
what do you want to add here yeah just

2516
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:42,400
they wrote comparing equations 35 and 41

2517
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:45,280
it becomes clear what this amounts to

2518
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:47,520
a system self evidence is by behaving in

2519
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:49,280
a way that minimizes noise while

2520
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:51,040
improving learning

2521
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:55,040
and so here they're juxtaposing the

2522
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:57,360
f of pi

2523
01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:00,480
on surprisal and divergence

2524
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:04,000
decomposition of variational free energy

2525
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
with this noise plus insufficient

2526
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,520
learning

2527
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:08,560
framing

2528
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:12,000
so we'll have time to unpack that and

2529
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,679
hopefully connect it to some systems but

2530
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:15,280
it's just a very

2531
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:16,560
interesting

2532
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:19,360
way that they've reached this trade-off

2533
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:20,840
learning requires

2534
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:23,360
seeking it's like

2535
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:25,600
how do we get there

2536
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,760
well that goes back to the um to the

2537
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,199
context switching like if you're always

2538
01:33:29,199 --> 01:33:30,880
in the same context like if you're

2539
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:32,800
always you know listening to the same

2540
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,639
music you're never gonna learn

2541
01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:36,560
any new music that someone else might

2542
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:38,719
know like or or so you have to kind of

2543
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:39,600
change

2544
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:42,000
um change your context maybe take

2545
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,080
someone else's perspective but you know

2546
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:46,639
seeking what

2547
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:50,199
but we'll get there

2548
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:53,840
yes okay so

2549
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:57,760
let's also save this let's save this for

2550
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:00,480
one but the asymptotic behavior of the

2551
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:03,120
fep let's just say why does it matter

2552
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:06,480
why are we studying asymptotic systems

2553
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:08,400
what is happening with the fpp

2554
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:09,840
asymptotically

2555
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:12,480
asymptotically meaning what

2556
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,239
but i think that that's a large

2557
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:15,440
discussion

2558
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:17,760
about entanglement and where everything

2559
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:19,600
is going

2560
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:20,960
and how it relates to the principle of

2561
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:23,600
unitarity

2562
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:24,880
yes

2563
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:25,679
okay

2564
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:27,120
cool

2565
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:27,840
just

2566
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:30,159
we'll get there in dot one

2567
01:34:30,159 --> 01:34:33,159
unitary

2568
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,400
there's only one more sliders is the how

2569
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:38,639
yeah the fep drives

2570
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:40,800
um it is it becomes the principle of

2571
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,400
unitarity so

2572
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,560
we can we can discuss that in dot ones

2573
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:46,880
better how does it does it why does it

2574
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:49,199
matter why would it matter

2575
01:34:49,199 --> 01:34:50,960
cool um

2576
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:51,840
okay

2577
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:53,199
discussion

2578
01:34:53,199 --> 01:34:56,000
travis home please okay

2579
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,040
we're just gonna we're not gonna discuss

2580
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:00,560
any of the discussion

2581
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:02,320
here

2582
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:03,840
we're going to look at the summary of

2583
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:06,159
the results as they give it

2584
01:35:06,159 --> 01:35:08,400
and then we're going to have a bunch of

2585
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:11,119
slides that will just be like a topic

2586
01:35:11,119 --> 01:35:12,960
and then with the dot one and the dot

2587
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:15,520
two we're just gonna go to that topic

2588
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:18,320
and probably start with just reading a

2589
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:21,360
quote from that paragraph

2590
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:23,360
or hearing the authors or the

2591
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:25,920
participant's perspective on like

2592
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:29,040
each of those topics

2593
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:30,400
cool

2594
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,400
okay

2595
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:33,360
do you want to you can go for the

2596
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:35,760
summary

2597
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:37,600
come on help me out okay

2598
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:42,239
you you read the three just the three um

2599
01:35:42,239 --> 01:35:45,440
big texts at the very beginning

2600
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:47,199
but the first

2601
01:35:47,199 --> 01:35:49,280
summary of the results that the um

2602
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:51,119
authors say

2603
01:35:51,119 --> 01:35:54,880
is that they can formulate this agent

2604
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,960
or information gathering and using

2605
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:58,480
system

2606
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,239
not just within the

2607
01:36:00,239 --> 01:36:02,320
classical information theory context

2608
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:04,159
that we've been talking about

2609
01:36:04,159 --> 01:36:06,880
informational and strategic agents but

2610
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:08,800
in the context of quantum information

2611
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:10,639
theory

2612
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:11,840
point two

2613
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:13,760
is not just

2614
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:16,320
using a generic agent or information

2615
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:18,080
gathering using system

2616
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:21,280
but specifically connecting the fep

2617
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:24,719
to its quantum theoretic formulation

2618
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:27,040
for generic quantum systems

2619
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:29,360
insert all the asterisks and other

2620
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:31,920
symbols about what that really means

2621
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:33,920
and about how active inference plays in

2622
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:35,119
etc

2623
01:36:35,119 --> 01:36:36,159
and then

2624
01:36:36,159 --> 01:36:38,000
three the part that we didn't really go

2625
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,400
into in this discussion when formulated

2626
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:42,159
as a generic principle of quantum

2627
01:36:42,159 --> 01:36:44,560
information theory the fep is

2628
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:46,159
asymptotically equivalent to the

2629
01:36:46,159 --> 01:36:48,239
principle of unitarity

2630
01:36:48,239 --> 01:36:50,800
and under asked in the chat

2631
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:53,119
asymptotically in what parameter just

2632
01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:56,480
exactly to what ends in what parameter

2633
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:59,199
so that's the summary of the results but

2634
01:36:59,199 --> 01:37:00,719
the authors then

2635
01:37:00,719 --> 01:37:02,239
embark on

2636
01:37:02,239 --> 01:37:03,600
an awesome

2637
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:05,280
series of

2638
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:07,199
kind of like standalone

2639
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:09,440
paragraph vignettes

2640
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:11,440
related to a wide

2641
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:13,600
set of other ideas

2642
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:16,000
so for each of these ideas

2643
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,400
i'll um ask the question on the top and

2644
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,400
then if you want to give a thought

2645
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:23,440
on that topic or not okay so the first

2646
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:25,040
topic is

2647
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:25,760
yeah

2648
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:27,360
let me answer the question so it says

2649
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:30,080
actually asymptotically perfect learning

2650
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:32,000
so that's the asymptotically perfect

2651
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,239
finding that drives to unitary on one

2652
01:37:34,239 --> 01:37:38,080
axis so anyway okay um

2653
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:41,119
what is observation

2654
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:44,480
that's deep

2655
01:37:45,199 --> 01:37:48,320
several paragraphs they wrote about that

2656
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,719
and this quote um

2657
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:51,920
the idea

2658
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:55,119
of a metaphysically

2659
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:57,440
solipsistic

2660
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:59,199
or solipsist

2661
01:37:59,199 --> 01:38:00,719
theory of observation is

2662
01:38:00,719 --> 01:38:03,719
self-contradictory

2663
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,320
what

2664
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:07,520
but we'll

2665
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:08,960
discuss

2666
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:10,159
okay

2667
01:38:10,159 --> 01:38:12,480
what is an agent

2668
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:14,639
and again we'll keep in mind classical

2669
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:15,679
physics

2670
01:38:15,679 --> 01:38:18,960
classical fep non-classical fep

2671
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:21,520
that where are we

2672
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:22,400
bigger

2673
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,480
from earlier

2674
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:25,600
i'll copy

2675
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:29,400
that one back in

2676
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:32,560
because this is definitely like a where

2677
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:34,560
are we like what are the similarities

2678
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:36,080
and differences

2679
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:39,040
in the agent model

2680
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:39,920
for

2681
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:44,239
fep and not and for quantum and not

2682
01:38:44,239 --> 01:38:45,600
any thoughts or like things that you'll

2683
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:48,560
want to ask about this

2684
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:51,280
what is free choice i think that's that

2685
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:54,400
was cool um

2686
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:57,800
yeah

2687
01:38:58,400 --> 01:38:59,520
and like

2688
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:00,960
do you get

2689
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:02,800
degrees of freedom or free choice over

2690
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:05,840
cognitive parameters action parameters

2691
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:08,000
which one do you want

2692
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,840
choice over or all of them

2693
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:14,239
preferences okay

2694
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:17,679
what is self-evidencing

2695
01:39:17,679 --> 01:39:20,480
so we've talked in several other

2696
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:21,920
discussions

2697
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:23,119
about

2698
01:39:23,119 --> 01:39:25,679
classical or bayesian inference as

2699
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:27,840
self-evidencing

2700
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:30,480
like finding oneself in likely states

2701
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:34,000
expected in preferred states

2702
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:35,920
how is that

2703
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:39,760
different in active than other physics

2704
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:41,760
that's like going from the bottom left

2705
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:43,920
to the bottom right

2706
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:46,000
and then how is this different within

2707
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,440
active inference

2708
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:49,679
with this quantum

2709
01:39:49,679 --> 01:39:53,639
integration and boost

2710
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:56,400
yes

2711
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:57,920
okay

2712
01:39:57,920 --> 01:39:59,600
what of

2713
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:02,800
asymptotic behavior

2714
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:09,920
yeah um so i think here it's the

2715
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:12,880
asymptotically perfect learning

2716
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:14,560
like what is a gauge theoretic

2717
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:16,000
perspective i don't even want to open

2718
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,199
that kind of worms at all

2719
01:40:19,199 --> 01:40:20,960
so yeah also this is like the quantum

2720
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:22,880
formulation the quantum formalism is

2721
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:25,119
background free

2722
01:40:25,119 --> 01:40:26,880
space is simply an observable

2723
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:29,440
represented by a qrf

2724
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:32,960
that a system may or may not deploy

2725
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:35,199
it can therefore play no on-tech role in

2726
01:40:35,199 --> 01:40:39,040
maintaining distinctions between systems

2727
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:40,800
this reflects the general role of

2728
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:43,199
physical 3d space in quantum field

2729
01:40:43,199 --> 01:40:44,159
theories

2730
01:40:44,159 --> 01:40:47,840
space is there to enforce separability

2731
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:50,320
c68 for general discussion from a gauge

2732
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:52,800
theoretical perspective

2733
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:56,159
so like the space between

2734
01:40:56,159 --> 01:40:58,960
is what

2735
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:07,199
i'm gonna also um copy in a comment that

2736
01:41:07,199 --> 01:41:10,159
underwrote in the live chat

2737
01:41:10,159 --> 01:41:11,199
just

2738
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:13,679
anyone who asks questions um

2739
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:15,440
you know just put it in live chat or put

2740
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:17,280
as a comment under the video

2741
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:19,840
or email us but

2742
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:21,920
it helps us and it's awesome questions

2743
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:23,600
that people ask okay

2744
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:25,119
we will definitely look at this before

2745
01:41:25,119 --> 01:41:27,360
we do that one and so if you you're

2746
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:28,880
welcome to join us get in touch if you

2747
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:31,280
want to participate live but also like

2748
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:32,719
we will ask these questions if we leave

2749
01:41:32,719 --> 01:41:34,000
them in the chat

2750
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,400
yeah okay let's go to

2751
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:39,840
close out almost kind of getting there

2752
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:42,560
applications to biological cognition

2753
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:43,840
um

2754
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:47,119
and then they wrote in this paper

2755
01:41:47,119 --> 01:41:50,239
in addition to the results listed above

2756
01:41:50,239 --> 01:41:51,920
the current framework

2757
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:53,760
so the paper we've been discussing

2758
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:55,280
has a variety of more specifically

2759
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:57,199
biological consequences some of which

2760
01:41:57,199 --> 01:41:59,360
have been discussed already in citation

2761
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:00,560
13.

2762
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:02,960
and here's citation 13 fields glaze

2763
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:04,239
broke 11

2764
01:42:04,239 --> 01:42:06,239
minimal physicalism as a scale-free

2765
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:07,440
substrate for cognition and

2766
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,199
consciousness and here's the sections of

2767
01:42:09,199 --> 01:42:10,080
that

2768
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:11,600
paper

2769
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:13,600
and so it's just kind of cool to connect

2770
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:15,679
back to the basal cognition

2771
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:17,600
computational boundaries of a self

2772
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,520
discussion that we've been having live

2773
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:21,840
stream number 39 just

2774
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:24,239
today

2775
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:27,040
um and we also have uh

2776
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:28,800
neurons as hierarchies of quantum

2777
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:30,320
reference frames which i haven't read

2778
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:32,560
yet um that this was just published in

2779
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:34,239
january of 22. i think that was

2780
01:42:34,239 --> 01:42:36,480
co-released with this paper so

2781
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:38,480
i'm i'm excited to

2782
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:40,000
read that work also

2783
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,760
awesome so yeah what are the biological

2784
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:43,840
implications okay

2785
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:44,719
um

2786
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:46,560
quantum frames

2787
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:48,560
for foraging

2788
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:49,520
so

2789
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:51,600
unique explanations and predictions it

2790
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:53,199
predicts for example that moving in

2791
01:42:53,199 --> 01:42:55,920
ordinary 3d space does not require a qrf

2792
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:57,760
for euclidean space

2793
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:59,920
and hence does not require an experience

2794
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:01,280
of space

2795
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:03,760
so like the fish could swim without

2796
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:06,719
knowing 3d

2797
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:09,119
and then from a classical perspective

2798
01:43:09,119 --> 01:43:11,920
okay so i guess that means non-fep and

2799
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:13,600
or non-quantum

2800
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:15,600
this is certainly true evidence by place

2801
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:20,239
and grid cells in mammalian brains etc

2802
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:22,239
and then what happens when we integrate

2803
01:43:22,239 --> 01:43:25,440
fep in the classical

2804
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:27,040
well the course graining would then be

2805
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:29,679
mandated by et cetera et cetera we'll

2806
01:43:29,679 --> 01:43:32,000
explore okay then what happens if we go

2807
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,199
from classical to classical fep and then

2808
01:43:35,199 --> 01:43:38,800
now go from fep to quantum fep

2809
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:41,280
still thinking about like foraging

2810
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:45,679
or information seeking and processing

2811
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:49,920
okay

2812
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:52,239
contextuality

2813
01:43:52,239 --> 01:43:55,679
we talked about that a lot in 171

2814
01:43:55,679 --> 01:43:56,960
but just

2815
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:59,920
what is context environment

2816
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:01,360
surrounding

2817
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:03,920
is this what people mean when they say

2818
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:06,960
set the context for the dinner party

2819
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:09,360
or give context for a video that they

2820
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:10,320
sent

2821
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:13,520
what is that everyday sense of context

2822
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:17,199
and what is this sense of context

2823
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:21,040
okay

2824
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:23,679
next steps so these are the last two

2825
01:44:23,679 --> 01:44:25,679
lines of the paper

2826
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:26,880
and they wrote

2827
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:28,719
in closing we hope that we have shown to

2828
01:44:28,719 --> 01:44:30,800
readers familiar with the fep and active

2829
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:32,400
inference framework that quantum effects

2830
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:34,320
are worth considering both theoretically

2831
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:36,239
and in experimental design

2832
01:44:36,239 --> 01:44:37,920
for readers not familiar with the

2833
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:40,880
classical fa ep but literate in quantum

2834
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:42,000
theory

2835
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,760
or vice versa

2836
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:46,320
we hope this paper has gone some way to

2837
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:50,560
contextualizing your qrfs incense making

2838
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:53,440
via markov blankets and their underlying

2839
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:55,360
holographic screens

2840
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:57,760
so this is like saying

2841
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:01,119
if you were familiar with either quantum

2842
01:45:01,119 --> 01:45:03,679
not fep upper left

2843
01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:06,000
or classical fep

2844
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,320
bottom right or maybe bottom left

2845
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:10,080
neither

2846
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:12,719
then this paper

2847
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:14,880
hopefully brought you towards that upper

2848
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:17,600
right corner of quantum fep

2849
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:18,960
and just like

2850
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:19,760
the

2851
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:23,440
classical classical way to end an fep

2852
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:26,719
paper was like we expect and prefer that

2853
01:45:26,719 --> 01:45:29,119
this reduces your uncertainty

2854
01:45:29,119 --> 01:45:32,159
this is like the classical quantum way

2855
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:34,719
to end the paper by saying

2856
01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:39,040
we hope it's contextualized your qrf

2857
01:45:41,119 --> 01:45:42,800
the clever ending

2858
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:44,719
to

2859
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:48,400
a very complex paper

2860
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:50,799
and

2861
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:54,320
it was really fun to work on this for a

2862
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:56,000
couple weeks

2863
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:00,400
leading up to these discussions and

2864
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:02,480
what else would you say as we now head

2865
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:04,639
into the dot one and two

2866
01:46:04,639 --> 01:46:06,400
yeah so like thanks for putting up with

2867
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:08,800
our rough interpretation of this paper

2868
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:10,159
and we hope we didn't butcher it too

2869
01:46:10,159 --> 01:46:12,639
badly yeah um

2870
01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:16,239
we tried yeah if if you know more or

2871
01:46:16,239 --> 01:46:18,320
would like to contribute to helping

2872
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:20,960
others know more about these topics

2873
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:22,719
that's what we're working on all the

2874
01:46:22,719 --> 01:46:24,639
time in actin flap so if you've made it

2875
01:46:24,639 --> 01:46:25,760
this far

2876
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:27,600
and you're riled up or curious about

2877
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:29,520
something then

2878
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:32,239
get in touch and let's try to make

2879
01:46:32,239 --> 01:46:34,080
all of this more

2880
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:35,679
handleable

2881
01:46:35,679 --> 01:46:37,760
and able to be translated and learned

2882
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:38,960
and applied

2883
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:40,639
yeah let's try to align our quantum

2884
01:46:40,639 --> 01:46:43,360
reference frames

2885
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:47,360
with respect to actin

2886
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:48,880
what else can we say

2887
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:51,600
all right so see you all

2888
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:54,239
um soon thanks a lot blue thanks also

2889
01:46:54,239 --> 01:46:55,840
jason and thanks everybody who will

2890
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:58,320
participate in the upcoming ones too

2891
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:02,519
so see you later bye

2892
01:47:18,239 --> 01:47:20,320
