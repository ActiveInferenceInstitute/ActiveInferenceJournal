1
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,000
all right hello and welcome everyone

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,760
it's march 17th 2022 we're here in actin

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,199
flab live stream number 40.1 discussing

4
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,279
a free energy principle for generic

5
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,039
quantum systems

6
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,199
welcome to the actin flap

7
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,359
we're a participatory online lab that is

8
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,039
communicating learning and practicing

9
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,040
applied active inference

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,719
this is recorded in an archived live

11
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,320
stream so please provide us with

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,040
feedback so we can improve our work

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,960
all backgrounds and perspectives are

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,520
welcome here all qrf

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,399
and video etiquette for live stream will

16
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,160
be hopefully following

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,559
to learn more about active lab head over

18
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,879
to activeinference.org

19
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,640
and for the rest of active stream 40.1

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,640
um blue thanks for being the facilitator

21
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,159
sure so in this stream today our goal is

22
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,880
to learn and discuss this paper a free

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,640
energy principle for generic quantum

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,600
systems by chris fields carl christian

25
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,240
james blazebrook and michael levin and

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,759
we have both chris and carl on the

27
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,600
stream with us today

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,840
so if we maybe want to just start off

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,000
briefly with doing

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,400
some introductions so my name is blue

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,640
knight i'm an independent researcher in

32
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,119
new mexico and i will pass it off to the

33
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,600
first author prince

34
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,799
um hi good morning and uh thanks for

35
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,840
attending this

36
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,720
discussion

37
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,479
uh this is a

38
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,320
a paper about

39
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,479
active inference um

40
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,960
and how to place the active entrance

41
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,560
framework in a quantum information

42
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,200
theoretic setting

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,159
so

44
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,200
what i

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,960
thought i should do to introduce it is

46
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,880
just give a little bit of the motivation

47
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,759
for doing that

48
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,119
quantum information theory

49
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,479
is an outgrowth of

50
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,760
quantum theory that started in the 70s

51
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,400
or or even you could take it back to the

52
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,640
60s if you wanted to

53
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,280
and its goal was to consider physical

54
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,920
interactions as information exchange

55
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,680
processes

56
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,360
and to reformulate quantum theory in

57
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,040
this way

58
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,480
and so

59
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,680
it has a very natural kind of overlap

60
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,319
with what

61
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,040
carl has been doing with the free energy

62
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,920
principle in terms of of reformulating

63
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,200
physics

64
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,720
essentially all of physics and

65
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,239
information

66
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,959
and decision theoretic terms

67
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,360
so why why quantum theory why go to

68
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,760
this theory that's often thought of as a

69
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,080
theory only of very

70
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,360
tiny objects that are moving very fast

71
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,599
and the reason is that it's scale free

72
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,040
and

73
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,800
conceptually

74
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,920
quantum theory is very simple

75
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,680
and

76
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,720
it

77
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,840
has one

78
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,120
core hypothesis which is the print the

79
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,519
principle of unitarity

80
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,159
and the principle of unitarity is simply

81
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,879
the idea that total information is

82
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,840
conserved

83
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,760
so quantum theory is based on a

84
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,239
conservation law a proposed conservation

85
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,640
law conservation of information

86
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,400
so what

87
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
going to quantum theory really

88
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,040
forces us to do

89
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,959
is to take

90
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,159
seriously the project that

91
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,280
um

92
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,400
carl spent a lot of time on

93
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,080
in his uh

94
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,120
particular physics paper in 2019

95
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,879
which is to understand what we mean

96
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,319
when we say that we've observed a system

97
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,080
multiple times

98
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,799
what we mean when we say we've

99
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,880
interacted with the same object

100
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,199
multiple times

101
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,440
and

102
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,600
it forces us to

103
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,400
uh or at least it encourages us to take

104
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,960
that question seriously and it provides

105
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,000
a number of tools for talking about that

106
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,360
question

107
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,680
and we'll talk about that as we get into

108
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,479
the

109
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,320
paper

110
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,600
but um and that's in a sense our

111
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,160
motivation it's to take this

112
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,479
um

113
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,639
very nice

114
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,479
quite abstract

115
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,919
uh

116
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,720
but in a sense very fundamental

117
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,919
toolkit

118
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,600
that's based around the idea of

119
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,479
conservation of information and

120
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,039
apply it to this question of of active

121
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,120
inference

122
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,560
so i'll let

123
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,080
carl pick it up from there

124
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,560
nice well thank you it's a great

125
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,800
pleasure to be here i have to say i was

126
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,759
hoping to learn more

127
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,759
a great opportunity from my point of

128
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,240
view just to

129
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,080
hear a conversation and probably

130
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,800
participate in terms of how this sport

131
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,520
run and control scale free

132
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,360
background free and that's what i think

133
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,720
is one of the

134
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,600
the most

135
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,800
attractive

136
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,919
um parsimonious um

137
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,000
benefits of taking a quantum perspective

138
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,080
on this it reminds me of the queenian

139
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,160
desert landscape a minimal assumption

140
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,600
which which

141
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,080
i'm always drawn to and apply this to

142
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,240
some fundamental questions which have

143
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,240
actually been beautifully listed for us

144
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,520
at the top here

145
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,400
about things and crucially um

146
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,919
how things

147
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,240
coupled to other things in terms of

148
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,639
measurement and observation and

149
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,680
inference

150
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,400
so

151
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,919
i'm personally delighted and hungry to

152
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,440
learn about

153
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,880
how

154
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,919
simple questions about the nature of

155
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,440
things

156
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,000
um we observe and pleasure and make

157
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,440
imprints about

158
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,319
can be cast that was fundamental in this

159
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,560
fundamental or from this fundamental

160
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,479
perspective of quantum information

161
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,759
very nice thank you

162
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,000
james thanks for joining us would you

163
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,319
like to introduce yourself and maybe say

164
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,720
a few words about the paper or pick it

165
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,960
up from there

166
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,560
oh um

167
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,759
hello

168

emeritus professor of eastern illinois

177
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,520
university and adjunct

178
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,599
associate professor

179
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,120
the university of illinois at

180
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,880
urbana-champaign

181
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,240
um

182
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,479
my background is

183
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,560
global analytic

184
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,560
geometry and some related areas but in

185
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,080
the last uh 16 or 17 years i've been

186
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,560
um

187
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,880
applying mathematical techniques to

188
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,800
cognitive neuroscience and

189
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,720
foundations of

190
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,680
quantum biology and more recently

191
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,879
quantum information as as it

192
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,160
relates to the free energy principle

193
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,840
great thank you

194
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,520
uh stephen do you want to maybe

195
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,520
introduce yourself and give a thought

196
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,199
about the paper something you like or

197
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,240
remembered or curious about today

198
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,199
yeah thank you hi i'm stephen i'm i'm

199
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,800
based in toronto

200
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,360
i'm just doing a practice-based phd into

201
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,599
social topographies and community

202
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:18,879
development

203
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,120
and i have got backgrounds many years

204
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,879
ago in chemistry

205
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,400
and i'm i'm really curious about um

206
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,759
the way that this idea of something

207
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,280
that's scale free

208
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,280
uh also ties to something which seems to

209
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,279
be very specific

210
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,200
on scale i

211
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,039
wear something that's highly contextual

212
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,479
and highly uh

213
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,240
bounded by degrees of freedom at a

214
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,599
certain scale

215
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,839
and then how something could be inferred

216
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:44,959
that's

217
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,880
across all sorts of scales so that

218
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,240
that's really something i'm curious

219
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,240
about on this particular piece of

220
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,839
great work daniel do you have any other

221
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,839
like particular questions that you want

222
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,800
to address or

223
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,640
just looking forward to

224
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,680
seeing the discussion and anyone who's

225
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,000
watching live can ask a question so i'm

226
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,080
curious about how

227
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,279
also like steven said the specificity

228
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,680
of a given experiment

229
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,920
interfaces with general

230
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,959
aspects of the formalism and uh

231
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,920
many other things but

232
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,160
we'll go go ahead blue

233
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,839
well do we want to maybe start there do

234
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,399
you guys want to speak to that

235
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,600
scale deterministic

236
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,600
aspect of the quantum fep

237
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,120
well i can say something here

238
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,360
um

239
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,000
in

240
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,800
any information theory

241
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,560
will start with some state space so some

242
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,279
set of degrees of freedom that have some

243
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,920
set of values

244
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,480
and in the paper we restrict ourselves

245
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,680
to finite state spaces because we're

246
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,680
really interested in systems that only

247
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,160
have access to finite energy

248
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,920
and so finite computational resources

249
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,839
so one starts with a state

250
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,399
space and in a sense that

251
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,279
state space

252
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,000
when viewed from kind of the external

253
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,680
perspective of the theorist who's

254
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,320
defining it sets the scale of the

255
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,720
problem

256
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,640
because in defining the state space

257
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,000
you're saying what the values are of the

258
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,320
degrees of freedom

259
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,440
and

260
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,120
when you say

261
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,560
what are the possible values

262
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,880
you are implicitly making some

263
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,360
assumptions about resolution

264
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,640
so

265
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,640
uh and making some assumptions about

266
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,760
measurement

267
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,880
so for example if we think of a

268
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,440
canonical quantum system which is a

269
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,200
cubit just one

270
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,160
a particle with a spin

271
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,360
uh and we say the spin can be up or down

272
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,800
um

273
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,519
then we made an assumption about how how

274
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,240
we can measure the spin

275
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,279
and

276
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,959
the most natural mathematical framework

277
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,360
is a three-dimensional

278
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,480
ball of values or sphere of values if

279
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,120
you normalize them

280
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,800
and that's making an assumption that we

281
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,720
can measure the spin

282
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,079
in any one of three directions

283
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,240
um

284
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,680
and so

285
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,839
here we

286
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,720
have imposed some possible values on

287
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,720
this on this

288
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,800
set of degrees of freedom

289
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,040
and so in a sense we've set a scale for

290
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,680
the problem

291
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,440
similarly if we're talking about

292
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,760
uh interactions between human beings

293
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,680
uh clearly there are lots and lots of

294
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,600
degrees of freedom that we can think of

295
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,399
but we typically think about only a tiny

296
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,200
handful of degrees of freedom

297
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,839
that have to do for example with verbal

298
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,560
communication or visual communication

299
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,720
olfactory communication or some other

300
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,480
kind of communication

301
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,560
and we always impose

302
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,120
resolution restrictions we can say this

303
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,360
difference is detectable

304
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,800
and these other differences aren't

305
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,639
detectable

306
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,720
and whenever we make a decision like

307
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,200
that we're setting a scale

308
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,279
and when we characterize the information

309
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,680
theory is scale-free

310
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,760
we're just saying that the formalism

311
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,160
doesn't change when the scale changes

312
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,880
so the formalism the

313
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,839
mathematical

314
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,480
description

315
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,079
remains exactly the same

316
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,160
regardless of what

317
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,440
scales we pick by choosing the possible

318
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,760
values of the degrees of freedom that

319
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,519
we're talking about we don't change

320
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,399
anything else about the way the theory

321
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,000
works

322
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,720
so that's that's all that's skill-free

323
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,639
means it it doesn't mean that we've

324
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,399
somehow abolished the notion of scale

325
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,360
uh

326
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,000
that's part of our experience

327
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,959
um

328
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,240
so it's not something we're going to

329
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,920
make go away

330
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,560
it's that we haven't changed the way the

331
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,040
math works depending on the notion of

332
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,720
scale

333
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,760
and you know the most the most notorious

334
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,000
example of that

335
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,880
uh thing that we're not doing

336
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,839
is

337
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:42,800
the

338
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,760
historical division of the world into

339
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,000
kind of a quantum domain a classical

340
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,120
domain in a cosmological domain

341
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,240
where you use three entirely different

342
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,680
theories

343
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,920
right quantum theory classical physics

344
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,839
and general relativity

345
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,480
to talk about what's going on so that's

346
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,120
not scale free

347
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,760
there you're you're radically altering

348
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,320
the mathematical description

349
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,320
to deal with different kinds of problems

350
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,519
so that's what we're not doing trying to

351
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,720
use the same mathematical description

352
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,000
uh to deal with all problems

353
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,920
i think that's a really helpful

354
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,320
description chris because so many times

355
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,399
when we think about quantum we think

356
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,079
about the very very very small like

357
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,639
subatomic particles and so it's pretty

358
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,639
amazing to see

359
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,000
math that's interchangeable with my

360
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,920
level of existence like not just tiny

361
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,720
little pieces of me um being used from

362
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,560
quantum theory

363
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,199
what um

364
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,959
is there any other math that you know of

365
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,480
or any other

366
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,600
um

367
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,199
examples of

368
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,720
math that's been interchangeable with

369
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,120
like classical and cosmological and

370
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,360
quantum scales ever before or is this

371
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,639
maybe the first time that's ever been

372
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,240
done

373
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,440
oh well

374
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,680
no if you look if you look back to

375
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,320
classical physics in the era of newton

376
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,360
or

377
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,440
even i think the better representative

378
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,240
is is classical physics is reformulated

379
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,880
by laplace

380
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,240
um

381
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,680
in that era electromagnetism wasn't

382
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,519
really understood yet so people were

383
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,839
thinking about classical physics in

384
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,959
terms of

385
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,480
mechanical interactions and gravity

386
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,360
um

387
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,759
but the idea at that point

388
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,279
was that

389
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,160
forces act instantaneously

390
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,560
and

391
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,160
forces uh

392
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,800
act with one over r squared dependence

393
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,320
that was the only force that was really

394
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,199
understood the force of gravity

395
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,560
uh

396
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,399
forces were symmetrical

397
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,480
right newton's second law action and

398
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,040
reaction

399
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,920
and

400
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,560
this theory was meant to be universal

401
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,600
and

402
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,079
so if you look at the structure of that

403
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,120
theory

404
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,959
as various people have pointed out i

405
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,720
think nicholas guyson has written a

406
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,920
couple of papers about this

407
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,959
it's a non-local theory

408
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,360
and even even in laplace's era

409
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,440
they realized that there was a a deep

410
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,839
issue with this theory that you know if

411
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,199
a

412
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,480
rock rolls downhill on the moon then

413
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,639
that immediately affects the state of

414
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,399
everything on earth it in fact

415
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,920
immediately affects the state of

416
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,399
everything in the universe

417
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,639
so that starts to look a lot like

418
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,560
entanglement

419
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,880
that states are not locally independent

420
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,000
um

421
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,800
and that's that's the fundamental thing

422
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,440
that einstein attacked about classical

423
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,920
physics in formulating

424
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,199
uh

425
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,480
the theory of relativity was to

426
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,319
insist on

427
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,079
uh

428
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,280
non-instantaneous forces which just

429
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,480
means forces transmitted by some carrier

430
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,880
which we call light

431
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,400
uh but light is really just a carrier of

432
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,000
information it could have been anything

433
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,839
it could have been neutrinos or

434
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,839
something like that

435
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,079
um

436
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,120
so

437
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,799
what einstein did that was most

438
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:35,120
revolutionary was to impose locality on

439
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,600
physics

440
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,960
and

441
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,918
that

442
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,120
in a sense divided the world into realms

443
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,480
that from a formal perspective not just

444
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,320
a practical perspective

445
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,840
could be treated independently

446
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,640
and so it's no surprise that einstein

447
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,360
hated the idea of entanglement

448
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,760
because entanglement was undoing

449
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,039
precisely what he had done to

450
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,480
in his mind repair physics

451
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,720
so yeah i mean classical physics of the

452
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,039
time of applause was formally a

453
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,000
scale-free theory

454
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,880
that's awesome thank you for uh the

455
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,200
clarification there so einstein einstein

456
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,840
broke physics

457
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,720
uh stephen did you have a question yeah

458
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,559
just one question sort of following from

459
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,679
that is

460
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,760
as someone sort of thinking about how

461
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,960
this might

462
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,799
play out in other

463
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,240
ways is it useful to think about things

464
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,720
all the way up from the smallest

465
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,039
and systems all the way up down from the

466
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,760
biggest and classical as being

467
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,080
where we're trying to

468
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,120
name things as systems

469
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,799
so that

470
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,240
because often i hear people talking

471
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,559
system system systems only but the use

472
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,440
of

473
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,080
things seems to be important

474
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,120
as well and i'm wondering if

475
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,400
we should have more thinness in our

476
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,440
way of looking at the world

477
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,480
oh should i comment on that yeah okay

478
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,600
well

479
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,520
this i think you're raising here a

480
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,200
really interesting question

481
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,559
and

482
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,360
uh when we talk about

483
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,559
things

484
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,480
as as

485
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,080
carl so beautifully emphasized in

486
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,840
his 2019 paper

487
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,200
we are implicitly talking about

488
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,320
something that has an identity

489
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,520
and that maintains that identity through

490
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,360
time

491
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,200
and that's a deep

492
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,679
philosophical assumption that's nearly

493
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,640
always implicit i mean people just don't

494
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,240
talk about that assumption very much

495
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,919
and when we when we use the word system

496
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,120
uh

497
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,480
we're

498
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,000
i think often

499
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,120
trying to speak a lot more loosely

500
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,240
but in fact our language doesn't let us

501
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,799
speak more loosely if i talk about a

502
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,640
system

503
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,039
then implicitly i'm saying

504
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,320
i've got a particular state space

505
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,440
that's what a system is

506
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,720
and

507
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,159
if i

508
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,720
talk about a different state space then

509
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,159
i'm talking about a different system

510
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,200
so

511
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,400
uh

512
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,000
let's apply that to something

513
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,360
interesting like embryology

514
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,799
uh

515
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,960
i pick a set of degrees of freedom that

516
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,720
are meant to be the degrees of freedom

517
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,679
of the zygote

518
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:02,799
and

519
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,000
uh i then

520
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,720
you know a few days later

521
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,039
have a set of degrees of freedom that

522
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,039
are the degrees of freedom of some kind

523
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,799
of early stage embryo

524
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,960
but i want to say this is the same thing

525
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,720
as the zygote

526
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,520
well i'm now really abusing my notation

527
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,720
right in a really serious way

528
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,760
by

529
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,080
saying that these two are the same thing

530
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,679
even though they have different state

531
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,240
spaces

532
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,400
so

533
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,440
this is a

534
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,640
i think this is a fundamental

535
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,880
question

536
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,320
for

537
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,559
any science that

538
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,120
bases itself on the notion of a state

539
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,200
space

540
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,840
how to talk

541
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,000
about of

542
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,039
moving between

543
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,400
different degrees of freedom and

544
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,559
associating those things

545
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,679
with with some kind of evolution

546
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,200
of a of a kind of meta thing

547
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,799
that we regard as a single entity

548
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,080
and this is this is one reason that uh

549
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,039
at the beginning of this paper we assume

550
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,720
that we have some

551
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,559
single system

552
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,440
that we divide into

553
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,799
we draw a decompositional boundary

554
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,280
and that decompositional boundary is

555
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,600
basically arbitrary

556
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,640
or it's completely arbitrary

557
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,799
but when we're we're doing something

558
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:45,840
like

559
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,840
embryology

560
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,679
we're looking at a decompositional

561
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,280
boundary between the thing we're

562
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,280
interested in the embryo

563
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,600
and the rest of the universe including

564
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,039
us

565
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,640
that's getting bigger and bigger and

566
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,960
bigger

567
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,840
and

568
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,559
so we need it we need a way to talk

569
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,559
about that sort of thing and we just we

570
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,120
allied that problem in this paper

571
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,200
we we talk about

572
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,159
a fixed decomposition

573
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,280
uh

574
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,000
that that divides the entire universe

575
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,360
into two parts that we can characterize

576
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,600
the interaction between

577
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,799
but but yes underlying all of this is

578
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,120
this much larger question of how we

579
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,080
think about decompositional boundaries

580
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,880
that are expanding

581
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,880
with respect to some parameter that we

582
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,880
call time of course that time

583
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,159
is

584
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,159
not anyone's observable time

585
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,400
because we're we're trying to talk about

586
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,240
it though at the level of the universe

587
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,320
as a whole

588
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,640
so we you can very quickly get into

589
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,320
extremely deep

590
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,799
questions

591
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,440
so two things that um

592
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,840
came up there uh really for me is like

593
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,200
okay yeah you're thinking about the

594
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,960
embryo suddenly that's like a system

595
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,320
that's separate from the world but even

596
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,720
like within the embryo like where do you

597
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,559
draw the line between the placenta and

598
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,799
the embryo and when so so like there's

599
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,520
even some fuzzy blurring um at the

600
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,440
developmental scale

601
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,559
and also really the notion of time and

602
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,559
time irreversibility

603
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,799
and memory and encoding was just

604
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,200
something i found absolutely fascinating

605
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,240
about

606
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,480
this paper so so you mentioned that um

607
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,480
the the quantum the free energy

608
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,640
principle for generic quantum systems

609
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,320
does not imply

610
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,840
like a space

611
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,440
background like it doesn't need a

612
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,520
space-time background to operate but

613
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,679
then like brought time back in in terms

614
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,240
of memory and encoding um and i just

615
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,799
wonder if anybody maybe wants to speak a

616
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,120
little bit more about that or or help us

617
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,039
understand how and why you don't need

618
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:05,158
space or time for its work

619
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,559
well i could talk about that a little

620
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,760
bit if no one else wants to pick it up

621
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,200
let me go back to the first thing you

622
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,559
said though blue which was about

623
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,159
boundaries and how hard it is for

624
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,640
example to draw boundaries in something

625
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,840
like embryology

626
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,919
there's another deep deep assumption

627
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,760
that we make

628
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,080
that the boundaries that we draw in the

629
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,039
world are somehow ontological

630
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,880
or objective and observer independent

631
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,200
and

632
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,840
quantum theory and and many other

633
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,080
sort of theoretical approaches remind us

634
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,000
constantly that that's a bad assumption

635
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,039
that

636
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,840
uh

637
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,400
drawing thinking of these boundaries as

638
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,440
antic causes all kinds of formal

639
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,640
problems

640
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,400
so for example

641
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,039
the associativity of the state space

642
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,320
multiplication operator becomes invalid

643
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,919
so you can you have to throw out the

644
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,960
whole vector space formalism

645
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,320
oh so i mean real problems

646
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,360
uh

647
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,799
so

648
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,559
so boundaries are observer dependent

649
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,520
in

650
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,679
any formalism like this

651
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,159
so what do we mean by this universal

652
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,440
time

653
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,000
it's a construct

654
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,480
it's it's a theoretical

655
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,720
convenience

656
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,039
and we map it on to our observable time

657
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,400
which is time measured by our clock

658
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,760
and since we're we're the theorists we

659
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,679
can say okay we're going to privilege

660
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,240
our clock

661
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,480
and

662
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,720
we're going to assume that our clock is

663
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,440
somehow universal even though we know

664
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,720
that that doesn't make any sense

665
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,240
and

666
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,240
when we think of space-time i mean the

667
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,640
term background-free comes from

668
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,480
cosmology or quantum cosmology

669
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,360
and

670
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,240
it's the idea that

671
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,080
if we want to

672
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,240
understand

673
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,840
gravity

674
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,640
or if we want to understand space-time

675
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,200
as an emergent phenomenon

676
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,360
then we need a theoretical approach that

677
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,120
doesn't build space-time into it

678
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,480
but if we think of biology

679
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,480
how many organisms what fraction of

680
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,799
organisms have anything like our

681
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,000
experience of space

682
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,760
to what extent

683
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,840
is

684
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,000
space part of

685
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,600
the world of

686
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,880
organisms that we're interested in

687
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,120
and

688
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,919
to what extent is

689
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,120
space as we see it

690
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,159
a construct of our ability to make

691
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,320
certain kinds of measurements

692
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,559
and then it's in a strict quantum

693
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,559
theoretic formalism

694
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,520
time is not an observable

695
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,760
but distance is

696
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,360
so it's an observable like any other

697
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,480
so in a in a very strict sense

698
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,399
quantum theory is not a mechanical

699
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:40,000
theory because it's not really about

700
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,159
things going on in an independent

701
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,159
spacetime

702
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:49,129
[Music]

703
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,600
did you have a question

704
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,360
yeah i'd just like to

705
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,240
comment on and i say thanks for

706
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,120
referencing state spaces for systems i

707
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,039
think that's really helpful

708
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,200
because i um i've been wrestling with

709
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,320
this

710
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,799
dynamical part of systems which is

711
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,640
really helpful to think in dynamics but

712
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,640
most or a lot of people when they talk

713
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,080
about systems they just think about

714
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,799
relationships between things

715
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,679
and system dynamics i just flows as if

716
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,600
it's like things being passed around

717
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,840
rather than dynamical

718
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,760
like processes so i think it's helpful

719
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,159
to think about state space

720
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,679
in that way to frame systems and i'm

721
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,440
i'm just um

722
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,840
yeah i'm curious about how

723
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,960
we

724
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,720
have to be careful about people who use

725
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,520
systems in those other ways and don't

726
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,919
have a dynamical

727
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,200
uh

728
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,000
concept of something which is non-linear

729
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,320
being taken into account because

730
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,240
that seems to be something that this

731
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,559
approach really gives the ability to do

732
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:57,840
so i wonder what your thoughts are on

733
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,000
that

734
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,320
carl would you like to say something to

735
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,559
that

736
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,320
yeah i'm not sure it's going to be

737
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,840
deeply informed um so i'm i'm

738
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,360
as i'm listening i'm so trying to

739
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,760
translate all these beautiful ideas into

740
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,520
a classical framework that i'm much more

741
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,240
comfortable with so but the last point

742
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,440
is um

743
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,960
from the classical perspective

744
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,960
absolutely fundamental i mean you start

745
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,480
with a launch valve or a random

746
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,200
dynamical system that is just cast in

747
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,200
terms of flow operators or movement

748
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,919
operators that you can cathex with time

749
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,799
if you want to but just to reinforce um

750
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:49,039
chris's point you know time and space um

751
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,960
are both constructs and then you know

752
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,880
they're just explanations

753
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,000
for what well for these flow operators

754
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,760
so if those flow operators have a

755
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,039
dynamics

756
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,880
then implicitly you've got a rate of

757
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,240
change with respect to something which

758
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,480
is time but uh you know that's quite a

759
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,240
big move um

760
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,100
and um

761
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,480
[Music]

762
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,519
so

763
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,399
putting things in terms of mappings i

764
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,159
think is absolutely fundamental so steve

765
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,760
if your point was

766
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,559
when you need to think about

767
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,760
systemic

768
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,159
processes or systems from the point of

769
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:23,360
view of

770
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,039
mappings

771
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,440
usually associated some time i get the

772
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,679
impression from um

773
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,360
working with chris and jim that um

774
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,519
there is an ordinal or a sequential

775
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,200
aspect so just going back to the

776
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,200
question where did memory get into the

777
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,000
game you know that there has to be

778
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,320
um there has to you know there can still

779
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,840
be sequences or um your

780
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,360
sets of things um that has constitute a

781
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,360
memory but it doesn't have to have the

782
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,480
attribute of um of time in the sense

783
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,559
that we would understand a flow from the

784
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,200
point of view of a differential equation

785
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,039
so i'd like to hear that i'd like to

786
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:06,640
hear sort of um uh chris and jim's

787
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,159
comments on that

788
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,559
while i'm talking though it um

789
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,600
just this importance of um

790
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,039
time as a construct um it does strike me

791
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,519
that you know

792
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,399
that

793
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,600
takes um does a lot of heavy lifting if

794
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,320
we just abandon the notion of some

795
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,399
universal or clock time

796
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,320
in relation to what i would um

797
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,320
from a classical perspective

798
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,440
um read the scale free aspect of and i'm

799
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,760
thinking here of the renormalization

800
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,360
group

801
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,960
um i've been just to know that you know

802
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,399
and i'm sure there is if there is a

803
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,320
renormation group or the apparatus of

804
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,320
the removalization group in quantum

805
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,679
physics but from my perspective um

806
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:52,960
that

807
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,360
that notion of having a scale-free

808
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,679
approach is exactly

809
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:58,559
um

810
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,399
what is the

811
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,080
aspiration

812
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,200
of any

813
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,399
um

814
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,240
in particular the free energy principle

815
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,279
approach um would have

816
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,159
when trying to account for

817
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,760
the progressive

818
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,720
um

819
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,840
increase

820
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,720
in the scale of a system but preserving

821
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,200
exactly the same dynamics the same

822
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,279
lagrangians the same so again from a

823
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,679
classical perspective the same um the

824
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,679
same functional forms

825
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,720
for the the things that are concerned so

826
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,559
yep this is to reiterate chris's

827
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,799
fundamental point earlier on that and

828
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,679
we're not talking about um a commitment

829
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,159
to a particular scale be very very small

830
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,679
or very very big what we're talking

831
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,519
about it's a commitment to the same

832
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,840
functional forms and the apparatus and

833
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,960
the mathematics that underwrite the

834
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,760
the the dynamics if you like and that's

835
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,399
you're at any given scale and then that

836
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,720
calls then into question

837
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,559
how do you get from one scale to the

838
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,360
other

839
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,480
um and i'm

840
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,640
one thing that sort of

841
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,480
jumps out to you when you when you look

842
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,600
at the

843
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,520
the

844
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,639
renormalization group in relation to um

845
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,960
summarizing dynamics of random

846
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,239
differential

847
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,520
systems

848
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,320
is that you get this time dilation or

849
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,480
this you know you move from one tonight

850
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,599
skill to another time scale um so i'm

851
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,239
i'm coming back to the point that you

852
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,918
know when you talk about time what's

853
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,239
skateboard scale what time are you

854
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,918
talking about are you talking about

855
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:36,239
evolutionary time are you talking about

856
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,119
um

857
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,040
uh sort of you know

858
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,079
the time that um the fetus is enjoying

859
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,239
in its mother's womb or you're talking

860
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,679
about the time scale appropriate for the

861
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,800
the fluxes of ions over your

862
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,918
cell membrane um so the deeper question

863
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,239
here is that how does one temp one time

864
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,040
relate to another um the people that i

865
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,640
know who are

866
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,960
interested in this issue from the point

867
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,480
of view of

868
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,480
the perception of time or time as a

869
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,760
construct

870
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,800
um

871
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,839
usually fall back on information rates

872
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,079
they usually fall back on the

873
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,800
the rate of belief updating or the

874
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,880
amount to which you have moved in some

875
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,680
belief space technically

876
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,359
manifold

877
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,040
from a classical point of view but as

878
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,359
soon as you say weight

879
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,040
with respect to what

880
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,599
um and then it comes back with

881
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,599
some time which time

882
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,040
and where you end up

883
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,359
where you end up as well okay

884
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,079
um i can't talk about any absolute

885
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,760
information rate but i can certainly

886
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,599
talk about um

887
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,119
the number of moves i make at one scale

888
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,440
per number of moves i make at another

889
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,640
scale

890
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,400
even we could be doing that in our heads

891
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,480
you know when we

892
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,839
very high

893
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:59,119
scales say from the point of view of a

894
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,760
generative model in our in our heads

895
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,490
dealing

896
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:03,839
[Music]

897
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,160
with things that unfold

898
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,119
very slowly in relation to

899
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,000
fast move updating much closer say to

900
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,800
our sensory organs or

901
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,079
actuators um but it does make sense you

902
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,920
know to actually talk about how much

903
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,160
have i moved how far have i moved in

904
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,720
terms of an information length

905
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,480
in my belief updating

906
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,920
in um at a higher level of a hierarchy

907
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,880
or you know a higher scale

908
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,800
in relation to the to the number of

909
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,079
moons or how far i have moved

910
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,119
we've got somebody

911
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,880
okay okay or you can just

912
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,400
um

913
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,040
it'll be it'll be muted

914
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,040
my that little response was very

915
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,960
rambling because there are so many just

916
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,880
like questions come up over the past

917
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,920
10 20 minutes i i like to pass that to

918
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,240
to chris and jim now that i understood

919
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,760
um to get their take on um

920
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,880
how comfortable they would be by taking

921
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,440
the notions of um say the

922
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,839
renormalization group as applied to

923
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,440
pathogenic formulations of random

924
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,040
dynamical systems and whether that has

925
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,680
any homolog or any currency in a truly

926
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,960
background-free quantum population

927
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,359
well i don't know

928
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,240
well

929
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:06,079
um basically i i

930
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,280
think um what carl is

931
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,599
proposing concerning the renormalization

932
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,640
group and the van der waals theories um

933
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,598
something to be investigated

934
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,000
concerning

935
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,440
um

936
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,240
the

937
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,320
aspect of um

938
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,240
memory from the

939
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,480
informational point of view

940
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,119
and um may i speak

941
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,920
about the specifics of our construction

942
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,599
namely the

943
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:40,560
cone

944
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,640
cocoon diagram

945
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,279
which um

946
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:02,320
okay you could mute or just yeah

947
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,640
that's all good

948
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,720
we're going to be looking at the cone

949
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,240
cocoon

950
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,280
um

951
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,520
maybe just chris or carl you can give a

952
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,720
first

953
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,480
pass

954
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,560
like what is this being shown and also

955
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,160
how does it relate to active inference

956
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,440
oh hello

957
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,240
okay welcome back

958
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,920
uh local distraction

959
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,200
um

960
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,520
yes uh okay well uh you see

961
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,359
at the beginning of the paper when we

962
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:44,000
discuss discuss the

963
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,640
holographic screen which underlies the

964
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,280
markov blanket you have

965
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,760
these preparation

966
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,240
measurement operations which

967
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,440
feed

968
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,760
into the diagram

969
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,760
diagram 14

970
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,119
um

971
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,160
of which

972
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,920
the lower part emanating from d prime

973
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,920
is um

974
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,280
a

975
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,359
memory write system

976
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,440
so as the

977
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,200
um

978
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,079
the top part is picking up information

979
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:18,960
from

980
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,680
the measurement and preparation

981
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,160
operators

982
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,599
there is a memory rights system

983
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,359
being um

984
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,000
implemented

985
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:33,920
from the opposite

986
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,079
direction

987
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,240
um

988
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,400
one thing i i would like to say about

989
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,920
the individual classifiers that

990
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,000
we haven't sort of um

991
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,480
fully mentioned in the paper that an

992
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,880
individual classifier

993
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,960
uh can be the result of um an algebraic

994
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,640
operation on

995
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,560
on two other uh

996
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,319
classifiers

997
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:01,280
um

998
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,680
these algebraic operations

999
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,280
uh can be of the type such as

1000
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,160
concurrency

1001
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,920
or

1002
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,560
ortho currents for example when you have

1003
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,720
a system of trains going through a

1004
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,040
system of stations

1005
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,359
um

1006
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:24,560
the

1007
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,880
the classifiers in question

1008
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,960
uh can be um

1009
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,839
combined to that extent and also by

1010
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:34,960
choice so i i think the scope for

1011
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,000
what is happening informationally

1012
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,800
in diagram 14 is uh quite significant

1013
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,040
um

1014
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:48,880
originally um two spaces were applied to

1015
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,400
such areas

1016
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,839
as

1017
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,480
as as concurrency and

1018
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,359
um

1019
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,200
high dimensional

1020
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,960
automata

1021
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,839
um

1022
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:04,640
and also um

1023
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,960
we can look at the possible uh

1024
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,720
possiblistic

1025
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,599
uh

1026
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:10,880
case

1027
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,240
and

1028
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,119
there are ways of interpreting diagram

1029
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,880
14 in terms of the graph network too

1030
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,800
so um

1031
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,520
i know this doesn't exactly answer uh

1032
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,920
carl's uh questions but um i i i want to

1033
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,400
say that there is the mechanism there

1034
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,040
um for the uh

1035
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,480
memory right

1036
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,240
so um

1037
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,400
this is um of course uh influential when

1038
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,839
uh you see that um

1039
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:46,000
inference leads to

1040
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,760
minimizing the

1041
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,560
variational free energy principle

1042
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,160
if you have any questions about those

1043
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,040
diagrams please ask me

1044
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,319
perhaps chris can elaborate on what i'm

1045
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,560
saying

1046
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,160
uh yeah let me make a background

1047
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,640
comment here

1048
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,599
uh

1049
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,160
which in a sense goes to

1050
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,880
uh one reason that we're using this

1051
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,560
quantum theoretic formalism

1052
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,839
if we

1053
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:28,079
if we think of everything in terms of

1054
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,040
a

1055
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,839
a quantum theoretic formalism in turn

1056
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:35,920
instead of a classical formalism

1057
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,240
then

1058
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,599
the only place that there's any

1059
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,920
classical information in the system

1060
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,880
is actually on the boundary between the

1061
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,720
two interacting components

1062
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,400
so

1063
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,720
um

1064
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,760
in that original i

1065
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,720
i don't know whether it's figure one or

1066
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,520
the

1067
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,040
the the very original idea in the paper

1068
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,079
is that we we have some

1069
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,079
closed system which we can think of as

1070
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,240
the universe as a whole or the universe

1071
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,319
of interest as a whole

1072
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:17,359
and

1073
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:21,119
it's in some quantum state

1074
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,079
and if we divide it into two and we make

1075
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,160
the assumption that

1076
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,880
the joint state after the division is

1077
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,200
separable that we've divided it in a

1078
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,560
place

1079
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,640
where the interaction of the system with

1080
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,200
itself is weak enough

1081
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,359
that we can think of the two halves

1082
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,280
independently of the two components

1083
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,520
independently

1084
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,520
then we have this natural sense of

1085
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,760
classical information written on that

1086
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,400
boundary and that's the sense of

1087
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,079
classical information that one

1088
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,079
encounters in the holographic principle

1089
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,640
in cosmology

1090
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,760
and

1091
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,400
it's it's in that sense of classical

1092
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,079
encoding

1093
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:02,880
that

1094
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,000
of this boundary serves as a markov

1095
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,680
blanket

1096
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,599
but since the boundary is the only locus

1097
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,440
anywhere of classical information

1098
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,599
in this formal description

1099
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:20,560
then any classical memory has to be

1100
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,000
resident on that boundary

1101
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,560
and

1102
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,000
this actually brings to mind a picture

1103
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,400
which was not included in this paper

1104
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,440
but that i'm using in a subsequent paper

1105
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,319
with

1106
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,640
mike levin

1107
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,119
which really is is just thinking of this

1108
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,560
boundary using a pie chart and

1109
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,040
as we pointed out in this paper

1110
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,560
uh

1111
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,359
another kind of classical information is

1112
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:56,400
the classical free energy flow

1113
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,280
that powers information processing so

1114
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,119
this this actually isn't the right

1115
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:02,480
picture but

1116
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,480
um

1117
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,359
and

1118
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:08,560
so one can immediately carve off a large

1119
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,800
chunk of the boundary and say okay this

1120
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,200
is just thermodynamic exchange these

1121
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,118
bits aren't useful to anybody

1122
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,400
they're

1123
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,079
they're the bits that are being used

1124
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,680
burned as power

1125
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,680
yeah this is a better picture

1126
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,078
for that

1127
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:27,359
and then

1128
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:28,400
there's a

1129
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,240
chunk of the pie chart

1130
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,560
that we can think of as perception and

1131
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,319
another chunk of the pie chart that we

1132
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:37,200
can think of as action

1133
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,680
but then some other piece of the pie

1134
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,440
chart has to be allocated to memory

1135
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,800
or

1136
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,359
there's no internal time

1137
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,760
right having an internal clock

1138
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,920
and having a memory are the same concept

1139
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,560
if i don't have any memory at all then i

1140
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,640
have no awareness of the passing of time

1141
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,680
and i have no internal clock

1142
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,920
so when jim talks about

1143
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,920
uh in that

1144
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,760
previous

1145
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,480
cocon diagram

1146
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,440
a memory right operation it's a memory

1147
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,040
right operation on the boundary

1148
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,079
and

1149
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:21,520
of course the the opposite partner in

1150
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,280
the interaction

1151
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,800
uh my memory segment of the boundary

1152
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,520
from my point of view

1153
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,400
might be my partner's perception segment

1154
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,839
of the boundary

1155
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,839
or might overlap with my partner's

1156
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:37,040
perception of the segment of the

1157
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,200
boundary i have no idea how my

1158
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,680
interaction partner cuts up the boundary

1159
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,040
from their point of view

1160
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:45,920
so

1161
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,240
um

1162
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,280
this is yeah that that's what this

1163
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,440
picture sort of illustrates

1164
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,880
uh

1165
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,160
so this question of of

1166
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,119
what is the memory

1167
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,920
also becomes observer independent

1168
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,319
which which gets back to this question

1169
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,800
of time and the relationship of time to

1170
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,440
a local clock and the relationship of a

1171
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,839
local clock to memory

1172
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:16,000
so whenever we talk about

1173
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,839
time as observed by

1174
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:20,559
someone

1175
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,800
oh we're making reference to a local

1176
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,040
clock and a memory resource and of

1177
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,599
course an energy flow that powers that

1178
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,680
memory resource and prevents it from

1179
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,240
decaying

1180
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:36,559
entropically so this i

1181
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,800
we keep circling back to this

1182
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,960
abstraction of the universal time that

1183
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:46,640
parameterizes the universal dynamics

1184
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,440
but um

1185
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,079
and you know this this formalism like

1186
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:54,880
any such formalism requires that concept

1187
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,680
is a theoretical construct

1188
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,640
but

1189
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:02,160
at least it doesn't confuse it with the

1190
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,800
the experienced time of any particular

1191
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,359
observer which has to be represented in

1192
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:08,880
this very different

1193
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,480
in this very distinct way

1194
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,760
awesome thanks so i think that is a

1195
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,920
perfect segue

1196
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,440
into a question that was asked by franz

1197
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,960
kutzling in the live chat um and also

1198
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,839
mike levin has joined us i don't know if

1199
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,280
he's able to talk he says he's having

1200
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,280
some internet issues mike did you want

1201
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,040
to say hello before i asked franz's

1202
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,000
question

1203
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,480
if you can

1204
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,359
be muted

1205
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:42,160
um

1206
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,680
okay i'll ask the question and then

1207
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,119
we'll see if mike figures out how to

1208
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:46,640
unmute and say hi

1209
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,119
um so franz asks

1210
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,280
how does the definition of a thing that

1211
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,079
maintains its identity over time scale

1212
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:56,640
with time scales or

1213
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,119
over scale with time scales there you go

1214
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:00,559
how does the definition of a thing that

1215
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:03,520
maintains its identity over time scale

1216
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,440
with time scales

1217
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,400
what

1218
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,160
i still didn't get it for example i

1219
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,359
would call something a thing if it

1220
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:11,040
persisted for some time

1221
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,040
with respect to my observational time

1222
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,200
scale so in other words can quantum

1223
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,160
theory

1224
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,480
say something about how to set temporal

1225
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,119
observer limited boundaries of defining

1226
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:22,960
a thing

1227
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,680
there's a lot in there

1228
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,440
yeah

1229
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,400
um

1230
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,839
we see many ways um some that are

1231
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:38,839
actually

1232
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:42,000
implicitly scale friendly or scale free

1233
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,359
like the hierarchical parametric models

1234
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:48,640
in spm statistical parametric modeling

1235
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,720
that's separating like in a multi-scale

1236
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,640
experimental design from an

1237
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,559
experimentalist's perspective

1238
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:57,440
into signal and noise including the

1239
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,599
combinatoric interactions

1240
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,559
in a classical parametric state space

1241
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,359
and there's also um the

1242
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:06,160
uh

1243
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,240
bayesian identification

1244
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,280
of parameters which also is

1245
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,000
just as was brought up scale implies

1246
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,319
choosing what the state space is

1247
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,319
and so what

1248
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,559
statistical variance gets partitioned

1249
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,720
into the noise term or the kind of

1250
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,800
ripple term and what gets partitioned

1251
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,200
into the wave term into the signal into

1252
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,720
the regression slope rather than the

1253
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,079
variance term

1254
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,480
these kinds of variance partitioning

1255
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,000
questions

1256
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,680
can be approached in a

1257
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,000
instantaneous sense like descriptive

1258
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,920
statistics even if it's about time

1259
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,880
series

1260
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,559
and um

1261
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:43,599
i think

1262
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:45,599
a theme that we're hearing brought up is

1263
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:48,240
that taking repeated measurements

1264
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,599
seriously

1265
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:52,400
brings in a whole host of essentially

1266
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,160
cognitive features

1267
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,200
like

1268
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,880
as well as

1269
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,319
information theoretic

1270
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:02,880
perspective dependence

1271
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,400
all of these features

1272
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,520
that are

1273
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,880
um tucked under the rug or um down

1274
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,240
projected onto in a special case

1275
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:15,440
if we just assume a synchronous universe

1276
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,480
um or a synchronous regression it's a

1277
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,559
totally different scenario

1278
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:24,000
but considering this quantum statistical

1279
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,319
background

1280
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:27,839
helps us

1281
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:29,920
deal with the cognitive modeling and

1282
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,640
also take the consequences of action

1283
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,240
into account

1284
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,960
because action is implied in the

1285
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,880
measurement preparation

1286
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,839
recording experimental active inference

1287
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:43,040
cycle

1288
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,800
it was just so subtle in the paper we

1289
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,960
said all inference in this scheme is

1290
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,119
active inference

1291
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:50,960
but the paper was about quantum and the

1292
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,960
fep

1293
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:00,880
um

1294
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,079
thanks

1295
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,160
uh could i bounce off what daniel just

1296
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,319
said very quickly

1297
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,160
because uh i was also thinking about the

1298
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,280
nature of action i thought i was um so i

1299
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,040
thought what daniel just mentioned there

1300
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,480
ties in with

1301
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,960
is is if memory

1302
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,480
happens via

1303
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,319
there being some action and then the

1304
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:21,520
action

1305
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,960
defines the memory scale there's

1306
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:25,839
um

1307
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:26,800
so

1308
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,720
i think that makes

1309
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,359
that that that starts to define a scale

1310
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:32,720
so i'm curious

1311
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,559
that if if there's something different

1312
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,160
between

1313
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,240
the the temporality of a thing

1314
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,720
maintaining its thinness

1315
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:41,599
and

1316
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:44,880
the sort of temporality of um

1317
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,559
actions

1318
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:49,280
by systems of things

1319
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,839
because i think things can only act to

1320
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:54,240
maintain their thinness but they don't

1321
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,960
if they start doing things with others

1322
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,359
they become a system so i suppose you've

1323
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:00,720
got

1324
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,440
where where that action still starts to

1325
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,319
come into the equation or am i mistaken

1326
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:09,319
there

1327
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,640
can i address that briefly

1328
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,520
yeah i i think a relevant the relevant

1329
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,839
fable here is the

1330
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:24,079
fable of the two drunks who are walking

1331
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:28,000
home from the bar leaning on each other

1332
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,680
and

1333
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,440
if they're lucky they manage to keep

1334
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,400
each other upright

1335
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,839
if

1336
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:45,119
if if we if we think

1337
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,520
of

1338
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,040
an observer in an environment

1339
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,839
and so we draw a boundary between

1340
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:57,759
the observer and the environment

1341
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,319
and we think about the observer's

1342
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:04,880
interaction with its total environment

1343
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,920
then we've divided the boundary up as we

1344
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,559
were talking about earlier

1345
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:13,760
uh into a pie chart where

1346
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,319
you know a large fraction of the bits

1347
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:17,599
are fuel

1348
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:18,839
and so they're

1349
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:21,440
uninformative and there's a perception

1350
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,000
space in an action space and a memory

1351
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,119
space and so on

1352
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:30,400
now let's think about what happens when

1353
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,280
the observer identifies a thing

1354
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,760
embedded in the environment

1355
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,400
so the observer has now

1356
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,520
segmented or sectored

1357
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,720
the

1358
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,760
the perception part of the space

1359
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,280
into

1360
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,799
a part

1361
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:49,599
that

1362
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:52,079
includes bits that represent the state

1363
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,720
of this thing

1364
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,640
and the rest of the perception space

1365
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,960
which are bits that represent the

1366
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,720
background

1367
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,359
that the thing is embedded in so the

1368
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:08,640
things environment

1369
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,680
and so the question becomes what does it

1370
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:12,720
mean

1371
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,359
to say that that thing

1372
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,559
remain

1373
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:19,359
retains its thinness its identity over

1374
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:20,559
time

1375
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:24,079
for that observer

1376
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:25,119
uh

1377
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:27,040
well that means that

1378
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,119
that observer

1379
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,359
is able to

1380
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:34,480
maintain this distinction

1381
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,079
between

1382
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:38,400
bits that communicate information about

1383
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,880
the thing and bits that communicate

1384
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,480
information about the thing's

1385
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,640
environment

1386
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,880
so this becomes a cognitive question

1387
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,000
about the observer

1388
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,359
so

1389
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:52,880
it's

1390
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,000
the question how does a thing

1391
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,359
maintain its identity

1392
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:02,480
is replaced in in this way by the

1393
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,520
question

1394
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,480
how does an observer of a thing

1395
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:10,559
maintain the thing's identity

1396
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:11,440
for

1397
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,720
himself or for itself

1398
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,799
how does the observer

1399
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:17,760
uh

1400
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,880
maintain the ability to lock in on this

1401
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,480
thing is distinct from the environment

1402
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,680
and

1403
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:26,960
um

1404
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,400
[Music]

1405
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,200
so let's let's go to an example

1406
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,440
right think about motor babbling in an

1407
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,280
infant

1408
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,240
so

1409
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,799
here's this infant she's lying on her

1410
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:41,920
back she's waving her arms and her legs

1411
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,440
around

1412
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,400
and

1413
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:48,160
what she's doing in this motor babbling

1414
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,440
is

1415
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,079
figuring out the relationship between

1416
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:55,040
the motor system and the visual system

1417
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:55,839
so

1418
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,839
among other things she's figuring out

1419
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:00,880
that some that something that she sees

1420
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,040
some visual stimulus

1421
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,960
is actually part of her body it's a hand

1422
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,960
and that at a certain moment she begins

1423
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,880
to be able to control what this hand is

1424
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,000
doing

1425
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,520
uh

1426
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,960
using visual and motor feedback

1427
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,559
so here's here's a living example of an

1428
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:22,720
observer

1429
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:23,839
of

1430
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:28,078
fixing the identity of an object

1431
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:32,079
and what we're trying to do here in a

1432
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:34,160
sense is

1433
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:37,119
use this as a

1434
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:41,119
is is to insist on thinking about

1435
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:43,680
thinghood always in this observer

1436
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,280
specific way

1437
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,960
so i noticed that carl just raised his

1438
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,119
hand so let me turn it over completely

1439
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:52,240
to him to carry on with that or contest

1440
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:56,160
it or give a different perspective

1441
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,799
no i do i don't want to contest it i

1442
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:00,640
want to fully endorse that and if you

1443
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,799
just

1444
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:05,760
look at the free energy principle as

1445
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,440
classically formulated it is exactly uh

1446
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,440
along the lines of

1447
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,760
the uh the thickness being an attribute

1448
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,000
of the observer so if you just start off

1449
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,920
with the notion of a markov blanket that

1450
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,960
stupidly defines a thickness how is the

1451
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,760
markov blanket defined well it's defined

1452
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,760
by the conditional independence between

1453
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,079
the dynamics on the inside versus the

1454
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:29,280
outside

1455
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,040
but of course

1456
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,760
those dynamics are not observable once

1457
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,520
they're on the inside from the outside

1458
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,200
by definition

1459
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,960
so you're immediately

1460
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,160
imputing

1461
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,079
some magical

1462
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:45,200
observer that could actually recognize

1463
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,599
that independence before you've even

1464
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:49,440
defined what a thing is so i just wanted

1465
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,160
to to you know um

1466
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,760
in an abstract and possibly even

1467
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,200
philosophical way

1468
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,640
and reinforce this notion that thingness

1469
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,440
does you know is an attribute of

1470
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,359
something that could possibly observe it

1471
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:05,680
even from the classical perspective of

1472
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,599
the free energy principle predicated on

1473
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:09,520
the notion of a mark or blanket that is

1474
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:12,240
in turn uh defined in terms of

1475
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,160
conditional independences or

1476
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,400
disentanglement um

1477
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,520
but the the that example of the um

1478
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,799
of motor babbling i think is that you

1479
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:24,319
know again a lovely illustration of

1480
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:25,280
um

1481
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,720
observation

1482
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,799
underwriting thingness and in this

1483
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:31,319
instance um your highly

1484
01:00:31,319 --> 01:00:33,280
anthropomorphized thing that's name is

1485
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,760
selfhood you know to to develop the

1486
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,079
hypothesis or the explanation

1487
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:41,680
for my holographic screen or my um

1488
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,720
all the uh information on my markov

1489
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,559
blanket that

1490
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:47,760
a a

1491
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,000
plausible parsimonious explanation is

1492
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,839
that i am a thing i am a self i am me

1493
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:56,559
is is actually you know takes months if

1494
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:59,760
not years to fully actually uh you know

1495
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,760
arrive at as you're an infant slowly

1496
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,480
discovering that i am different from mom

1497
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:07,119
and perhaps mom is different from the

1498
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:08,880
background and

1499
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,440
ultimately perhaps i am something like

1500
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,920
mum uh so you know

1501
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,960
these um the emergence of thingness i

1502
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,000
think is it is quintessentially observer

1503
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,640
dependent both mathematically and in

1504
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:27,118
terms of developmental uh psychology

1505
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:33,359
great thank you

1506
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,720
oh crap did you want to head on sorry i

1507
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:39,118
was trying

1508
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:47,440
how lucky the technology

1509
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,240
so

1510
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,799
maybe i will put put this back to carl

1511
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:53,839
maybe you were talking earlier

1512
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:56,720
before jim started talking about the

1513
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,880
rate of information flow

1514
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:02,799
and the rate of belief updating

1515
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:04,559
and so i just wonder i've been curious

1516
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:07,039
about this actually um

1517
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:09,200
just in terms of human

1518
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,119
information like are we really bombarded

1519
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:13,760
with more information now than we used

1520
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:14,640
to be

1521
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:17,920
um and is this like influencing our rate

1522
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,319
of cultural change cultural evolution

1523
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:22,400
because as a culture like we

1524
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,480
update our beliefs more often do you

1525
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,680
think that these two things are

1526
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,280
proportional the rate of information

1527
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:31,760
flow and the rate of belief updating

1528
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:33,520
something i've been thinking about

1529
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,680
yes no i i'm sure that's absolutely

1530
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:36,480
right

1531
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,799
and right i think you know at every

1532
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:40,480
scale of analysis

1533
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,319
um so you could look at it from the

1534
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:44,559
point of view of culture and the

1535
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:46,400
availability of information on social

1536
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,680
media and globalization uh at a cultural

1537
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:52,559
scale but you could also i think um

1538
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:54,480
bring us back to motor bubbling that you

1539
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,039
know the degree of bleep updating an

1540
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:58,640
infant has to do

1541
01:02:58,640 --> 01:02:59,520
um

1542
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,920
is clearly going to be much greater than

1543
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:05,119
somebody um of of my age um

1544
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:07,440
so you know time will

1545
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,520
a year in the life of an infant will not

1546
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,839
be the same as a year in the life in my

1547
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:14,000
life and you know

1548
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,079
i think that that is a direct reflection

1549
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:18,799
of the degree of belief updating

1550
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:21,359
interestingly that that question um

1551
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:23,440
touches upon the separation of time

1552
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,960
scales which i think underwrites

1553
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,039
everything that we're talking about here

1554
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:28,000
um

1555
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:28,799
so

1556
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:31,920
you just stand back again and go back to

1557
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,319
some of uh chris's earlier observations

1558
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:36,240
um about the

1559
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,760
remit of

1560
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,400
the um the paper in question

1561
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,319
um it was really at any given but not

1562
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:46,079
specified scale

1563
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:46,960
um

1564
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:47,760
where

1565
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,950
we could assume that um

1566
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:51,280
[Music]

1567
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,480
we didn't have to worry about the

1568
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,720
separation of time scales from the point

1569
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,400
of view of a cognitive

1570
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,920
neuroscientist for example what we're

1571
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:00,160
talking about is inference where

1572
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:02,000
inference in this instance would be read

1573
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:02,720
as

1574
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,599
um a kind of reading and writing onto

1575
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:07,839
this holographic screen or if you're one

1576
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:11,359
of the perspective um the you know the

1577
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:14,640
updating of um active and sensory states

1578
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,520
on the on the markov blanket um

1579
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,240
but

1580
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,960
under the assumption that the

1581
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,559
the the

1582
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:24,319
other things that change at a slower

1583
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,400
time scale are not changing

1584
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,559
and those other things might not be

1585
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:30,480
might be for example at a slow time

1586
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,079
scale they might be learning

1587
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:34,240
so you've got this notion that the the

1588
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,000
formalism at hand

1589
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,160
the reading and writing at hand

1590
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:39,359
from the

1591
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:42,160
information theoretical perspective

1592
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,920
could be a very good metaphor for

1593
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,119
inference

1594
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:48,319
you know over a short time period where

1595
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:51,359
there um where things are not changing

1596
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:53,119
very quickly from a point of view on the

1597
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:54,400
things to be learned

1598
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,640
so within a few seconds or minutes of

1599
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,039
the life of the zygote

1600
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:00,960
acknowledging that you could apply the

1601
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,760
same apparatus and the same mechanics

1602
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,520
at a slower time scale that would

1603
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,400
account for the transition from a zygote

1604
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,680
to a to a neonate as it learns so the

1605
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:12,799
difference between inference and

1606
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:14,960
learning i think is is

1607
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,240
a nice

1608
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,160
common sensible example of this

1609
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,160
separation of time skills so when you

1610
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,640
ask about you know cultural information

1611
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,160
available i think you're probably

1612
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,400
talking about

1613
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,359
a scale of learning um and

1614
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:30,880
absolutely you're

1615
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:33,119
when we learn we update our beliefs

1616
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:34,559
there it will be from a classical

1617
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:37,839
perspective a statistical manifold that

1618
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:39,760
holds those beliefs and you're literally

1619
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:44,000
moving over that um and with respect to

1620
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,599
another scale and then the degree of

1621
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:49,680
belief update and the degree of asking

1622
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:52,640
questions the degree of read writing um

1623
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:55,520
will certainly be

1624
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:59,760
be a function of the amount of reading

1625
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,599
or writing that's going on and i can

1626
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,680
imagine that somebody

1627
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:06,240
somebody who has access to wikipedia or

1628
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,400
news on social media is doing a lot more

1629
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,160
read writing

1630
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,599
than i was saying

1631
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:14,839
in the 1960s

1632
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:18,479
[Music]

1633
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,960
okay you're moving but to me blue

1634
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,400
yes to you

1635
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,280
so

1636
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,839
carl you made a fascinating point about

1637
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:30,799
connecting the motor babbling and taking

1638
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:33,119
it into the informational and the belief

1639
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:35,280
updating domain um

1640
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,960
into the adult

1641
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,359
where we're kind of motor babbling on

1642
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:41,200
social media in a way that has different

1643
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,720
dynamics than before

1644
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,799
um

1645
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:46,720
and people often give the example of

1646
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,400
like well a year feels longer for a

1647
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,839
seven-year-old because it's the seventh

1648
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,520
of their life but then for the 80 year

1649
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,520
old it's an 80th of their life so that

1650
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,440
piece of the pie is smaller versus

1651
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,400
bigger

1652
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,640
and that is implicitly the fallacy of

1653
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,760
the observer independent time as if

1654
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,839
there was a linear chart that was being

1655
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:06,880
linearly divided by some static observer

1656
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,119
whereas another way to look at that or

1657
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:11,440
an alternative model is like the rate of

1658
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,839
development or experiences or change or

1659
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:15,119
novelty or

1660
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:17,359
continue to explore and don't worry all

1661
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:18,720
mute james

1662
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,000
is that

1663
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,920
oh he's muted on the live stream so it's

1664
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,720
all those um

1665
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:28,480
that uh rate of belief updating

1666
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,400
could set that internal

1667
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:33,280
kairos that biological time like that

1668
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:36,160
biological information geometry

1669
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,480
and so it connects the cognitive

1670
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:41,039
sciences and also the statistical

1671
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:42,400
perspectives that have been

1672
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,319
discussed to this

1673
01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:45,440
time

1674
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:46,960
question which as also brought up

1675
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,440
earlier does so much work

1676
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,559
in so-called dynamical modeling

1677
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:53,760
and it just makes me think about how

1678
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,599
there was a movement from the observer

1679
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:56,799
independent

1680
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,240
synchronous

1681
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,359
into

1682
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:02,000
the relativistic

1683
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,119
which prepared and almost like prepared

1684
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:06,000
the

1685
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,280
partition

1686
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:08,799
to exist

1687
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:11,039
so that all these other domains

1688
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:12,559
like the holographic principle could

1689
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:13,920
come into play

1690
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:14,720
so

1691
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:18,080
my question for any of the authors is

1692
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:20,719
where does the qrf come into play and

1693
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:23,040
how does this relate to discussions of

1694
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:27,158
pluralism and polycentrality

1695
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:34,000
awesome question

1696
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:36,799
jim did you

1697
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:39,839
answer well

1698
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,040
um i i wonder if you can bring up a

1699
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:46,399
diagram there um in the paper

1700
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:48,399
uh let's see

1701
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:49,359
sure

1702
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:52,399
yes it's diagram 34 well there

1703
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:55,759
you have a configuration that

1704
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:59,279
um relates the

1705
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:02,238
qrf to the

1706
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:04,640
cochlear cone diagrams and

1707
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,198
we say here that

1708
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:08,640
um

1709
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:09,759
let's see

1710
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:12,158
um

1711
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:15,759
well here we focus on co deployable

1712
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:18,238
observers uh when this

1713
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:21,600
uh diagram uh commutes

1714
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,198
um

1715
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:26,080
it is interesting of course um when the

1716
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,960
diagram doesn't commute and then you

1717
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,040
have a kind of intrinsic

1718
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:31,839
uh

1719
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:34,238
context uh

1720
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:35,839
reality

1721
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:36,880
so

1722
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,199
um

1723
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:44,000
i i i think

1724
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,839
what this is saying is that

1725
01:09:46,839 --> 01:09:49,279
um there are

1726
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:52,080
there are certain elements of um

1727
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:55,280
information represented by the logic of

1728
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,920
the distributed system in question

1729
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,360
that are

1730
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:00,640
um

1731
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:03,360
kind of uh ambiguous

1732
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:04,560
or um

1733
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:05,440
rather

1734
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,679
they're manifest in um

1735
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:10,880
classifiers and infomorphisms that

1736
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:11,920
um

1737
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:14,000
aren't defined or

1738
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,360
um the co limit the bolt c at the top

1739
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:18,159
there

1740
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:20,960
uh does not exist

1741
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:24,719
so um this is a very useful criteria uh

1742
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:26,080
i think to

1743
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:30,560
uh distinguish between sort of um

1744
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,719
empirical models which the best part are

1745
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:38,880
based on co-deployable variables and

1746
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,800
what happens

1747
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,840
when quantum

1748
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:46,080
contextuality um occurs the that is

1749
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,920
diagram 34

1750
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,640
um doesn't uh commute so

1751
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,239
there's some sort of

1752
01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:57,199
uh discrepancy there in the um

1753
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:59,840
uh mechanism of the quantum reference

1754
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:00,800
frame

1755
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:01,920
um

1756
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:05,120
relative to the dynamics of from

1757
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,679
the markov blanket or the the

1758
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:09,440
holographic screen

1759
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,120
underlying it so

1760
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:12,560
um

1761
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,840
there is some kind of distortion in

1762
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,159
meaning um

1763
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:21,199
that results in this sort of intrinsic

1764
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:24,199
contextuality

1765
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,960
uh i i i don't know if that's a

1766
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,560
satisfactory

1767
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,800
uh answer at all

1768
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,679
but um

1769
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,960
when this breaks down i haven't seen

1770
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:40,560
that before it sounds good

1771
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,640
i'm sorry there's another local distress

1772
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,040
it's all good

1773
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:47,199
chris did you want to add on to that or

1774
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:49,840
maybe make another comment

1775
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,800
uh well i wanted to go back

1776
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,199
a little bit to the basics of what a

1777
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:57,120
quantum reference frame is because this

1778
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,080
is a

1779
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,080
concept that

1780
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,920
is both very familiar and i think a

1781
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:05,040
little bit unfamiliar

1782
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:10,800
and the the term was

1783
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,800
only coined

1784
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:15,920
back in the 1990s

1785
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,199
when

1786
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:19,440
uh

1787
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,199
the the idea of of

1788
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:25,760
a quantum measurement

1789
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:30,159
was associated with with the idea of

1790
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:31,199
uh

1791
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:34,000
the the units in which the measurement

1792
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,760
is made and what are the requirements

1793
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,840
for

1794
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,560
a measurement being meaningful and we're

1795
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,560
going to get right back to the same

1796
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,320
issues we've been talking about with

1797
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:50,759
respect to time and thingness

1798
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,199
but

1799
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:55,840
a a reference frame

1800
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:56,719
is

1801
01:12:56,719 --> 01:12:59,120
just a way of giving meaning to an

1802
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,280
outcome

1803
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:02,719
and it's

1804
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:07,840
it's what allows outcomes to be compared

1805
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:10,880
so if i have an apparatus like a meter

1806
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:11,920
stick

1807
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,719
i can go around and measure

1808
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:16,480
lengths

1809
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,040
and as long as i believe that my meter

1810
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:20,320
stick

1811
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,960
maintains its identity

1812
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,120
as long as i believe that my meter stick

1813
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,280
remains the same thing

1814
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,440
then i can compare the lengths that i've

1815
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:31,040
measured

1816
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,960
but if i don't believe my meter stick

1817
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,340
remains the same thing

1818
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:35,440
[Music]

1819
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:38,320
uh then i then these length comparisons

1820
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:40,159
are meaningless

1821
01:13:40,159 --> 01:13:40,960
so

1822
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:43,840
the notion of of a reference frame is is

1823
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,159
intimately tied up with this notion of

1824
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:48,080
meaning

1825
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,080
which in a

1826
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,800
in this free energy principle context is

1827
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:56,400
really a notion of actionability

1828
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,480
uh can i use

1829
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:01,360
what something means to guide my actions

1830
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,760
and my decision-making

1831
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,679
so

1832
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:09,360
this notion of a qrf

1833
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:14,440
becomes a notion of

1834
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:16,400
giving

1835
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:17,199
of

1836
01:14:17,199 --> 01:14:19,760
giving an outcome value that i obtain

1837
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:23,120
and write in memory comparability with

1838
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,360
other outcome values that i maintained

1839
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:28,239
and write in memory

1840
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:30,880
and we're very used to you know as human

1841
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,360
beings we have this incredibly

1842
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:35,199
complicated

1843
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:39,679
sensory and inferential apparatus

1844
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:40,880
that

1845
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,440
involves many many degrees of freedom

1846
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:45,760
and many many values that are

1847
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,800
distinguishable so i think if we want to

1848
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,880
think about something like

1849
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,960
the role of of reference frames in

1850
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:54,840
perception

1851
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:58,560
it's it's better to think in terms of

1852
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:01,920
something like e coli

1853
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,120
oh

1854
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:05,360
and

1855
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:09,120
so think of a much simpler kind of

1856
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:12,320
system that can measure fewer things

1857
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:15,040
right e coli can measure concentrations

1858
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:18,640
of salt and sugars of various kinds

1859
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:19,440
and

1860
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:22,239
those concentrations are meaningful to

1861
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,920
it

1862
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:26,320
those concentrations allow it to make

1863
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,239
decisions

1864
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:31,280
because its internal biochemistry

1865
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:35,519
assigns them an actionable meaning

1866
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:39,199
so

1867
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:42,719
chemotaxis in e coli works

1868
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,920
uh

1869
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,360
because the

1870
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:48,159
level of phosphorylation of a particular

1871
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:50,560
chemical

1872
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:53,520
remains reasonably constant that's the

1873
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:54,430
reference frame

1874
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:55,840
[Music]

1875
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:56,640
and

1876
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:00,239
concentration levels can be compared to

1877
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:02,199
each other as long as that

1878
01:16:02,199 --> 01:16:04,640
phosphorylation state remains reasonably

1879
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,320
constant that reference frame is

1880
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:07,600
meaningful

1881
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:10,640
and so chemotaxis makes sense

1882
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:14,159
because e coli has if you will a slow

1883
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:16,080
clock

1884
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:20,880
how the phosphorylation state of chi y

1885
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:24,080
uh that assigns that that confers

1886
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,920
meanings upon its outcomes

1887
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:30,320
so now we can spool back to what jim was

1888
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,840
saying about co-deployable reference

1889
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,800
frames of

1890
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,560
reference frames

1891
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:39,640
that i can use at the same time

1892
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:40,880
[Music]

1893
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,000
that i can

1894
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,199
obtain information from simultaneously

1895
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:46,800
have to commute

1896
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,719
this is what heisenberg's uncertainty

1897
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:51,280
principle is about

1898
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:52,320
oh

1899
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,480
and if i can't use them at the same time

1900
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,719
it's because they don't commute if i use

1901
01:16:56,719 --> 01:16:58,480
them in different orders i get different

1902
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,320
answers

1903
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,280
and

1904
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:03,920
what that means is that by switching

1905
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,679
reference frames

1906
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:08,400
i'm effectively changing

1907
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,199
the

1908
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:11,360
the calibration i'm effectively changing

1909
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,679
the meaning

1910
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:14,840
that i've

1911
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:19,440
assigned and uh i think

1912
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:22,480
a very beautiful place to see this uh is

1913
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:25,760
the paper a paper that we reference here

1914
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:29,679
uh from cervantes in zafra and zafrov

1915
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:32,239
called the snow queen experiment

1916
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:35,440
uh the paper's called uh snow queen is

1917
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,920
evil and beautiful

1918
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:40,239
i'll came out a few years ago

1919
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:41,199
and

1920
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:42,960
basically this paper is demonstrating

1921
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,120
quantum contextuality and human decision

1922
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,640
making

1923
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:50,239
and it's doing it by exploiting

1924
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:52,239
differences context dependent

1925
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:55,360
differences in the meanings of words

1926
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:58,640
so it's it's it's perfectly pointing out

1927
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:01,760
this relationship between meaning

1928
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,000
and co-deployability

1929
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,440
and hints and hence context dependence

1930
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,840
in human cognition so that's that's a

1931
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:13,840
paper i'd very much recommend reading

1932
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,560
thank you so much carl did you want to

1933
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,440
comment on that also

1934
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,320
yes

1935
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,640
i'm aware that stephen also the question

1936
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,880
but uh just to follow up on on

1937
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,040
um that um

1938
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,920
beautiful deconstruction um

1939
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:34,239
[Music]

1940
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:35,920
this is more of a question but i'm going

1941
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:39,679
to state it as an observation um this

1942
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:41,920
notion of

1943
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:45,280
the qrf as being fundamentally getting

1944
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:46,560
um

1945
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,679
measurements right or metrics right

1946
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:51,440
would be understood from the point of

1947
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:52,719
view of

1948
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:55,600
inference technically um

1949
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:59,440
as getting um an internally consistent

1950
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:00,560
metric

1951
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,560
correct and the metric we're talking

1952
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,719
about is a fisher

1953
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:08,960
information metric so um you if you look

1954
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:12,000
at all reading and writing or action and

1955
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,199
sensation from a classical perspective

1956
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:18,000
as just trying to minimize some

1957
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,640
divergence or some prediction error

1958
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,320
what you are saying is that you are

1959
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:25,280
trying to find an internally consistent

1960
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:28,000
metric in an information space

1961
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,040
um that makes sense of your active

1962
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:33,600
sampling querying the world

1963
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,400
um so it just sounded to me as if what

1964
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:39,040
chris was saying was exactly uh

1965
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:42,000
getting the measure the measuring stick

1966
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,320
at least behaving consistently you'll

1967
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:45,760
never know whether it's changing its

1968
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:47,840
length or not but at least if it behaves

1969
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:50,320
consistently in relation to what you can

1970
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:51,920
see of the world the way that you can

1971
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,480
query that world actively then that's

1972
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:57,120
good enough and that of course is is

1973
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,400
um

1974
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:01,120
one way of simply stating that the name

1975
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:04,239
of the game in active imprints is just

1976
01:20:04,239 --> 01:20:06,560
to minimize your prediction error where

1977
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,800
you are now reading prediction error

1978
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:12,400
as a kl divergence and of course the

1979
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,520
the information length or the amount the

1980
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:18,400
measurement of movement the metric is

1981
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,560
just a uh a path integral of

1982
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:23,199
infinitesimal changes in kl divergence

1983
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:25,280
so it's been from a mathematical

1984
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:27,360
perspective on the perspective of

1985
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,440
information geometries there's a

1986
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:32,719
beautiful link here between aligning

1987
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:36,000
your qrfs and getting your generative

1988
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,800
models right to make the most sense in

1989
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:42,400
the sense of minimizing or making as

1990
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:44,719
internally consistent as possible all

1991
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:47,840
your information metrics

1992
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,800
awesome thank you

1993
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,719
um before we go to stephen's question we

1994
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:56,320
have a question or two from the from uh

1995
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:59,600
ander aguirre in the live chat

1996
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:02,000
he asks does the existence of a

1997
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,719
holographic screen slash markup blanket

1998
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:06,880
automatically yield a statistical

1999
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,800
manifold for the belief state of the

2000
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:09,760
agent

2001
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,239
and is there a canonical renormalization

2002
01:21:12,239 --> 01:21:14,400
procedure for a quantum mechanical

2003
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:15,360
system

2004
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:17,360
if there is one how would the core

2005
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:19,679
screening translate into the statistical

2006
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:22,679
manifold

2007
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:36,639
oh i i can take one

2008
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:39,040
quack at that which is

2009
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:40,639
uh

2010
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:43,190
if i if i'm coarse graining something

2011
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:44,400
[Music]

2012
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:49,199
if if we think of this in terms of qrfs

2013
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:50,320
uh

2014
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:53,920
then i'm i'm deploying a different

2015
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:58,400
reference frame with lower resolution

2016
01:21:58,400 --> 01:21:59,440
so

2017
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:00,719
the

2018
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:04,159
in a sense what's being renormalized

2019
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:05,600
is

2020
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,679
my representation

2021
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:11,280
of the units

2022
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:14,000
that i use to distinguish states of the

2023
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,400
world

2024
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,000
so

2025
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,280
if if i have

2026
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:24,960
a meter stick

2027
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:25,760
uh

2028
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:28,719
that's made of stainless steel

2029
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:31,360
that has millimeters

2030
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:33,440
indicated on it

2031
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:34,960
then i can go around and make

2032
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:38,159
measurements in millimeters

2033
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:40,719
uh that if i coarse grain to a meter

2034
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:42,159
stick

2035
01:22:42,159 --> 01:22:45,440
that only has half centimeters indicated

2036
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:46,960
on it

2037
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:49,520
uh then i've lost a factor of five in

2038
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:52,400
resolution i've coarse grained by a

2039
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,639
factor of five

2040
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:57,199
and so i've i've in effect rounded off

2041
01:22:57,199 --> 01:23:00,000
all my outcome values

2042
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,239
and now my my

2043
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:05,679
function of comparing outcome values

2044
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:09,120
is is differently defined

2045
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:10,880
because it has to work at this lower

2046
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:13,520
resolution

2047
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:15,840
and if i want to

2048
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,320
compare my previous values to my later

2049
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:19,760
values

2050
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:22,159
i have to incorporate this explicit

2051
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:25,040
roundoff function into my comparison of

2052
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:29,519
values because i've changed my qrf

2053
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,040
so

2054
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:32,400
so

2055
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:35,839
coarse graining

2056
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:38,639
which which of course couples to scale

2057
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:39,840
changing

2058
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,679
uh from the very beginning of our

2059
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:44,480
conversation

2060
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:49,440
can be thought of as a transition from

2061
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:50,719
a

2062
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:52,400
a very

2063
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:56,960
a qrf with some grain size to a qrf for

2064
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:58,880
a similar degree of freedom with a

2065
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:01,199
different grain size

2066
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:04,639
uh and that has ripple effects

2067
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:05,840
uh

2068
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:08,719
through everything including the

2069
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:11,600
the free energy cost of memory

2070
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:14,239
right if i'm if i'm writing

2071
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:16,880
two-bit numbers into memory then that's

2072
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:18,880
a lot less expensive than writing

2073
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:21,840
five-bit numbers into memory

2074
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:22,719
so

2075
01:24:22,719 --> 01:24:24,560
um

2076
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:28,000
this raises the another aspect of this

2077
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:32,239
question of renormalization which is

2078
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:35,600
how does it influence

2079
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:38,159
how can i use it

2080
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:39,040
to

2081
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:42,480
solve the trade-off problems

2082
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:45,760
that arise if i'm an organism with a

2083
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:48,280
limited fuel supply which of course i am

2084
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:49,440
[Music]

2085
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,760
of going about the world

2086
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,679
trying to gather

2087
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:55,520
uh

2088
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,360
preferentially the gather the

2089
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,280
information that's going to be most

2090
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:04,320
useful to me at the lowest possible cost

2091
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:05,199
so

2092
01:25:05,199 --> 01:25:07,840
again we get back to this

2093
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:09,679
key

2094
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:11,199
issue

2095
01:25:11,199 --> 01:25:12,880
uh in

2096
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:15,920
in all of active inference of

2097
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:17,760
balancing of

2098
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:20,000
the risk of exploration against the

2099
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,800
reward of new information

2100
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:26,239
uh and coarse graining is is intimate to

2101
01:25:26,239 --> 01:25:27,600
that

2102
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:30,880
and it involves the choice i make of the

2103
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:33,440
tools that i'm going to use to make

2104
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,600
measurements

2105
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:39,120
and how that choice impacts

2106
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,920
my need to allocate computational

2107
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:44,080
resources and energy resources to what

2108
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:46,960
i'm doing too

2109
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:53,199
to the to the complex task of of getting

2110
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:55,280
new information while at the same time

2111
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:57,840
surviving

2112
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:01,679
awesome thanks

2113
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:03,520
daniel did you oh carl do you want to

2114
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:06,639
speak to that first

2115
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,520
perhaps stephen should ask but then i

2116
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:12,320
can come back to what just said yeah

2117
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:14,880
i'll um make a note and then carl would

2118
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,159
be great to have your response and then

2119
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:18,320
stephen's your question so to transpose

2120
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:21,520
it into statistical parametric mapping

2121
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:25,280
the true classics there's a mapping from

2122
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:28,719
the measured voxels which are being

2123
01:26:28,719 --> 01:26:31,280
defined by the resolution of the eeg or

2124
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:34,400
the fmri machine that's the holograph

2125
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:35,920
that's like what the experimental

2126
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:37,600
apparatus is providing is the

2127
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,600
measurements those are the o

2128
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,679
in our partially observable markov

2129
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:44,080
decision process it's the predicted

2130
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:45,840
value in the regression

2131
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:48,960
and that space you know if it's 128

2132
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:51,280
channels in the eeg and they're getting

2133
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:52,960
this sampling rate that is the state

2134
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:54,960
space that's being discussed and that's

2135
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:56,080
being

2136
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:58,639
transposed or mapped or connected to a

2137
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:00,159
different statistical space with

2138
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:01,760
different features

2139
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:04,960
and rather than the voxels there's like

2140
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:08,159
the mapping onto res else so carl that's

2141
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:09,920
why i'd appreciate if this is um true or

2142
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,360
not but those are the resolution

2143
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,760
elements and that it can be like a

2144
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:17,760
coarse graining and in that um stretch

2145
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,760
meter stick

2146
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:21,600
and different space

2147
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:24,400
there's a lot more statistical inference

2148
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,719
options available that are just not

2149
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:28,159
accessible at all

2150
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:31,120
from the um voxel

2151
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:33,600
coarse graining which is noisier and

2152
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,760
there's a signal enrichment in the

2153
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,360
coarse graining to the results that's

2154
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:40,400
appropriate and then that gets

2155
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:43,280
juxtaposed with the contrasts which is

2156
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:44,960
the experimental design of the

2157
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:46,400
scientists like you couldn't

2158
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:49,360
differentiate um a versus b category if

2159
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:51,679
you only tested a so the experimental

2160
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:53,280
design that's where like the statistics

2161
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:54,960
actually comes into play

2162
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:55,840
and then

2163
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:58,400
um just as chris said there's the

2164
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:00,400
organism with limited food supply and

2165
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:01,920
then there's like the scientists with

2166
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:02,960
limited

2167
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:05,199
time attention computer storage

2168
01:28:05,199 --> 01:28:06,639
processor time

2169
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:08,000
funding

2170
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,920
maybe seven billion people like he just

2171
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:12,239
there's plausibility and so that's where

2172
01:28:12,239 --> 01:28:14,800
this operational co-deployment

2173
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:17,120
connects with experimental design

2174
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:19,199
and so many of the patterns and

2175
01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:21,520
analogies exist in the purely classical

2176
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:23,840
domain of the parametric statistics like

2177
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:24,880
spm

2178
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:27,120
in the classical physics and the flow

2179
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:28,880
and the information flow area that's

2180
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:31,840
coming into play and also these more

2181
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:34,800
recent in quantum areas so carl would

2182
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:38,320
love to hear your thoughts on that

2183
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,560
yes of course i'm i'm mindful that

2184
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,320
stephen's still great

2185
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:45,760
but

2186
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:48,320
um perhaps i'll i'll speak to that and

2187
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:49,760
then um

2188
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:51,679
uh stephen can i ask a question but i

2189
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:53,760
think yes that i think

2190
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:54,560
you know

2191
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:56,400
these questions and daniel your

2192
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:59,040
responses are touching uh chris's

2193
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:00,320
attaching on something really

2194
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:03,199
fundamental so just to um answer the

2195
01:29:03,199 --> 01:29:04,239
question from the point of view of

2196
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:06,239
markov blankety yes it does

2197
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:07,760
automatically yield a statistical

2198
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:11,280
manifold or at least it looks as if

2199
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:13,840
there is a statistical manifold um if

2200
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:16,480
you can observe the uh the behavior of

2201
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:18,750
the thing that you are observing um

2202
01:29:18,750 --> 01:29:20,000
[Music]

2203
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,120
the second thing uh question um

2204
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:25,920
which we've been focusing on and

2205
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:28,480
the core screening i i i think that's a

2206
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:30,880
really fundamental thing i would um

2207
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:33,520
argue that not not to conflate too much

2208
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:35,440
the notion of renormalization which

2209
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:36,400
would be

2210
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:38,800
i think um

2211
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,639
more a question of how you get from one

2212
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:42,480
scale to another scale

2213
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,960
um with the notion of course grading

2214
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:46,800
which is which could be read just simply

2215
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:49,840
as a degree of quantization or choosing

2216
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:52,639
the right resolution element the right

2217
01:29:52,639 --> 01:29:55,199
um course grading of a given qrf at any

2218
01:29:55,199 --> 01:29:57,600
given scale you could argue that you

2219
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,920
could contextualize it but i think

2220
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:02,560
there's a there's a more fundamental um

2221
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:06,560
argument here um and that's um the

2222
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,639
argument that there will be

2223
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:11,440
from a statistical perspective an

2224
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:12,719
optimal

2225
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:15,760
core screening for any given um

2226
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:18,800
holographic screen or exchange

2227
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:22,239
over a markov blanket and that's the one

2228
01:30:22,239 --> 01:30:23,280
that

2229
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:25,920
statistically maximizes the marginal

2230
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,000
likelihood um

2231
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,800
which you could if you like

2232
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:32,800
relate to this sort of getting the

2233
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,800
measurements as internally consistent as

2234
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:37,360
possible maximizing the predictability

2235
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:39,600
of the next measurement you make that

2236
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:42,560
goes hand in hand with a maximization of

2237
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,760
the marginal likelihood or a

2238
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:45,760
minimization of the variational free

2239
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:47,520
energy

2240
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:49,679
that

2241
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:52,239
is important to remember because the

2242
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:53,920
marginal likelihood can always be

2243
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:57,199
expressed as accuracy minus complexity

2244
01:30:57,199 --> 01:30:58,800
where complexity

2245
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:01,440
scores the degrees of freedom you're

2246
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:04,000
burning up if you remember about the uh

2247
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,600
the the the

2248
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,679
the bits on the on the holographic

2249
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:10,320
screen you need energy um

2250
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:13,120
um to um to

2251
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:15,360
from a classical perspective represent

2252
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:18,000
and what that translates to in a very

2253
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,080
simple way in terms of probability

2254
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:22,080
distributions and functionals

2255
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:25,840
is in maximizing the marginal likelihood

2256
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:28,320
or the evidence for your

2257
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:32,000
aligned or model of the world you are to

2258
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,679
maintain a certain degree of accuracy

2259
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:35,199
trying to minimize complexity so you're

2260
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:37,600
using as few degrees of freedom your

2261
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,679
core screening to the extent you can get

2262
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:42,400
away with while maintaining an accurate

2263
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,560
account of the

2264
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:45,600
um

2265
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:48,400
of say the sensory states um or the

2266
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:50,560
perceptual space on your holographic

2267
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:52,000
screen

2268
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:52,880
and

2269
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:55,280
if you know um from the point of view of

2270
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:57,679
active inference just think about well

2271
01:31:57,679 --> 01:31:59,280
what would that sort of accuracy and

2272
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:01,520
complexity look like in terms of the

2273
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:03,360
consequences of action you get exactly

2274
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:05,040
what chris was talking about which was

2275
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:09,840
the um the expected uh complexity um

2276
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:13,520
being the risk usually and i mean risk

2277
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:15,679
in the sense of an economist or basin

2278
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:17,440
decision theorist it is literally

2279
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:19,520
mathematically the same thing

2280
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:22,320
the expected accuracy now becomes um

2281
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:24,320
you're a sort of um

2282
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:26,960
expected utility or the um

2283
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:30,400
the um expected uh log evidence the

2284
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:32,639
other the likelihood uh the expected

2285
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:34,880
likelihood that you would um get if you

2286
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:36,480
could if you committed to this kind of

2287
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,480
course screening so this course grading

2288
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:40,239
is absolutely fundamental it's really

2289
01:32:40,239 --> 01:32:42,239
interesting to go back to

2290
01:32:42,239 --> 01:32:44,320
um the

2291
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:47,520
all the sources where where

2292
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:50,480
the core screening uh starts to make a

2293
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:52,159
difference and i'm thinking here coming

2294
01:32:52,159 --> 01:32:55,120
back to daniel's uh notion of resolution

2295
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:57,280
elements you know you find this in sort

2296
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:59,040
of vena filtering you find in the match

2297
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:01,120
filtering theorem there is an optimal

2298
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:03,440
level of smoothing or blurring

2299
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:05,600
for any given kind of

2300
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,679
data about which you want to make an

2301
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:10,159
inference or you want to assimilate um

2302
01:33:10,159 --> 01:33:12,000
you see this um

2303
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:12,960
in

2304
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:15,360
formulations of universal computation

2305
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:17,679
that themselves are based upon solemn of

2306
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:20,000
induction that get you right back to

2307
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,719
kamalgarh complexity and compressibility

2308
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:25,120
so you see it in

2309
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:27,520
the drive that underwrites all

2310
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:31,199
formulations of universal computation

2311
01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:35,520
to maximize compression by minimizing

2312
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:37,760
the complexity of your of your message

2313
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,600
passing getting as efficient and as

2314
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:42,639
simple as you can and of course this

2315
01:33:42,639 --> 01:33:44,960
best way to make your account as simple

2316
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:47,440
as possible is to course grain it and i

2317
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:50,159
think you also see it in

2318
01:33:50,159 --> 01:33:53,600
the sort of the different levels of

2319
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:55,040
um

2320
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:57,800
cognition in psychology and in

2321
01:33:57,800 --> 01:34:01,120
neurophysiology in the sense that

2322
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:04,400
the higher level more efficient

2323
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,000
ways in which we

2324
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,080
align our qrfs or

2325
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:10,719
optimize our generative models always

2326
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:12,880
lead you to a very coarse grade

2327
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:16,400
quantization of the world so for example

2328
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:17,120
i

2329
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:19,840
um represent i am sure in my brain and

2330
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:22,480
some neural populations the fact that i

2331
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:25,360
am in my study i do not represent that

2332
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:26,560
in terms of

2333
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:30,000
very fine grained xyz coordinates down

2334
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,639
to the millimeter i represented no i'm

2335
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:34,880
in my study i carve the world

2336
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:37,840
at its joints and those joints

2337
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:40,400
basically demarcate the the kind of

2338
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:41,840
corresponding i bring to the bring to

2339
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:43,440
the table there are all sorts of

2340
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:45,440
arguments you can pursue here to to

2341
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:47,040
vindicate this is the very existence of

2342
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,800
receptive fields

2343
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:52,080
tiling a censorium in a way that is

2344
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:54,639
covered by discrete quantized receptive

2345
01:34:54,639 --> 01:34:57,040
fields tells you immediately that the

2346
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:59,119
way that the brain represents stuff on

2347
01:34:59,119 --> 01:35:01,520
the inside the if you could look at it

2348
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:04,000
through brain imaging

2349
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,560
is in this quantized fashion this course

2350
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:09,520
grained fashion and those that cause

2351
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:12,800
grainness and the size the deployment

2352
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,639
and the organization of those receptive

2353
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:16,800
fields has been optimized at many

2354
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:19,840
different temporal scales so

2355
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:22,080
i just give you a few takes on course

2356
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:23,520
grading or something absolutely

2357
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:25,760
fundamental to the structure of a

2358
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:27,119
generative model

2359
01:35:27,119 --> 01:35:31,199
or to the way that we um we align our

2360
01:35:31,199 --> 01:35:34,400
qrs to to make sense of

2361
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:36,880
of of the stuff on the holographic

2362
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:40,080
screen or at least when when we are

2363
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:42,400
when we are reading from that and sense

2364
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:45,360
making in that sense

2365
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:46,960
great

2366
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:49,119
thank you stephen did you want to ask

2367
01:35:49,119 --> 01:35:51,280
the question yeah thanks no this is

2368
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:53,600
really cool um it was going to come back

2369
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:57,360
a little bit to now in the past and um

2370
01:35:57,360 --> 01:36:00,159
the the idea that you mentioned about

2371
01:36:00,159 --> 01:36:02,639
the way that we interface

2372
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:04,639
or the assumptions of the interface then

2373
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:06,960
changes how we um

2374
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:10,159
we resolve the thing and the background

2375
01:36:10,159 --> 01:36:14,080
situation situatedness of that thing so

2376
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:17,360
and so it's like and so that could then

2377
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:19,040
also

2378
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:21,119
and this is the question in a way is how

2379
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:22,639
can that also

2380
01:36:22,639 --> 01:36:24,639
because if the way that that thing and

2381
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:27,520
the assumptions are made sets up

2382
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:29,679
like the meaning for influence the

2383
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:31,760
action policy selection

2384
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:34,560
and the way things are thought about

2385
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,080
how can that

2386
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:38,880
itself change the way the brain

2387
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:41,760
or the way that organisms look at the

2388
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:43,679
what things are

2389
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:45,679
for instance in

2390
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:47,920
the modern world we do see everything as

2391
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:50,320
things we carve things up we see things

2392
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:52,159
as separate like an individual is

2393
01:36:52,159 --> 01:36:53,199
separate

2394
01:36:53,199 --> 01:36:54,560
whereas if you go back to sort of

2395
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:56,800
indigenous approaches time for them was

2396
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:59,199
cyclical or followed

2397
01:36:59,199 --> 01:37:02,080
the river going down a hill or so there

2398
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:03,280
was a

2399
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:06,080
there was a complexity focus in a way it

2400
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:09,520
was almost like the mounting car

2401
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:11,040
problem of

2402
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:12,800
finding the landscape

2403
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:16,080
of meaning rather than defining

2404
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:17,360
the thing

2405
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:19,920
and what it is and carving it so i'm

2406
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:23,679
curious about is this how much is

2407
01:37:23,679 --> 01:37:26,159
the way that the the quantum reference

2408
01:37:26,159 --> 01:37:27,119
field

2409
01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:30,400
you know translated into thinking about

2410
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:32,080
what that thing is

2411
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:34,159
and how that you know compares to say

2412
01:37:34,159 --> 01:37:36,719
our western cognitive frames

2413
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:38,080
which kind of

2414
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:39,920
we measure everything because we can

2415
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:42,000
because basically we can control our

2416
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,400
environment so heavily we've we can make

2417
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:46,960
things very accurate whereas in the past

2418
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:49,360
it might have been you know the kalahari

2419
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:50,960
bushmen or the people in the middle of

2420
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:52,639
the amazon

2421
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:55,280
that somehow go with the landscape of

2422
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:56,960
complexity

2423
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:59,119
so that the way that

2424
01:37:59,119 --> 01:38:01,360
that is understood is going to be

2425
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:03,840
different so i'm just curious about

2426
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:08,520
how you think about that ways of knowing

2427
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:18,719
great question i wonder also if that

2428
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:21,360
ties into um

2429
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:23,360
the

2430
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:26,080
individuality of of temporal scales like

2431
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:28,960
you mentioned the the cyclical time and

2432
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:29,760
um

2433
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:32,320
back to franz's question maybe earlier

2434
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,080
about um

2435
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:36,320
how

2436
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:38,320
and a thing

2437
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:41,119
over time that stays a thing over time

2438
01:38:41,119 --> 01:38:43,440
scales with the scale of the time or

2439
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:45,760
with the cyclical nature of the time or

2440
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:48,239
it reminds me back of um when we had

2441
01:38:48,239 --> 01:38:50,719
chris and shawna here talking about like

2442
01:38:50,719 --> 01:38:52,800
flattening time maybe that was just

2443
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,639
shanna's talk

2444
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:57,360
but um yeah anyway i don't know do you

2445
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:59,360
guys anybody have any

2446
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:02,639
temporal comments

2447
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:05,119
just that there's an analogy to the

2448
01:39:05,119 --> 01:39:08,159
synchronization of clocks which is a

2449
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:11,199
huge part of computer science and of

2450
01:39:11,199 --> 01:39:12,480
quantum

2451
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,639
and other areas that question of

2452
01:39:14,639 --> 01:39:16,719
synchronizing clocks

2453
01:39:16,719 --> 01:39:19,360
seems to have some relationship to

2454
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:20,960
cognitive model

2455
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:22,639
not naive

2456
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:22,910
um

2457
01:39:22,910 --> 01:39:24,840
[Music]

2458
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:28,239
congruence in terms of synchronization

2459
01:39:28,239 --> 01:39:30,320
but in terms of

2460
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:33,280
like time zone coordination

2461
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:35,600
so if we're in the same time zone then

2462
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:37,360
there's a comparability but for

2463
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:38,880
cognitive states

2464
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,639
and so i think that will be something

2465
01:39:40,639 --> 01:39:42,239
awesome to explore

2466
01:39:42,239 --> 01:39:43,600
in

2467
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:46,080
next week's session and of course

2468
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:48,320
in the long run

2469
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:50,560
about what that kind of

2470
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:54,480
semantic and rhetorical and narrative

2471
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:58,239
alignment that isn't congruence

2472
01:39:58,239 --> 01:39:59,679
but reflects

2473
01:39:59,679 --> 01:40:01,840
a broader frame

2474
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:03,679
which actually the differences within

2475
01:40:03,679 --> 01:40:05,040
the frame

2476
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:06,639
are

2477
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:09,840
the search through that field

2478
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:12,000
thanks uh

2479
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,400
and in the interest of of temporal

2480
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:17,280
comments i think um maybe does everyone

2481
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:20,480
just want to go around and um you know

2482
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:22,639
give a final thought and maybe

2483
01:40:22,639 --> 01:40:24,800
an idea of what

2484
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:27,199
they would like to see in

2485
01:40:27,199 --> 01:40:28,560
next week's

2486
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:30,639
discussion and we will start with

2487
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:33,040
stephen

2488
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:35,520
yeah thanks

2489
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:37,520
lots of lots of interesting things i

2490
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:40,400
suppose i'm yeah curious about this the

2491
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:42,239
way that um

2492
01:40:42,239 --> 01:40:44,480
collapsing of

2493
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:47,199
the quantum reference frame might

2494
01:40:47,199 --> 01:40:49,199
scale differently or might the

2495
01:40:49,199 --> 01:40:52,880
assumptions that lead to the collapse

2496
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:53,760
could

2497
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:54,960
inform

2498
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:56,880
different scales of uh

2499
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:59,040
interactions and mixing and blending of

2500
01:40:59,040 --> 01:40:59,920
the

2501
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:01,840
behavior and uh

2502
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:02,639
yeah

2503
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:04,400
digesting a lot of stuff that's come up

2504
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:05,920
so yeah thank you for

2505
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:09,360
for the opportunity to talk to you

2506
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:13,520
awesome

2507
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:15,440
uh daniel anything you want to see

2508
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:19,239
happened next week

2509
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:21,920
we always think of the dot zero it's

2510
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:23,920
kind of like dropping into the skate

2511
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:25,920
park or the bathtub

2512
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:27,040
um

2513
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:29,920
and so that was like a microcosm of all

2514
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:31,840
the threads that get brought

2515
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:34,320
together and then in dot one i feel like

2516
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:36,560
we opened up so many

2517
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:38,400
areas of

2518
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:40,480
possible connection

2519
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:41,520
and

2520
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:44,400
so i'll just look forward to the

2521
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:47,119
second repeated measurement

2522
01:41:47,119 --> 01:41:49,840
of this semantic or

2523
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:52,080
regime of attention space

2524
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:54,719
and see how the continued interaction

2525
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:56,159
and engagement

2526
01:41:56,159 --> 01:41:57,920
updates our generative model pass the

2527
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:01,480
dot to even

2528
01:42:02,159 --> 01:42:04,080
awesome

2529
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:05,920
carl or chris do you want to give a

2530
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:08,239
thought about what you'd like to unpack

2531
01:42:08,239 --> 01:42:11,879
in the next discussion

2532
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:19,199
should i go first well chris thinks of

2533
01:42:19,199 --> 01:42:21,920
something very common to say um

2534
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:23,920
so it's probably all from from daniel to

2535
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:25,679
a certain extent uh stephen's question

2536
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:28,639
as well i'd like to hear about the

2537
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:30,800
principle of unitarity

2538
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:31,719
um

2539
01:42:31,719 --> 01:42:34,800
entanglement and um

2540
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:36,719
its relationship to this notion of

2541
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:39,440
synchronization and the mutual alignment

2542
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:42,239
of qrfs between things that are coupled

2543
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:44,560
so coming to

2544
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:45,520
the

2545
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:47,600
regimes of attention i i think that

2546
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:49,600
could be a very transparent link there

2547
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,040
in the sense that

2548
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:53,760
contextualizing your qrf i think for a

2549
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:55,280
cognitive neuroscientist would be

2550
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:57,679
getting your intentional set right and

2551
01:42:57,679 --> 01:43:01,280
possibly an implicit course grading

2552
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:02,960
that comes along with a particular

2553
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:05,520
attentional set um

2554
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:08,320
taking that that notion to

2555
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:10,639
attending to others and

2556
01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:12,480
synchronizing and communicating and

2557
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:15,360
living in a universe that is also

2558
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:17,920
composed of things like me

2559
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:20,960
um i think bring brings some fundamental

2560
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:22,800
questions about

2561
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:25,679
classically generalized synchronization

2562
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:29,760
quantum theoretically entanglement and

2563
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:31,679
enabling that entanglement in the right

2564
01:43:31,679 --> 01:43:35,280
kind of way um via aligning your qrs and

2565
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:37,679
getting the course grading right

2566
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:39,920
in sympathy with your partner so that

2567
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:41,119
i'd like to hear about the principal

2568
01:43:41,119 --> 01:43:43,440
unitarity entanglement and how it

2569
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:45,119
relates to classical notions of

2570
01:43:45,119 --> 01:43:47,920
communication mutual inference and

2571
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:50,880
generalized synchrony

2572
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:52,560
well thanks for stealing what i was

2573
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:55,040
gonna say

2574
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:56,400
um

2575
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:58,960
i i was also gonna say um how the

2576
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:01,679
there's one like the final concluding

2577
01:44:01,679 --> 01:44:03,280
part of the paper talks about how the

2578
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:05,920
fep is asymptotically the principle of

2579
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:08,080
unitarity and i i really would like to

2580
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:10,080
dive into that more and maybe any

2581
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:12,639
potential implications of that

2582
01:44:12,639 --> 01:44:14,880
and now chris gets the final and

2583
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:17,440
cleverest word

2584
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:19,920
uh okay this this won't be terribly

2585
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:21,520
clever uh

2586
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:23,119
what i was going to do

2587
01:44:23,119 --> 01:44:25,040
was to uh

2588
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:27,040
recommend uh

2589
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:30,080
a lovely paper by alexi grinbaum

2590
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:33,600
that we refer to in this paper

2591
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:35,840
and

2592
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:36,880
the

2593
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:39,119
the closing sentence of that paper is

2594
01:44:39,119 --> 01:44:42,880
that physics is really about languages

2595
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:45,119
and i think this ties in nicely to some

2596
01:44:45,119 --> 01:44:47,040
of the issues that stephen was raising

2597
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:48,960
in his last question which i found very

2598
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:50,239
interesting

2599
01:44:50,239 --> 01:44:51,840
about

2600
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:55,440
you know how how do conceptual schemes

2601
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:58,719
evolve at the cultural level

2602
01:44:58,719 --> 01:45:00,880
and

2603
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:06,320
i i i in hearing about uh

2604
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:08,560
the the whole issue of reference frame

2605
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:11,679
synchronization uh or or reference frame

2606
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:13,280
alignment and how that relates to

2607
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:14,480
entanglement

2608
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:16,320
this this really is a question about

2609
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:18,080
language

2610
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:19,040
and

2611
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:20,239
um

2612
01:45:20,239 --> 01:45:22,719
that that paper by alexei grinbaum i

2613
01:45:22,719 --> 01:45:24,719
think makes this point very very

2614
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:26,239
beautifully

2615
01:45:26,239 --> 01:45:28,639
uh so that that would be a nice thing to

2616
01:45:28,639 --> 01:45:30,800
look at at some point

2617
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:33,040
um

2618
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:34,719
let's see this is

2619
01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:38,000
that's probably a newer paper by him

2620
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,600
uh the one i was referring to is uh

2621
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:46,080
titled something like uh how device-free

2622
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:48,320
how device-independent methods change

2623
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:50,159
the nature of physical theory or

2624
01:45:50,159 --> 01:45:52,400
something like that it was published in

2625
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:53,600
uh

2626
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:55,360
studies in history and philosophy of

2627
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:57,040
science

2628
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:59,440
2017 or something like that

2629
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:03,519
okay anyway thank you very much for this

2630
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:06,480
yeah this was um

2631
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:08,400
very

2632
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:10,800
interesting and engaging

2633
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:12,800
and really appreciated everyone's

2634
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:15,760
participation and blues facilitation

2635
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:17,840
so we'll look forward to seeing anyone

2636
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:19,760
just drop in or out when it works for

2637
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:20,719
you

2638
01:46:20,719 --> 01:46:23,199
next week at the same time in number

2639
01:46:23,199 --> 01:46:24,840
40.2

2640
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:28,560
so until the next measurement

2641
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:31,800
thank you
