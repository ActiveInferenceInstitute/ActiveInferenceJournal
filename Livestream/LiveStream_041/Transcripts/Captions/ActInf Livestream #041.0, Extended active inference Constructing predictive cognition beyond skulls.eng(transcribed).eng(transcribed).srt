so welcome to the actin flab everyone

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,680
we're a participatory online lab that is

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,840
communicating learning and practicing

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,239
applied active inference you can find us

14
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,160
at some of the links here

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,160
this is a recorded and an archived live

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,000
stream so please provide us with

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,960

all backgrounds and perspectives are

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,280
welcome and we'll be following good

video etiquette for live streams

21
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,479
head over to

22
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,040

23
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,960
what is happening in act lab

24
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,000
we're here today in active stream number

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,640

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,600
so long ago

33
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,159
and this video is an introduction for

34
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,320
some of the ideas and some of the pieces

35
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,960
of the paper it's not a review or a

36
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,640
final word and the dot one is just

37
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,960
us getting excited and

38
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,439
doing our preparation so that the dot

39
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,280
one and the dot two the participatory

40
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,240
group discussions we can start to unpack

41
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,280
them

42
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,960
more

43
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,959
we're going to go over some aims and

44
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,800
claims keywords the abstract and the

45
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,480
roadmap of the paper

46
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,239
address the big question and then walk

47
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,840
through some of the figures and

48
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,160
formalisms and

49
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,640
the coming weeks we'll have

50
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,360
a.1.2

51
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,959
which of course are open to anyone who

52
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,200
wants to join

53
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,520
so we'll just begin by saying hello and

54
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,680
any thoughts we have

55
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,480
i'm

56
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,280
daniel i'm a researcher in california

57
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,680
and on the topic of distributed or

58
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,560
extended cognitive processes dean really

59
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,879
appreciated

60
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:41,760
co

61
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,680
stigmatically

62
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,840
extended in space and time collaborating

63
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,599
with you on the slides

64
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,959
um i loved your first pass on the slides

65
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,239
and it just

66
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,440
made me remark on how different it is um

67
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,959
to be involved in a distributed

68
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,040
cognitive process versus the kind that

69
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,440
can just play out in the quiet room

70
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,680
within the skull and that's like just

71
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,720
one example of what this whole paper and

72
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,519
extended mind extended cognitive area is

73
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,840
about is actually

74
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,159
among other things respecting those

75
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,599
kinds of processes and thinking about

76
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,760
how to frame them so that is obviously

77
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,519
something we'll be talking

78
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,120
about a lot more

79
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,440
over to you

80
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,599
hi uh my name is dean i'm up here in

81
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,599
calgary and i think what i really liked

82
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,120
about this paper

83
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,640
is

84
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,120
their ability to sort of say

85
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,319
um

86
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,840
there's some ways that we've been

87
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,760
looking at this question of how far does

88
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,519
the process

89
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,440
go and then there's

90
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,879
this paper

91
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,920
which introduces a new way of maybe

92
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,920
having a conversation around that they

93
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,760
talk about things like

94
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,879
uploading

95
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,599
uh entailing some of the more nascent

96
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,840
features of offloading and so

97
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,680
that to me

98
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,840
has the potential of morphing because

99
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,840
we've done a lot of morphology lately

100
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,599
from subject matter expertise to

101
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,560
prediction matter expertise if

102
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,519
somebody

103
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,439
can also hold up an egg and a chicken

104
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,519
for example so i'm kind of excited about

105
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,599
that

106
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,400
okay

107
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,519
excellent into the paper we go

108
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,798
so the paper link is provided here and

109
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,759
as stated it's from 2020.

110
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,600
um i'll just

111
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,560
uh

112
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,400
well why don't you summarize what you

113
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,000
felt some of the

114
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,280
key aims and claims were

115
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,639
uh

116
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,639
well i'll summarize aims you you can

117
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,960
summarize the claims for me the aim was

118
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,040
to be able to optimize organize

119
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,919
organisms generative models which

120
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,639
a cognitive niche construction

121
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,160
implies but these authors essentially

122
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,440
sort of

123
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,680
put that out there in a

124
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,080
they articulate that

125
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,440
it reviews generic predictive approaches

126
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,199
to niche construction

127
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,960
it takes

128
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,479
and looks at both the functional and the

129
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,440
psychological components of what

130
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,440
that active

131
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,160
generation of a cognitive niche might be

132
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,759
and then they argue for and i think this

133
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,160
is the critical bullet an extended

134
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,600
active inference henceforth e a i based

135
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,520
on our model of cognitive niche

136
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,080
construction so there's a model within

137
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,759
the modeling universe

138
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,320
this is theirs

139
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,600
excellent yes as we'll explore

140
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,720
they aim towards reconciling some of the

141
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,360
functional and grounded and embodied

142
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,120
aspects of what is known as the

143
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,919
cognitive niche with some of the

144
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,240
essentially metaphysical in the sense

145
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,840
that they're not as embodied they're

146
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,039
like purely cognitive features of or

147
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,039
psychological features of the cognitive

148
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,120
niche so that's kind of where they aim

149
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,440
and yes they aim for a synthesis

150
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,160
reflected in the eai idea

151
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,680
so some of the

152
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,039
claims in

153
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,639
the paper so these are things where it's

154
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,120
like you could ask whether these are

155
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,840
valid assertions or assumptions

156
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,400
cognitive niche construction which again

157
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,479
they're thinking of in a functional and

158
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,919
psychological sense

159
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,160
is the process whereby organisms create

160
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,000
and maintain cause effect models of

161
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,240
their niche as guides for fitness

162
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,639
influencing behavior so it's kind of

163
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,639
like extended autopoesis

164
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,479
self-maintenance but not just at the

165
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,199
level of the epithelia like a cognitive

166
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,479
boundary

167
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,080
extended mind theory claims that

168
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,080
cognitive processes extend beyond the

169
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,479
brain to include predictable states the

170
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,759
world

171
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,039
statistical

172
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,440
regularities in the generative process

173
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,080
and how to leverage those processes

174
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,360
active inference and predictive

175
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,479
processing in cognitive science assume

176
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,880
that organisms embody predictive

177
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,199
which is generative models of the world

178
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,039
optimized by standard cognitive

179
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,080
functions

180
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,160
like perception action learning and so

181
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,120
putting

182
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,360
different cognitive features on common

183
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,759
grounding

184
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,840
those are some of the

185
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,840
aims and claims of the paper

186
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,479
let's see how they get there

187
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,280
here's a few of the keywords that were

188
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,360
in the paper active inference

189
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,560
affordances

190
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,880
capacities for action availabilities for

191
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,080
action

192
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,919
cognitive niche construction which we'll

193
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,840
go into a lot more

194
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,319
ecological psychology

195
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,520
which is

196
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,880
something that's been around for decades

197
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,440
it's about breaking the psyche out of

198
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,960
the skull

199
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,520
and that's very related to extended mind

200
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,759
and then predictive processing and this

201
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,400
sort of anticipatory perspective

202
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,319
and the real time signal processing

203
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,080
action loop all these things that are

204
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,039
like

205
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,120
active by another word or kind of like

206
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,280
the latent

207
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,919
proto-active threads that um are brought

208
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,759
together here

209
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,039
anything to add on keywords

210
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,080
no

211
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,960
no

212
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,199
okay i'll read the abstract and then you

213
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,840
can feel free to give a thumb

214
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,440
cognitive niche construction is the

215
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,280
process whereby organisms create and

216
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,120
maintain cause effect models of their

217
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,520
niche as guides for fitness influencing

218
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,800
behavior

219
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,479
extended mind theory claims that

220
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,319
cognitive processes extend beyond the

221
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,160
brain to include predictable states of

222
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,199
the world

223
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,400
active inference and predictive

224
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,240
processing and cognitive science assume

225
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,639
that organisms embody predictive ie

226
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,800
generative models of the world optimized

227
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,039
by standard cognitive functions eg

228
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,958
perception action learning

229
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,120
this paper presents an active inference

230
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,958
formulation that views cognitive niche

231
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,200
construction as a cognitive function

232
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,440
aimed at optimizing organisms generative

233
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,559
models

234
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,720
we call that process of optimization

235
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,160
extended active inference

236
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,360
what do i think what do i think about

237
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,320
that i i think of it from the from the

238
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,760
view of

239
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,000
a professional setting as an example of

240
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,600
an environment

241
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,200
and how that professional setting

242
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,800
traditionally is

243
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,800
not necessarily seeing

244
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,120
the agents within it like

245
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,760
we sometimes consider the internalities

246
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,120
within the epithelial

247
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,959
limits

248
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,000
but

249
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,480
we very much depend on those things

250
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,640
functioning correctly so

251
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,680
this kind of opens up a little

252
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,279
tiny portal into how our imaginations

253
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,080
might

254
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,560
be able to sort of um

255
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,279
access them

256
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,240
it makes me think about like the

257
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,839
professional setting

258
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,000
the professional niche

259
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,320
is that something that's just reflected

260
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,720
in the skull of the expert or the

261
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,959
professional as a person

262
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,959
or is the setting something that's

263
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,880
distributed where

264
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,120
it wouldn't be possible to locate or

265
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,519
focalize it within the skull of any

266
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,360
individual

267
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,519
while also recognizing for example that

268
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,480
um a lesion inside of the skull of a

269
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,320
person in a professional setting would

270
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,440
change it so we don't need to like deny

271
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,200
brain functionalism

272
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,160
to have an extended yes and approach to

273
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,040
cognitive systems so what are we going

274
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,440
to find to have when we go down that way

275
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,720
um well here's some of the signposts

276
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,160
along that way

277
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,920
this is their roadmap how they get from

278
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,120
discussing previous work in the extended

279
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,279
mind and cognitive niche area towards

280
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,440
their concept of extended extended

281
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,959
active inference

282
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,440
the introduction covers some of the core

283
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,800
background concepts like cognitive niche

284
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,360
active inference and the extended mind

285
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,720
they then kind of lay out where they're

286
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,519
going to go in section two the

287
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,440
functional and psychological niches

288
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,040
under active inference

289
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,760
they partition or delineate different

290
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,680
ways of thinking about the cognitive

291
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,279
niche into a psychological and a

292
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,040
functional component and then present a

293
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,720
case study

294
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,360
um there's also figures that we'll walk

295
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,880
through and

296
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,959
through the presentation of this

297
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,600
disambiguation of cognitive niche and

298
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,079
case study in connection to the active

299
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,480
inference models they present

300
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,600
extended active inference eai

301
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,920
and then discuss several features or

302
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,959
aspects of eai like the parity principle

303
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,720
which we'll come back to of course

304
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,640
functional isomorphisms epistemic

305
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,800
actions and diachronic cognition under

306
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
eai

307
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,360
anything to add on the roadmap

308
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,880
no i'll let's get the big question here

309
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,600
go for the big question

310
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,880
okay i'll just read it off the slide

311
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,240
here the set of questions that fall

312
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,440
within our scope relates to the

313
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,360
computational function of cognitive

314
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,160
extensions and the developmental and

315
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,240
intergenerational so we're going to talk

316
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,079
about a little bit of a temporal thing

317
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,560
here process whereby this computational

318
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,279
function emerges given

319
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,279
the on the cognitive niche is sometimes

320
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,120
studied as a psychological habitat

321
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,440
refers to the set of organisms niche

322
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,120
relations

323
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,639
that offer organisms relevant

324
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,880
affordances

325
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,800
and two the cognitive niche is sometimes

326
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,880
studied as a functional habitat refers

327
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,480
to the set of resources that support

328
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,519
species specific tasks

329
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,839
that's the behavior angle then this

330
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,880
means that one must define the

331
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,560
functional habitat on the background of

332
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,600
the organism's phenotypic dispositions

333
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
this is where daniel's expertise can

334
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,519
step in for example books are part of

335
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,959
the functional habitats of humans

336
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,120
because of humans ability to read

337
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,399
but they're not part of the beaver's

338
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,160
functional habitat unless of course the

339
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,000
beaver wants to include it as part of

340
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,120
their

341
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,200
environmental structure which

342
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,120
if they're an imaginal beaver maybe they

343
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,839
do

344
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,120
the psychological and functional

345
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,880
habitats can be part of the same overall

346
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,480
physical habitat

347
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,160
my question then was how then do

348
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,720
cognitive extensions exist we're not

349
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,399
answering that today

350
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,920
but we're parking that for future

351
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,560
conversation

352
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,480
there's a famous quote in biology

353
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,639
nothing makes sense except in the light

354
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,399
of evolution and a million other

355
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,800
mutations on that and we've talked about

356
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,519
eco evo devo in biology like the

357
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,279
importance of thinking holistically

358
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,200
about ecology and evolution and

359
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,760
development processes that entail

360
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,440
different mechanisms and play out over

361
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,320
different scales to influence phenotype

362
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,160
as studied

363
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,600
and

364
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,040
what i see

365
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,480
here is

366
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,240
ecology

367
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,639
which has been dancing with cognition

368
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,440
that's the ecological cognitive area

369
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,360
ecological psychology

370
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,279
then there's developmental

371
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,120
psychology

372
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,800
of course how does learning happen and

373
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,760
then there's evolutionary psychology and

374
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,600
any of those fields people can take or

375
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
leave but it's almost like we're going

376
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,320
to

377
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,199
um

378
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,800
dissolve those

379
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,240
couplets

380
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,720
into just eco evo and devo pull them

381
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,959
away from the cognition from

382
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,560
developmental ecological and

383
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,480
evolutionary cognition

384
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,920
and then like

385
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,240
bring it all back together so no one's

386
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,320
denying that humans don't read books or

387
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,160
that beavers don't make a damn or

388
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,560
anything like that so what are we really

389
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,959
getting at here it's a different way to

390
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,399
recombine and

391
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,920
reframe

392
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,839
how we think about

393
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,320
cognition and ecology

394
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,680
can i just add one thing to that because

395
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,800
that's that's

396
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,079
thank you

397
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,040
a decade and even two two decades ago

398
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,560
there's a real push of real

399
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,040
philosophical um

400
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,279
density forming around the idea of

401
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,959
hands-on science

402
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,519
but this questions what can we get our

403
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,720
hands on

404
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,639
because if again if you want to simplify

405
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,160
it let's just say oh if we give

406
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,480
everybody a chance to

407
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,279
touch the beaver kit that will somehow

408
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,959
change their understanding of beaver

409
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,079
behavior

410
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,040
um what you just described says know

411
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,240
what that will give us is an

412
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,920
understanding of

413
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,240
the the direction that their fur

414
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,680
um all seems to set up as right so

415
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,360
again we have to be careful that we

416
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,839
don't come up with these oh

417
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,680
here's here's the way to solve all of

418
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,519
these really complex issues

419
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,399
the hands-on example also um

420
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,600
it made me think about how you could

421
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,760
still have a very brain-based approach

422
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,680
to thinking about hands-on cognition

423
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,680
some could say it's been shown that when

424
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,079
there's multi-sensory engagement that

425
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,480
the learner updates their cognitive

426
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,959
model more rapidly so multi-sensory

427
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,360
learning or experience driven learning

428
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,440
is more engaging for science it keeps

429
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,199
people in the game longer they learn the

430
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,560
concepts better

431
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,399
absolutely that is still within the

432
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,839
individual

433
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,480
intra skull paradigm

434
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,600
but it starts moving into the periphery

435
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,360
and the parry personal space

436
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,839
and it's like

437
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,759
is this extended cognitive process

438
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,639
aren't the hands always on something or

439
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,240
i'm sure there's right now are they

440
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,440
literally

441
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,079
are they on are they on an abstraction

442
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,399
that's the big question right so yeah it

443
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,560
gets really interesting in a hurry it's

444
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,959
if you want to take a a quantum bike

445
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,959
ride with chris fields

446
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,519
you got to be able to explain how that

447
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,720
how that works so

448
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,680
another piece i just can't help but it's

449
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,720
from the academic textbook

450
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,880
i can't help myself

451
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,839
i have a new car i have to drive it

452
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,040
um

453
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,839
this is on the first page of the preface

454
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,519
to illustrate the simplicity of active

455
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,959
inference and what we are trying to

456
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,199
explain place your fingertips gently on

457
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,279
your leg keep them there motionless for

458
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,600
a second or two now does your leg feel

459
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,880
rough or smooth

460
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,480
if you had to move your fingers to

461
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,839
events a feeling of roughness or

462
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,120
smoothness you have discovered a

463
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,199
fundament of active inference to feel is

464
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,680
to palpate to see is to look to hear is

465
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,639
to listen

466
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,040
so if you can't with your hands on with

467
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,240
a finger on

468
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,000
if the pants don't have a feeling of

469
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,600
smoothness or roughness

470
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,760
except for as a function

471
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,520
of action

472
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,400
what are we handling grasping

473
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,760
comprehending

474
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,039
right with cognitive

475
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,160
things

476
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,119
right

477
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,720
that that whole niche development thing

478
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,799
which we're going to get into today

479
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,439
all right awesome so cognitive niche

480
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,039
section 111.

481
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,039
do you want to give a first summary on

482
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,520
any parts you think are important well i

483
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,120
i'm going to just read some of the stuff

484
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,440
from the paper itself i i threw a few

485
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,600
references in here as well but

486
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,360
i mean cognitive science a form of

487
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,000
instrumental intelligence

488
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,720
uh to be into devore if i hope i'm

489
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,240
pronouncing that correctly create and

490
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,160
maintain cost effect models of the world

491
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,760
as guides

492
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,240
for prejudging which courses of action

493
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,640
will lead to which results

494
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,320
we've had a few conversations about

495
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,720
guides in the in the new year 2022 so

496
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,280
that was i thought that was interesting

497
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,200
residues in the environment act as cues

498
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,960
and prompts

499
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,799
concept development niche

500
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,520
as where and when your genes are act

501
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,320
given the epigenetic epigenetic envelope

502
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,840
over

503
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,360
niche as genetic information inherited

504
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,840
i thought that that that made a clear

505
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,600
differentiation

506
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,520
uh the concept of cognitive

507
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,200
cognitive niche that we're referring to

508
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,080
here is a sort of hybrid again i love

509
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,520
this

510
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,679
between the concepts of the selected

511
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,760
developmental and cognitive niches

512
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,320
this paper questions

513
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,400
this paper's questions fall under

514
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,600
that which conceptual function emerges

515
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,960
comp sorry computational function

516
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,799
emerges

517
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,559
um

518
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,720
so the so bottom line is they say that

519
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,240
there are there are

520
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,160
things in the

521
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,039
in the timeline of the environment

522
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,240
which

523
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,559
are passed along

524
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,280
so how do we explain that

525
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,440
through

526
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,799
a lot of different ways but active

527
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,280
inference in particular and so that's

528
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,080
what this is about and so again i threw

529
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,480
a a couple of different ways in terms of

530
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,120
explaining the cognitive load aspect of

531
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,039
that like why would we

532
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,080
download or offload or upload into the

533
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,320
environment and why would the next

534
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,880
generation necessarily be able to pick

535
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,320
up on that

536
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,480
through some sort of pointing or signal

537
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,280
signaling effort

538
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,880
what were you getting at with

539
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,679
the cognitive niche for enabling

540
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,200
somebody to learn and apply active

541
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,679
inference and about how that relates to

542
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,320
professional or other settings inside

543
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,960
and outside of academia

544
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,280
well the enabling part is what i was

545
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,240
really wondering about so how is is that

546
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,200
set up

547
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,160
is there a set the condition for that or

548
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,240
are what they describing here as is

549
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,440
something

550
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,880
variant

551
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,080
retained

552
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,640
meaning condition set

553
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,320
right because there's always a tendency

554
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,640
to want to say okay well things are too

555
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,039
complicated so let's focus on

556
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,559
x

557
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:17,360
right

558
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,679
and that was my essentially what my

559
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,720
question was here is is the

560
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,400
interdisciplinary question satisfied

561
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,559
by organizing along chapters and subject

562
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,679
areas because we just don't want to

563
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,320
overload people right i mean we get why

564
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,880
we do it there's a reason for it and

565
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,000
that's what they're talking about here

566
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,520
there's a reason why

567
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,039
there are tracks laid down in the

568
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,400
environment that can help guide the next

569
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,720
passing passer through right but the

570
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,159
bottom line is

571
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,120
um

572
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,679
is the constructionism aspect of this

573
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,280
mechanics part of it

574
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,679
the default or functional enhancement

575
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,919
outside of the academic niche like when

576
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,080
you get out of school

577
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,200
what do you do

578
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,000
do you necessarily follow the same

579
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,840
patterns that you do in school

580
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,000
how does a bridge to uncertainty as a

581
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
metaphor change the nature from

582
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,120
explanatory to exploration and back

583
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,039
so when we go out into the world and

584
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,440
then come back into academia how does

585
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,600
that change our perception of the

586
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,320
structures that academia places down to

587
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,480
make sure that we get to certain

588
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,520
outcomes relative to the variance that

589
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,679
still exists out there in the greater

590
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,679
space

591
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,480
makes me think of uh paths in a forest

592
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,840
and it's like

593
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,039
is

594
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,720
within a generation

595
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,280
or between generations

596
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,559
are we trying to pass down the path

597
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,440
or are we passing down a healthy forest

598
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,679
where wayfinding can happen

599
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,400
and it's like well i paved the path and

600
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,200
i removed all the brambles from it

601
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,919
where's the forest now because in order

602
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,679
to make that path stabilized

603
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,640
the functional niche had to actually

604
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,200
change and so that

605
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,880
um shows how like the cognitive and the

606
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,120
functional niche start to have interplay

607
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,559
over these multiple

608
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,000
time scales

609
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,960
yep

610
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,840
all right great

611
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,360
1.1.2 here's where they uh

612
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,120
introduce the concept of active

613
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,360
inference

614
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,679
what parts did you pull out on the left

615
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,919
side like what text pieces did you find

616
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,240
important

617
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,080
well before we get about before we talk

618
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,919
about starting and pronging yeah no i

619
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,840
just highlight where i thought it was

620
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,360
kind of interesting is if you just read

621
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,320
the stuff that's um fonted in red

622
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,159
you have to entertain there's a

623
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,640
probabilistic relationship we have to

624
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,720
think of this not just over a single

625
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,080
time frame but

626
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,799
over as you said over pulse possible

627
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,080
inference probability and modeling

628
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,600
time frames um what's entailing what

629
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,200
when we're talking through the active

630
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,559
inference lens

631
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,760
transitions amongst causes

632
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,880
interesting so processes of processes

633
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,840
um

634
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,520
the updating piece

635
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,039
right and so

636
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,159
again

637
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,240
the the starting the procking thing all

638
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,640
i did wanted to do is in that section of

639
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,039
the paper say here's an example in in

640
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,520
the in the wild

641
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,080
where we could identify each one of the

642
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,000
aspects that they were talking about in

643
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,640
this section of the paper

644
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,880
and you had listed a few

645
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,039
um functions or a few

646
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,640
as here and then i added a few more

647
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,240
and i think it just reflected how

648
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,760
there's

649
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,039
always a plurality of answers to the y

650
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,400
question

651
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,000
in biology

652
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,080
we have tim bergen's for whys and we

653
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,880
have

654
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,480
different time scales and whether the

655
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,240
proximate or the ultimate cost all this

656
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,679
stuff that we've talked about other

657
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,760
times and then just even within the

658
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,679
active perspective

659
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:00,559
why

660
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,360
do these animals do this jumping

661
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,559
behavior

662
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,840
and

663
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,840
how does active inference help us think

664
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,320
about that kind of behavior like it's a

665
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,799
signal to itself about its bodily

666
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,559
integrity and its coherence in its

667
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,000
capacity

668
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,880
it's a signal to other entities like

669
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,240
itself like other con specifics for

670
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,880
example an early warning system for a

671
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,080
predator

672
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,600
it also

673
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,880
has been brought up

674
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,400
in the literature that this is actually

675
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,120
uh honest and costly signal to the

676
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,159
predator

677
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,039
like

678
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,039
look at me jump and play you think

679
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,480
you're going to get me that's absurd go

680
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,400
after somebody who's not jumping and

681
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,440
playing

682
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,240
um

683
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,400
and then there's so many other ways like

684
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,120
to think about it and those are

685
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,559
things that you could disambiguate you

686
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,640
might be able to design and experiment

687
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,960
or a professional setting to reduce your

688
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,200
uncertainty or to

689
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,679
engineer and scaffold

690
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:58,960
something

691
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,279
but once you get

692
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,919
this deer in the lab

693
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,120
on the trampoline in the vr headset with

694
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,559
the predators approaching from both

695
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:09,840
sides when that doesn't happen in the

696
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,039
wild

697
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,440
what are you actually studying

698
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,200
right

699
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,799
i like the last bullet too because it

700
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:17,760
could be

701
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,440
pronounced as way updating or way up

702
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,720
dating

703
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,640
so i mean anytime we and i i i i hope

704
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,799
people appreciate that it could

705
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:29,919
literally

706
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,039
literally

707
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,440
be interpreted both ways and that's what

708
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,520
i think is kind of fascinating about

709
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,799
this paper

710
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,480
is that inversion

711
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,640
in our minds of what so what is that

712
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,520
just put placing the emphasis

713
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,840
reinforces two very different concepts

714
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,158
yes

715
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,480
and to close this set of introductory

716
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,880
concepts the cognitive niche active

717
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,360
inference and we get to the extended

718
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,600
mind concept so

719
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,679
what pieces did you find relevant here

720
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,919
and what did you pull out of the text

721
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,440
itself and associated citations

722
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,960
well just for me it was an affirmation

723
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,320
of what i've been thinking about for a

724
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,720
long time that the idea of

725
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,600
saying

726
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,760
something is something is contained in

727
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,200
your skull and and shall no further pass

728
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,799
doesn't get answered just because we can

729
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,240
communicate back and forth to one

730
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,240
another there's probably a lot more

731
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,679
evidence in the larger environment if

732
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:32,720
you

733
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,799
take the time to look for it and it

734
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,480
doesn't always necessarily cause issues

735
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,880
in terms of what you

736
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,520
can or or can't

737
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,039
imagine

738
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,520
so those images out there

739
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,640
are

740
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,520
are collective and so do we always come

741
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,600
at it from the perspective of

742
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,279
we're making connections because there

743
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,760
are associations and we get that but is

744
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,720
there an uploading aspect of this that

745
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,400
quite literally in in the in the

746
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,360
community can look like a museum

747
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,960
right so

748
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,840
these these ways of being able to

749
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,120
understand what's happening

750
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,080
have other ways than what has

751
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,919
traditionally been thought of as here's

752
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,360
where something ends

753
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,799
and something else

754
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,279
begins

755
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,559
one piece i thought was interesting

756
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,120
this is kind of a classic modern example

757
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,799
of extended minds

758
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,200
so they discuss

759
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,679
reliable access to external states the

760
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,240
niche eg the cell phone that functions

761
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,320
as an extended memory

762
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,440
for recalling phone numbers

763
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,760
okay how about when those are your cloud

764
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,039
contacts and now that phone is pinging a

765
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,600
global communications network

766
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,799
so again no one is denying that an

767
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,200
entity can take an action that triggers

768
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,039
computational events and

769
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,120
cognitive events to occur around the

770
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,840
world and beyond sending those signals

771
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,399
off into wherever so

772
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,200
what are we actually

773
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,279
discussing what is extended relative to

774
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,080
what again reifying the epithelial

775
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,080
boundary and saying well it's extended

776
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,159
relative to the epithelial boundary but

777
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,159
isn't this about updating our priors to

778
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,159
think about cognition in a more extended

779
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,039
way

780
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,559
so then

781
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,080
why do the sort of straw person version

782
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,919
of epithelial individualist

783
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,760
brain-centered cognition

784
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,919
and then posit extended cognition as a

785
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,159
contrast from that like what is the real

786
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:37,919
positivist

787
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,159
um or positive

788
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,120
claim

789
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,840
in extended

790
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,960
cognition and there's a lot of

791
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,039
interesting citations here back through

792
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,720
the decades and

793
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,919
people have been talking about the stuff

794
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:50,960
for a very

795
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,039
long time so that'll be a cool like

796
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,120
thread to draw on yeah

797
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,480
yeah what's interesting is i've had

798
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,520
conversations with sweller and gins

799
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,919
back you know like 15 years ago

800
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,679
about this whole question of what is

801
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,840
cognitive overload and one of my one of

802
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,480
my favorite references is lucy sukeman's

803
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,799
the human machine interface where her

804
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,720
her book is essentially set up as a case

805
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,000
study around

806
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,080
people encountering

807
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,880
the

808
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,640
photocopy machine

809
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,159
and

810
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,200
what exactly transpires there as as an

811
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,200
extended mind because there's people

812
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,840
that have sort of built the photocopy

813
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,720
machine in the hopes that it becomes

814
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,399
intuitive

815
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,120
but as she points out in a reference

816
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,039
well that's

817
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,720
that's in the eye of the beholder that's

818
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,200
in the person who has to key in their

819
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,440
passcode and then

820
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,760
try to try to determine of course the

821
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,440
person who's actually built a photocopy

822
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,159
machine try to determine how each one of

823
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,000
those individuals with each separate

824
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,559
passcode necessarily

825
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,080
believes that their mind is being

826
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,640
extended so that they don't have to

827
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,960
you know as stephen used to do make

828
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,039
another copy and make another copy and

829
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,360
make another copy right so there's a

830
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,600
there's a lot in this

831
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,399
and

832
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,120
it's it can't always be

833
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,520
reduced down to

834
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,960
an assumption around

835
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,720
a particular order of steps that will

836
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,200
just naturally seem

837
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,440
present to the person who now has their

838
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,120
hand available

839
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,520
and and a screen from which they can

840
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,600
select a number of options but still

841
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,000
can't get what inside of their head they

842
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,039
want

843
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,760
in terms of that version or that format

844
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,760
so anyway it's

845
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,159
i love the extended mind concept but now

846
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,120
how how do we employ it in such a way

847
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,799
that it be actually is something

848
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,559
available as opposed to just theoretical

849
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,720
it makes me think of playing pool or

850
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,559
billiards so in the extended desire to

851
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,240
move the ball from one area to another

852
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,760
like you use a q and it's like

853
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,440
transducing mechanical force and then

854
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,679
that force is transmitted to the um ball

855
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,279
that you strike and that has all these

856
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,600
outcomes in the board

857
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,600
what is the pool cue

858
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,440
but these increasingly abstract

859
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,080
processes we talk about the grip and the

860
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,760
embodied performance the skilled

861
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,159
performance of playing pool and all of

862
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,279
those aspects and again how do we talk

863
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,559
about epistemic grip and we're extending

864
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,799
not just into the functional niche so

865
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,320
like the real phenotypic substrates but

866
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,080
when we start thinking about as the

867
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,840
authors reminded us

868
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,919
of selective developmental and cognitive

869
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,080
niches this is like

870
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,880
apples and oranges and kale chips over

871
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,039
different time scales it's not just

872
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,880
counting how many pieces of fruit are on

873
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,840
the table these are different nested

874
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,320
interacting and even types

875
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,880
of things so how do we keep all of that

876
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,960
on the menu

877
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,200
and still

878
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,320
do

879
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,679
yeah and you introduced with the pool

880
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,279
cue a field thing

881
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,080
which is in zukman's

882
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,760
reference she talks about feel thing

883
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,240
it's not just the touching of a screen

884
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,559
there's a huge feel component to this

885
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,120
that's often left out but can't be if

886
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,480
we're talking about extending our minds

887
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,600
it makes me think about putting the

888
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,600
chalk on the tip of the queue and that

889
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,760
helps the pool tip

890
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,480
um make grip with the ball better

891
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,120
but you wouldn't put the the blue chalk

892
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,000
on

893
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,960
you know

894
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,720
your feet on the ground like the way

895
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,640
that they grip the ground is different

896
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,399
than how the extended

897
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,399
cognitive apparatus gets a grip and

898
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:35,360
that's like where we see a lot of

899
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,360
challenges in programming somebody with

900
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,440
skill and programming goes well of

901
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,519
course that's not going to work because

902
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,760
like to get a grip on this process this

903
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,600
program needs the api call to look like

904
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,440
this and then it can get a handle it can

905
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,480
get a web hook it can make this call so

906
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,159
that on the other side of the phone the

907
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,120
right other program calls back but

908
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,720
here's the other person still you know

909
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,880
shining their shoe with the blue chalk

910
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,559
and wondering why the billiards not

911
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:03,519
going the right direction

912
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,159
okay

913
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,279
perfect here we get to their outline and

914
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,840
argument so

915
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,120
what would you say is important about

916
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,440
what they wrote here with all of these

917
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,360
different cues that we have annotated

918
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,519
and added into the text

919
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,080
well what i appreciate is that there

920
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,679
in order to be able to introduce the

921
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,760
concept of uploading which we'll get to

922
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,519
here they're basically saying so

923
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:32,960
and i don't want to put words in the

924
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,720
author's mouths but in

925
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,880
my interpretation of what i read was

926
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,279
this is why it's taking so long

927
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,960
because they're going to cut into a a

928
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,200
time a temporal piece to this eventually

929
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,279
anyway and and

930
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,640
rather than read all of the of the uh

931
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,640
highlighted parts that i i dragged out

932
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,600
i'll let you

933
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,760
maybe you want to talk about the things

934
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,120
that you think

935
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,200
for the point one and point two

936
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,120
we might wanna spend a little bit more

937
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,120
time on i'd like when you're done i'd

938
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,880
like to talk about stuff in the on the

939
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,519
right-hand side of the page

940
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,360
excellent just a few pieces that would

941
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,879
be cool to unpack would be salience and

942
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,079
attention

943
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:15,119
and ascent of cues in communication

944
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,159
and how sometimes cues can be transient

945
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,000
like what i'm about to say next is

946
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,560
really important but then other times

947
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,480
cues can be

948
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,359
acting through time like stigmergy so

949
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,399
epistemic cues as ecological legacies is

950
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,000
really powerful

951
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,639
guiding epistemic foraging

952
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,599
um

953
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,918
the notion of a shared

954
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,440
cognitive model

955
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,760
but once it becomes one shared cognitive

956
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,239
model is it extended anymore

957
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,560
or by drawing the boundaries around that

958
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,800
shared model is it saying well it's not

959
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,639
extended within

960
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,159
so um

961
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:52,960
i think

962
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,639
optimization leveraging of shared

963
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,159
generative models through action and

964
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,760
perception

965
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,920
excellence place to pick up as we think

966
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,960
about

967
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,599
our intra actin flab and other contexts

968
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,240
share generative models um cognitive

969
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,280
uploading

970
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,720
one place to

971
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,280
start there would be like what is being

972
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,520
appealed to or invoked with this upload

973
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,400
download metaphor how many

974
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,119
kb per second are we talking about what

975
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,359
are we getting at or potentially seeing

976
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,400
only one facet of when we use this

977
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,280
computationalist notion of up and down

978
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,720
load

979
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,760
which they do unpack

980
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,599
and

981
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,920
also the idea of cognitive extensions

982
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,920
that gain independence from the specific

983
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,160
individuals having produced them

984
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,119
so it's kind of like if the ex the cool

985
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,240
queue

986
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,200
doesn't

987
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,760
do a different type of thing

988
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,160
but then as people might be interested

989
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:52,880
in

990
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,520
more and more autonomous pool cues

991
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,280
allowing them to be further and further

992
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,839
from more and more complex pool tables

993
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,280
until they're not even looking at the

994
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,880
pool table

995
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,480
they're just sending a sequence of

996
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,160
messages to something that is

997
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,240
outside of the person who designed it it

998
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,640
wouldn't even be called a pool cue but

999
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,960
all of a sudden it's so extended

1000
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,720
it's involving all this cyber physical

1001
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,000
apparatus that it does have this degree

1002
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,800
of

1003
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,560
autonomy or independence from the

1004
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,720
individuals who created them so then

1005
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,480
where do we put these complex cyber

1006
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,880
physical systems where it's like it's

1007
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,200
not dr frankenstein nor is it dr

1008
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,680
frankenstein's monster

1009
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,280
what is really

1010
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,800
the cognitive apparatus in those

1011
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,800
situations what about what you see on

1012
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,280
the right side

1013
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,280
well i want to just before i go to that

1014
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,280
i want to just say because i i put on

1015
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,359
that thing there professional niches

1016
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,800
programming and i'm not

1017
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,880
not horn tuning here but basically that

1018
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,200
was the name of the

1019
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,160
that was the name of the company that i

1020
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,640
started up and ran for a decade and

1021
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,320
essentially the reason why i put it in

1022
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,520
there is because to the point uh the

1023
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,960
optimization and leveraging of the

1024
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,599
shared generative model sharing through

1025
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,920
action and perception or what we

1026
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,880
call extended active inference

1027
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,119
when that's actually applied and you

1028
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,400
actually see

1029
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,280
people doing something with that

1030
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,599
uh

1031
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,680
it it's actually quite fascinating

1032
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,000
because it's actually very distributed

1033
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,880
you don't have a job wall and then

1034
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,960
people decide whether or not the things

1035
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,960
that are on offer are things that they

1036
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,880
want to partake in what it does is it's

1037
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,119
an inversion of that it's essentially

1038
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,000
saying

1039
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,040
um

1040
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,359
are you an explorer by nature

1041
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,839
and if you are are there other explorers

1042
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,720
out there in the larger community who

1043
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,160
that relational

1044
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,680
frame is something that you could share

1045
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,560
so again this these are interesting

1046
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,480
things that this paper now

1047
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,640
surfaces so

1048
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,079
i just want to talk about that for a

1049
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,400
second so my my questions were should we

1050
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,680
assume that the exploration done in

1051
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,599
literature is a proxy for functioning in

1052
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,920
the wild we take maps with us

1053
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,920
but do we continue to stare at the maps

1054
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,440
while we're in the wild

1055
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,599
how much focus on the epistemic resolves

1056
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:18,000
what when which questions to predict

1057
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,200
when the bird strike happens

1058
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,320
right these random things

1059
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,520
are are how do we respond to randomness

1060
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,280
and then how does the hudson river take

1061
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,599
care of cognitive extension gain because

1062
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,280
that seems like a weird question to ask

1063
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,760
but in the context of this paper

1064
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,599
that's the question that's being asked

1065
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:40,800
so

1066
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,240
don't be afraid

1067
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,720
ask it

1068
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,200
don't be scared

1069
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,680
because the alternative is a lot worse

1070
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,119
right

1071
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,200
that's what's fascinating about the

1072
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,040
sort of creative part of this that

1073
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,000
active inference i think enables

1074
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,599
but it's it's not

1075
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,400
it's not constructivist it's

1076
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,400
creativist and i'm not saying that there

1077
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,800
isn't a huge constructivist piece here

1078
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,800
but you're leaving off another

1079
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,920
magnificent part of it if you only focus

1080
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,599
on the computational and the

1081
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,400
constructivist

1082
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,040
excellent a lot more to say on that but

1083
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,400
let's move forward to section two

1084
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,920
we're gonna now talk about active

1085
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,480
inference entailing functional and

1086
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,960
psychological niches okay so here's

1087
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,680
where we get to equation one

1088
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,839
and they write a generative model which

1089
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,480
is this left term here with a purple

1090
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,359
line

1091
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,440
is a probabilistic statement about a set

1092
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,480
of unobserved hidden variables i.e

1093
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,640
hypothesized causes

1094
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,960
like you didn't actually see the

1095
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,960
lightning strike but there's going to be

1096
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,880
some unobserved cause which is like the

1097
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,000
actual event of the lightning initiation

1098
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,480
and observed sensations i.e consequences

1099
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,480
so that could be like the volume and the

1100
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,599
visual input of thunder and lightning

1101
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,200
which represents an organism's

1102
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,359
predictive or causal model of the world

1103
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,520
that's that joint generative model

1104
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,280
a generative model is usually expressed

1105
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,760
in terms of a likelihood and a prior

1106
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,240
term and this is sort of like um a

1107
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,599
fundamental statistical

1108
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,560
tool slash trick slash tip

1109
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,680
that you can take a joint distribution

1110
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,160
and then kind of pull out and condition

1111
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,119
upon

1112
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,200
one of the variables in that joint

1113
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,680
distribution so it's like probability of

1114
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,760
flipping a coin rolling a die

1115
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,240
it's like flipping a coin condition on

1116
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,240
rolling a die multiplied by rolling the

1117
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,400
die but not exactly in this likelihood

1118
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,680
prior case but it's very much too

1119
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,359
similar so quick question for you can

1120
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:46,000
you can you tell me when you say trick

1121
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,720
is it is as simple as a flip

1122
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,440
like

1123
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,599
effect cause

1124
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,440
cause effect is it is that what you mean

1125
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,920
by trick

1126
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,440
like a hot trick

1127
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,880
well like a a pattern of performance

1128
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,839
that enables you

1129
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,920
to win statistical games

1130
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,079
okay okay

1131
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,520
but of course anyone can describe it

1132
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,359
however else they want so

1133
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:14,480
here they're saying the likelihood

1134
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,560
corresponds to the probability of

1135
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,160
sensations

1136
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,119
given the priors

1137
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,720
and then the prior corresponds to the

1138
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,640
probability of the conditions or causes

1139
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,880
that generate the sensations

1140
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,720
so this is like beliefs about how the

1141
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,160
world is

1142
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,520
in the prior

1143
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,280
and then this is the likelihood of

1144
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,520
sensations which is here s

1145
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,680
conditioned upon those beliefs of the

1146
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,720
world

1147
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,119
and uh two other places to

1148
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,960
learn a little bit more would be um

1149
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,440
active stream number 34 where we were

1150
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,480
discussing

1151
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,000
axel's paper

1152
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,760
free energy principle it's not about

1153
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,280
what it takes it's about what took you

1154
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,920
there we talked a lot about bays exact

1155
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,000
bays variational bays and about free

1156
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,240
energy minimization and when do priors

1157
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,200
go right when do they go wrong

1158
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,560
and then here is an example from

1159
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,520
the active textbook from 2022

1160
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,920
and on page 18

1161
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,960
they show an example with frog and apple

1162
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,319
that's the hidden state of the world

1163
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:18,400
what is actually in your hand is it a

1164
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,079
frog or an apple

1165
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,920
and so initially there's a prior belief

1166
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,760
like 90 percent that it's an apple and

1167
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,440
10 that it's a frog

1168
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,200
and then there's this observation of

1169
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,520
jumping which could be like vis visual

1170
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,560
it could be

1171
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,560
tactile proprioceptive etc and then that

1172
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,760
has an associated likelihood model of

1173
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,599
apples jump one percent of the time

1174
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,640
frogs are jumping 81 of the time

1175
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,319
and then it's like much more likely that

1176
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:49,040
jumping is a frog than an apple

1177
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,720
people can see that and then that

1178
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,400
updates the prior belief into a

1179
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,359
posterior belief but it never eradicates

1180
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,040
the alternative it's still 10 percent

1181
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,960
likely that it's an apple that jumped

1182
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,240
because initially we thought it was like

1183
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,640
very likely so that's just one example

1184
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,119
from the book

1185
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,760
let's see how we actually use that

1186
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,680
generative model decomposition into

1187
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,599
likelihood and prior to talk about

1188
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,440
functional and psychological niche

1189
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,000
they're going to use variational

1190
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,280
inference to invert this likelihood

1191
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,760
which is the statistical distribution of

1192
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,800
sensations given causes of the world

1193
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,720
so how you should interpret a given

1194
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,920
sensation

1195
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,839
conditioned upon your beliefs about how

1196
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:38,240
things actually are out there

1197
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,520
to

1198
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,400
um

1199
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,200
approximate the posterior probability of

1200
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,400
causes

1201
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,800
once a sensation has been sampled so

1202
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,400
here it's p

1203
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,040
s conditioned upon

1204
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,000
eta

1205
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,560
oh that's the right um pronunciation of

1206
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,160
fancy n

1207
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,800
um but here we're looking for actually

1208
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,359
the probability distribution on

1209
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,520
unobserved causes of the world

1210
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,640
conditioned upon observed sensations so

1211
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,720
these are like two of the directions of

1212
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,720
cognition given

1213
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,560
the prior on what's out there in the

1214
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,160
world

1215
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,960
what is being sensed

1216
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,400
and then this is

1217
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,720
given the sensations

1218
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,880
what is out there in the world

1219
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,800
so the big picture level this is like

1220
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,119
how we're both doing inference on

1221
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,599
perceiving the lightning and thunder and

1222
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,119
the actual likelihood of what's

1223
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:32,560
happening in that cloud out there

1224
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,560
despite not being able to directly

1225
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,599
observe it

1226
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,160
so that's the inversion that they're

1227
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,240
talking about here and that could be

1228
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,599
done through

1229
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,480
different methods but the variational

1230
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,520
approach

1231
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,160
allows this inversion to be done in like

1232
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,880
a tractable and computable way

1233
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,839
and so here they're gonna use the same

1234
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:55,280
notation

1235
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,119
and they're just gonna unpack it into

1236
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:58,319
equation two and they write the

1237
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,400
variational density becomes a posterior

1238
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,240
belief

1239
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,800
so that's a prior that's been updated by

1240
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,119
input about the causes of sensations

1241
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,640
given

1242
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,359
um the sensations that were experienced

1243
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:15,119
this inverse mapping from causes to

1244
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:16,400
effect corresponds to inferring the

1245
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,280
causes of sensations so

1246
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,920
in a way we repeat ourselves many times

1247
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,240
with this inversion in both directions

1248
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,280
at once

1249
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,520
and

1250
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,920
i hope it's just not redundant for those

1251
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,800
who are familiar nor

1252
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,880
ambiguous overly for those who are

1253
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,800
unfamiliar but this is sort of at the

1254
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,079
core of it is that there's modeling of

1255
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,240
both the sensations and the underlying

1256
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,359
causes

1257
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:46,079
and sometimes it goes from one to the

1258
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,359
other

1259
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:48,720
and backwards

1260
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,960
and variational inference is like a

1261
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,839
toolbox or a toolkit that helps deal

1262
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:55,280
with both of those directions and

1263
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,920
compute them in a tractable way

1264
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,119
and here's the thing it's if if

1265
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:02,720
if you

1266
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,880
if you think you can analogize this too

1267
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,560
i've always walked around on my feet and

1268
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,119
now i'm going to walk around on my hands

1269
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:10,720
that's not what's actually happening

1270
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,520
here that's not the type of inversion

1271
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,760
that's actually going on here there's

1272
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,680
there's something to do with effect and

1273
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,040
cause

1274
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,160
that doesn't just necessarily translate

1275
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,960
to what's up and what's down you have to

1276
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,079
take more a little bit more

1277
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:28,400
dimensionality into that

1278
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,560
and so that's

1279
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,480
that's why it remains at sort of this

1280
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,960
mathematical statistical level

1281
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,800
as opposed to oh if it was just as

1282
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,040
simple as oh you're telling me now to

1283
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,400
walk around in my hands and that's going

1284
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,800
to change my perspective no that's not

1285
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,680
what we're saying here

1286
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,520
just to give kind of one reading of

1287
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,599
equation two so this f it's very much

1288
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,960
spaced out but you can think of it as

1289
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,839
being like f of x like a function f of

1290
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:56,160
the variable x like with x as an

1291
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,599
argument but you could think about that

1292
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,920
f being like right here it's a

1293
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,200
functional it's a function of

1294
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,640
states that are sensations s and mu the

1295
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,920
internal states and like it's kind of

1296
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,319
like here the eta is the external it's

1297
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:12,480
like an upside down view so mu is

1298
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,280
internal and then it says external

1299
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,960
and so that free energy value for a

1300
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,359
given combination of sensation and

1301
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,119
internal which are to say cognitive

1302
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:27,119
states is the divergence between

1303
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,839
the truth the true posterior which is

1304
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:32,079
the actual distribution of causes given

1305
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:33,680
sensations

1306
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,760
and this q distribution q sub mu so it's

1307
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,680
a q distribution that we control as a

1308
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,920
cognitive state that takes only a single

1309
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,880
argument which is just eta

1310
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,520
and then that kl divergence which is

1311
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,720
trying to minimize the difference

1312
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,720
between like the q distribution that we

1313
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,800
control and the true posterior

1314
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,599
and subtracting out just how surprising

1315
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,839
given stage should be

1316
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,839
we talk about it also other times but

1317
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:01,920
many touches many coats of paint so

1318
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,000
we'll continue on

1319
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,400
what is this variational inference

1320
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,520
approach allow

1321
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,720
that takes us to equation three formally

1322
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,839
variational inference

1323
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,280
converts an inference problem

1324
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,440
into an optimization problem

1325
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,839
as articulated by equation three and

1326
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:26,400
figure one so here's our figure two

1327
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,240
which was stated as like an inference

1328
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,280
problem

1329
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,079
and then this is going to move to

1330
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,040
um an optimization problem

1331
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,440
using this arg min which just means like

1332
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,599
choose the minimum choose the minimum of

1333
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:40,880
that argument

1334
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,359
um over q

1335
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:45,200
and then that is going to be applied to

1336
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,480
this inverse mapping

1337
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,440
they also connected here to

1338
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,400
some discussion of bayes optimal

1339
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,680
updating

1340
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,240
when learning that cause sensation

1341
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,520
relationship

1342
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,359
and about how it's tied to biological

1343
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:05,040
cognitive mechanisms like experience

1344
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,440
dependent plasticity

1345
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,720
and then they tie that to several

1346
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,960
specific mechanisms of cognitive

1347
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,880
updating like the millisecond time scale

1348
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,280
the minutes to hours time scale

1349
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,280
and then the months to years and then

1350
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,119
when we think about that forest that's

1351
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:22,319
where we think about the

1352
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:24,800
intergenerational selective extended

1353
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,319
niche

1354
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:28,480
anything else you'd add on this one

1355
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,400
this is kind of the in between we're

1356
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,240
going to get to the other side here

1357
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,000
shortly when we go

1358
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,160
further in the slides but

1359
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,240
if you if you started thinking that if

1360
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,920
if it was a simple matter of inverting

1361
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,280
from walking on feet to walking on hands

1362
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,280
this is kind of the in between between

1363
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,359
okay so

1364
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,280
to me it makes perfect sense it's

1365
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,040
unsurprising that my skin is on the

1366
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,079
outside and everything else is sort of

1367
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:56,240
the bones and the and the organs and all

1368
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,319
the blood is on the inside but to the

1369
00:49:58,319 --> 00:49:59,839
environment

1370
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:02,319
they it has an inside and an outside as

1371
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:03,520
well

1372
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,720
and what is my outside could necessarily

1373
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:07,520
be

1374
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,079
the environments inside and this is kind

1375
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:13,520
of transitioning us to that idea of yes

1376
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,760
it would be surprising if everything

1377
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,680
that's now currently inside of me was on

1378
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,960
the outside

1379
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,440
but stop looking at it as inversion in

1380
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,800
that

1381
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,400
sort of

1382
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,119
centric or cellular way think of it now

1383
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:29,599
in terms of the bigger picture

1384
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:32,800
and that's where this i think this slide

1385
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,280
starts transitioning us to that other

1386
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,160
other perspective

1387
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,040
awesome

1388
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,040
okay continuing on

1389
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,640
in section two

1390
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,559
to figure one

1391
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,880
all right

1392
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,440
why don't you give a first pass

1393
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,800
description on what you see in the

1394
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,079
figure or what you think is important

1395
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,119
about dean

1396
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,040
well i'm going to read first before i

1397
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,200
sort of throw my own comment in actions

1398
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,720
are selected they bring about expected

1399
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,160
outcomes while being geared toward

1400
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,240
minimizing expected surprise or

1401
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,079
uncertainty about the future

1402
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:07,680
that's if you've been reading enough

1403
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,280
stuff in active inference that you've

1404
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,040
read that a few times

1405
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,720
hence

1406
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,800
inactive inference motor and autonomic

1407
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,520
functions autonomic

1408
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,280
work hand in hand

1409
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,160
with a perceptual inference to resolve

1410
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,040
uncertainty through the active sampling

1411
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,440
of salient uncertainty reducing

1412
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,480
sensations back to the feeling piece

1413
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,079
while allowing for preferred

1414
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:34,640
unsurprising outcomes free energy is

1415
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,000
minimized with respect to counter

1416
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,240
factual outcomes

1417
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,400
and we've spoken a few times what what

1418
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,079
is a counterfactual

1419
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,480
in this context

1420
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,240
but now it's very clear that the

1421
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,400
counterfactual is embedded in a context

1422
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,040
it doesn't just free float there are

1423
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,599
times when it is supposed to now

1424
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:58,319
extend into something or is already

1425
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:01,599
embedded within something

1426
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:04,160
by taking the expectation of free energy

1427
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,280
under future outcomes given the action

1428
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,440
being evaluated now

1429
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,200
both daniel's copying my copy of the

1430
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,119
paper didn't do a good job of

1431
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:15,119
reproducing the purple and the greenness

1432
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:16,319
of this

1433
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:19,040
this world these two worlds and there's

1434
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,880
a there's actually a third world going

1435
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,119
to be introduced as well but

1436
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,520
in order to be able to get to the idea

1437
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,839
of extending

1438
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:31,359
the first thing that they want to do is

1439
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,880
kind of create this

1440
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,160
idea of surprise minimization within a

1441
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,760
tighter loop there's going to be a

1442
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,760
concentric loop that they're going to

1443
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,839
introduce around this

1444
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:43,680
shortly

1445
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,000
and that's what the all this is is is

1446
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,240
just basically setting up i think for

1447
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,760
the next figure but what do you think

1448
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,599
daniel

1449
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:53,760
yes just a few pieces to highlight and

1450
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,319
then just describing it um this is a key

1451
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:58,800
piece of active inference that there's a

1452
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,920
relative comparison of expected futures

1453
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,000
not just in the abstract

1454
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,400
but always conditioned upon policy

1455
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,839
affordances

1456
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:09,520
and that helps us

1457
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,680
determine whether to trim tab or steer

1458
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,680
the ship to the left or to the right

1459
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,680
because that's our affordances with our

1460
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,520
hand on the rudder okay now if you're

1461
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,119
modeling the hand on the rudder and a

1462
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:21,359
hand on the gas and break that's another

1463
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,359
control situation that you might be in

1464
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:25,680
but there is no such thing as like the

1465
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,119
neutral non-policy grounded trajectory

1466
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:31,040
of the boat or

1467
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,839
one could do that but it would actually

1468
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,839
not be actionable it wouldn't be action

1469
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:38,480
oriented because there would be like

1470
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,040
some maximum likelihood boat trajectory

1471
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,760
implicitly based upon non-action of the

1472
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,800
captain

1473
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,640
and it's like okay but i know that we're

1474
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,119
gonna crash if we don't do anything

1475
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:51,520
a biological organism is actually always

1476
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,160
engaged in that action selection

1477
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,160
and so this is both something that's

1478
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,240
biologically grounding to always

1479
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,720
condition upon policy affordances but

1480
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,720
also is computationally simplifying

1481
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,160
because we could have uncertainty about

1482
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,079
both sides of the teammates but we still

1483
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,680
need to act what do you think about that

1484
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,119
before we continue well i think that's

1485
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:10,800
that's fantastic because i think the

1486
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,480
struggle that people have

1487
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,240
in writing papers

1488
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,680
is the fact that they're saying they're

1489
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,960
talking right now because you have to

1490
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,960
talk about the psychological niches how

1491
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,359
do you keep in mind the functional

1492
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,839
niches they've said you have to do that

1493
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:27,040
but it's hard to do that when your focus

1494
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,160
is on the cycle but but so how do you

1495
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,200
keep

1496
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,559
that other thing running in parallel the

1497
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:37,599
functional niche while you're supposedly

1498
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:39,359
giving your attentional

1499
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,920
energies over to psychological niches

1500
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,000
but you got to do it so how do you train

1501
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,599
for that

1502
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:47,440
that's what that's a fantastic thing

1503
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,079
about this paper and what you just

1504
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:51,200
kind of

1505
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,720
explained again about active inference

1506
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,799
it's a minimum of two if you lose one

1507
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:02,720
you the whole thing falls apart

1508
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,240
let's um

1509
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,150
run around the rosie as it were

1510
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:09,440
[Laughter]

1511
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,760
so here even though the paper was quite

1512
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,680
literally beyond skulls we're gonna have

1513
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,599
a brain for the internal states

1514
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,240
and so just looking at these four pieces

1515
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,680
you could also kind of think about a

1516
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,119
markov blanket in the middle but it's

1517
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:23,440
not emphasized in this picture

1518
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,119
what you see even without knowing what

1519
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:27,119
the variables are is that these two on

1520
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,280
the bottom right the internal states and

1521
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,400
the action selection have this arg min

1522
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,839
so those are as per this discussion

1523
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:37,599
it means that it's an optimization

1524
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:38,799
problem

1525
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:42,480
so these two there's this active an act

1526
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,440
of

1527
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,640
optimization and selection and choice

1528
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,880
here's the external states which it's a

1529
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,960
stochastic differential equation so it's

1530
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,400
doing some dynamics that's a function of

1531
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,799
well omega noise term but also a

1532
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:59,760
function of the current external states

1533
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,440
as well as the actions

1534
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,839
so if external states weren't influenced

1535
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,839
in some way by action it would be for

1536
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:07,040
naught

1537
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,280
here's the sense states they're a

1538
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,480
function of external states and noise

1539
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,280
so you don't get to directly in the

1540
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,760
instant of perception select sense

1541
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:18,880
states

1542
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,319
however

1543
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:21,920
actions like

1544
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,280
isocating ocular motor choices

1545
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,040
can be selected

1546
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,440
that result in changed sensory output

1547
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,040
you can walk to a different part of the

1548
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,200
room where you get a different

1549
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,040
sensation of temperature

1550
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,640
but

1551
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,200
without um special appeals one can't

1552
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,160
just

1553
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,799
change their sensory inputs and so this

1554
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:45,040
is like framing here's the

1555
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,280
particular entity the blankets and the

1556
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,440
internal states as partitioned off from

1557
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,280
the external states

1558
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,839
and even within the entity

1559
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:55,599
we see that it's not enough just to talk

1560
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:58,960
about the set of undirected nodes that

1561
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,319
makes the internal and the external

1562
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:01,680
states conditionally independent from

1563
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,520
each other the mark called blanket this

1564
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,040
is where we kind of get towards the

1565
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,559
first and blanket where we're thinking

1566
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:09,200
about incoming sensory dependencies

1567
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,799
and treating those as perception

1568
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:14,319
and then there's this free energy

1569
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:15,280
function

1570
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:18,160
that is doing perception as divergence

1571
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,760
minimization

1572
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,079
without the ability to directly control

1573
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:24,160
those sensations

1574
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,480
we also have action

1575
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,880
as minimizing a divergence and

1576
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,160
minimizing a bound on surprisal but this

1577
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,799
is also framed as an optimization

1578
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:36,319
that we actually get to choose based

1579
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:38,480
upon our affordances and so this one is

1580
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,960
kind of like you're selecting the

1581
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,240
sensory

1582
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,640
perceptive interpretive lens that is

1583
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,640
minimizing something

1584
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,799
it's minimizing surprisal and then in a

1585
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,440
different way choosing from the action

1586
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,839
selection

1587
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:55,119
affordances there's also a minimization

1588
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:57,920
of surprisal through action and so these

1589
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,799
two are like choice driven optimization

1590
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:02,720
like and then there also is this

1591
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,640
optimization happening with perception

1592
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,440
but it's like slightly different

1593
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,599
can i just add something to that weekend

1594
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:11,680
in all of these live streams

1595
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,839
to go again and again back to the active

1596
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:15,520
piece and the inference piece or the

1597
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,760
action piece and the perception piece

1598
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,280
but what i really liked about this

1599
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,000
figure was if you actually again do a

1600
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,200
little

1601
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,119
little shift in terms of what you want

1602
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:26,960
to pay attention to

1603
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,880
back to the way

1604
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,680
uploading or way up finding or whatever

1605
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:32,799
right

1606
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:35,280
you could say the bound

1607
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,400
as minimized or you could say the bound

1608
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,280
as

1609
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,839
optimized and i think that's really

1610
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:44,799
critical as well we can we can put all

1611
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:46,319
of our attention on the perception in

1612
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:49,359
the action or we could look at the bound

1613
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:52,160
and what are the two meanings of

1614
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,920
binding

1615
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,920
and i get again if we're going to look

1616
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,760
at this imaginally

1617
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,000
what is the hudson river telling us

1618
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,440
today

1619
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,480
because that's that's now the bound as

1620
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,319
optimized

1621
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:08,000
doesn't necessarily have to have a plane

1622
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,440
land on it

1623
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,040
and the bound has minimized and i'll let

1624
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,359
you use your imagination of what that

1625
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:16,319
means

1626
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:19,359
in that context right but again

1627
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:21,200
there's multiple ways that this can be

1628
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,839
parsed arbitrarily what we tend to focus

1629
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:26,319
on is the action and the inference but

1630
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:28,400
we could also look at so

1631
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,760
how does this

1632
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,799
how does this bound behave do we just

1633
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:35,839
assume it's it's stationary it's static

1634
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:37,520
it doesn't change

1635
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:38,480
or

1636
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,160
is it malleable

1637
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,839
as well

1638
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:43,280
i guess it just depends on what you want

1639
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,799
to pay attention to right so again if we

1640
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:48,240
it's this is going to lead to the next

1641
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,319
figure which i really love

1642
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:52,640
yes we'll get to figure two in a second

1643
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:53,599
yep

1644
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:54,720
um

1645
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,119
they continue in section two one

1646
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:58,799
discussing the

1647
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:02,079
cognitive niche and this

1648
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:03,680
there's a lot to say people could you

1649
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,000
know pause the video and read these

1650
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,960
quotations or they could read the paper

1651
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,040
um

1652
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,119
what would be the one or few things that

1653
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:14,400
you would highlight from this and then

1654
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,720
i'll give a thought

1655
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,160
um

1656
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,559
well i took i took from the paper the

1657
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:22,799
the thing on the right bottom which in

1658
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:25,440
red which i really like we do not claim

1659
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,520
that the formal symmetry between brain

1660
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:28,400
and niche

1661
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,160
dynamics entails the symmetry and

1662
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,559
construal

1663
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:35,119
fantastic i'll let people they don't

1664
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:36,720
know what construal is they can look

1665
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,240
that up

1666
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,839
rather we employ the notion of symmetry

1667
01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:44,400
epistemically as a modeling analog

1668
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,160
to make sense of niche dynamics as

1669
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,920
learning dynamics under active inference

1670
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,079
they're just reassuring us that this is

1671
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:54,160
through active inference

1672
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,280
okay

1673
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,119
the notion of symmetry is merely an

1674
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:59,680
assumption

1675
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:01,760
i think that that's

1676
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,440
and if you read the paper

1677
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,160
and you read that statement you'll go

1678
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,520
okay they're not they're not overfitting

1679
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,040
anything here

1680
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,720
which i love

1681
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:16,000
because it would be real easy to just go

1682
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,880
completely off and start thinking

1683
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,280
we've solved every riddle

1684
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,559
they haven't done that they've done a

1685
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,960
brilliant job of just sort of keeping it

1686
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,280
in its lane

1687
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,559
awesome so

1688
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:30,880
to pick up on one of their quotes

1689
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,240
uh they write the environment is the

1690
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,920
generative process

1691
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,079
that is modeled by the generative model

1692
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:37,520
generative process

1693
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,480
forest

1694
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:42,640
generative model wayfinding hiking team

1695
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,960
entailed by the phenotype

1696
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,200
in virtue of the mathematical symmetry

1697
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,040
imposed by a markov blanket that

1698
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,799
separates or makes conditionally

1699
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:52,480
independent the internal and external

1700
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,480
states it's like hey whose side are you

1701
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,160
on internal

1702
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,200
is

1703
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,119
external they're just

1704
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:01,680
two sides

1705
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:06,880
the environment can also be construed as

1706
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:10,160
a generative model of its denizens

1707
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,319
who now become the processes generating

1708
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:14,400
outcomes for the environment so in

1709
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,760
figure one

1710
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,079
we had this sort of like argument on the

1711
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:20,400
internal states but then it's a

1712
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,280
different qualitative structure for

1713
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,440
those generative processes

1714
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,680
um so this might be appropriate for a

1715
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,520
world where there's some active entity

1716
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,839
that's doing strategy and cognition

1717
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:34,480
and the rest of the world is like chains

1718
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:37,119
of dominoes like there are

1719
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:39,039
exogenous dynamics that could happen

1720
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:41,119
without the cognitive entity pushing

1721
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:42,079
them

1722
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:45,280
but it's a mere active inference entity

1723
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,799
in a sense

1724
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:50,240
this formalism also could extend to

1725
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,920
other cases but this is just sort of at

1726
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,119
a first pass

1727
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:54,880
and where we're headed and where we're

1728
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,319
going to go in figure two in the next

1729
01:02:56,319 --> 01:03:01,200
slide is this symmetry as an assumption

1730
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,880
and saying well actually let's put rich

1731
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,559
dynamics on both sides of the blanket

1732
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:11,039
let's allow this thinking where um one

1733
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:13,039
active state of this entity is the sense

1734
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,599
state of the other entity and vice versa

1735
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:17,200
so

1736
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,799
that means that niche construction is a

1737
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:21,119
form of environmental learning

1738
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:22,960
about the organisms hosted by the

1739
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,039
environment so it's like the field

1740
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:26,880
that's getting the pleasure path burnt

1741
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,920
into it by footsteps it's actually in a

1742
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:30,880
sense

1743
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:33,920
learning where people like to walk

1744
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,400
that's it's parameter updating

1745
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,240
and then there's one case where

1746
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,680
that pleasure path is just like the

1747
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,520
stacks of dominoes and so it's like yes

1748
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,680
it's parameter updating but it's kind of

1749
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:44,640
like

1750
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,480
low-key not learning

1751
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,039
versus what if that pleasure path was

1752
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:51,440
more and more agentic

1753
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:54,799
more and more cognitive

1754
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,839
then there's teaching going both

1755
01:03:56,839 --> 01:04:00,000
directions yeah and um

1756
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,319
then we see a few examples like

1757
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:05,039
um the the the two guys on this stream

1758
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:06,720
you know here's the one that you put so

1759
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,839
it's the person in nature and they're in

1760
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:12,960
their vr viewing nature

1761
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,799
that's like sort of this one which is

1762
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:17,280
viewing viewing like that's the strange

1763
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,200
loop part right and

1764
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,039
the other thing too is if there was some

1765
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:22,640
way that you could have put little vrs

1766
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,640
on every one of those ants that would

1767
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:27,359
have been kind of fascinating as well

1768
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:30,079
because it and again it goes back to

1769
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:31,839
when we when we look at slices in time

1770
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:33,200
we can nest

1771
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,520
and we're looking at a nest of ants but

1772
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,079
is that the same thing

1773
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:39,039
so

1774
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:42,559
again it's it comes back to okay so i'm

1775
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:44,160
just gonna say this at this point we'll

1776
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,079
probably i'll probably have a ton of

1777
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,920
bricks fall down on me but

1778
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,160
you can look at things as as opposite

1779
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,839
sides of the same coin or you can look

1780
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:53,359
at twins

1781
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:55,760
in both cases your the question is is

1782
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,880
one better than the other or is it our

1783
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:02,319
our ability to see both

1784
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:06,160
that is the thing that matters

1785
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,079
here's the um

1786
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:09,839
twist with the ant picture

1787
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:12,000
you'll notice that this ant has yellow

1788
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,920
paints yellow paint on all three of its

1789
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,480
body parts and this one has blue paint

1790
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,839
and so it turns out that an experimenter

1791
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:21,920
had previously collected these ants and

1792
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:22,640
then

1793
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,559
chilled them on ice and then while they

1794
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:26,400
were stopped painted them carefully and

1795
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,160
then reintroduced them to their colony

1796
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:29,920
several hours later i did this in

1797
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,039
arizona

1798
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:31,839
so

1799
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:33,839
now these painted ants and their

1800
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:36,240
behavior they're like tracers in this

1801
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,240
collective behavioral system

1802
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,720
and so who's learning and who's teaching

1803
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:41,760
from who

1804
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,119
who's

1805
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:46,799
training who there's cognitive entities

1806
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:49,200
in a shared niche on both sides of the

1807
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,960
markov blanket or whatever kind of

1808
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,520
blanket however you draw it and so what

1809
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,599
does it look like to start to embrace

1810
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:57,440
this richness on both sides of the

1811
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,200
cognitive partition

1812
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,920
yeah let's see what that looks like in

1813
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,200
figure two

1814
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,520
okay so on the right side

1815
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:09,759
um we have ye old figure one

1816
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:11,920
way back when back when the environment

1817
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,240
was simple weren't those the days

1818
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:15,280
and

1819
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,839
the figure has been updated in a few

1820
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:20,000
different ways which i'll describe but

1821
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,480
first what what did you see in figure 2

1822
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:25,680
or what would you highlight here

1823
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:28,319
okay well i'm gonna i'm gonna beat the

1824
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:29,520
drum about

1825
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,559
joint

1826
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:31,599
self

1827
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:33,839
evidencing so

1828
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:35,359
i think we i think

1829
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:37,359
it's easy enough to find out what

1830
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:40,559
self-evidencing is

1831
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:43,520
but joint outsell self-evidencing

1832
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,920
is a whole different aunt or cat or

1833
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,039
whatever

1834
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:48,880
and so

1835
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,200
when we introduce

1836
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,119
the

1837
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:55,280
niche construction optimizes the bound

1838
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:58,160
on surprise now now the boundary

1839
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:01,520
has a different look

1840
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,280
what

1841
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,920
why is that different than the first two

1842
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,240
where is the where is the joint like

1843
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:10,000
literally the joint

1844
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,200
in this relationship because

1845
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:16,160
relationship is fluid

1846
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:18,960
how do we how do we secure exactly where

1847
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,520
the joint is or is it

1848
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,079
something that's more in the realm of

1849
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:26,480
the twist you know back in the key words

1850
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:29,280
we've got that image of the sort of the

1851
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,520
morpheus strip

1852
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:34,079
is that what's actually going on here as

1853
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:36,319
opposed to sort of the more traditional

1854
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:39,920
definition of what a joint is

1855
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,640
awesome joint it's funny it means both

1856
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,119
separate carve nature at the joints and

1857
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:46,559
all that the joint between the two

1858
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:49,200
pieces of plywood and it literally means

1859
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,200
together they are joint it's like the

1860
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,440
past tense of to join

1861
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,640
it's a joint in the tensegrity sculpture

1862
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:59,200
so that's a very interesting and what is

1863
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,640
the difference between figure one and

1864
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:03,520
figure two so the um triangle and the

1865
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:04,640
star

1866
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:07,119
so the idea of perception optimizing

1867
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:08,799
surprisal we don't get to directly

1868
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:10,480
control sensory states but we can

1869
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,640
control our cognitive modeling of

1870
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,880
sensory states

1871
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,679
is bound on survival a surprisal

1872
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:19,439
and a bound on survival in the

1873
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:21,839
evolutionary sense and then action is

1874
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:25,040
also this um argument like process of

1875
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,839
choosing actions so that was in figure

1876
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:28,880
one

1877
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,000
now

1878
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,560
rather than this external state just

1879
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,880
being like a function of

1880
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,960
external states and action states in a

1881
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,399
noise term

1882
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:39,839
now there's actually

1883
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:42,640
this argument happening now it's an

1884
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:46,080
argument on those same two arguments

1885
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,238
it's still being influenced by the

1886
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:51,279
current state of the external um states

1887
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:52,640
and the actions

1888
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:53,600
but now

1889
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,520
the other side of the cognitive

1890
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,920
partitioning is also doing

1891
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,600
action selection

1892
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,120
and so then they write

1893
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:02,640
this effectively closes a circle of

1894
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,839
causality in which the niche and

1895
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:07,040
phenotypes i mean it's really just two

1896
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,719
different phenotypes the niche and the

1897
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:10,880
entity

1898
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,799
are trying to learn about each other to

1899
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:14,880
minimize their joint free energy or

1900
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:17,120
surprise an inevitable consequence of

1901
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,319
this is that the niche and its

1902
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:19,839
incumbents

1903
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:21,600
become mutually predictable

1904
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,319
in both directions of fit

1905
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:27,040
paging the principle of unitarity and

1906
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:29,679
the quantum and the entanglement from 41

1907
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:31,120
from 40.

1908
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,279
so that the joint niche phenotype system

1909
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:35,279
can be regarded as jointly

1910
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:37,359
self-evidencing which probably also has

1911
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:38,719
a few different ways to read it but we

1912
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:40,880
had the star in the triangle

1913
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,120
as perception and action as in the

1914
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:46,000
common game of minimizing surprise for

1915
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,040
the entity and now we have square

1916
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,120
which is niche construction optimizing

1917
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,799
the bound on surprise

1918
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:54,238
of the niche

1919
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:56,800
of the organism's actions which are

1920
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:57,920
sense

1921
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,400
from the perspective of the niche

1922
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,719
like what if instead of

1923
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:05,199
us trying to minimize our surprise about

1924
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:07,679
co2 readings in the atmosphere

1925
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:10,400
the other side of that coin is

1926
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:13,199
the environment minimizing its surprise

1927
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:16,480
about the co2 that's actually put in

1928
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,159
and that's what about

1929
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:18,880
yeah

1930
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,760
what about the siamese twin example like

1931
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:26,400
is that two sides of the same coin

1932
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,159
right so again

1933
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:30,320
this is the twist aspect of it this is

1934
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:33,759
we're looking at the bound

1935
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,760
as as opposed to

1936
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:38,000
what's what's on the either on either

1937
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,880
side of that again we have this ability

1938
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,920
to see both it's a question of whether

1939
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,920
we choose to

1940
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,280
that's what's really that's what's

1941
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,440
really great about this paper actually

1942
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:50,800
because it's actually looking at

1943
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,199
extending a mind but in order to be able

1944
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:55,600
to do that it's asking you to can you

1945
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:56,880
delimit

1946
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:00,400
from what you're paying attention to

1947
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,159
let's unpack the equations with one more

1948
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:06,880
level so yep here we are in equation

1949
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,560
four so

1950
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:09,920
on the top left

1951
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:11,679
we're going from figure one to figure

1952
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:12,560
two

1953
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,040
but with equation two to equation four

1954
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:15,760
so

1955
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,280
figure one

1956
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:19,360
was here and then we introduced the

1957
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:22,480
activity of the niche

1958
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,400
equation

1959
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:25,760
three

1960
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:29,840
was the optimization of internal states

1961
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,920
to infer causes

1962
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,120
between this

1963
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,159
and now

1964
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:37,520
the niche is also going to be doing

1965
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,920
something similar so equation four has

1966
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,840
the same form as equation two

1967
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,000
but with internal sensory and external

1968
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,920
active states switch around

1969
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,360
which is like

1970
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:50,239
i switched um

1971
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:52,000
um which

1972
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,080
signpost was pointing to each side of

1973
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,560
the maze and i switched where the food

1974
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,480
locations were so it's still like the

1975
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,560
sign is still correct but it's all

1976
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,159
different now

1977
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:04,719
this means that the variational density

1978
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:06,840
is taken under the external

1979
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:10,400
states not the internal states

1980
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,640
and surprisal is relative to organisms

1981
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,880
actions so from the organism's point of

1982
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,360
view the variational density is over

1983
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:19,920
internal states minimizing surprisal

1984
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,679
about the environment

1985
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:23,920
from the environment's point of view the

1986
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,239
variational distribution is over

1987
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:28,239
external states

1988
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:31,040
and it is over

1989
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,800
it is oriented towards reducing

1990
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,800
surprisal relative to the organism's

1991
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,960
actions but again environment and

1992
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,400
organism it could just be thought of as

1993
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,520
like side a and side b like whichever

1994
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,280
side you're on there's going to be this

1995
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,880
symmetry

1996
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:47,120
in the forming

1997
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:47,920
and

1998
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:50,000
so that's what equation four does is it

1999
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,719
pretty much just replicates equation two

2000
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:54,640
but instead of um

2001
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:57,040
it being about the organism

2002
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,719
doing free energy minimization on

2003
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:00,320
sensations and

2004
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,159
internal states

2005
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:04,880
it's literally the other two pieces

2006
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,280
of the quadrivium of the fourfold

2007
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:09,280
distinction which is like it's a free

2008
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:11,920
energy minimization of the environments

2009
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,560
on the actions of the organism and the

2010
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,480
current state of the environment

2011
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,560
and then there's analogous flippings of

2012
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,239
all the other pieces

2013
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:21,120
so

2014
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:24,080
that's basically taking this symmetry

2015
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,440
seriously

2016
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:28,000
and it shows that this free energy

2017
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,360
functional

2018
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,640
structure

2019
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,520
it is like it's enough to hold the yes

2020
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,920
and the no or to hold both sides

2021
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:37,440
together

2022
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,520
it's not a jedi mind trick to say that

2023
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,120
my outsides

2024
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,600
can be inside

2025
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,080
the insides of something else like that

2026
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,600
that's

2027
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:51,120
that that is literally not hard to do

2028
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,520
but that's not necessarily how i don't

2029
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:56,320
walk around every day identifying myself

2030
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:58,400
as the insides of something

2031
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,320
larger

2032
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:03,120
right but that's a fact

2033
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,960
so

2034
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,440
yeah and it's almost like the um inside

2035
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:10,159
out view on strategy

2036
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:12,159
it ends up through thinking through

2037
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:14,800
other minds being like an outside in

2038
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,400
strategy

2039
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,719
other strategic entities the other chess

2040
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:19,679
player

2041
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:21,040
how will they

2042
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,280
think about my actions

2043
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:26,239
and so it's like stepping outside of the

2044
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:27,440
entity

2045
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:29,840
considering how other minds

2046
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,960
will see the entity's actions as sense

2047
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:33,920
states

2048
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:34,960
yeah

2049
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:37,440
perfect all right great

2050
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:38,800
2.2

2051
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,640
the psychological niche so this is where

2052
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,000
they're going to be unpacking the

2053
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,239
cognitive niche concept again in terms

2054
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:45,440
of like the functional and the

2055
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:47,840
psychological components

2056
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,280
and um

2057
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:51,760
any things here before all just note

2058
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,840
whatever i see yeah and then the thing

2059
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:54,880
you've just highlighted the

2060
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,560
psychological niche can thus be viewed

2061
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:00,640
as a state space of invitations to act

2062
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,239
that's that's the attractor state thing

2063
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:04,480
i think i don't want to overstep but i

2064
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:07,040
think that's what it's sort of pointing

2065
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,000
to

2066
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,199
uh with peaks and valleys that

2067
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:11,199
correspond to the most and least

2068
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:13,440
probable and thereby adaptive actions

2069
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:14,880
given the priors and phenotypic

2070
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,360
preferences of organisms like me

2071
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:18,800
having constructed the niche in the

2072
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,000
first place and i brought those three

2073
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,600
images in

2074
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,760
as examples of why free energy minimize

2075
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,920
drive niche construction in states they

2076
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,199
share with these

2077
01:15:29,199 --> 01:15:31,040
psychological attractors like why does

2078
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,040
somebody want to paraglide

2079
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,520
outside of the launch in switzerland or

2080
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,120
do the ferrata

2081
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:39,360
on mount norquay and banff or

2082
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,880
i'm not sure where that where the

2083
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,360
amusement park is in the states but i

2084
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:45,440
mean again why are these

2085
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:48,320
why are these could be these

2086
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:49,920
not just functional places but

2087
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,679
psychological

2088
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:55,679
niches right as an extension of the mind

2089
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:57,600
that's essentially what this is

2090
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:00,880
is is pointing at do we necessarily see

2091
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:03,679
the walking along that ferrata as an

2092
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:05,600
extension of the mind well

2093
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,480
people that are probably enjoying it do

2094
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,640
and people that are wetting themselves

2095
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,070
probably don't

2096
01:16:12,070 --> 01:16:14,960
[Laughter]

2097
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:17,440
and all of these cases

2098
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:18,719
involve

2099
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:20,719
the cognitive niche broadly as having

2100
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:22,880
like a functional underlying physical

2101
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,120
embodied substrate like there is a

2102
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:28,560
roller coaster here there is a

2103
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,080
bridge of some kind there is the

2104
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:33,360
apparatus of the paragliding machinery

2105
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,760
and it's both functional and it's

2106
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:38,080
cognitive it's an invitation

2107
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:41,760
for an experience and an invitation for

2108
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:44,640
being in a certain scenario

2109
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:46,880
so that's very rich and i hope we can

2110
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:48,400
explore that a little more

2111
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:49,440
in the

2112
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,679
one too

2113
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:53,920
and it's also it's also yeah it's also

2114
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:56,159
dense and it's also up and down

2115
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:58,560
which in the previous slide we saw the

2116
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,080
i'm sorry i think it's the previous

2117
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:03,600
slide where we saw the the waves

2118
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:04,880
example

2119
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,719
one one of the i'm not sure if it's

2120
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:09,440
slide 23 or 24

2121
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:11,520
but anyway that's the other part of this

2122
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,679
the psychological piece it's it's not

2123
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:15,440
necessarily stable

2124
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,120
you don't know who's going to walk into

2125
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,400
these kind of

2126
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:21,520
uh niche constructions and remain stable

2127
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:22,880
and who's going to be completely

2128
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,199
destabilized by what they find

2129
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:27,440
themselves and that surprisal piece

2130
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,840
causes all kinds of feelings right so

2131
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:30,880
yeah it's

2132
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:33,280
again fantastic paper

2133
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:34,400
great

2134
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,120
we come now to section two three the

2135
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:38,960
functional niche so previously we were

2136
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:41,600
discussing that psychological niche

2137
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,239
facet of the cognitive niche and then

2138
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:48,959
this is going to the functional niche

2139
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:51,440
what does dancing with the stars have to

2140
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:54,480
do with it or what would you add here

2141
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,159
well

2142
01:17:56,159 --> 01:17:58,159
do we gear learning towards belonging to

2143
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:00,159
or working with or both

2144
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:02,800
because i think in in in different

2145
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,960
situations that we find ourselves

2146
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,480
sometimes we're

2147
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,640
partnered with somebody who has prior

2148
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:11,120
experience sometimes we're stepping on

2149
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,880
one another's toes

2150
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,800
and either one of those kind of

2151
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,159
situations

2152
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:20,639
can bring us minimize our free energy

2153
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:23,600
right and optimize

2154
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,920
i step on you step on my toes enough

2155
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:28,239
times i'll probably communicate to you

2156
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:31,679
that we need to maybe change the pattern

2157
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:33,440
of your foot movement

2158
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:36,239
right one isn't one isn't always done at

2159
01:18:36,239 --> 01:18:38,400
the exclusion of the other in terms of

2160
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:41,280
getting to the place we want to be

2161
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,280
sooner there's also the part where

2162
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,840
dancing and and actual

2163
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:47,360
galactic

2164
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,220
scales just fascinates me

2165
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:52,080
[Laughter]

2166
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,760
um i'm going to start with a quote in

2167
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:57,840
the paper but it will end in a joke um

2168
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,480
they give this example of the wax

2169
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,880
feeling and extendative cognitive

2170
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,600
apparatus of like the whole postal

2171
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,239
chain the supply chain logistics of the

2172
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:09,280
mailing

2173
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:10,560
yeah and

2174
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,239
they basically say the point here is

2175
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:13,600
neither

2176
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:16,159
uh is that neither of the internal or

2177
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:17,199
external

2178
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:19,360
subcomponents of the brainwax system

2179
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:21,600
exists in isolation so it's like the

2180
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:24,080
fully distributed term so what does it

2181
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:25,760
look like when instead of just thinking

2182
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:26,960
like well

2183
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:28,560
cognition is about what's happening in

2184
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,719
the brain happening in the skull

2185
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:32,800
and then there's all these extensions of

2186
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:36,880
cognition like that get um facilitating

2187
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:39,280
what happens in the brain is now going

2188
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:41,280
to be done through these extended

2189
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,360
apparatuses and this is kind of like

2190
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,920
even going further which is like yeah

2191
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,840
it's a little odd to depict the wax as

2192
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:51,840
doing active modeling of the punch

2193
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:52,719
but

2194
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:55,280
actually from the markov partitioning

2195
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,360
perspective all these different sub

2196
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,440
components of the cognitive

2197
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:01,840
constellation federation

2198
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,120
are all

2199
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,199
sense and acting each other they're all

2200
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:08,719
doing active on each other

2201
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:11,600
back to figure two

2202
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:12,960
look at the brain

2203
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,120
see how it has a star here perception

2204
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:16,800
optimizing the balance of

2205
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,280
so how do we dance with the stars

2206
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:22,080
how do we do group dancing with the

2207
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,760
stars

2208
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,719
how do the brains dance together

2209
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:29,440
that's not the same thing as one active

2210
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,600
brain one star

2211
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,400
in an extended dead universe

2212
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,960
dancing with the stars is when

2213
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,800
cognitive entities

2214
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:41,360
are on the other side of the phone

2215
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:44,880
and so it's a very apt

2216
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,800
meme that you added here

2217
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,320
there's another interesting part to this

2218
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,159
too and that is the stage tends to be

2219
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:52,320
set up so that the cameras can catch all

2220
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:53,199
of the

2221
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:55,520
the choreography what happens when the

2222
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:57,199
participants

2223
01:20:57,199 --> 01:20:59,120
impose on the cameras right like when

2224
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,760
did they extend the stage out into the

2225
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,679
audience like that that hasn't happened

2226
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:06,320
yet but what would that mean then for

2227
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,239
the property that we know had

2228
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:10,639
conventionally have known as dancing

2229
01:21:10,639 --> 01:21:12,960
with the stars

2230
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,280
now the camera has to move

2231
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:16,320
to that

2232
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:17,840
active inference

2233
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:20,239
that that's imposing and it's kind of

2234
01:21:20,239 --> 01:21:22,880
really fascinating again

2235
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,880
do you do you construct it and contain

2236
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:25,760
it

2237
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,560
or

2238
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:28,320
what what what elements of this are

2239
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,360
actually

2240
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:32,639
free and independent

2241
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,610
that makes me think about um

2242
01:21:34,610 --> 01:21:35,760
[Music]

2243
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:39,199
here's figure one science communication

2244
01:21:39,199 --> 01:21:40,840
scientists are

2245
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:44,159
stars and they're great

2246
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:47,520
figure two science communication

2247
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,760
now we're dancing with the stars because

2248
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:52,080
the fourth wall has been broken

2249
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,199
and there's

2250
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:55,679
rich cognitive activity

2251
01:21:55,679 --> 01:21:57,600
not just happening on both sides of the

2252
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,920
communication partition but actually in

2253
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:02,960
a way where it's irreducible and it's a

2254
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:05,280
value add from both sides that's when

2255
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,360
we'll be doing science communication

2256
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:10,000
with the stars

2257
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,520
okay yep

2258
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:14,239
two four um we won't go into it that

2259
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:15,840
much but feel free to make any um

2260
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,080
comment that you like they give a case

2261
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,199
study

2262
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:22,000
of the common earthworm

2263
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,199
lumber chris

2264
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:27,120
terrestris so here's that wormy guy

2265
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:29,679
and they talk about some of the ideas

2266
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:30,800
that were brought up in the previous

2267
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,880
sections like

2268
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,719
counterfactuals in the niche and

2269
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:36,880
inferential efficiency and

2270
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:40,400
uh uploading of cognitive functions

2271
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,480
in the context of the worm anything

2272
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,400
you'd add about this or we can continue

2273
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,679
on

2274
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:47,679
just real quickly i mean i'm glad that

2275
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:49,840
they're introducing the second not just

2276
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:53,120
offloading but uploading but again i'm

2277
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:55,520
always sort of i always get a little

2278
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:57,360
sensitive around the idea that

2279
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:58,719
expediting

2280
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:01,920
is not expedition and and we we are sort

2281
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,760
of built to do both

2282
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:06,400
so optimization can sometimes just

2283
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,960
take take a longer path

2284
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:10,880
and so i'm again i'm not i'm not

2285
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,719
critiquing what they're saying here i

2286
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:14,159
understand what in the context of

2287
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:16,880
earthworms i don't know if there's a

2288
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:19,520
a magellan earthworm and or if one has

2289
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:21,199
been discovered yet

2290
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:23,520
so i i don't want to sort of drag this

2291
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,679
off into the into the wilderness but i

2292
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:27,520
do know that for us

2293
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:28,719
there is

2294
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:32,159
that aspect of our curiosity which we

2295
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:34,480
want to make sure that we don't toss

2296
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:36,159
away in terms of

2297
01:23:36,159 --> 01:23:37,040
bringing

2298
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:39,520
the example of the case study for

2299
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:40,400
cool

2300
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,480
just one note here um

2301
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:45,040
over multiple generations

2302
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:47,120
so that's both ecological in terms of

2303
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:49,040
the stigmatic niche construction of

2304
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:50,880
building the tunnel apparatus and it's

2305
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,800
evolutionary because there's a selective

2306
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,800
niche now inside of the ecological niche

2307
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,239
that selects for earthworms that are

2308
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:59,120
better at for example using tunnels and

2309
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:01,280
buildings sometimes rather than being

2310
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,440
the builder earthworm

2311
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:04,639
this comes at the cost of being

2312
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:07,040
evolutionarily glued to those cognitive

2313
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,520
extensions put bluntly

2314
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,440
cognitive niche construction smartens

2315
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,280
the world of the earthworm so that its

2316
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:16,080
physiology can remain dumb yet optimal

2317
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:17,199
in peace

2318
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:21,120
so from 24 years ago clark

2319
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:24,239
and so that's interesting to think about

2320
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:25,840
and it actually relates to a question

2321
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:29,360
that um joseph clarke asked in the chat

2322
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:32,560
um they wrote if we can model the

2323
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:34,719
environment as a sum of its states and

2324
01:24:34,719 --> 01:24:36,000
the state's

2325
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,520
environment

2326
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:39,120
what does this stay about what does this

2327
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:41,760
say about our capacity to create a super

2328
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:42,880
intelligence

2329
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,600
perhaps in an adapted structure to

2330
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,280
the deep generative model of mental

2331
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,120
action with the super intelligence

2332
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,960
acting as a tension over its states like

2333
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:52,480
people and frogs

2334
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,400
so this is kind of like saying

2335
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,000
okay um

2336
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,560
well just one thought it's not exactly

2337
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,480
what is being said is all right so we've

2338
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:01,920
talked about how there's this like

2339
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,679
extended active inference that's

2340
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:04,719
happening

2341
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:06,719
richly in a distributed way across

2342
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:08,639
multiple stars we're doing active with

2343
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:10,080
the stars

2344
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:12,960
but is that whole system

2345
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,000
one

2346
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,560
non-extended super intelligence

2347
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:18,159
or what is that

2348
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:20,400
extended system and what does that say

2349
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:22,320
about our ability to actually construct

2350
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:24,400
and work with different intelligences

2351
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:27,559
than human

2352
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,120
cool

2353
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:30,960
um three

2354
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,480
extended active inference so here's

2355
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:36,320
where we get to the eai parts

2356
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:41,840
what would you say about this

2357
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:46,320
well um

2358
01:25:48,159 --> 01:25:50,000
i have a lot to say but honestly i think

2359
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,440
i want to keep it to the point one on

2360
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:53,600
the point too because they're they're

2361
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:54,880
i'm not

2362
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:57,199
by nature the kind of person who wants

2363
01:25:57,199 --> 01:25:59,840
to critique and i'm not critiquing this

2364
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,280
but i can think of lots and lots of

2365
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:03,679
examples in my

2366
01:26:03,679 --> 01:26:05,920
my personal professional

2367
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,480
uh history where

2368
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:10,320
if you don't appreciate put bluntly

2369
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:12,159
cognitive niche construction smartens

2370
01:26:12,159 --> 01:26:14,080
the world of the earthworm so that its

2371
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:16,320
physiology can remain dumb yet optimal

2372
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,800
in peace that's been ignored in a lot of

2373
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:21,120
formal education settings so if we get

2374
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:23,440
there we'll talk about it and if we

2375
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:25,440
don't

2376
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:26,719
no problem

2377
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:29,520
great they do connect to

2378
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:32,159
um at least two minimum of two of course

2379
01:26:32,159 --> 01:26:34,880
and these are like extended in space and

2380
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:37,760
extended in time through time diacronic

2381
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:41,040
as opposed to sin chronic and so without

2382
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:42,080
um

2383
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:43,120
going too

2384
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:45,679
much into the quantum

2385
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:48,239
wormhole rabbit hole with space and time

2386
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:51,920
being constructs hashtag livestream4d

2387
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,679
those are at least just two ways we can

2388
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:55,679
think about extended cognition

2389
01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:56,639
okay

2390
01:26:56,639 --> 01:26:58,960
here's the sections that are in three

2391
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:00,239
and it'll be great to talk more about

2392
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:01,440
this in

2393
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,280
one and two

2394
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:05,760
in these sections they introduce

2395
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:08,320
three functions or aspects of the

2396
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:09,840
extended mind

2397
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:10,800
so

2398
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,560
the first of these

2399
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,719
features as they call them is a parity

2400
01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:17,719
principle

2401
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:20,719
the parity principle states that

2402
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:22,400
if a part of the world functions as a

2403
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:23,920
process which

2404
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:25,920
weren't done in the head we would have

2405
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:28,239
no hesitation in recognizing it as part

2406
01:27:28,239 --> 01:27:30,000
of the cognitive process then that part

2407
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,280
of the world is

2408
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:33,760
part of the cognitive process so if you

2409
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:35,679
can add two plus two in your head be

2410
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:37,679
right or wrong or whatever

2411
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:41,199
then it shouldn't be um qualitatively

2412
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:42,159
different

2413
01:27:42,159 --> 01:27:44,000
to think about two plus two on the

2414
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,360
calculator it's all part of this

2415
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:47,679
extended cognitive so parity just means

2416
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:50,000
like um

2417
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
if it's been rendered under caesar then

2418
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,560
it's equal

2419
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:56,880
the parity principle yeah

2420
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:59,280
okay no no that's that's right yeah the

2421
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:00,480
parity principle entails the second

2422
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:02,320
feature of the theory of extended mind

2423
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,000
which is the notion of a potential

2424
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,159
functional isomorphism between some

2425
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:08,639
internal and external states

2426
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:11,199
we discuss this a lot in the

2427
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:13,840
representations paper and what does

2428
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,520
active inference tell us about our

2429
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:17,120
representations of ourself and all of

2430
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:18,880
that so

2431
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:19,840
there's

2432
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:20,960
a lot

2433
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:23,040
packed into this notion of functional

2434
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:25,360
isomorphism what kind of functional

2435
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:27,520
isomorphism does the cognitive model

2436
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:28,960
have the same structure as the

2437
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:31,520
generative process or can it be just

2438
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,120
action oriented and of a totally

2439
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:34,719
different kind

2440
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:35,520
but

2441
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:36,960
suffice to say there has to be some

2442
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:38,480
functional connection

2443
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:39,920
and then the third piece that they

2444
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:42,880
introduce is this epistemic action

2445
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:45,040
these are actions that ease or optimize

2446
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:47,280
cognitive tasks by reducing the memory

2447
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:48,080
load

2448
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:50,400
required to perform a task so that's

2449
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:53,600
like space complexity

2450
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:55,199
by simplifying the computational

2451
01:28:55,199 --> 01:28:56,480
processing procedure

2452
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:58,239
time complexity

2453
01:28:58,239 --> 01:29:00,239
and by minimizing the probability of

2454
01:29:00,239 --> 01:29:03,360
error outcomes success probabilities

2455
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:06,560
so it's kind of like space time and then

2456
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:08,880
surprise

2457
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:11,280
and that's the cognitive dimension like

2458
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:12,719
we always hear about what would it be

2459
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:14,239
like when you're on the light beam and

2460
01:29:14,239 --> 01:29:15,520
when you're on the spaceship and when

2461
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,199
you're going into the black hole

2462
01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:19,520
in this objectivist frame

2463
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,520
as if the dimensions that mattered were

2464
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:23,679
like the objective space and time but

2465
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:26,639
once we swallow that cognitive pill or

2466
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:28,719
decide to let it course through us in

2467
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:30,239
our action

2468
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:31,600
all of a sudden there's the surprise

2469
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:32,719
dimension

2470
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:34,639
the element of surprise

2471
01:29:34,639 --> 01:29:35,920
and that's where some of these

2472
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:38,239
psychological aspects of the cognitive

2473
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:41,120
niche come into play

2474
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,040
and some of these citations are pretty

2475
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:45,360
interesting so as always like reading

2476
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:47,040
citations is awesome

2477
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:48,960
um

2478
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:49,760
so

2479
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:52,159
referring to the first of those features

2480
01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:53,920
that they talk about with the parity

2481
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,840
principle

2482
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:58,000
it's been suggested that external

2483
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,760
resources should meet the requirements

2484
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:01,840
of glue and trust

2485
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:03,679
so it's not just for first graders

2486
01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:05,679
anymore glue and trust

2487
01:30:05,679 --> 01:30:07,440
so that the resource is available when

2488
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:10,000
needed like biomemory and not subject to

2489
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,480
constant agentive scrutiny

2490
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:14,400
to ensure it is working as it should

2491
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:18,080
again like biomimicry biomembrane sorry

2492
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,520
in the point of view of extended active

2493
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,040
inference the trust condition is

2494
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:22,800
guaranteed by the uploading process

2495
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,639
whereby the agent learns to engage

2496
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:29,199
epistemic cues of the generative process

2497
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,639
this entails trading off

2498
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:35,440
onboard neurocognitive functions

2499
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:36,239
for

2500
01:30:36,239 --> 01:30:38,560
on-board environmental ones i wasn't

2501
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:39,840
actually sure if this was meant to be

2502
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,120
off-boarded

2503
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:44,080
environmental ones or if on-board here

2504
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:46,159
is still referring to our ship it's

2505
01:30:46,159 --> 01:30:48,960
still on board our ship but

2506
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:51,440
now the function is also distributed

2507
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:53,760
environmentally

2508
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:54,639
yeah

2509
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:56,480
but i i i kind of focused on the

2510
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:58,080
trade-off

2511
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:00,320
so

2512
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:03,280
it's it's

2513
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:05,360
you you you made a choice

2514
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:07,840
now was it the was it the proper one you

2515
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:10,480
won't you you hope that the stability of

2516
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:11,920
the thing that you

2517
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:14,239
that you've passed along to

2518
01:31:14,239 --> 01:31:16,400
remains robust and

2519
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:18,480
and constant

2520
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:20,719
so that's why it's a trade-off there's

2521
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:22,880
an assumption built in i think that's

2522
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,960
how i read it

2523
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:26,880
and they also write like for instance

2524
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:28,080
the earthworm is glued to its

2525
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:30,159
inheritance of burrows and moist soil

2526
01:31:30,159 --> 01:31:32,719
because the constraints of burrows soils

2527
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:35,199
etc have played on the earthworms

2528
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:37,440
evolution

2529
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:39,440
and then um we can imagine how an

2530
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:41,280
individual would become glued to their

2531
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:43,600
environment in a similar fashion over

2532
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:46,000
developmental and also evolutionary time

2533
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,679
skills like if we

2534
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:51,520
don't have fossil fuels tomorrow it's

2535
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:53,120
going to be tough but there would have

2536
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:55,040
been a time previously in history before

2537
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:57,600
we were glued to them like we are now

2538
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:00,639
and so it's like glue and trust and

2539
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:02,000
what does that enable what does it

2540
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,159
constrain and how does that relate to

2541
01:32:04,159 --> 01:32:06,080
this course graining and the parity

2542
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:07,920
principle

2543
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:10,960
okay epistemic actions so they write uh

2544
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:13,440
a notebook for instance can be viewed as

2545
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,600
supporting and easing the task of making

2546
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:16,960
it to your multiple appointments

2547
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:20,400
throughout the week because it can

2548
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:23,040
encode relevant information

2549
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:24,719
it can provide structures like a

2550
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:27,199
schedule and it can increase your

2551
01:32:27,199 --> 01:32:28,400
chances of making it to those

2552
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,320
appointments on time so it's the same

2553
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:31,199
three

2554
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:32,719
areas that we discussed earlier like

2555
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:34,960
space time and

2556
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:36,719
surprise

2557
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:40,199
about success

2558
01:32:40,239 --> 01:32:41,920
these intuitions are formalized by the

2559
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:43,520
process of uploading from the point of

2560
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:45,760
view of extended active inference but in

2561
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:48,000
addition by accounting for the relation

2562
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,920
between all these advantages

2563
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:52,320
also between slash among between is for

2564
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,719
two things and among us for more than

2565
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:56,159
two things

2566
01:32:56,159 --> 01:32:57,679
um and then here's a bunch of different

2567
01:32:57,679 --> 01:32:59,360
kinds of notebooks and then here's the

2568
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,840
computational one

2569
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:03,760
anything to add on this

2570
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:06,080
well traditionally i mean from a from a

2571
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:09,120
learning standpoint that the

2572
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:12,320
the epistemic actions tend to be placed

2573
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:15,120
into a planning paradigm whereas i see

2574
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:17,520
this more as the provisioning

2575
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:19,120
this is part of

2576
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:20,560
my kit

2577
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:23,520
so i kind of tend to step back and say

2578
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:24,880
um

2579
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:26,159
a journal

2580
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:28,239
a journal by itself or an assumption

2581
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:31,280
that journaling writing my ideas out in

2582
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:33,040
the traditional sense

2583
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:34,560
um

2584
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:36,960
isn't the same as i'm going to bring a

2585
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:39,440
journal along in case

2586
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:41,600
and then the encase being the counter

2587
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:42,960
factual right

2588
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:46,080
so again i'm in agreement with them but

2589
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:48,239
i don't necessarily i know that

2590
01:33:48,239 --> 01:33:49,520
that

2591
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:51,280
convention follows that you take one of

2592
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:52,480
these things along because you're

2593
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:53,760
planning

2594
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:56,159
and i'm not discounting planning i'm

2595
01:33:56,159 --> 01:33:58,800
just saying when it turns into a plan as

2596
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:01,040
opposed to it's one more

2597
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:03,840
source of uh or one more example of a

2598
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:07,360
provisioning exercise

2599
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:10,880
yes um one thought on that would be like

2600
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:12,800
the difference between

2601
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:15,920
um true step-by-step long-term planning

2602
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:18,480
planning as inference

2603
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:19,440
and

2604
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:22,159
a sort of nested planning approach where

2605
01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:24,639
it's like today i'm just gonna plan to

2606
01:34:24,639 --> 01:34:27,840
make time to pack my backpack

2607
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,199
and then

2608
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:31,440
i'll have a plan in the moment when i'm

2609
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:33,440
there with my backpack like i want to

2610
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:36,159
have the best possible plan but we're

2611
01:34:36,159 --> 01:34:38,560
like layers of uncertainty away from

2612
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:40,639
what actually might be that situation or

2613
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:41,920
the specifics

2614
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,239
but i want to have the right affordances

2615
01:34:44,239 --> 01:34:45,199
then

2616
01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:47,840
and so what are the plans that can be

2617
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:49,760
taken right now

2618
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:50,960
so that we can

2619
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:52,560
plan to plan

2620
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,080
instead of just treating planning as

2621
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:57,199
like being like before action and being

2622
01:34:57,199 --> 01:34:58,159
like we're just going to be in the

2623
01:34:58,159 --> 01:34:59,600
headquarters and we're going to plan out

2624
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:01,199
all the alternatives

2625
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:02,800
it's like how are we going to plan to

2626
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,719
plan and then once you go into the

2627
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:06,320
nested planning well then how are we

2628
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:07,920
going to plan to plan to plan and what

2629
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:09,280
should we be doing in the headquarters

2630
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:10,639
maybe we should be

2631
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:12,239
on the road by now

2632
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:13,040
yeah

2633
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:15,360
well it's just it's different versions

2634
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:18,159
and i think and as long as you can see

2635
01:35:18,159 --> 01:35:20,000
them as being different

2636
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,679
you're probably ahead of the person who

2637
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:22,960
automatically

2638
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:24,719
jumps to one conclusion of what this

2639
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:26,480
means so that's all

2640
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:29,199
great and then one other term um that

2641
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:30,000
they

2642
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:34,000
talked about is on diachronic cognition

2643
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,880
so they wrote the standard example used

2644
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:39,119
to explain diachronic cognition is that

2645
01:35:39,119 --> 01:35:42,400
of elizabethan theater companies

2646
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:45,040
uh in the work of triple 2005 evelyn

2647
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:46,960
triple distributing cognition in the

2648
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:47,920
globe

2649
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:49,760
theater

2650
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:52,880
and this paper is about how members of

2651
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:54,480
theater companies during the 16th

2652
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:56,719
century ad would manage to perform

2653
01:35:56,719 --> 01:35:58,239
multiple plays per week without being

2654
01:35:58,239 --> 01:36:00,719
able to rehearse due to time limitations

2655
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:02,320
so

2656
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:04,000
too real too real

2657
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,600
and the ability of the actors to

2658
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,840
memorize how to perform those plays

2659
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:09,440
depended on

2660
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:12,080
all kinds of embodied enacted and

2661
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:14,480
cultured et cetera et cetera et cetera

2662
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:16,400
like all the richness

2663
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,719
was there and is there

2664
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:22,000
and um then like this is just one quote

2665
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,239
from tribble's paper and then love to

2666
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:26,080
hear what you think about it

2667
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:28,560
so here's from king lear which is a

2668
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:30,960
shakespeare play that i love

2669
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:31,300
um

2670
01:36:31,300 --> 01:36:32,400
[Music]

2671
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:33,199
and

2672
01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:35,280
it's just interesting

2673
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:39,600
in this extended cognitive discussion

2674
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:42,960
to see the artifact of the text

2675
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:46,159
the written part that's like the trace

2676
01:36:46,159 --> 01:36:48,560
that we see and that's um when when

2677
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:50,639
fristen speaks of singing from the same

2678
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:53,040
hymn sheet this is kind of like this is

2679
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:54,960
the script i mean isn't the script like

2680
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:57,440
the dna isn't it the blueprint

2681
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:59,520
and then this actually reminds us that

2682
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:01,119
no there's actually hundreds of years of

2683
01:37:01,119 --> 01:37:03,679
discourse and discussion

2684
01:37:03,679 --> 01:37:06,560
around the enactments and what the trace

2685
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:07,600
means

2686
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,360
and so like

2687
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:10,880
meager argues what has eluded

2688
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:12,560
generations of editors

2689
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:14,400
is not likely to have been instantly

2690
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:16,960
grasped by the company originally

2691
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:18,960
mobilizing the play

2692
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:20,560
meager argues that shakespeare was

2693
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:22,239
expected

2694
01:37:22,239 --> 01:37:25,679
probably and preferred to be available

2695
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:28,400
plan to plan to speak to will

2696
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:30,080
get in the boat

2697
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:32,960
able to explain and install such designs

2698
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:35,040
as this yeah

2699
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:37,520
captain shakespeare was expected to be

2700
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:40,560
there and so that's why the trace isn't

2701
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:43,360
instructions

2702
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:45,840
it's kind of interesting too if you

2703
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:48,400
think about this because what does this

2704
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:50,639
say about a lot of stuff that goes on at

2705
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:52,719
the post-secondary level now which

2706
01:37:52,719 --> 01:37:53,920
you

2707
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:56,000
put a loop on it or put a bow on it when

2708
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,840
you when you

2709
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:59,280
have a conversation with somebody about

2710
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:02,159
your poster or your trifold

2711
01:38:02,159 --> 01:38:05,440
what is what has that got to do with a a

2712
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:08,880
a diachronic cognition

2713
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:09,920
um

2714
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:12,159
interesting right because

2715
01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:14,159
it's not the same thing what they're

2716
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:16,880
what they're essentially saying here is

2717
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:18,960
there's

2718
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:20,719
there's the context of how you would

2719
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:22,719
present a poster

2720
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:24,560
but then there's this

2721
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:27,280
which is appears

2722
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:30,000
i guess to the to the to the current

2723
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:33,280
viewer not the one 500 years ago as

2724
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:36,159
being this this thing being taking up a

2725
01:38:36,159 --> 01:38:38,480
lot more time

2726
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:40,000
but back then

2727
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,320
that was the default

2728
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:44,000
for those people who are time

2729
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,440
constrained

2730
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:47,199
so

2731
01:38:47,199 --> 01:38:49,280
again do we have it we have have we have

2732
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:52,000
we come up with a way of being able to

2733
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,840
demonstrate

2734
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:55,920
cognition today

2735
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:56,840
that

2736
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:58,560
um

2737
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:00,159
enables

2738
01:39:00,159 --> 01:39:01,199
this

2739
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:02,400
view

2740
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:04,159
i don't know i'm not i'm not again i'm

2741
01:39:04,159 --> 01:39:07,199
not criticizing i'm just saying what if

2742
01:39:07,199 --> 01:39:08,880
counterfactually

2743
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:11,600
this were the way that we were able to

2744
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:15,280
now give people an opportunity to say

2745
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:17,920
this was my niche construction as

2746
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:20,560
opposed to i got x number

2747
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:24,159
of answers correct on this form of

2748
01:39:24,159 --> 01:39:26,639
filter

2749
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:28,560
yeah when you when

2750
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:29,840
um

2751
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:31,040
this paper

2752
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:32,800
talks about pattern sociocultural

2753
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:35,199
practices mediated by material artifacts

2754
01:39:35,199 --> 01:39:37,360
populating the stage and across

2755
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:40,000
generational apprenticeship system and

2756
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,679
what you just said about

2757
01:39:41,679 --> 01:39:44,239
education this makes me think about the

2758
01:39:44,239 --> 01:39:45,440
phd

2759
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:46,639
system

2760
01:39:46,639 --> 01:39:48,239
and the idea that it could happen

2761
01:39:48,239 --> 01:39:50,239
without the materiality

2762
01:39:50,239 --> 01:39:53,119
or the intergenerational mentorship and

2763
01:39:53,119 --> 01:39:55,280
apprenticeship systems

2764
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:56,560
um

2765
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:58,960
it just wouldn't be the same cognitive

2766
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:01,119
system and i really liked what you said

2767
01:40:01,119 --> 01:40:03,520
there like the brain

2768
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:04,639
based

2769
01:40:04,639 --> 01:40:07,280
instructionist paradigm it it wants to

2770
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:09,679
put the student in the cubicle

2771
01:40:09,679 --> 01:40:10,960
into a different niche a different

2772
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:13,280
learning environment and then test them

2773
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:16,159
on the recall on the ability to like be

2774
01:40:16,159 --> 01:40:18,639
that api on the other side of the

2775
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:21,040
question response hotline

2776
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:23,040
and what else does it look like when we

2777
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:24,000
invite

2778
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,960
each student to create a cognitive niche

2779
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:28,320
which as we're discussing here is

2780
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:29,920
psychological

2781
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:32,080
and it's offloaded it's uploaded into

2782
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:34,159
the environment which could be digital

2783
01:40:34,159 --> 01:40:37,679
and then it's like i want to know that

2784
01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:40,080
you spent the time and attention

2785
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:42,880
i want to see your coda page with the

2786
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:45,280
questions that you wrote and i want to

2787
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:47,760
see some components of your cognitive

2788
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:48,880
niche

2789
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:50,639
and see where you're developing it and

2790
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:53,440
how you're developing it and

2791
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:55,360
public goods like parks there's people

2792
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:56,719
who prune the roses and there's people

2793
01:40:56,719 --> 01:40:59,600
who mow the grass there's people who

2794
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:01,840
make sure the trees are all good to go

2795
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:03,360
and those are all different kinds of

2796
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:05,679
niche maintenance practices

2797
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:07,360
and so in our

2798
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:08,639
broader

2799
01:41:08,639 --> 01:41:10,719
cognitive niche

2800
01:41:10,719 --> 01:41:13,280
how do we

2801
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:15,199
navigate

2802
01:41:15,199 --> 01:41:16,800
man

2803
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:18,880
here's their whole concluding stage

2804
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:19,920
right

2805
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:21,119
yeah

2806
01:41:21,119 --> 01:41:23,520
here's their whole concluding remark

2807
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:25,119
um the model of cognitive niche

2808
01:41:25,119 --> 01:41:26,560
construction proposed in this paper

2809
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:28,800
offers a formal apparatus for the study

2810
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:31,679
of non-brace non-brain based factors in

2811
01:41:31,679 --> 01:41:32,800
cognition

2812
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:33,600
so

2813
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:36,719
extended cognition as a starting point

2814
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:38,239
for modeling

2815
01:41:38,239 --> 01:41:40,719
not as a conclusion not like well

2816
01:41:40,719 --> 01:41:42,159
there's all these things in the niche

2817
01:41:42,159 --> 01:41:43,600
and there's the apprenticeship and then

2818
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:45,360
there's the ambiguity and so the

2819
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:48,000
conclusion of my paper is

2820
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,639
it's extended

2821
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:52,159
invert

2822
01:41:52,159 --> 01:41:53,440
that

2823
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:54,560
so that it's right

2824
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:57,040
starting with the notion of this

2825
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:59,760
extended distributed cognitive process

2826
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:03,520
and then apply the sense making

2827
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:06,400
to the modeling process in this holistic

2828
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:08,638
way

2829
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:11,360
the point stressed in the paper

2830
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:13,679
was that cognitive niche construction

2831
01:42:13,679 --> 01:42:15,440
can be studied as a shared cognitive

2832
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:16,560
functioning

2833
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:20,159
enabling organisms to track

2834
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:21,840
fractal

2835
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:25,840
often implicitly and at low cost

2836
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:27,280
and fractal

2837
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:29,440
cause effect relationships

2838
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:31,760
otherwise difficult if not impossible to

2839
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:33,040
track

2840
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:34,639
semicolon

2841
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:36,880
notably relationships where the causal

2842
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:39,280
structure is volatile

2843
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:41,440
or too complex to be learned

2844
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:44,880
by a single entity by a single nest mate

2845
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:47,360
and so as they close from the point of

2846
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:49,760
view of extended active inference eai

2847
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:51,360
all cognitive functions are in the game

2848
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:53,600
of tracking causal regularities and

2849
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:55,360
there's no principled reason to restrict

2850
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:58,080
this process to the boundaries of skin

2851
01:42:58,080 --> 01:42:58,960
skull

2852
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:02,639
or even individual agents

2853
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:04,719
so then how do we put it all into

2854
01:43:04,719 --> 01:43:07,040
practice

2855
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:10,000
what does applied extended active

2856
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,679
inference looks like

2857
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:13,440
um yes

2858
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:16,719
the four e a cognitive extended embedded

2859
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:20,800
and cultured inactive applied cognition

2860
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:24,239
and so definitely when we're in 41.1

2861
01:43:24,239 --> 01:43:26,239
we can talk about

2862
01:43:26,239 --> 01:43:29,600
applied slash applying

2863
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:31,520
i'm taking initiative

2864
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:33,600
that's a really critical thing like it's

2865
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:35,119
hard to do

2866
01:43:35,119 --> 01:43:36,719
you always hear people in in

2867
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:38,800
post-secondary education say well it's

2868
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:41,280
what you do with it it's right like

2869
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:43,600
there's a bit of a hand wiping aspect

2870
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:45,520
what's what you do with it

2871
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:47,840
but what this is saying is

2872
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:49,760
i think it's a little bit more than

2873
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:52,400
what i do with it so how do we set that

2874
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:53,440
stage

2875
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:56,239
so that it's not quite

2876
01:43:56,239 --> 01:43:59,440
so daunting to take the initiative

2877
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:01,119
the the what you do with it is the

2878
01:44:01,119 --> 01:44:04,080
hands-on that's you're the active person

2879
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:06,239
it's what you make of it it's the energy

2880
01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:07,840
you put in you're going to get back what

2881
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:10,880
you put into your phd

2882
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:12,560
that's

2883
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:14,800
you're the star of the show you're the

2884
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:17,199
main and only character in this dead

2885
01:44:17,199 --> 01:44:19,280
extended cognitive worlds

2886
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:20,960
right but what about when we're dancing

2887
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:23,840
with the phds and non-phds

2888
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:26,239
and we're actually applying together in

2889
01:44:26,239 --> 01:44:28,000
a shared cognitive niche

2890
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,239
and that cognitive niche includes other

2891
01:44:30,239 --> 01:44:32,880
stars who are also like sensing and

2892
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:36,239
acting and cognizing about us so applied

2893
01:44:36,239 --> 01:44:38,320
thinking through other minds and ways of

2894
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:39,360
knowing

2895
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:40,639
and then

2896
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:42,719
another question that we'll discuss in

2897
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:44,480
dot one

2898
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:45,440
dave

2899
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:47,199
was that there's often a point in these

2900
01:44:47,199 --> 01:44:48,719
active papers

2901
01:44:48,719 --> 01:44:49,600
about

2902
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:52,080
the um different kinds of partitioning

2903
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:53,840
and blankets there's anatomical

2904
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:55,760
mechanical there's functional

2905
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:58,000
psychological but there's a lot of

2906
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,679
different partitionings and different

2907
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:02,800
kinds of things come into play so what

2908
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:04,560
is the relation

2909
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:06,719
between the anatomical mechanical

2910
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:07,760
blankets

2911
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:10,159
so the skin and skull

2912
01:45:10,159 --> 01:45:12,880
yep and the functional psychological

2913
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:15,280
blankets this is kind of like brain and

2914
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:16,960
mind

2915
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:20,400
so how is that distinction related to

2916
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:21,440
nesting

2917
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:23,360
of similar or different kinds of

2918
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:24,560
blankets

2919
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:25,520
and then

2920
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:27,920
oh yeah where does the niche

2921
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:30,159
and the niches and the niches of each

2922
01:45:30,159 --> 01:45:32,400
other and the laterally interacting and

2923
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:34,960
the nested niches

2924
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:37,920
how does that all come together

2925
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:39,520
so yeah

2926
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:44,360
what are your penultimate thoughts dean

2927
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:45,920
well first of all i really appreciate

2928
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:48,159
the paper i think it's a fantastic paper

2929
01:45:48,159 --> 01:45:51,199
it's it's it i love inverting because i

2930
01:45:51,199 --> 01:45:53,199
think we're capable of doing that to

2931
01:45:53,199 --> 01:45:56,159
dave's point um i think we have this

2932
01:45:56,159 --> 01:45:57,679
ability to see the difference between

2933
01:45:57,679 --> 01:45:59,520
process and product or

2934
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:01,920
up and down or whatever dynamic and

2935
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:03,040
stable

2936
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:05,280
and arbitrariness

2937
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:07,040
seems to

2938
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:08,719
bother the people who want things to be

2939
01:46:08,719 --> 01:46:11,040
stable and stability seems to bother

2940
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:12,880
those people that want things to be

2941
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:14,639
creative and i think that's a perfect

2942
01:46:14,639 --> 01:46:15,679
world

2943
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:17,679
and so

2944
01:46:17,679 --> 01:46:19,440
every time i read one of these papers by

2945
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:22,320
axel and the other authors but

2946
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:24,560
in particular the two papers recently

2947
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:26,960
that we've now given a treatment to that

2948
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:29,600
i think axel was the primary author

2949
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:31,520
first author

2950
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:35,040
only author on 34 yes yeah i mean he he

2951
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:37,760
he brings things that

2952
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:39,520
at first

2953
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:40,560
our

2954
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:41,920
at first

2955
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:44,639
might seem counterintuitive compared to

2956
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:46,320
the way things traditionally have been

2957
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:47,280
viewed

2958
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:49,840
and he makes a very compelling case for

2959
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:52,080
why we might want to open a second eye

2960
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:54,560
to this he doesn't throw out

2961
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:56,880
the first thing he says maybe there's a

2962
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:59,600
new entailment that we might want to

2963
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:01,679
consider in this partitioning exercise

2964
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:02,719
we all

2965
01:47:02,719 --> 01:47:04,800
seem to participate in just

2966
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:05,920
different levels of degrees of

2967
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:07,840
sophistication so

2968
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:10,639
again i don't i'm not a i'm not a fanboy

2969
01:47:10,639 --> 01:47:12,719
or uh you know putting people up on

2970
01:47:12,719 --> 01:47:15,040
pedestals but i certainly respect

2971
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:16,000
uh

2972
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,600
the way that he's able to share this

2973
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:21,360
information and make it more accessible

2974
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:22,480
i think we can make it even more

2975
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:24,719
accessible if we can find real life on

2976
01:47:24,719 --> 01:47:26,719
the ground examples and i think that's

2977
01:47:26,719 --> 01:47:28,159
what we'll try to do in the forty one

2978
01:47:28,159 --> 01:47:30,480
one and two

2979
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:32,880
awesome agreed um

2980
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:35,840
axel gets those cogs spinning so as

2981
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:38,800
always axel thanks for the collaboration

2982
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:41,600
directly and indirectly and yeah this

2983
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:43,440
should be a great

2984
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:45,920
set of discussions in the dot one and

2985
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:47,360
dot two so

2986
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:50,080
dean thanks a ton for all the assistance

2987
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:52,639
uh before during and after here

2988
01:47:52,639 --> 01:47:54,159
and uh

2989
01:47:54,159 --> 01:47:56,560
to anyone else who's listening now or in

2990
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:59,119
the future or whenever just

2991
01:47:59,119 --> 01:47:59,920
come

2992
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:02,080
get involved and enact

2993
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:03,679
with us all the world's a stage

2994
01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:05,679
everyone's a critic we're all stars here

2995
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:07,040
etc

2996
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:12,040
thanks daniel really appreciate it bye

2997
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:44,639
you
