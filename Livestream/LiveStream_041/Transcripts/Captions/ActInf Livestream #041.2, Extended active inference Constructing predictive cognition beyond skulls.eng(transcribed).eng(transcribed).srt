00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,120
livestream number 41.2

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,239
it's april 13th 2022.

7
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,640
so welcome to the actin flap we're a

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,960
participatory online lab that is

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,280
communicating learning and practicing

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,520
applied active inference you can find us

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,520
at the links on this slide

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,440
this is recorded and an archived live

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,039
stream so please provide us with

14
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,039
feedback so that we can be improving on

15
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,320
our work

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,000
all backgrounds and perspectives are

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,079
welcome and we'll be following good

18
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,640
video etiquette for livestream and dean

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,000
and blue thanks a ton for joining

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,240
check out activeinference.org

21
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,640
to learn more about what the acting lab

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,600
is up to and how you can participate

23
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,960
today in

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,080
number 41.2 we are going to have our

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,040
third

26
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,759
discussion on the paper extended active

27
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:20,799
inference

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,080
michael kirchoff and carl fristen

31
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,400
we had a zero video

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,200
where we took a first pass a first coat

33
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,520
of paint on this paper

34
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,360
overviewed some of their distinctions

35
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,920
and their background and some context

36
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,560
and then we had a fun dot one last week

37
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,360
with all of us here and we went down a

38
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,799
few different paths

39
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,799
and

40
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,320
all i can say is with trust and glue

41
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,280
of

42
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,640
all of

43
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,040
us here and those who are watching live

44
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,880
who are welcome to write questions in

45
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,399
the live chat i think we'll get

46
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,240
somewhere pretty cool in the next two

47
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,799
hours but can't even know what shape it

48
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,240
will be then

49
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,038
so we can just start by saying hello and

50
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,000
then

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,410
we can

52
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,520
[Music]

53
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,800
pick up where we've left off

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,760
or we can go in any other direction so

55
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,000
i'm daniel i'm a researcher in

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,360
california and i think the part that i'm

57
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,840
looking most forward to exploring today

58
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,520
is that trust and glue and how do we

59
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,760
trust and glue

60
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,239
appropriately or adaptively and i'll

61
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,599
pass to d

62
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,599
thanks daniel i'm dean i'm in british

63
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,599
columbia at the moment

64
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,800
um i really like where you and blue

65
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,680
were

66
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,599
were going with this

67
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,720
um once i signed off last week and i was

68
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,080
particularly

69
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,160
interested in the idea of is the answer

70
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,599
in the question

71
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,120
because i thought that was a an

72
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,360
interesting

73
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,120
way of maybe looking at is there an

74
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,239
extended active inference component to

75
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,879
that so maybe you'll pick that thread up

76
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,080
again today i'll pass it to blue

77
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,720
i am blue i'm a researcher in new mexico

78
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,519
and

79
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,959
yeah trust and glue or um

80
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,840
you know what kind of improvisational

81
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,480
context do we use this extended active

82
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,239
inference like where is this kind of

83
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,840
um

84
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,920
thing necessary functional where do we

85
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,599
see it like what kinds of environments

86
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,519
maybe highlight extended active

87
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,959
inference that'd be interesting for me

88
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,280
to explore

89
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,799
awesome

90
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,440
so we have a few different

91
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,280
aspects we can

92
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,720
talk and return to some formalisms about

93
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,319
how are the equations connected

94
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,640
internally how are the formalisms

95
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,720
connected to one another how are the

96
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,040
extended active inference formalisms

97
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,280
framed in this paper connected to

98
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,319
earlier

99
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,159
or now that some time has passed since

100
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,400
the publication later formalisms in

101
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,239
active inference how are they connected

102
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,480
to the ideas that we've been discussing

103
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,760
we have

104
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,720
questions and answers

105
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,640
or answers and questions

106
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,120
what does that look like in the context

107
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,639
of extended active inference

108
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,440
perception

109
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,840
action learning teaching applying

110
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,720
finding discovering

111
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,400
a lot of ing

112
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,679
verbs and that is

113
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,280
hiding or

114
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,400
somehow

115
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,240
intertwined with this

116
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,639
question which is always

117
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,600
in the backdrop or the pre-drop or stage

118
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,600
right or something like that

119
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,400
with what takes us from a regime of

120
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,080
attention

121
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,320
or regime of intention

122
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,440
towards

123
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,400
active inference itself

124
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,199
and some specific model

125
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,360
so

126
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
where to go i think the most structured

127
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,000
of the operations here is to remind

128
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,400
ourselves of the formalisms and the

129
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,039
figures and then maybe we can come back

130
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,639
to any of these as we see does that

131
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,280
sound good

132
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,280
okay

133
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,159
okay

134
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,400
their equation one

135
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,919
is a

136
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,280
fairly typical

137
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,039
restatement of

138
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,080
bayes theorem so we won't dwell too much

139
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,280
on that

140
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,240
but it is relating to the decomposition

141
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,160
of a joint model

142
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,680
of

143
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,080
both observations and inferred latent

144
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,960
causes and the total model contains both

145
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,520
of those

146
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,600
yet it's able to be decomposed in some

147
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,400
amenable ways

148
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,240
equation 2

149
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,400
using variational inference one can

150
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,520
invert the likelihood in equation one

151
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,600
the probability of the hidden states

152
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,120
conditioned on observation

153
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,880
to approximate the posterior probability

154
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,440
of causes once a sensation has been

155
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,800
sampled

156
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,680
so

157
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,680
is this a twist dean

158
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,680
or what kind of inversion are we talking

159
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,280
about here when we go from thinking

160
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,160
about

161
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,759
the likelihood which is like the

162
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,360
probability of

163
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,120
there being a lightning strike

164
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,479
conditioned upon

165
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,039
what we actually observed

166
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,520
and that is now flipping to what are the

167
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,639
causes

168
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,759
given the sensation

169
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,520
well

170
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,280
here's a here's a question for both of

171
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,080
you

172
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,599
is there such a thing as a group

173
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,039
sensation

174
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,960
i mean if we if we think of it i mean

175
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,400
it's seldom that we would consider

176
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,240
ourselves

177
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,800
as a proportion of a

178
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,520
larger volume of energy when we find

179
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,360
ourselves in these contexts

180
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,520
and in these cultures

181
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,758
um

182
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,840
so what happens when we invert that idea

183
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,280
um

184
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,199
i'm one pie

185
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,400
in a whole collection of pies at a pie

186
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,280
shop

187
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,160
to

188
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,080
i'm some proportion

189
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,680
of

190
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,759
of a larger energy set

191
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,520
and then what are the implications of

192
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,759
that in terms of the kind of evidence

193
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,560
that i can or cannot gather

194
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,479
so that's my question for both of you

195
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:39,759
because you guys probably can answer

196
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,639
that better than i can

197
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,199
so i think we definitely experience

198
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,039
group sensation

199
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,960
um i think about like

200
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,319
the countries that are being bombed

201
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,319
right now and i think about like the

202
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,560
countries that when a tsunami hits like

203
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,199
there is definitely a group felt sense

204
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,440
of like terror that's like a group

205
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,440
sensation but also even on like a

206
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,440
positive note like i think about like

207
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,280
huge concerts and it's like a bunch of

208
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,120
people really having fun and that's kind

209
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,639
of another like group

210
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,840
sensation um like even like yeah those

211
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,960
kinds of

212
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,560
um

213
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,560
group things or even like large

214
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,039
meditation retreats is like another good

215
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,520
example of like a group sensation and it

216
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,520
does kind of get like

217
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,560
amplified or it feels like the sensation

218
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,240
is like going through a megaphone when

219
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,840
you know you're experiencing it with

220
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,958
5000 people or something like that so in

221
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,760
my experience

222
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,519
and does that change the formalism

223
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,839
like i mean i think we can identify it

224
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,240
but does that change the math or the way

225
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,000
that we measure that

226
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,200
base it based on the source of

227
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,640
affective

228
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,920
sensing within within one agent versus

229
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,000
that collective

230
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,680
measure i think i think it just changes

231
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,719
where we put the blanket

232
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,720
doesn't change the math though

233
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,120
i think it just changes where we put the

234
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,000
blanket like like so so if you have a

235
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,760
bigger blanket you know there's there's

236
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,920
more components

237
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,560
um you know like you would separate the

238
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,560
group of people that are experiencing

239
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,640
the concert from a group of people that

240
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,880
are about to experience a tsunami you

241
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,399
know there's like a huge partition and

242
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,000
it's it's

243
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,160
the same as separating two different

244
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,760
people mathematically it's just

245
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,600
separating groups of people like as

246
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,920
mathematically we are groups of

247
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,880
cells tissues organs so i think that the

248
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,959
the only difference is just what's under

249
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,920
that markov blanket

250
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,640
all right a few cool

251
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,800
points to make so

252
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,000
you asked about group sensations

253
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,399
and if we were in a

254
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,360
unidirectional signa signal processing

255
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,600
paradigm

256
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,440
the question could be approached like

257
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,279
what are the outside signals that come

258
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,360
in and how do those diffuse through the

259
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,839
group

260
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,839
what does that look like when

261
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,360
we've taken a step towards thinking

262
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,839
about perception as inference as a

263
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,360
generative inference so what are groups

264
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,480
expecting

265
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,480
so what is the same way that we talk

266
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,800
about perception cognition and affect

267
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,880
and memory anticipation planning as

268
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,160
inference of entities

269
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,240
what does it mean for the group to not

270
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,360
just be passively receiving sensations

271
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,399
but to be

272
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,440
engaged in active inference so that's

273
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,800
going to be a

274
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,240
a

275
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,320
big question and i'll leave it for

276
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,720
another brief break to write out a few

277
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,200
more options here but i think what blue

278
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,440
said about it depends on where the

279
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,920
blanket is drawn or how the model is

280
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,600
phrased relates to the composability of

281
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,160
active inference and the way that it's

282
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,360
kind of like

283
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,480
blocks

284
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,680
that play nice together laterally

285
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,560
as well as in a nested fashion

286
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,680
including

287
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,519
a nice little tuck at the end so let me

288
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,680
explain by what i mean there

289
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,720
the way that they interact laterally is

290
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,640
it's a framework that allows you to

291
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,399
simulate one ant or many ants because

292
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,480
one can just have

293
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,480
more and more entities in the same

294
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,800
lateral level or scale that are

295
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,200
interacting with the same environment

296
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,959
and or with each other whether that's

297
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,880
like direct contact or with

298
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,360
communication because all that one needs

299
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,120
to specify is the entity model and then

300
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,240
their

301
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,800
perception their oom felt basically and

302
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,240
their action selection like their

303
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,560
affordances so if we know

304
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,880
where where the blanket is

305
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,320
that was the system of interest that's

306
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,760
the entity the ant and then what goes

307
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,279
both directions

308
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,079
that

309
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,480
allows composability of a thousand ants

310
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,959
just like one but then the key piece

311
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,959
with the nesting

312
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:01,920
is

313
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,839
even if we only

314
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,040
write down

315
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,800
a single layer active model so the mouse

316
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,160
in the t maze or just a single layer

317
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,240
it's not a deep nested

318
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,560
hierarchical model

319
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,120
we can actually still interpret

320
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,480
that

321
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,720
graphical model

322
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,519
as

323
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,639
abstracting or receiving

324
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,560
other models that we didn't directly

325
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,079
formalize

326
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,200
um

327
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,480
so it was discussed in in the textbook

328
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,959
and in other sources of like we could

329
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,120
make an active inference model of one

330
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,279
brain region with the inputs as sense

331
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,680
states and the outputs as action states

332
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,000
and then in that single brain region

333
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,880
model

334
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,959
those input states

335
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,360
it can just be like that's where

336
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,560
the black box is there's just

337
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,360
um an inability to actually do modeling

338
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,519
on the details of what's coming in we're

339
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,040
just going to leave it at some sort of

340
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,720
stochastic process coming in

341
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,120
so it kind of like tucks all the

342
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,839
uncertainty

343
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,959
away

344
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,120
into

345
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,519
this hidden little corner and then we're

346
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,959
going to interface with that uncertainty

347
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,959
as it becomes

348
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,680
recognized by the system of interest or

349
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,160
one could make another model of that

350
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,000
second brain region and it could have

351
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,760
its own perception action states but

352
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,040
then that too

353
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,040
would have inputs coming from elsewhere

354
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,040
and actions going elsewhere so i think

355
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,600
there's probably more to unpack and

356
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,959
explore here but this

357
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,279
hopefully speaks to the composability of

358
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,399
active inference models to implicitly

359
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,040
contain nested subsystems like we could

360
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,519
do an active inference model of a person

361
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,360
and recognize that they consist of

362
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,720
organs and cells and organelles and

363
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,199
go all the way down to however small

364
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,160
and

365
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,560
we can compose down and dig down

366
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,440
or compose up as the extended

367
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,279
perspective hopefully will have us look

368
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,079
at

369
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,279
but

370
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,800
we get to be making our

371
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,639
single layer model

372
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,240
implicitly

373
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,959
within a more composable structure

374
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,360
than many other families of modeling

375
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,880
might allow for

376
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,079
so that might give a ability to compare

377
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,680
alternative ways of looking at

378
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,519
multi-scale extended systems

379
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,440
but it will be more like a comparison of

380
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,079
relative free energies or relative model

381
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,040
fits

382
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,120
rather than some sort of ad hoc

383
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,519
comparison that we're applying based

384
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,480
upon

385
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,880
a desire for simplicity or desire for to

386
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,920
see this many levels

387
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,959
i wonder in the sense that i understand

388
00:14:58,959 --> 00:14:59,920
that

389
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,680
you can have the

390
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,000
you can have the single land and you can

391
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,480
you can find the average in the eco evo

392
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,360
devo as you pointed out in

393
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,480
in

394
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,199
earlier versions of this set of

395
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,199
of um live streams

396
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,279
and you can also look at the entire

397
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,320
colony

398
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,480
and look at it and find an average of

399
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,519
its behavior over hiko evo and devo as

400
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,199
well

401
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,880
but that's why i'm not i'm not

402
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,880
questioning whether or not

403
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,120
the

404
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,399
if you use if you use one type of math

405
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,440
and you just decide which

406
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,320
which

407
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,240
partition you're going to make that

408
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,240
that's going to kick out a certain

409
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,000
expected kind of

410
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,480
of average what i'm what i'm

411
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,480
kind of curious about is

412
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,360
um

413
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,160
in the synchronicity question so we all

414
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,800
go to the concert for example

415
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,720
we all anticipate because this is the

416
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,120
anticipatory part we all anticipate

417
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,000
having a good time how do we build that

418
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,040
into

419
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,680
what the actual result is when we all

420
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,560
start singing along to the chorus

421
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,480
because i don't know

422
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,040
i don't know if there's a math for that

423
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,399
quite yet

424
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,160
and that's all i'm basically asking i'm

425
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,399
not i'm not questioning the formalism

426
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,560
per se i'm just saying if we build up

427
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,320
how does that affect

428
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,560
what the equations are telling us versus

429
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,800
if we as you said daniel

430
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,800
maybe collapse down

431
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,880
and what the math tells us there there's

432
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,480
going to be an average that gets kicked

433
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,600
out so

434
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,680
not arguing

435
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,759
i'm not ignoring that i'm just saying i

436
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,839
think there is an anticipatory piece to

437
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:42,720
this

438
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,560
when we're talking about extended active

439
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,040
inference and what we should be able to

440
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,480
anticipate what that surprisal should be

441
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,120
and what ends up happening when

442
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,279
um

443
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,680
those external controls in terms of

444
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,639
rules

445
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,959
play their part and what each

446
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,880
individual's heuristics that they bring

447
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,280
to the collective play their part and

448
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,119
what that how that all sort of

449
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,000
transpires into something which can be

450
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,919
measured and other parts of which may

451
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,119
still be

452
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:18,198
way too untractable that's all

453
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,640
blue any thoughts

454
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,439
no i i think uh

455
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,520
i don't know i said what i

456
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,600
needed to say i think um

457
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,400
it scales differently for for me than

458
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,960
how dean perceives it i think

459
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,200
i'm gonna bring in another

460
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,600
resource here so this is from the uh

461
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,480
the 2021 paper felix scholler mark

462
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,520
miller roy salomon and carl fristen

463
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,160
and it's trust as extended control human

464
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,640
machine interactions as active inference

465
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,080
so

466
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,240
staying on this trust and glue and

467
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,200
extended anticipatory theme

468
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,440
so here is one figure that they have

469
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,919
okay

470
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,200
on the left side is a

471
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,640
uni dimensional scalar perspective on

472
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,840
trust

473
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,400
so this is like from zero to ten or one

474
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,480
could think that zero is the threshold

475
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,799
pass through zero rather than passing

476
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,240
through five

477
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,000
do not collect two hundred dollars on

478
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,280
your way through five but you might on

479
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,640
the way through zero

480
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,520
and we have negative trust

481
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,679
as well as like positive complete trust

482
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,200
with

483
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,200
various associations we could make like

484
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,400
having aligned interest or um shared

485
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
affection

486
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,799
they then expand

487
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,160
that

488
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,760
uni-dimensional

489
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,919
perspective into like a two-dimensional

490
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,840
perspective on trust

491
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,520
and they separate out the x-axis and the

492
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,080
y-axis as being trustworthiness and

493
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,080
trust and we've been talking about glue

494
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,520
and trust so let's keep the glue and

495
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,799
trust

496
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,640
rattling around as we think about this

497
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,559
later work which

498
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,559
undoubtedly is building upon the current

499
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,240
paper we're discussing

500
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,840
and so

501
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,280
on the y equals x line

502
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,280
where the trust and the trustworthiness

503
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,640
evaluations are equivalent that is where

504
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,799
you have justified trust

505
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,360
meaning like high sense of trust felt

506
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,480
sense of trust in a trustworthy system i

507
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,280
believe the glue is strong and the glue

508
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,080
is manifestly strong i believe the glue

509
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,240
is weak and it's breaking all the time

510
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,880
so that's on the y equals x line and

511
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,440
that's like a manifold which is to say a

512
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,440
lower dimensional line in a higher

513
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,840
dimensional state space that actually is

514
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,840
this uni-dimensional one so we can

515
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,480
imagine that being like at an angle and

516
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,640
being the y equals x line

517
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,400
what is opening it up into multiple

518
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,880
dimensions allow us to talk about

519
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,679
well

520
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:02,480
it's

521
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,520
allowing

522
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,880
other quadrants to be explored where the

523
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,039
perceived sense of trust may differ

524
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,280
from the

525
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,600
objective or the relational

526
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,559
trust

527
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,559
and so it's sort of like separating out

528
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,400
cognitive versus the behavioral

529
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,720
dimensions of trust like would you

530
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,760
rather

531
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,760
be the person that people behaviorally

532
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,039
trust like they give their keys to you

533
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,799
but then they're always having the

534
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:31,919
sentiment

535
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,440
or having the communications that that

536
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,200
person's untrustworthy

537
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,919
or would you rather have the lip service

538
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,600
or the cognitive lip service of people

539
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,360
thinking and feeling and maybe even

540
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,280
speaking like they trust you but then

541
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,120
when it comes down to it there's no

542
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,520
actual behavioral trust there so they

543
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,559
explored that in the context of

544
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,159
human robotic interactions and

545
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,440
technology

546
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,200
so then let's just look at the second

547
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,880
one and then it'll be awesome to hear

548
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,679
what you two think or anyone in the chat

549
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,679
here they're looking at

550
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,120
generations of technology

551
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,000
along with their adoption curves

552
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,360
and the ways in which they enable

553
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,640
empowerment

554
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,440
and so the three rows here

555
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,640
are like the sort of mobility

556
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,400
genre

557
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,960
of the legs embodied

558
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,720
moving into the extended and then

559
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,159
cultured with like the horses and the

560
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,280
cars there's like a weaponry genre or a

561
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,799
sport hunting

562
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,720
for those who want to

563
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,640
and then there's a navigation and

564
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,640
orientation which even came up in our

565
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,960
discussion last time about

566
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,880
cloud-based map services and how that

567
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,480
leads to changes like in our spatial

568
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,480
navigation and especially as we'll be

569
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,799
exploring in 42 upcoming

570
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,240
what if the neurobiology of navigation

571
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,720
is deeply intrinsic to ourselves so what

572
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,440
is actually happening to ourselves

573
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,039
as the navigational technology

574
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,600
becomes something that we trust

575
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,200
something that we

576
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,080
glue to and so here they're just showing

577
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,360
that there's this um spiral

578
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,240
of increasing empowerment like an

579
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,200
individual who's in the v3 tech stack

580
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,320
here

581
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,159
has certain

582
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,080
constraints and affordances and just

583
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,400
simply differences not even

584
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,480
better except on specifically defined

585
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,679
axes

586
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,280
than those in the v1 tech stack so

587
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,600
where do some of these representations

588
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,360
or points that are raised in the later

589
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,960
shoulder paper

590
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,840
speak to either of you

591
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,000
do you have something to happen to that

592
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,039
blue

593
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,880
so i'm not like really getting this

594
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,880
empowerment time adoption like without

595
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,559
reading the paper it's just like not

596
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,159
clicking for me

597
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,600
so i have to i guess catch up um in this

598
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,840
trust versus extended control

599
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,799
yes totally agreeing and um definitely

600
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,640
the the real time

601
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,159
uh

602
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,320
interpretation is um

603
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,919
non-trivial so let's just look at what

604
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,840
they defined there

605
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,159
to measure the amount of control or

606
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,520
influence an agent has and perceives

607
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,840
klubin at all proposed the concept of

608
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,000
empowerment empowerment is a property of

609
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,799
self-organized adaptive systems and is a

610
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,880
function of the agent perception action

611
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,840
loop

612
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,840
more specifically the relation between

613
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,559
sensors and actuators of the organism as

614
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,799
induced by interactions between the

615
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,720
environment and the agent's morphology

616
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,960
so this goes back to like the definition

617
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,720
of agency and where we were talking

618
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,960
about empowerment as like a definable

619
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,799
measurable metric on a live stream

620
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:01,919
recently

621
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,440
you remember that now it's starting to

622
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,880
kind of click in

623
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,559
um

624
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,120
but but we were talking about that

625
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,640
like the um capacity of an entity to

626
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,559
realize their preferences

627
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,480
like you can have all the preferences in

628
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,039
the world on a given on the temperature

629
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:19,919
of

630
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,520
the that day but on that dimension

631
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,679
one's empowerment like their capacity

632
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,440
for action selection

633
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,640
to have

634
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,840
impact a causal impact

635
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,559
on

636
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,799
what is being preferred

637
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,320
that is minimal

638
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,640
versus one can be empowered and um not

639
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,600
even care

640
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,360
and they could have the power to to

641
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,080
modify something and yet not

642
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,880
approach that potentially seriously

643
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,720
yeah so it's clicking now it's making a

644
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,799
little bit more um sense but i'm still

645
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,120
not really getting this graph

646
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,120
the the um

647
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,960
i understand like empowerment over

648
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,400
time i guess

649
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,360
i mean

650
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,720
like if you think about a graph of a

651
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,960
human we become more empowered we're

652
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,840
like a

653
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,080
uh inverted parabola right so like we

654
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,080
become more empowered as time goes on

655
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,080
and then less empowered as we you know

656
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,120
age and

657
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,200
become less able to care for ourselves

658
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,480
we're unable at the beginning and then

659
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,960
we max empowerment and then like least

660
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,880
empowerment towards the end of our life

661
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,080
or or if we live to be you know 110 or

662
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,760
whatever not always true the end of life

663
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,760
gets a little weird it's a wiggly trail

664
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,360
off line

665
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,440
that that reminds me of um

666
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,200
the classic riddle

667
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,240
what has

668
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,080
four legs in the morning

669
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,000
two legs in the midday and then three

670
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,559
legs at night

671
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,520
it's a person

672
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,799
yeah

673
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,039
and then also um

674
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,320
let's look at what they mean by these

675
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,159
like flex because there's a few other

676
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,159
pieces of course that this paper is um

677
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,919
bringing in and then we'll kind of

678
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,240
return to the trust and glue of the

679
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,679
constant at all

680
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:58,880
so

681
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,679
of course it's a simplification

682
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,400
the important idea here is that

683
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,840
the inflection point flex

684
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,919
indicating the start of technological

685
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,440
decay

686
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,120
reflects the abandoned rate of a

687
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,120
practice as the experience of better

688
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,200
predicted slopes of extended

689
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,840
technological engagement

690
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,320
lead to disengagement of non-extended

691
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,799
approaches

692
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,840
cars replace horses replacing legs

693
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,640
old slopes are less than expected

694
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,440
and so unsatisfactory as compared to new

695
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,760
ones

696
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,400
so it's a

697
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,159
uh technology adoption

698
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,039
model

699
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,840
and often we just see the s-curve part

700
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,159
of the adoption and people will say like

701
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,400
well here's how fast telegraph was

702
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,880
adopted then the radio then the tv then

703
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,720
the internet and so one can look at

704
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,880
these s-curves of adoption and sometimes

705
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,120
they like start low they go up and then

706
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,039
they flatten out and then it's sort of

707
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,960
like look the technology's at 100

708
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,080
adoption

709
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,400
this is also showing not just the rise

710
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,400
of empire but the decline

711
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,480
where we're seeing the

712
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,960
retraction of use from a given

713
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,279
technology and isn't it funny that we

714
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,440
may have actually you know used our legs

715
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,480
less

716
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,320
as other technologies come into play

717
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,320
like just the steps per day

718
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,200
so we have each of these technologies

719
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,240
stacks

720
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,200
that they're modeling here have like a

721
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,799
curve of adoption

722
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,200
and also a curve by which they're no

723
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,679
longer in use

724
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,240
with many simplifications as people can

725
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,559
hopefully charitably interpret

726
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,559
and what they're pointing to

727
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,360
is actually that the inflection point

728
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,000
of the next generation

729
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,480
when things are like when it's moving as

730
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,640
fast adoption is increasing as fast as

731
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,679
it's going to increase for this new tech

732
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:56,960
occurs

733
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,799
basically

734
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,360
it must be occurring during the decline

735
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,159
the peak or the decline phase

736
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,240
of the previous generation of glue

737
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,000
because

738
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,600
unless the technologies can be

739
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,039
coexisting in use but

740
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,399
they're looking a little bit more like

741
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:24,799
technologies that replace one another

742
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,840
so it's interesting here because

743
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,840
legs are actually glued to you

744
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,120
whereas like horses can wander away or

745
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,320
be stolen so there's like an

746
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,240
intermediate level of glue but like cars

747
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,480
are like you know or horses are like the

748
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,039
most likely to to go away and then cars

749
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,399
are you know not

750
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,279
they have no agency themselves so they

751
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,880
can kind of be glued a little bit more

752
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,399
tightly so horses are like the least

753
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:51,760
amount of glue and cars are like the

754
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,960
most amount of glue it's interesting

755
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,320
yes like

756
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,559
yes dean

757
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,360
so um

758
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,120
i have relatives who have a ranch in the

759
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,039
in the um

760
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,320
wine growing

761
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,799
um part of british columbia

762
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,559
and in a in a strange conversation

763
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,799
i asked my relative who has a number of

764
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:17,840
horses

765
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,600
would he ever consider

766
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,440
instead of people being

767
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,960
carted around in

768
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,240
many buses

769
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,440
from

770
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,000
winery to winery on a wine tour given

771
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,440
the proximity

772
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,039
to a number of

773
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,240
vineyards

774
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,159
would he ever consider

775
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,760
uh

776
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,960
taking

777
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,399
his

778
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,279
his horses and and putting a business

779
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,520
plan together around having people go

780
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,480
from vineyard to vineyard on horseback

781
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,320
and he laughed me off in a like in a

782
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,240
heartbeat because he said no i think

783
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,399
that would be very dangerous people with

784
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,880
drinking too much wine and

785
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,480
and

786
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,720
trying to stay on their horse

787
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,600
but then he came back to me later on

788
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,679
and said i maybe i was too dismissive of

789
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:04,640
that

790
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,880
because of the novelty aspect of it and

791
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,120
if you could actually control

792
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,880
the nature of because he's got great

793
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,000
horses i've ridden on his horses a lot

794
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,600
but if you could actually control that

795
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,640
situation the novelty of that

796
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,919
means that the people that would

797
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,240
participate in that would actually be

798
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,559
doing something very unique and very

799
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:25,600
novel

800
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,679
and so that reversion back to something

801
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,520
that's not necessarily

802
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,480
seen as being something super efficient

803
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,159
is actually something that can be

804
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,080
something that's very attractive and

805
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,200
extend that generative model

806
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,799
now we haven't followed through on that

807
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:41,919
that was

808
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,840
that was mid pandemic

809
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,640
but just this conversation right here i

810
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,640
find it really well i

811
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,799
find it kind of disturbing because to

812
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,760
have all of that now come rushing back

813
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,360
a year and and

814
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,120
five months later

815
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,120
kind of tells me whoa what what hap

816
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,440
what's going on here but it's that it's

817
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,240
that

818
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,240
it's that sense that in the collective

819
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,080
extended act of inference in that

820
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,640
probability of what portion of a

821
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,279
population would actually find this

822
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,360
interesting instead of just dismissing

823
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,039
it out of hand and saying no that would

824
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,440
be a logistical nightmare

825
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,440
um

826
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,919
you incorporate base right you actually

827
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,000
see as well maybe there is a percentage

828
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,919
of the population that would actually

829
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,720
see this as something really unique as

830
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,640
long as it's not something that's

831
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,320
unmanageable right

832
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,919
so i had no idea that you were going to

833
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,640
bring this up i'd have no absolutely no

834
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,200
idea what the comparison is of

835
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,240
empowerment to the adoption uptake of

836
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,279
that particular offering but i do find

837
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,519
it really curious right now that it here

838
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,919
it comes again it's popping up again and

839
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,840
it's not a constructivist thing so much

840
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,919
as it's

841
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,399
holding open the idea that there is

842
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,880
not necessarily a whole bunch of people

843
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,399
that just want to

844
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:03,840
be

845
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,399
housed in a in a minivan

846
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,360
what's the what's the possibility then

847
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,880
so it's actually pretty interesting in

848
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,200
terms of this extended active inference

849
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,840
right it's not optimization in the in

850
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,960
the conventional sense of well we can

851
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,200
now get nine wineries in four hours

852
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,399
maybe it's a an all day thing and people

853
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:27,360
actually

854
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,960
tell all their friends what a great

855
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,480
experience they had

856
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,159
so you you look at the model a little

857
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,240
their generative model is inverted

858
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,840
i hate to break it to you dean but the

859
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,720
idea is not that novel

860
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,120
well there you go well so where i live

861
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,200
um i live like really pretty far out in

862
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,120
the middle of nowhere and there's one

863
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:47,919
bar

864
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,880
like within maybe a 25 mile radius

865
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,279
and people ride their horse to the bar

866
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,960
and there's hitches for the horse where

867
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,039
you can tie the horses outside uh i

868
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,559
drove daniel up that road so he knows

869
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,640
he's been he's driven right past it so

870
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,240
there's hitches where you can tie your

871
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,840
horse and to go to the bar and drink it

872
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,159
and people actually have been cited for

873
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,360
dwi on horseback um after leaving the

874
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,279
bar

875
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,720
also the the cinque terre is um amazing

876
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,679
uh a little series of five towns in

877
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,799
italy and there's no cars um i mean they

878
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,640
say that no cars there are these tiny

879
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,440
little baby like trash trucks and like

880
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,440
fedex delivery trucks but like there's

881
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,200
no roads that a car could actually drive

882
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,519
on just these little tiny like

883
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,159
car like things but you have to get you

884
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,640
have to arrive by boat or by train and

885
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,480
people take horseback from you know

886
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,919
through these five little towns that's

887
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,399
they do horse tours and wine it's a

888
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,080
five little towns that what they do is

889
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,840
make wine so like that's definitely like

890
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,840
a winery tour and there's a beautiful

891
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,919
beach and yeah it's really kind of nice

892
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,200
so so

893
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,960
maybe novel in the area and there's some

894
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,519
value always to that but uh i yeah i had

895
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,360
to bring up the the closest bar to my

896
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,279
house where there's horse hitches i'm

897
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,559
actually at the family dollar which is

898
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,399
like also the only store near where i

899
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,880
live i've seen people tie their horse to

900
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,480
like the handicapped parking signs in

901
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,239
the front of the store

902
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,719
classic two things one shout out for the

903
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,800
gelato in rio magiori

904
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,839
and two

905
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,280
i could just see

906
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,280
because i've been to the to the well i

907
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,199
haven't been in the french laundry but

908
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,679
that famous restaurant in napa

909
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,480
that's up from napa bit but but i never

910
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,599
saw

911
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,480
like

912
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,199
a dozen people riding by on their horses

913
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,359
but i could just imagine for the people

914
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,679
who are going there that wouldn't seem

915
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,119
out of place

916
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,399
so yeah

917
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,118
two shout outs

918
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,239
here's an interesting pattern so

919
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,119
let's

920
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,520
review figure 1 and 2 just briefly

921
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,480
because that's

922
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,079
that's one of the key contributions it's

923
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,159
also some of the formalism so

924
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,679
um we are

925
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,199
taking it fast but then we'll take it

926
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,560
slow

927
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,079
in figure one we saw the standard action

928
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,000
perception loop that we've seen in

929
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
different guises

930
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,760
where we have

931
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,680
perception and cognition

932
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,520
as being a process of

933
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,440
optimization and that is what the

934
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,760
variational approach enables

935
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,800
so that's what they write here um

936
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,320
variational inference converts an

937
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,400
inference problem into an optimization

938
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,960
problem articulated by equation three so

939
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,800
that's where we went from

940
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,200
the bayesian decomposition

941
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,920
into this variational approach

942
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,160
variational because there's this q

943
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,920
distribution that we control and we're

944
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,079
minimizing a divergence between a

945
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,760
distribution that we're in control of

946
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,599
that's simplified from a family that's

947
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,920
very tractable to study from this true

948
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,480
posterior which is inferred and then we

949
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,280
go from that variational phrasing of

950
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,480
this inversion to an optimization that

951
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,720
helps us solve it

952
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,320
that's what we're seeing in figure one

953
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,839
there's optimization happening at the

954
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:59,599
cognitive part of the partition and at

955
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,599
the action part

956
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,400
the sensory inputs are not being chosen

957
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,880
by the entity directly they can engage

958
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,200
in active inference to take action

959
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,720
selection that then brings

960
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,280
predictability and control to sensations

961
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,359
perceptual control theory however those

962
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,119
are not directly being controlled or

963
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,359
optimized so that was figure one and we

964
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:20,880
talked about how on the other side of

965
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,920
the table there still is this stochastic

966
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,680
dynamical equation

967
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,720
reflecting how external states depend on

968
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,320
their prior

969
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,359
states

970
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,119
and on action so we still have this

971
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,640
interactive

972
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,160
external states

973
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:36,960
with

974
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,520
potentially complex and self-reinforcing

975
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,680
dynamics that's emitting sense states

976
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,720
and so it goes in figure two

977
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,280
that gets brought into the extended

978
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,839
active inference space because now on

979
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:51,599
the other side of the table from our

980
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,800
star system of interest the brain here

981
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,119
is also something looking more like an

982
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,640
argument

983
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,440
of

984
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,119
previous external states and action

985
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,359
selection rather than looking more like

986
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,320
a stochastic differential equation so

987
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,400
now we have extended active inference

988
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,800
because there's like an adaptive

989
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,119
cognitive process happening on both

990
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,520
sides of the blanket

991
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,640
and that

992
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,440
provides this new interpretation

993
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,880
of what is crossing the boundary

994
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,520
as being joint self-evidencing and part

995
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,079
of a joint optimization process even if

996
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,760
these two

997
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,920
different arguments are quite different

998
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,400
from each other okay so that's also

999
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,800
where figure four came into play

1000
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,640
the same way that figure one developed

1001
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,040
into figure two from the

1002
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,640
mirror active inference on the other

1003
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,720
side of the table to the adaptive on the

1004
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,240
other side of the table

1005
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,839
in equation two we were looking at the

1006
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,839
variational optimizable

1007
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,920
approximation of figure one

1008
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,560
and in equation four we're looking at

1009
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,480
the variational

1010
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,200
optimizable equation describing

1011
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,079
basically figure two

1012
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,800
let's return to our discussion on

1013
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,800
trusting control and glue and tech and

1014
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,200
all of this

1015
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,920
even before there was spears if we were

1016
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,839
gonna have v zero we could have

1017
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,440
legs hands

1018
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,040
and

1019
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,320
some

1020
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,000
embodied

1021
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,599
navigational

1022
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,000
onboard perspective so that's the pure

1023
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,440
bioware

1024
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,000
stack v0

1025
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,040
and then

1026
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,280
we can think about and it's not so clean

1027
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,200
across these different um verticals of

1028
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,400
technology

1029
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,000
but the horse

1030
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,720
for sure is like an adaptive active

1031
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,599
entity like there is an intelligence on

1032
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,040
the other side of the table when

1033
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,640
somebody is

1034
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,359
riding a horse

1035
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,119
what's interesting is that

1036
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,880
cars

1037
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,400
may be

1038
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,280
um

1039
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,839
complex

1040
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:03,280
however simple early cars were more like

1041
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,599
a mere active inference entity i'm sure

1042
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:06,560
they still

1043
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,800
brought surprise and they broke and did

1044
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,720
things that were like wacky and stuff

1045
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,839
but it was kind of like

1046
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:15,920
operating a motor

1047
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,520
now

1048
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,599
cars and technologies are actually

1049
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,000
becoming increasingly

1050
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,280
um

1051
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,880
adaptive on the other side so let's

1052
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,200
replace horses and v2 what if it was a

1053
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,119
map like a paper map

1054
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,800
a bow and arrow

1055
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,880
and a skateboard

1056
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,160
so those are all non-living

1057
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,160
extended entities

1058
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,720
and those are

1059
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,359
one stack and then the next level is

1060
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:46,320
like the technology is developing

1061
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,940
but it still is um

1062
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,040
[Music]

1063
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,359
like that offloading rather than the

1064
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,599
uploading like you can't punch the

1065
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,640
person from 500 feet but you can

1066
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,040
use the crossbow to do basically the

1067
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,680
same transfer of kinetic

1068
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,040
energy

1069
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,760
and

1070
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,319
with digital technology

1071
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:07,920
and

1072
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,800
digital models of cognition we're moving

1073
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,480
into a place where like

1074
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,000
the car the gun

1075
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,760
the gps system

1076
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,520
like

1077
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,720
they might just say you can't do that

1078
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,160
so that is

1079
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,160
changing the nature of interaction with

1080
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,160
technology

1081
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,240
whereas like a trusty bow was one that

1082
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,720
can be relied upon to be behave

1083
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,078
predictably in a certain way

1084
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,680
what is trust and glue

1085
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,720
when

1086
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,160
there are

1087
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,640
when we're in the figure two worlds with

1088
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,118
everything

1089
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,560
here's the bow

1090
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,000
and skateboard worlds

1091
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,599
in figure one

1092
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:52,480
and now

1093
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,040
this is in like a

1094
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,279
adaptive active setting

1095
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:00,560
but

1096
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,160
yeah blue

1097
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,680
so i'm really reminded of um

1098
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,400
the

1099
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,400
pay phones and like i know you know dean

1100
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,680
is old enough to remember but like

1101
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,200
daniel what were you like five when they

1102
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,080
had pay phones i'm just kidding

1103
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:17,760
[Laughter]

1104
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,040
so so i mean we you know

1105
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,880
everywhere so we had a telephone we had

1106
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,480
a telephone at home right like we could

1107
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,760
trust it that if we were at home we

1108
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,359
could connect with whoever we would want

1109
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,880
to connect with

1110
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,280
um and then you know there was all these

1111
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,520
pay phone technologies like if you were

1112
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,280
somewhere where there were people where

1113
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,640
there was a gas station you could always

1114
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,240
find a pay phone

1115
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,640
and it's interesting like the you know

1116
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,599
so we

1117
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,599
we were okay being away from our home

1118
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,359
phone but we had some trust that

1119
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,359
somewhere we could find a phone to

1120
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:48,640
connect with people if we needed to

1121
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,680
right

1122
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,040
but we still couldn't connect with them

1123
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,480
unless they were at their house there

1124
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,640
was this other weird like

1125
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,119
looped component and then you know you

1126
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,960
don't see a payphone now at all like the

1127
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,640
last time i saw when i took a picture of

1128
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,359
it

1129
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:04,240
because it's like such an anomalous

1130
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,640
thing i mean they just don't exist

1131
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,040
anymore because there's some you know

1132
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,880
everyone trusts that they'll have a

1133
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,319
phone and yeah if your phone battery

1134
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:13,680
dies it's okay you trust that you'll be

1135
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,839
able to charge it you know in your car

1136
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,839
or you get a battery pack or you have a

1137
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,280
solar battery pack i have one of those

1138
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,680
it's great um but so so you trust that

1139
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,280
you'll be able to connect even if you

1140
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,280
don't have your phone someone will have

1141
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,640
a phone right so like you know if you're

1142
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,319
in a car accident have no cell phone

1143
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:29,839
someone will stop and you can use their

1144
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,680
phone so there's always this but it's

1145
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,839
it's interesting this level of of

1146
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,079
you know trust and the ability to

1147
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,640
communicate with others and then what

1148
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,040
does that do to us cognitively like if

1149
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,240
we you know

1150
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,400
uh can you check the fridge hon did i

1151
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,720
leave do we need milk like you know can

1152
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,839
you call your house and find out like

1153
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:51,920
it's interesting so i wonder how much

1154
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,319
more preparation we used to do

1155
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:57,280
without this ability to communicate

1156
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,880
broadly like at the push of a button or

1157
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,400
you know 10 buttons or whatever

1158
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,119
b

1159
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,119
can i just build on that for a second so

1160
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,520
a couple of things um

1161
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,520
and if we're going to if we're gonna do

1162
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,520
it around the world thing

1163
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,040
there are places still in the world

1164
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:15,920
where

1165
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,280
although there's a whole bunch of people

1166
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,200
that have got their own device there's

1167
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,880
still lots and lots of pay phones right

1168
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,280
so we we don't see them necessarily in

1169
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,520
our cognitive niche but

1170
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,680
i can think i can think of central

1171
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,680
american countries that i visited

1172
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,440
recently and i'm going to be visiting

1173
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,760
later this year where if there wasn't a

1174
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,680
pay phone on every second corner

1175
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,520
that will have changed only

1176
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,760
since 2017

1177
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,560
right so some cognitive niches still

1178
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,880
require that in this diagram here i

1179
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,400
think it's interesting that when we look

1180
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,400
at the verticals

1181
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,240
we could probably see

1182
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,200
the offloading the idea that why would

1183
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,839
you need a payphone anymore

1184
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,319
that being sort of resolved depending on

1185
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,079
which niche you're in

1186
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:03,920
but the horizontals which is really the

1187
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,560
diacronic part that's what kind of frees

1188
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,880
us up to go and look at a turntable

1189
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,680
again

1190
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,400
even though most people have got

1191
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,520
that same capacity to access whatever

1192
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,040
the media is

1193
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,040
on their phone right

1194
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,440
so i think again

1195
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,359
i'm going to beat the same drum when we

1196
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:25,200
look at these kind of representations

1197
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,440
it's a minimum of two do we look at the

1198
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,160
verticals and the horizontals do we see

1199
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,960
the stacks and the diacronics because

1200
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,440
when we incorporate the diacronics

1201
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,800
then that looking

1202
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,240
looking back i still probably won't go

1203
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,839
to a phone booth

1204
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,560
in costa rica because i just

1205
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,560
don't need to but i can certainly

1206
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,040
understand why it still exists and it

1207
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,560
isn't just a novelty it exists like like

1208
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,720
you were talking about last

1209
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,359
live stream about why why

1210
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:00,560
we've automated water access

1211
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,440
it's still and it's there's those people

1212
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,400
in those

1213
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,240
cognitive niches

1214
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,680
are still

1215
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,200
finding those those tools useful

1216
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,640
so

1217
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,720
yeah i think it's i think it's

1218
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,839
again i i keep bragging about this axle

1219
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:19,440
constant character who writes these

1220
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,640
papers but

1221
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,880
man is he ever touching on important

1222
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,480
stuff in terms of us

1223
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,400
sort of being aware

1224
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,800
not just in terms of

1225
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,400
what we're dealing with in the here and

1226
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,599
now but how that environment

1227
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,040
necessarily

1228
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,720
partitions us

1229
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,400
as much as we actively and partition it

1230
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,800
and so

1231
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,200
yeah i mean go go to costa rica it's

1232
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,680
pretty it's pretty i wouldn't

1233
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,839
pretty modern place but they still have

1234
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:51,599
lots and lots of pay phones and they

1235
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,400
still really matter

1236
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,720
they're in that second hump right as

1237
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,880
we're transitioning from you know

1238
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,680
house phone to pay phone to cell phone

1239
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,359
they're still in in v2 there or yes some

1240
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:06,560
point

1241
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,680
where there's overlapping waves of tech

1242
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,720
so

1243
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,960
very interesting about

1244
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,960
trust and glue at different levels or

1245
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,000
types

1246
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,079
like do you trust that you'll be able to

1247
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:19,920
simply make the call

1248
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,200
or do you trust that they're going to be

1249
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,000
able to hear you on the call

1250
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:24,880
do they

1251
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,640
do you have trust that

1252
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,720
you'll be understood do you have trust

1253
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,160
that that will

1254
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,920
have action like if you call an

1255
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,240
emergency hotline number

1256
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,118
that's like um

1257
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,960
it's probably a bunch of

1258
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,599
active jokes that one can imagine

1259
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,079
because one is providing a sense

1260
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,040
stimuli for that operator

1261
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,680
so that they undertake some action and

1262
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,520
you trust

1263
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,280
that a certain kind of action will be

1264
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,480
taken

1265
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,720
though not directly knowing all the

1266
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,520
details like we may not understand how

1267
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,359
an ambulance gets called or where the

1268
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:04,319
location of the ambulance are but then

1269
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,560
we expect that

1270
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,240
upon a certain type of signal a call

1271
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,000
that one will be

1272
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,079
arriving shortly

1273
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,160
so that is very

1274
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,680
interesting and then also dean like you

1275
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,800
said we're we're partitioning technology

1276
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,599
like

1277
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,599
if you install linux on a computer and

1278
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:25,680
it's the disk partition and there's so

1279
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,280
many times where

1280
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,119
technology is about

1281
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:30,880
partitioning

1282
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,880
and about putting the technology in the

1283
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,200
box and technology is often in a box

1284
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,960
it's like wrapped in a box and then it's

1285
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,880
in like another plastic box or a metal

1286
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:39,760
box

1287
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,040
but then

1288
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,160
that actually changes our cognitive

1289
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,440
partitioning

1290
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,000
and then we've explored in this paper a

1291
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,920
sort of low bar

1292
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,440
and then a high bar

1293
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,280
where more is different and the low bar

1294
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,960
was the offloading

1295
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,839
was where the technology is going to

1296
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:01,520
merely remind you of something and so

1297
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,319
the

1298
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,079
offloading

1299
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:04,839
can

1300
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:07,760
be freeing up

1301
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,520
cognitive

1302
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,280
thought cycles

1303
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,000
and allowing for future epistemic action

1304
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,680
writing something down on the post-it

1305
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,200
and putting it on the doorway and it

1306
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,359
says get milk or it's yellow and you

1307
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,520
know that yellow means get milk but

1308
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,680
you're offloading it to this sort of

1309
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,599
relatively passive

1310
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,680
more like a crossbow more like a

1311
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,359
skateboard kind of technology

1312
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:33,520
what starts to happen when technology

1313
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,119
becomes adaptive and anticipatory

1314
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,640
and so we are not just offloading

1315
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,680
that's the low bar but we're uploading

1316
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,760
and there's an active entity on both

1317
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,839
sides of the table now and they're

1318
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:52,319
anticipating and expecting each other

1319
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,920
what is happening when our technology

1320
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,480
use and modifications in the niche

1321
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:03,240
change our cognitive partitioning

1322
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,880
i got a question maybe for both of you

1323
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,920
so

1324
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:08,880
um

1325
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,040
in that in that

1326
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,119
in under that sort of the spirit of what

1327
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:14,839
you're just saying

1328
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:18,000
daniel so you get some you get some

1329
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,240
platforms where you want to do some

1330
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,920
uh you want to take all your photos and

1331
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,079
all your images from your holiday and

1332
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,480
you you make an imovie

1333
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,640
or you go to final cut pro

1334
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,640
now both of those platforms

1335
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,559
perform

1336
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:34,319
essentially the same

1337
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,000
function in terms of you being able to

1338
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,440
stitch together

1339
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,160
a bunch of images but the

1340
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,359
imovie

1341
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:43,760
in its effort to be adaptive

1342
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,720
says

1343
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,160
how how

1344
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,240
much of this would you like me to do

1345
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,160
would you like me to sink the music for

1346
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,640
you would you like me to apply the ken

1347
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,440
burns effect whereas the final cut pro

1348
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,520
the assumption is that you have a much

1349
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,760
a much more um

1350
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,760
control

1351
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,960
aspect of this in terms of what you

1352
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,720
want to be able to

1353
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,440
fine tune and continue to operate

1354
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,839
so i think it's interesting the the

1355
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:15,520
technology question and the environment

1356
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,680
question because

1357
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,359
it can guess it can be framed as freeing

1358
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:20,640
up

1359
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,559
but i think at some time at some point

1360
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:24,319
we have to ask whether it's option

1361
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:25,680
removing

1362
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,960
because it's trying to help us

1363
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,160
but it's not necessarily generating more

1364
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,920
possibilities

1365
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,359
which is again another form of

1366
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:38,240
optimization optimization isn't always

1367
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,520
removing uncertainty lots and tots times

1368
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,160
optimization is having more

1369
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,559
possibilities

1370
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:49,440
that are that are valid that are viable

1371
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,760
and that's the harder of those two

1372
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,160
things to determine which what's a

1373
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,040
viable alternative here as opposed to am

1374
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,880
i getting closer and closer to being

1375
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,960
able to regenerate the copy

1376
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,720
it makes me think about optimization

1377
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,400
when we're in

1378
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,000
the world of figure one

1379
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,160
and when we're in the world of figure

1380
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,520
two so human on the bike

1381
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,079
and optimizing has to do with like speed

1382
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:21,280
on the bike

1383
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,400
okay but now we're in figure 2 world and

1384
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,559
we're all going on a walk together like

1385
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:27,920
the three of us

1386
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,599
what is the optimum speed

1387
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:32,720
it may have some of the same

1388
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,559
considerations as the bicycle like we

1389
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,960
want to get there we want to be safe

1390
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,800
we don't want to break anything

1391
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,520
but then there is this

1392
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:45,920
relational layer where the optimum speed

1393
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,000
may be a pure group decision

1394
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,200
and um

1395
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,000
then

1396
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,400
what you said about optimization

1397
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,119
how is optimization related to

1398
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,280
reducing uncertainty

1399
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,839
as well as or in what cases reducing

1400
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:06,480
options which can be a one way to reduce

1401
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,839
uncertainty

1402
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:09,040
like you have

1403
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,640
equal uncertainty about 100 options

1404
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,559
let's just reduce it to two you're still

1405
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,640
uncertain but there's only two options

1406
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,119
but then you also mentioned adding more

1407
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:20,000
options and of what kind so let's think

1408
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,480
about choosing a cereal

1409
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,400
so there's 100 cereals there in the

1410
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,599
store

1411
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:28,319
and we're in the figure one world it's

1412
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:32,160
just the dead cereals and they are uh

1413
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,000
passive recipients of our action

1414
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
selection maybe they're wiggling around

1415
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,280
a little bit on the shelves trying to

1416
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,440
escape but basically they're dead and

1417
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,599
we're taking adaptive decisions

1418
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,359
and so there can be uncertainty about

1419
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:45,119
which actions to take

1420
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,880
so yes we could increase our precision

1421
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,359
by having for for example fewer

1422
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:52,800
alternatives

1423
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,720
but then again you said what about

1424
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,119
optimization via more

1425
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:58,839
acceptable

1426
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:01,680
alternatives what if there was a friend

1427
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,440
or a parent or

1428
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,200
a adaptive computer system that said

1429
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,559
would you like me to make some

1430
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:09,920
suggestions

1431
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,760
that's actually another option of a

1432
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,079
totally different type than serial 1

1433
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:16,480
through 100. so you've added another

1434
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,520
option another affordance for action

1435
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,200
and in doing so it's part of a

1436
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,800
trajectory

1437
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,079
that does minimize free energy and

1438
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:28,960
find some sort of

1439
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,680
satisficing solution

1440
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,280
or like

1441
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,839
can i ask a question

1442
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:37,839
it's actually an opportunity for an

1443
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,760
open-endedness

1444
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,480
it puts a new affordance on the table

1445
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,280
when the adaptive entity asks like

1446
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,880
okay could i make a suggestion about

1447
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,880
your serial choice

1448
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,720
yes

1449
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,599
are you interested in this or that like

1450
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:56,640
it's actually adding more

1451
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,640
uncertainty about potentially even a

1452
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,640
novel introduction

1453
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,000
of now there's this dialogue it's like

1454
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,680
wait i thought we were choosing a serial

1455
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,520
why are we now engaging in dialogue

1456
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,880
but then

1457
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,000
it could be on the path

1458
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,720
to selecting

1459
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,359
a good cereal

1460
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,160
can i just quote some you just reminded

1461
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,160
me of something in the paper under the

1462
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,319
diet chronic cognition and the eai and

1463
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:25,839
the 314.

1464
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:27,839
i'll just read it because i think it's

1465
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,680
it spot on to what you were just

1466
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,079
describing cognitive assemblies are

1467
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,160
formed and maintained

1468
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,079
diachronically

1469
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:37,920
beyond the local organism's center

1470
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,200
boundaries of individuals kirchoff

1471
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,760
malophorus and stotts

1472
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,240
cognitive assemblies are decentralized

1473
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,520
systems

1474
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,400
or

1475
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,480
networks of human and non-human agencies

1476
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,079
which is what you were just describing

1477
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:56,640
the tour 1993 whose cause of

1478
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,000
constitutive relationship

1479
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,240
depends upon self-organized processes

1480
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,839
distributed across

1481
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:06,640
the network that they constitute

1482
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,200
so yeah i mean i think the authors would

1483
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,879
agree with what you were just describing

1484
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,799
who i remember reading that the first

1485
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:23,040
time and thinking to myself

1486
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,200
again of paul khan's

1487
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,000
book the origins of order so you have

1488
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,440
you have

1489
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,599
assemblies within and then you have

1490
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:34,160
access assemblies in terms of a larger

1491
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,440
energy package a constitution

1492
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,200
and so how does that

1493
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,200
how does that ebb and flow relative to

1494
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,720
your own homeostatic and allostatic

1495
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:45,599
um

1496
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:48,000
heuristics that you're following right

1497
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,359
so

1498
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:51,680
yeah

1499
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,559
but that's again back to the witness

1500
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:03,839
piece right

1501
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:08,960
i don't know if this is exactly

1502
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,480
how to say it but

1503
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,880
i see this

1504
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,799
paper and

1505
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:18,559
line of research and thinking

1506
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:20,240
as

1507
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,799
being sort of the upswing of thinking

1508
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:26,160
about 4e cognition extended enacted

1509
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:30,160
embedded etc etc etc

1510
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,760
what does it look like to be on the

1511
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,040
upswing

1512
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,760
of taking 4e cognition as a starting

1513
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:36,960
point

1514
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:42,079
so no longer does non 4e have to be

1515
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:45,680
straw person or discussed pejoratively

1516
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:46,480
like

1517
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,720
car companies today are not

1518
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,440
doing slam pieces on horses

1519
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,200
there's a recognized

1520
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,960
place in time for people who are horses

1521
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,319
and it's now in a different tech

1522
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,880
vertical than people who are now doing

1523
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,400
the differentiation between different

1524
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,599
cars that they might like to buy

1525
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:06,000
when a technology actually does threaten

1526
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:06,799
it

1527
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:08,640
like hey maybe you don't need to own a

1528
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,240
car maybe there's going to be something

1529
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,480
you can trust on that will take you

1530
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,920
where you need to go

1531
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,760
that is where you start to see the

1532
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,280
threatening and the responses and things

1533
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,040
like that when there actually is a

1534
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,960
possibility to have a technological

1535
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,079
replacement

1536
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:23,839
but

1537
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:26,400
there isn't a

1538
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,079
attack

1539
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:29,160
on

1540
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:32,880
non-extended non-embedded non-encultured

1541
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,280
cognition the paper does not spend a

1542
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,079
massive amount of time describing that

1543
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:40,240
cultural priors influence cognitive

1544
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,720
processes of individuals

1545
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:46,319
it in descriptive

1546
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:47,760
indescriptive

1547
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:48,559
and

1548
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:49,839
concise

1549
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:51,599
positive language

1550
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,920
it is

1551
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,440
recouping

1552
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,200
and restating

1553
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,280
an extended perspective

1554
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,200
and taking that as a

1555
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,880
starting point for moving forward and

1556
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,040
for modeling kinds of systems that

1557
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,440
previously had ineffective

1558
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:11,119
or incomplete models

1559
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,480
because

1560
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,400
hardly could it be said that this paper

1561
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,839
answers

1562
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:18,079
anything about extended cognitive

1563
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:19,280
process

1564
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,440
in fact we keep on coming back to the

1565
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,200
figure one figure two equation two

1566
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,960
equation four

1567
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,160
step

1568
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,760
because it's subtle

1569
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,200
but it is the contribution of this paper

1570
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,799
because they took

1571
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:34,480
active inference

1572
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,480
which was always framed this way

1573
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,720
extended it and showed well actually

1574
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,880
like this is a special case figure one

1575
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,720
of active inference was a special case

1576
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,880
of where there could be a more

1577
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,839
adaptive entity on the other side

1578
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:52,640
and then that becomes reabsorbed into

1579
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,319
active inference

1580
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:56,559
and is a starting point for

1581
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:57,920
what i hope that we'll continue to

1582
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,760
discuss in

1583
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:03,359
some of the rest of this discussion

1584
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:05,520
what is active inference and extended

1585
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,240
active inference particularly as a

1586
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,960
starting point look like rather than

1587
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,280
well we've done all of these

1588
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:17,119
um attack ads versus earlier models of

1589
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:20,160
cybernetics or of ecological psychology

1590
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,880
we we've decimated the opposition and

1591
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,040
now the only model that you can go

1592
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:28,160
forward with is active or is extended

1593
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,680
cognition people who don't believe in

1594
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,119
extended cognition just what are they

1595
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:32,559
thinking about like

1596
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:34,160
that isn't where our

1597
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:37,599
regime of attention or linguistics is to

1598
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,680
let the record show

1599
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,440
so what does it look like when we

1600
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:42,720
actually do

1601
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:45,520
start to take steps forward

1602
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,960
in this

1603
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:50,480
figure two kind of world

1604
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,599
dean

1605
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:54,160
and i ask a question on that then

1606
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:57,440
would it not make sense

1607
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,079
to at least momentarily suspend many of

1608
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:03,119
the typical hierarchies that we apply

1609
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:06,000
like we can keep things nested

1610
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,640
those things continue to exist but

1611
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,200
isn't it is an extended active inference

1612
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,400
asking us

1613
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,599
to start from a place of not knowing i i

1614
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:18,480
mentioned this in the last livestream

1615
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,160
i mean if both people are willing to

1616
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,400
take that risk and face down that

1617
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,559
consequence or if the entire

1618
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:26,400
if the entire audience

1619
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,640
has taken on that risk

1620
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,559
and taken that that

1621
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:33,200
that question on collectively is that

1622
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,520
not the beginning of extended active

1623
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,799
influence where now the environment

1624
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:41,839
access the scrutinizer as opposed to oh

1625
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:44,160
there's somebody who now judges all

1626
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:47,839
people who don't believe in acting

1627
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:51,040
extended active inference as being

1628
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,760
not legitimate like it is the first

1629
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,839
thing that we have to do is allow the

1630
01:00:55,839 --> 01:00:57,799
environment to be the

1631
01:00:57,799 --> 01:01:00,720
scrutinizer as opposed to

1632
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,880
somebody else who's given that

1633
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,720
role

1634
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:07,040
and i'm i'm sincerely asking that

1635
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,599
question i'm not questioning whether

1636
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,920
that's even possible but if if we're

1637
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,599
going to start down that road of

1638
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,960
applying

1639
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,880
extended active inference

1640
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,680
then who who's the judge here

1641
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,319
and for how

1642
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:25,599
long if it's extended

1643
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,760
it's extended active inference as

1644
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:31,839
opposed to mere activities

1645
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:33,680
blue you have a thought or all

1646
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,280
go

1647
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,839
okay

1648
01:01:36,839 --> 01:01:39,920
um it makes me look in the bottom right

1649
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:43,359
corner of our video or act infer serve

1650
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:45,440
as we sometimes do

1651
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,640
and

1652
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,640
uh before

1653
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:51,280
the action potentially there's like this

1654
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,240
stop wait listen perceive

1655
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,160
that is silence and it's important to

1656
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,640
also recognize like a silence before and

1657
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,000
after a word

1658
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,920
so

1659
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,319
where the action perception loop begins

1660
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:05,359
and ends

1661
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:06,559
no one else

1662
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:08,720
but you said what happens when we start

1663
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,520
with not knowing what if we start or

1664
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,359
intend for the environment to be the

1665
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:14,799
scrutinizer

1666
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:15,920
how

1667
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,680
do we let the environment be the

1668
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:20,160
scrutinizer whether it's short long

1669
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,280
transient

1670
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,799
we have to act

1671
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:23,920
because

1672
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,920
hashtag figure 2

1673
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,839
our actions

1674
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:31,520
are the observations of the environment

1675
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:34,720
so if we withhold action

1676
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:38,559
or act in a way that the scrutinizer

1677
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:40,240
is going to get the wrong impressions

1678
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:43,280
from like we're the adversarial demon

1679
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:48,079
it's like oh i prefer lower co2 but then

1680
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:51,599
t he i'm just putting a ton out

1681
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:53,520
what could one

1682
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,520
ask the environment to make its

1683
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:58,400
inferences on only the markov blanket

1684
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,920
only the holograph

1685
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,559
only the quantum experiment

1686
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:04,480
and so

1687
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,400
action

1688
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,599
is how we allow the environment to

1689
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:11,839
make inferences

1690
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:13,039
like

1691
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,039
two people i don't know operating on a

1692
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:17,520
saw for a tree

1693
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,119
one person's pushing while the other one

1694
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:21,680
is pulling

1695
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:25,760
what are the consequences of our actions

1696
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,480
we don't know but we have expectations

1697
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:29,839
preferences and we reduce our

1698
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:32,559
uncertainty about all of that

1699
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:33,760
but

1700
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:36,240
when we don't know which is to say our

1701
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,079
cognitive process

1702
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:39,520
doesn't have

1703
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,960
precision

1704
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,359
and precision could also be a false

1705
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,960
belief

1706
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,160
so we have

1707
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,640
not knowing

1708
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:51,280
in our non-extended active

1709
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:54,799
in our cognitive process

1710
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,960
do we

1711
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:59,520
infer first

1712
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,520
and wait until we have higher precision

1713
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:05,119
which again can be a false perception

1714
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,319
and then

1715
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:08,640
that is actually implicitly putting one

1716
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,079
into the position of the central

1717
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:11,359
scrutinizer

1718
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:13,200
it's like saying when i'm ready to act

1719
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,799
then i'll act

1720
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:16,799
but i'm going to wait until then these

1721
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:18,160
are all of course

1722
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,520
simplifications and i know there's

1723
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,520
counter examples that people can think

1724
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:24,000
of and that's rich and those counter

1725
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,960
examples are in a yes and spirit because

1726
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,319
these are only

1727
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:30,319
some of the actions that i or you could

1728
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:31,280
take

1729
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,160
but

1730
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,760
when we

1731
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:36,640
empower the environment

1732
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,839
that doesn't mean that we don't

1733
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:41,760
act right

1734
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,520
it doesn't know does it not mean we

1735
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:45,680
interact more and

1736
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,799
we we get out more often

1737
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:51,039
isn't that the first

1738
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:52,720
isn't that the first assumption if we

1739
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:55,039
actually want the environment to become

1740
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:55,920
more

1741
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,559
involved in whatever it is

1742
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:01,200
whatever the joint self-evidencing is

1743
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,280
don't we have to actually allow

1744
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,839
the environment in by getting out more

1745
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:09,720
and interacting more

1746
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:11,359
blue

1747
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:12,400
so

1748
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,319
i kind of find this like

1749
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:18,319
if a tree falls in the forest and no one

1750
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:20,720
heard it did the tree really fall

1751
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:21,520
um

1752
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,039
so

1753
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:25,119
if there's no action

1754
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:27,440
um and i guess a tree falling down is

1755
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,760
also a tree doing action maybe whether

1756
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,760
it's you know

1757
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,440
your active inference or not doesn't

1758
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,280
really matter

1759
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:39,280
but but i i do think that that um

1760
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,520
you know something has to happen for the

1761
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,559
environment to perceive it otherwise

1762
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:46,400
what is the environment

1763
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,400
receiving

1764
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,119
yeah so i think we're i think we're

1765
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:54,960
navigating on it

1766
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,960
but i think it's hard for us to perceive

1767
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,440
in our minds how it might be navigating

1768
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:00,480
on us

1769
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:01,920
i mean we pick ourselves up put

1770
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,920
ourselves on an airplane and fly

1771
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,079
somewhere so that's pretty that's pretty

1772
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:08,000
easy to track

1773
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,680
but i don't know that we necessarily

1774
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:12,880
know until we bump into that pay phone

1775
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,960
in that foreign niche

1776
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,760
how that's going to necessarily navigate

1777
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,599
on us

1778
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:21,599
we don't know until we until we actually

1779
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:23,599
put ourselves in that position and then

1780
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:25,680
decide what that interaction will or

1781
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,520
will not be do i take a picture of it

1782
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,520
because whoa i just found something i

1783
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,359
haven't seen in a long time or to

1784
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:32,960
actually pick it up

1785
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,760
and do some and have its affordances

1786
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,039
play on me

1787
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:39,440
that's the harder part to get your mind

1788
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,440
around it seems like it's imaginable and

1789
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,280
philosophical but it's really

1790
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,760
navigational and way finding and and

1791
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:49,280
reorienting updating updating update

1792
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,000
so can i just respond really quick um

1793
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,760
i think that you are

1794
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,760
dealing with or

1795
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,119
thinking about when you're thinking

1796
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:00,720
about cognitive uploading and this has

1797
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,400
like been consistent through this stream

1798
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,119
and the last stream you're talking about

1799
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:07,359
putting yourself in a foreign

1800
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:09,440
environment right so like i would have

1801
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:10,720
to

1802
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:13,119
act by leaving my office getting on a

1803
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:14,799
plane arriving in switzerland and

1804
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:16,640
getting off the plane and now i'm in a

1805
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,559
foreign environment right and so what do

1806
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:21,119
i perceive in this foreign or in this

1807
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:24,000
novel environment but but simply the act

1808
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,880
of moving from a familiar environment to

1809
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,200
a novel environment is also an action

1810
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,439
right

1811
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:36,000
it's an epistemic foraging action to

1812
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,799
be in a new informational niche

1813
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:43,039
to jump into a new paper to listen to a

1814
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:44,880
live stream that somebody might not

1815
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:47,280
otherwise like take a little journey

1816
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,640
with us

1817
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:52,079
and it is definitely one of the

1818
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:54,160
most important kinds of action

1819
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,599
to study

1820
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:57,680
just like they bring up epistemic

1821
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:00,960
actions at the end of this paper like

1822
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,720
knowing where to look like what what is

1823
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:06,799
on um you know page 50 of this book

1824
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:08,720
one has to have precision in an action

1825
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:10,319
policy to know where to look that's an

1826
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:11,680
epistemic action

1827
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:14,559
and dean you've brought together

1828
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:18,000
the spatial navigation element

1829
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,600
with the epistemic

1830
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,719
aspect and then even in that example of

1831
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:24,799
the pay phone we see epistemic and

1832
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:26,719
pragmatic value like if it's high

1833
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:29,679
novelty high epistemic value

1834
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:31,600
that might induce a certain kind of

1835
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:32,560
action

1836
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,399
like taking a picture maybe um to

1837
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:36,238
document it but then also there's the

1838
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:39,040
pragmatics of the phone like using it to

1839
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,040
make a call

1840
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,679
so this type of action

1841
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:46,960
to have the initiative just to get up

1842
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,960
and to do something

1843
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:52,560
and to to have bounded

1844
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,158
modeling

1845
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:54,960
and

1846
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,359
just knowing that one will know enough

1847
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:00,000
when they're in that situation or that

1848
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,920
it's low stakes enough that it doesn't

1849
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,679
really matter

1850
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:05,839
that's very interesting so let me read

1851
01:09:05,839 --> 01:09:07,839
something that is in live chat so

1852
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:10,000
stephen wrote

1853
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,880
this paper extends towards the mind body

1854
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,520
spirit environment dynamic by starting

1855
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,520
in terms of what most active models

1856
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,880
focus on generative models how can we

1857
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,880
start bigger bolder

1858
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,080
and work back in

1859
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:32,000
so i'll just give a first thought thanks

1860
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,399
for the question stephen

1861
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:35,439
so

1862
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:36,719
i

1863
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:38,238
believe that

1864
01:09:38,238 --> 01:09:40,960
when steven is saying where most active

1865
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,920
models focus on or start on which is

1866
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,640
like the generative model of the

1867
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,120
particular entity and the particular

1868
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:52,319
entity the thing which is the thing as

1869
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:54,800
distinguished from the environment

1870
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,480
is this

1871
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:57,679
that is

1872
01:09:57,679 --> 01:09:59,679
the blanket states

1873
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,800
and

1874
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,480
the cognitive states blanket and

1875
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,960
internal states constitute the thing

1876
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,920
like the car

1877
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:10,239
of course here we would take the car as

1878
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,000
processed and the car includes the roads

1879
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,520
and the stop signs but

1880
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,840
the car as a thing partitioned from its

1881
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:16,960
environment

1882
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:20,159
is the blanket and internal states of

1883
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,199
the car

1884
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:24,640
and so extended the idea that this is

1885
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:25,760
the thing

1886
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,000
but that it's extending

1887
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,960
its function in a more distributed way

1888
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,800
in a way as i think we may have even

1889
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,760
talked about last week reifies that as

1890
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,040
the thing

1891
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,360
like when the person puts the post-it

1892
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,199
note and we call that extended

1893
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:43,360
organismal cognition

1894
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,760
do we not reify and maybe even

1895
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,560
implicitly constrain what organismal

1896
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:50,640
cognition is because we're saying well

1897
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,480
an organism with a post-it note is

1898
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,719
extended organismal cognition so that

1899
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,600
means that

1900
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:58,400
regular organismal can cognition isn't

1901
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,640
that so

1902
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:03,520
when we go to the figure two world

1903
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,960
we can then

1904
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,960
ask about well

1905
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:09,520
there's now a generative model on both

1906
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:10,640
sides

1907
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:14,480
that's what we were looking at with our

1908
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:17,280
colorful boxes last time

1909
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:20,320
each one of these boxes is a thing

1910
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,239
and then we talked about how like they

1911
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:25,440
make up a bigger thing together

1912
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,520
they make up a different generative

1913
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,120
model together

1914
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:32,080
so this thing the green thing on the

1915
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,760
right

1916
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,520
is still a generative model so it's not

1917
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,840
like we're going to escape

1918
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:43,120
active highlighting of generative model

1919
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,080
but

1920
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:45,920
rather we recognize that generative

1921
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,480
models can have

1922
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:49,280
sub-partitionings

1923
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:51,760
and that some of the cases that we might

1924
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,679
want to think about involve like a

1925
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:54,960
partitioning between what are

1926
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,960
classically understood to be

1927
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:00,080
autonomous entities and their niche and

1928
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,840
so it's almost like

1929
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:02,560
from

1930
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:03,679
the

1931
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:06,080
atomic active

1932
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,440
not the quantum just like sort of the

1933
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,920
single entity where we're gonna put less

1934
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,600
emphasis on the niche

1935
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:12,719
then

1936
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:14,960
with extended active we start to

1937
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:19,440
recognize the niche as an active entity

1938
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:20,159
not

1939
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:23,440
of the same type but of the same

1940
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,360
structure in terms of performing

1941
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:26,640
optimization

1942
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,320
on both sides

1943
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,239
and then that really moves us to a place

1944
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:32,480
of like synthesis which is

1945
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:36,080
it's just like holistic active or it's

1946
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:36,880
just

1947
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:39,520
it is extended active inference

1948
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,280
but we're not saying who it's extended

1949
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,480
from

1950
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:45,280
it's just we're taking a total modeling

1951
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:46,800
perspective

1952
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:49,679
on all these activities

1953
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:51,040
as well as

1954
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:52,960
all of these activities

1955
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,719
now with the red line

1956
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:56,080
but then

1957
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,440
what does that

1958
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,040
make

1959
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,560
the purple line

1960
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,360
and what is its niche and that comes

1961
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,520
back to the point about composability

1962
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,920
which is like we could stop with just

1963
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,600
the black box

1964
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,520
and say we're just modeling the entity

1965
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,199
and we're not going to think about the

1966
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:14,719
environment as a thing we're going to

1967
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:17,199
think of it as the heat sink just like

1968
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:19,360
our quantum colleagues reminded us

1969
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:21,920
or maybe we want to model both sides of

1970
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:22,960
the table

1971
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,560
as things

1972
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,640
but then in doing so

1973
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:29,360
we make them into this joint

1974
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,280
generative model

1975
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:32,960
so again we didn't escape generative

1976
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:35,920
models we actually only reified the need

1977
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:36,880
for them

1978
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,400
because now we've made this fusion

1979
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,480
generative model

1980
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,159
but now we're back to where we were

1981
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:44,719
earlier which is implicitly taking the

1982
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:48,080
environment to be the heatsink

1983
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:54,080
blue

1984
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:54,880
so

1985
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:56,159
i have a thought if you could go back to

1986
01:13:56,159 --> 01:13:58,320
figure two that would be great

1987
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:01,520
um just about um what happens and this

1988
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,440
goes back to what dean was talking about

1989
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:04,960
earlier when we're talking about scaling

1990
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,440
and where do you put the markov blanket

1991
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,360
so here we have the niche and the

1992
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,600
environment doing this joint

1993
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,280
self-evidencing

1994
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:16,400
um and what happens when like they're

1995
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,560
trying to fit to each other right but i

1996
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:21,199
mean we all have seen circumstances

1997
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:22,960
where

1998
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,560
someone doesn't quite fit in with a

1999
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,120
crowd right and so like this is how like

2000
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,040
people become school shooters or

2001
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,040
radicalized or you know bullied or you

2002
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,719
know we've all seen

2003
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:34,159
someone doesn't matter they see their

2004
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:36,719
niche environment they just can't quite

2005
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:38,960
fit like a square peg trying to fit into

2006
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,159
a round hole

2007
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:41,760
um and this happens like i just was

2008
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:44,239
writing about this you know last night

2009
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:46,239
um when we

2010
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:48,239
if we were to take an organism and put

2011
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:50,719
it in a novel environment as dean was

2012
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:52,480
suggesting earlier but like i mean take

2013
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,640
a bacterium that lives in a hot springs

2014
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,120
and put it in a cold water pond it's not

2015
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,600
going to do very well because it's just

2016
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,000
that's the wrong place for it to be

2017
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,159
um and i just was really talking with

2018
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:05,920
chris fields yesterday about what makes

2019
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:07,840
you put a markov blanket in a certain

2020
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,719
place or what makes things and this is

2021
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:11,520
like

2022
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:14,000
one of the fundamental

2023
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,840
the bit it's the big question it is the

2024
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,440
question where do you put the markov

2025
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:18,960
blanket like where you can establish

2026
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:21,520
conditional independence okay

2027
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:24,640
so like i get that answer but but at the

2028
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,239
same time

2029
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:27,679
you can kind of put it wherever you want

2030
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:28,960
it

2031
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,400
so so

2032
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,520
when

2033
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:34,719
there's maladaption like a maladaptive

2034
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:37,440
fit to the niche environment

2035
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,679
does that make it pop out of the markov

2036
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:41,360
blanket and what is the threshold for

2037
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,360
that maladaptive fit

2038
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:45,120
these are just the things that i want to

2039
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,360
know

2040
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:52,000
in the actin textbook and in other

2041
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,199
sources

2042
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:55,600
there's a discussion of

2043
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,840
bayesian brain and of computational

2044
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:00,320
approaches to

2045
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:02,800
neurophysiology neurodiversity

2046
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,560
psychopathology all of these different

2047
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,600
areas

2048
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:06,400
and

2049
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,400
by integrating them

2050
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,719
we kind of see that

2051
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:13,440
just like axel's bacteria can be

2052
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:16,000
doing exact bays or variational bays

2053
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,520
free energy minimization right off the

2054
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:18,640
cliff

2055
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:19,520
that

2056
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:21,440
hot water bacteria in the cold water is

2057
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:22,960
going to continue minimizing its free

2058
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:24,960
energy up until it dies

2059
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,040
and so

2060
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:29,280
um

2061
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:32,960
if systems are always doing free energy

2062
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,280
descent

2063
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,679
where do we get to say which kinds that

2064
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:38,400
we

2065
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:39,520
prefer

2066
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:43,199
like maybe um we need to bring that

2067
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:45,360
purple line back

2068
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:46,560
and what's on the other side of the

2069
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,520
purple line is like the modeler

2070
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:51,360
like we've still been thinking about

2071
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:54,480
this in a very like entity

2072
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:57,520
it's physical environment partitioning

2073
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,840
but this comes back to what happens

2074
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,560
before the graphical model gets drawn

2075
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:04,400
that's the first markov blanket where

2076
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:05,280
now

2077
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:07,360
you and that paper

2078
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:10,400
or you in that graphical representation

2079
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,080
now there's a blanket between the two of

2080
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,280
you

2081
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:14,719
but it's almost like there's this

2082
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:16,880
modeling impulse

2083
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:19,280
that is not extended it's within a

2084
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,760
cognitive entity whether that's a person

2085
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,280
bouncing around their head

2086
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:25,920
whether it's in a group that hasn't

2087
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,440
externalized

2088
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:28,560
the model

2089
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:29,920
but they're bouncing around in each

2090
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:30,640
other

2091
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:34,560
and then when they externalize it

2092
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:39,199
then when they externalize this

2093
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:41,520
as a model

2094
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:42,840
that is an

2095
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:45,360
action it's not the only kind of action

2096
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,840
to take but then that is um

2097
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,920
[Music]

2098
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:54,000
the zero to one step yes dean

2099
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,640
and to both of your comments one of the

2100
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,000
things in our program that we used to

2101
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,679
talk about all the time is

2102
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:02,560
we don't want your sponsor the person

2103
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:04,560
who is essentially

2104
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,719
taking you and inviting you into their

2105
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:08,480
professional setting their professional

2106
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:09,920
cognitive niche

2107
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,520
we don't want you to turn that person

2108
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,080
into teacher 2.0

2109
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,159
we don't want you to have the same

2110
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:19,360
expectations of that person as you have

2111
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:20,960
of the person that's in the classroom

2112
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:23,040
one of the things that you have to try

2113
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:24,080
to do

2114
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:27,280
is be adaptive and extend

2115
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:30,880
what you then can accommodate in terms

2116
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:33,760
of these various

2117
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,280
formalized

2118
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:38,000
cognitive niches that you're now gaining

2119
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,280
access to so i i

2120
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:44,159
i just think that that that joint

2121
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:47,120
joint self evidencing part

2122
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:48,719
is

2123
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:50,239
is really really critical because i

2124
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:52,719
think for most of us it's hard for us to

2125
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:55,520
get our heads around the idea that

2126
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:57,280
well i have a certain agency and then i

2127
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:59,360
have other people who who have leverage

2128
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:00,960
over me and they can tell me what i can

2129
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,480
and cannot do

2130
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,719
versus the person who goes into a

2131
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:07,040
situation and says

2132
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:10,719
i'm a proportion of a larger energy

2133
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:12,960
situation set volume whatever you want

2134
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:15,440
to call it i'm gonna and

2135
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:17,360
somebody's been able to find another

2136
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:19,199
person who despite the fact that they

2137
01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:21,120
have a lot more experience than me is

2138
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,679
also able to perceive themselves as a

2139
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:26,080
proportion and is prepared to base

2140
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:28,640
update and now giving that

2141
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:31,840
that relational composition

2142
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,760
all the all the support and resources

2143
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,600
that you possibly can

2144
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,600
so that you're actually

2145
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:40,560
generating this possibility of being

2146
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:43,440
able to invent together as opposed to

2147
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,840
one person's downloading to another

2148
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:48,560
which i found traditionally even in

2149
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:49,800
those

2150
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,360
transdisciplinary

2151
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:54,560
settings um which i really like

2152
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:55,760
even those

2153
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:58,159
tend to revert back regress

2154
01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:00,880
back to an average of i want to i want

2155
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:03,440
to stay in my safe place i want to stay

2156
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:05,600
with what i know and only share those

2157
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,679
things that i know

2158
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,520
rarely will you find a situation like

2159
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:10,960
the one we have here

2160
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:12,239
where

2161
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:13,840
every single time i walk into one of

2162
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,280
these live streams

2163
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,199
i assume i'm going to learn

2164
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:19,840
way more than i can bring to the actual

2165
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,800
conversation and if i and if i come in

2166
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,440
into it with that sort of humble

2167
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,199
sense that

2168
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:29,840
i i can't come from a place of

2169
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,440
everything that i know i have a few

2170
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,120
experiences that i can

2171
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,880
share and say i think that this

2172
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,080
validates

2173
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,080
some of the ideas that we have but i

2174
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:39,760
never come at it with a situation of

2175
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:42,239
going i'm going to school everybody up

2176
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:43,360
today

2177
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:45,600
i think it's the interaction part

2178
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,920
and i think it's the getting into those

2179
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:49,199
places of

2180
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:53,440
necessary discomfort because we do

2181
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,440
find ourselves lots of times in these

2182
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,360
papers not really knowing where it's

2183
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,920
going to end up and you have to kind of

2184
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:03,199
have the strategies and the attitude

2185
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:06,000
to be able to handle that and so when we

2186
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,239
develop that in people

2187
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:09,920
what does that do in terms of giving

2188
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:13,040
them a better sense of what applied

2189
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:15,679
active inference really means

2190
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:17,600
we have to go a step back

2191
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:18,960
and say

2192
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:21,120
so what strategies do you use right now

2193
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:23,600
what is what are your default heuristics

2194
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,440
when you find those heuristics as blue

2195
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,040
pointed out

2196
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,199
being applied in certain social settings

2197
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:33,360
and getting rejected now what do you do

2198
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:40,159
okay i'm gonna uh plateau on this slide

2199
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:42,480
elaboration to see what this might

2200
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,960
reflect on either of you about applying

2201
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,480
active inference

2202
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:47,440
so

2203
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,760
now we've added in another layer so

2204
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:52,239
here's the active inference modeler

2205
01:21:52,239 --> 01:21:54,320
team

2206
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:55,360
making

2207
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:56,639
figure two

2208
01:21:56,639 --> 01:21:57,760
model

2209
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,679
making a model where there is

2210
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:02,080
intelligence on both sides of the table

2211
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:03,520
whereas here

2212
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,199
they're making

2213
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:08,000
something more like figure one

2214
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,440
so in this case the modeler

2215
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:15,120
in the more figure one like case

2216
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:17,440
there's more of a tendency

2217
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:18,880
speculating

2218
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:21,520
for the the modeler

2219
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:26,080
to just project their cognition into the

2220
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:29,360
model as it interfaces with a more

2221
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:30,960
passive or

2222
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:32,880
non-agentic

2223
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,639
surrounding

2224
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:37,760
when we start

2225
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:40,639
thinking about making models

2226
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:43,920
where there's agency on both sides

2227
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:45,040
then

2228
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,320
it's like

2229
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,960
we have that realization

2230
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,080
that

2231
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:52,320
we're also on the other side of

2232
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:54,799
something

2233
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:59,120
and so that is some of the

2234
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:02,080
implicit

2235
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,960
esoteric

2236
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,360
impactful

2237
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:12,080
interfaces of modeling as development

2238
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:14,880
and modeling as personal and multi-scale

2239
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,800
development

2240
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,040
because there is a difference with

2241
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,480
making these two different types of

2242
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:23,199
model in what this individual thinks and

2243
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:26,080
their thought loops

2244
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:30,880
change how they act and their actions

2245
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:34,320
are the environment's sense states

2246
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:36,960
so it's like

2247
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,800
there's a lot of ways to go with it and

2248
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,960
a lot of loops of cognition and

2249
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:44,639
perception action

2250
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:47,760
but again it's taking those intertwined

2251
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:50,400
and nested and laterally interacting

2252
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,040
perception cognition action loops

2253
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,520
taking that as a starting point

2254
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,280
not as an ending point

2255
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,960
so we don't need to talk about how it's

2256
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:00,800
not that way

2257
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,960
we need to talk about applying active

2258
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:04,480
inference

2259
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,639
so that it can be

2260
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:08,080
a starting point

2261
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:09,840
and it is a starting point

2262
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:12,639
and we're on the journey anyone who's

2263
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:14,800
paying attention is

2264
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:18,239
but what happens as we continue in that

2265
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:20,559
journey

2266
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,639
are either of you gamers like do you do

2267
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:29,639
gaming

2268
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:33,520
i have a little bit but like as a

2269
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,600
teenager or something but not not so

2270
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:38,159
much anymore

2271
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:40,480
because

2272
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:42,159
like in that environment i don't do it

2273
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:43,040
at all

2274
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:44,880
but in in that in that virtual

2275
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:46,639
environment i have a number of friends

2276
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:49,679
who have picked up the

2277
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:50,800
the um

2278
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:53,520
virtual reality gear

2279
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,520
and they absolutely love it in that in

2280
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,440
that kind of an environment

2281
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,600
they are neophilic

2282
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:02,320
through and through and they want

2283
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:04,159
to share that with me

2284
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:06,320
i mean they want to invite me in they

2285
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:07,280
want

2286
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:08,480
me to

2287
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:12,400
kind of join that world of playing

2288
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:15,600
virtual tennis with them because

2289
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:17,520
they they just have so much fun in there

2290
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:19,920
so a big part of this although it's not

2291
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:23,840
my cup of tea anymore the robots are um

2292
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,120
i can see

2293
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,719
where you can take these basic

2294
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:29,280
principles of applying active inference

2295
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:31,120
and it doesn't always have to be pick

2296
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:32,800
yourself up physically and get on board

2297
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:35,600
an airplane and or whatever you can do

2298
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:38,320
it virtually as well it's just that

2299
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:39,440
knowing

2300
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:40,880
when those

2301
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:44,000
when those conditions and circumstances

2302
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,880
are such that people want to

2303
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,639
move concentrically

2304
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:51,280
and circularly

2305
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:53,520
around a certain a certain set of

2306
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,679
conditions where they're limited by the

2307
01:25:55,679 --> 01:25:59,360
number of pixels or limited by their

2308
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:00,560
their

2309
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:01,840
wanting to control their carbon

2310
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,280
footprint

2311
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:05,360
but again the applied active inference

2312
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:09,040
part isn't necessarily something that's

2313
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,560
always

2314
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,400
you know i have to i have to get on the

2315
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:13,679
big

2316
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:16,560
big rocket and on a way to go

2317
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:19,120
sort of thing

2318
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,400
i think this does take us towards this

2319
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,560
question of like

2320
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:26,560
wanting to apply active inference or

2321
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:29,840
wanting to be applying active inference

2322
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,840
expecting and preferring oneself to be

2323
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:34,080
applying active inference if you don't

2324
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:36,960
expect and prefer that

2325
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:39,199
fine

2326
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:42,080
do what you expect and prefer and you

2327
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:43,280
will

2328
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:44,719
but then

2329
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:46,000
what

2330
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,639
brings one

2331
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:51,199
from seeing a phenomena

2332
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:52,960
from being curious about pay phones and

2333
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:54,639
technology adoption in this or that

2334
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:56,719
region of the world or wanting to

2335
01:26:56,719 --> 01:27:00,159
understand how moving a bacteria from

2336
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:02,320
one temperature and salt concentration

2337
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:04,880
to a different niche how to model that

2338
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:05,760
or

2339
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,760
all of these other processes that come

2340
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:08,480
up

2341
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:11,679
as examples or as ancillary to some of

2342
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:13,920
the discussions that we have

2343
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,679
how do we go

2344
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:18,800
from that phenomena that has taken our

2345
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:21,120
interest that we've distinguished that

2346
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:23,600
phenomena from the other phenomena like

2347
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,600
i'm talking about the rotating of the

2348
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:28,080
hurricane i'm not talking about the fact

2349
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:30,400
that the clouds are gray or that it's 21

2350
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:32,320
000 feet off the ground like there's a

2351
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:33,760
phenomena

2352
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:35,840
not the only phenomena but there's

2353
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:37,760
something

2354
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:40,239
and thing ends with ing too so some

2355
01:27:40,239 --> 01:27:41,360
thing ing

2356
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:43,040
that has

2357
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:45,040
come on to our

2358
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:47,199
radar

2359
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:50,639
and then how do we go from that

2360
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:53,840
t-h-i-n-g or

2361
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:54,880
other

2362
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,120
thing

2363
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:59,120
towards

2364
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:00,400
active inference

2365
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:01,760
models

2366
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:04,159
and that space

2367
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:06,800
before the modeler has even

2368
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:08,960
written down a bayes graph

2369
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:11,120
before they in their journey may even

2370
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:13,199
know what a bayes graph is

2371
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:16,320
or a way to interpret it let alone the

2372
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:20,159
minimum of two ways to interpret it

2373
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,239
what's happening in that space and is

2374
01:28:22,239 --> 01:28:23,440
that

2375
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:26,320
applying active inference

2376
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:29,360
even if it's only recognized later

2377
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:31,360
that it was

2378
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:35,080
applying active inference

2379
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:44,880
well i don't have much more to say on it

2380
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,480
except the fact that i think that a lot

2381
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:47,280
of us

2382
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,679
are trained in in formal education

2383
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:51,040
settings

2384
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:54,239
to never actually

2385
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:55,600
really apply

2386
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,840
active inference in terms of that

2387
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:00,960
formality around what we think we what

2388
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:02,560
we predict

2389
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:04,080
we have to do

2390
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:06,639
in order to

2391
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:08,480
come out the other side of that that

2392
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:09,920
particular kind of formalized and

2393
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:11,840
structured learning journey that's what

2394
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:14,719
i know from my own experiences i mean

2395
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:16,639
until there was an active inference

2396
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:18,320
group

2397
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:19,520
um

2398
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,239
something formally organized around the

2399
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:24,800
concept of active inference

2400
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,239
i wouldn't have even

2401
01:29:26,239 --> 01:29:28,159
i wouldn't have

2402
01:29:28,159 --> 01:29:29,600
i would not have guessed i would have

2403
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,199
not have predicted

2404
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:32,800
that there would be

2405
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:35,199
the kind of interest that we

2406
01:29:35,199 --> 01:29:36,639
are now

2407
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:39,199
trying to evolve and support

2408
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:42,480
it's this is still very nascent in terms

2409
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:45,040
of its acceptance and its uptake

2410
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:47,440
if we're going to talk about uploading

2411
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:50,159
in terms of what

2412
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:52,880
what kinds of um

2413
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:56,320
what kinds of alternatives we could

2414
01:29:56,320 --> 01:30:00,159
we could at least give um

2415
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:02,320
some consideration

2416
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:05,320
too

2417
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:08,800
i can show an image from the

2418
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:10,960
textbook from the active textbook and

2419
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:11,920
kind of

2420
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:14,400
reflect on that and this is just

2421
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:17,199
this is the appetizer of the appetizer

2422
01:30:17,199 --> 01:30:18,080
because

2423
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,199
of course we're going to have the

2424
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:20,639
textbook group

2425
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:22,400
and multiple cohorts of that where we

2426
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,719
like go through it and the textbook is

2427
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:27,199
an appetizer to the appetizer and so

2428
01:30:27,199 --> 01:30:28,320
just

2429
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:31,599
it's a fractal it's a crumb

2430
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:34,480
we've been talking a lot about graphs

2431
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:36,719
that look like the one on the top

2432
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:39,760
and so this is the same kind of

2433
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:41,679
partially observable markov decision

2434
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:43,520
process written in a slightly different

2435
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:45,760
um way slightly different labeling like

2436
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:47,840
a three instead of a d and a 2 instead

2437
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:48,880
of an a

2438
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:52,639
and a b here and etc so

2439
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:54,800
same but a little different

2440
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:55,600
and

2441
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,840
in this type of model we talk about like

2442
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:00,320
the state at a given time s of t

2443
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:02,320
and then we talk about the transitions

2444
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:04,159
of it being different at a different

2445
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:06,960
time point like here is the past

2446
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:08,320
and then the transition to the present

2447
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:10,400
the present the transition to the future

2448
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:12,560
and then at each of those time steps

2449
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,480
there's like the emission of some

2450
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:16,639
observation so there's the

2451
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:19,120
dynamics of the translation of the

2452
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:20,719
underlying hidden state

2453
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:22,159
and then there's the emission of

2454
01:31:22,159 --> 01:31:23,600
observations that's the part that makes

2455
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:25,440
it like partially observable and then

2456
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:27,440
there's action in the loop with pi

2457
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:28,239
okay

2458
01:31:28,239 --> 01:31:30,400
that's the top one

2459
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:33,840
the bottom one is clearly drawn

2460
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:35,360
if we can have a theory of mind of the

2461
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:36,320
authors

2462
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,000
to reflect

2463
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,800
some isomorphisms or similarities

2464
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:43,120
structurally between this top

2465
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:45,360
representation and the bottom one

2466
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:46,320
and

2467
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:48,480
they discuss we're going to appeal to

2468
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:49,840
these throughout the remainder of the

2469
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:52,719
book okay so the tops the pomdp

2470
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:54,880
sequence of states evolving through time

2471
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:57,679
indexed by the subscript

2472
01:31:57,679 --> 01:31:59,920
continuous time model of the sort

2473
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:01,600
implied by stochastic differential

2474
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,840
equations with prime notation indicating

2475
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:05,600
temporal derivatives

2476
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:07,840
so here x

2477
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:11,360
is like the hidden state now

2478
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,679
x prime is the rate of change of the

2479
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:15,600
hidden state now

2480
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:18,400
x double prime is the second derivative

2481
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,000
so not just like the velocity but the

2482
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,360
acceleration of the hidden state now

2483
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:26,800
each of those are emitting observations

2484
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,960
in this y prime space

2485
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,239
but now

2486
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:32,080
3

2487
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:33,120
the b

2488
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,320
up here

2489
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,080
does not reflect how things change

2490
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:37,440
through time

2491
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:38,639
but rather

2492
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:42,080
how derivatives are taken now

2493
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:44,560
and so this is like time series planning

2494
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,880
with time series inference

2495
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:48,800
where should we be in five time steps

2496
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:51,440
well let's explore and roll out where we

2497
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:53,199
could be in five time steps

2498
01:32:53,199 --> 01:32:56,400
the bottom is more like a taylor series

2499
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:59,520
because we're only staying with two feet

2500
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,400
now

2501
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:01,760
and then we're just asking okay where

2502
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:03,600
are we now that's our first

2503
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,199
fundamental frequency

2504
01:33:05,199 --> 01:33:07,120
then where's the rate of change and

2505
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:08,320
where's the second derivative of the

2506
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:09,840
rate of change and so we're

2507
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:12,000
approximating a future

2508
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,600
unfolding

2509
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,159
using only the generalized coordinates

2510
01:33:16,159 --> 01:33:17,920
of motion

2511
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:20,960
in one time step and so there isn't an

2512
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:23,360
explicit modeling of any future time

2513
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:26,239
points at all it's not x prime

2514
01:33:26,239 --> 01:33:27,920
of t plus one

2515
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:30,480
this is all about the derivatives of

2516
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:31,520
motion

2517
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,280
at this time point

2518
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:34,239
so

2519
01:33:34,239 --> 01:33:35,679
we've been having some interesting

2520
01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:37,520
conversations

2521
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:40,159
what kind of thing

2522
01:33:40,159 --> 01:33:43,520
allows these representations

2523
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:44,320
and

2524
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,080
then thinking about what kind of thing

2525
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:47,280
that is

2526
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:49,040
and actually how different these

2527
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,199
representations are despite being able

2528
01:33:51,199 --> 01:33:52,880
to be laid out graphically in a similar

2529
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:55,199
way

2530
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:57,440
there are more

2531
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:58,560
in this

2532
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:01,520
family of graphs that we haven't seen

2533
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:03,520
even if these two uniquely identified

2534
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:05,600
one thing and that one thing was the one

2535
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:07,840
thing there still would be

2536
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:12,320
other representations we haven't seen so

2537
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:16,639
blue

2538
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:17,600
so you're way ahead of me in the

2539
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,280
textbook because you're a good student

2540
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:20,800
like that i haven't come to that picture

2541
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:24,400
yet but i think it's interesting that

2542
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,000
when

2543
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,440
things are changing rapidly we notice

2544
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:30,560
them more

2545
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:32,560
um and when things are changing slowly

2546
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:34,320
we don't notice them at all

2547
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:36,159
so what

2548
01:34:36,159 --> 01:34:38,159
what effect do the first and second

2549
01:34:38,159 --> 01:34:40,400
order derivatives have on our

2550
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:43,440
perception like a frog being boiled in

2551
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:45,520
hot water right or in tap water if you

2552
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:46,800
take it room temperature water and

2553
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:48,400
slowly increase it it doesn't really

2554
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,560
notice that it's being boiled alive but

2555
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:52,480
if you take it from you know it's cold

2556
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,960
nice cool pond into a pot of boiling

2557
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:57,360
water it's gonna big time notice

2558
01:34:57,360 --> 01:35:00,080
so so i wonder um you know does

2559
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:01,840
perception increase with first and

2560
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:04,480
second order derivatives

2561
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:06,560
or or the sensation increase the

2562
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:08,560
magnitude of the sensation or the

2563
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:11,560
perception

2564
01:35:14,159 --> 01:35:16,400
when some things change so fast they

2565
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:19,119
again become imperceptible

2566
01:35:19,119 --> 01:35:21,360
like a helicopter blades then it becomes

2567
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:23,600
again or like a frequency that just

2568
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:27,000
becomes inaudible

2569
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:33,360
is it like parabolic

2570
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:35,520
okay like like uh you know that we get

2571
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:37,040
max perception

2572
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:38,639
like when the rate of change is between

2573
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:40,719
this and this and then no perception and

2574
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:42,480
no perception over on the other side

2575
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:43,920
it's like uh

2576
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:46,000
it's like tuning in and tuning out

2577
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
there's um some

2578
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,920
wavelength that's being optimally

2579
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:51,199
perceived

2580
01:35:51,199 --> 01:35:53,440
and then there's trailing off

2581
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:56,400
so now let's go back to figure two

2582
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:58,480
and think about blue like you brought up

2583
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:01,280
the beginning like improvisation

2584
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:05,280
now when we're doing improvisation

2585
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:09,360
do we

2586
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:12,480
in what ways do we

2587
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:15,520
do time series modeling to explicitly

2588
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:16,480
predict

2589
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:17,360
how

2590
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:19,920
i will be and how they will be

2591
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:22,840
in the future at specific future time

2592
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:25,040
points and or

2593
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:29,440
if we are uploading not just offloading

2594
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:31,840
what if we just have to where is their

2595
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:33,119
arm

2596
01:36:33,119 --> 01:36:35,280
is it accelerating is it changing how

2597
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:37,280
it's accelerating

2598
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:39,920
rather than where will their arm be in

2599
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:41,520
30 minutes

2600
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:45,920
one can just say in the very short term

2601
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:49,199
in a playful space

2602
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:51,440
how can we just listen to how things are

2603
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:52,719
how they're changing and how that's

2604
01:36:52,719 --> 01:36:55,840
changing and so on

2605
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:58,719
how does that move from

2606
01:36:58,719 --> 01:37:02,400
playful contact improv into

2607
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:04,480
digital stigmargy that makes useful

2608
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:06,880
productive technologies

2609
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:08,639
it's another question

2610
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:10,639
one of those questions isn't better

2611
01:37:10,639 --> 01:37:12,159
it's awesome that we have a framework

2612
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:14,320
that helps us address both of them

2613
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:17,519
as well as other questions

2614
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:22,800
what happens when we think about

2615
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:24,719
offloading and uploading using the

2616
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:26,960
structures that we've seen we won't go

2617
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:28,800
into it today but like

2618
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,400
we've added

2619
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:34,159
this extended perspective

2620
01:37:34,159 --> 01:37:35,360
to

2621
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:37,360
what will be evoked

2622
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:39,760
when we hear about active

2623
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:41,600
in the future

2624
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:45,040
it's like charging that term

2625
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:46,719
with more and more

2626
01:37:46,719 --> 01:37:49,719
ways

2627
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:52,000
to relate it

2628
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,239
like

2629
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:58,719
it'll be interesting to find out

2630
01:37:58,719 --> 01:38:00,480
there will be epistemic and pragmatic

2631
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:04,080
value in finding out dean

2632
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:06,159
do you daniel because i haven't i

2633
01:38:06,159 --> 01:38:07,679
haven't seen this before you put it up

2634
01:38:07,679 --> 01:38:09,760
here today you didn't got the book but

2635
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:13,119
i've just read the introduction um

2636
01:38:13,119 --> 01:38:14,800
do you think do you think going forward

2637
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,239
if we're going to get to a place where

2638
01:38:16,239 --> 01:38:17,840
we're going to feel comfortable in terms

2639
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:18,960
of

2640
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:20,800
developing the conditions around which

2641
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:23,199
active inference is

2642
01:38:23,199 --> 01:38:24,639
more easily

2643
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:27,360
uptaken or adopted

2644
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:28,480
or given

2645
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,000
there's a certain confidence around

2646
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,280
using that

2647
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:32,800
methodology

2648
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:33,760
to

2649
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:35,520
conform

2650
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:37,920
what's on the other side of the

2651
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:39,600
the

2652
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:41,920
yet to be observed is there is there a

2653
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:43,360
monte carlo

2654
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:45,440
aspect to this in terms of

2655
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:48,400
just having to play out a few hands and

2656
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:49,920
getting comfortable with the fact that

2657
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:53,040
that takes a while is that perhaps why

2658
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:56,080
the diacronic piece was introduced

2659
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:58,719
and kept right near the end

2660
01:38:58,719 --> 01:39:00,480
where the remarks are

2661
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:02,639
in in in the sense that

2662
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:04,400
we all seem to be time constrained and

2663
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:06,239
we want to make sure that we're getting

2664
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:07,840
value for our dollar

2665
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:08,880
from our

2666
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:11,440
our ways of uh doing things but

2667
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:12,639
if we're going to look at it from the

2668
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:15,199
perspective of distributing cognition in

2669
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:16,800
the globe

2670
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:19,199
there are still going to be some ad hoc

2671
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:21,840
aspects of this that kind of play out

2672
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:24,159
monte carlo style

2673
01:39:24,159 --> 01:39:26,719
like you went to one performance and

2674
01:39:26,719 --> 01:39:28,320
then you went to the the next

2675
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:29,600
performance

2676
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:32,080
five hours later

2677
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:34,480
would you go in with an expectation that

2678
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:36,880
you're going to see an exact copy of

2679
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:39,520
what you saw before and does that change

2680
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:40,880
the value

2681
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:42,000
of

2682
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,159
of being

2683
01:39:44,159 --> 01:39:46,400
now part of that

2684
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:48,639
that that collector or that const

2685
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:50,400
constituted

2686
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:53,040
um cognitive niche right

2687
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:54,880
so maybe maybe one of the things we have

2688
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:59,199
to do is ask ask ourselves if we

2689
01:39:59,199 --> 01:40:02,000
want people to be able to take this on

2690
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,320
the idea of active inference and

2691
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:07,760
extended making it safe for them not to

2692
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:09,760
feel as though if they don't come up

2693
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:12,239
with the correct answer out of the

2694
01:40:12,239 --> 01:40:14,480
the series of four

2695
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:16,320
that

2696
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:17,920
that's not the only way to measure

2697
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:20,080
whether or not you're you're gaining

2698
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:22,639
confidence is around how your generative

2699
01:40:22,639 --> 01:40:23,760
model

2700
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:26,719
gives you a chance to maybe

2701
01:40:26,719 --> 01:40:29,280
decide who the two finalists are in said

2702
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:32,239
competition still six weeks away from

2703
01:40:32,239 --> 01:40:34,159
now right like i don't want every thing

2704
01:40:34,159 --> 01:40:36,639
now to become about online gambling but

2705
01:40:36,639 --> 01:40:38,639
i mean there are actual things that we

2706
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:39,360
can

2707
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:41,920
find in the niche that are currently

2708
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:42,880
there

2709
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:45,280
that would give people a better sense of

2710
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:46,960
what information they might may or may

2711
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:48,400
not need

2712
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:50,960
in order to be able to make open that

2713
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:53,920
that basal ganglia or close it

2714
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:55,360
because there's a lot of times we know

2715
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:57,600
that we should close it we just should

2716
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:59,840
not go forward

2717
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:02,080
so

2718
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:06,480
yeah again i think i think

2719
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:08,400
it um

2720
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:10,080
it maybe some of these things come back

2721
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:12,320
to how much time we're willing to spend

2722
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:14,320
on it and whether we see the the

2723
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:16,800
investment of time at the front end

2724
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:19,600
paying off exponentially at the back end

2725
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:20,960
or whether we just

2726
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:23,520
stick with those methods that we

2727
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:25,760
are familiar with because we know at the

2728
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:28,159
end of the 13-week cycle we can say

2729
01:41:28,159 --> 01:41:30,480
we've now accounted for

2730
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:33,840
x amount of a of a of a download or an

2731
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:36,560
offload or a dump

2732
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:38,159
i wonder if that's part of where we're

2733
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:41,159
at

2734
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:50,159
blue

2735
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:54,960
this is only a partial a partial

2736
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:56,719
um alignment just a yes and to what you

2737
01:41:56,719 --> 01:41:58,400
said it's not a direct example or a

2738
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:00,159
contradiction or anything but if we

2739
01:42:00,159 --> 01:42:02,800
think about the tech adoption curve of

2740
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:04,480
cars and

2741
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:06,719
advanced modern technology extending

2742
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:07,840
back

2743
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:09,119
infinitely

2744
01:42:09,119 --> 01:42:12,960
it's like it asymptotes back infinitely

2745
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:15,920
when i hear you talking about 13-week

2746
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:16,880
um

2747
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:17,920
quarter

2748
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:20,560
educational paradigm the instructionist

2749
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:21,760
paradigm

2750
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:24,639
which may be able to get you from three

2751
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:26,639
out of ten on the week one assessment

2752
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:28,639
and then we have a strategy that gets

2753
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:30,400
this percentage of people to seven out

2754
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,080
of ten on the week one assessment in

2755
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:34,080
this set of instructions the teachers

2756
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:35,280
get the instructions and they give

2757
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:39,040
different instructions to the learners

2758
01:42:40,639 --> 01:42:43,360
then you said in contrast there's

2759
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:45,280
putting the time in up front and

2760
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:47,759
receiving

2761
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:49,440
super linear

2762
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:51,119
reward

2763
01:42:51,119 --> 01:42:52,880
and so it's like

2764
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:55,520
the long phase

2765
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:57,840
where

2766
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,800
the technology is developing and that's

2767
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:04,159
sort of happening in someone's life like

2768
01:43:04,159 --> 01:43:06,639
and then i i saw that as connected to

2769
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:08,080
the gaming

2770
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:09,360
question

2771
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:10,719
and so

2772
01:43:10,719 --> 01:43:13,119
we have a lot of the tools for that

2773
01:43:13,119 --> 01:43:15,199
micro gaming

2774
01:43:15,199 --> 01:43:17,280
getting people to engage in

2775
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:19,679
instructionalist activities

2776
01:43:19,679 --> 01:43:21,760
has been gamified

2777
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:25,679
to a fine art and science and it will

2778
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:28,800
become more intense in the coming years

2779
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:30,239
we can expect

2780
01:43:30,239 --> 01:43:31,760
even if we cognitively say we don't

2781
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:33,280
prefer that

2782
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:35,119
so

2783
01:43:35,119 --> 01:43:37,440
how

2784
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:39,840
do we

2785
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:41,679
interact

2786
01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:44,000
not just instruct

2787
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,800
in a way where somebody who is spending

2788
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:49,119
one hour a week on active

2789
01:43:49,119 --> 01:43:51,040
goes to 10 and somebody who's at zero

2790
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:52,960
goes to one

2791
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:53,760
but

2792
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:57,119
we don't need to take 10 to 100

2793
01:43:57,119 --> 01:43:59,360
probably most of the time and how much

2794
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:01,600
time should people be spending on active

2795
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:03,199
what should they expect to get out of

2796
01:44:03,199 --> 01:44:05,920
this what do people expect from

2797
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:07,840
listening to live streams they should

2798
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:10,080
comment if they're listening it's a

2799
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:11,520
special request

2800
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:14,400
they should comment for what they do

2801
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:17,280
expect that would be interesting to know

2802
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:18,639
because

2803
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:20,960
otherwise it's us acting

2804
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:23,679
without that much of a sense back from

2805
01:44:23,679 --> 01:44:25,199
our environment

2806
01:44:25,199 --> 01:44:27,199
and so that puts us more into a figure

2807
01:44:27,199 --> 01:44:29,440
one paradigm rather than a figure two

2808
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:31,600
paradigm

2809
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:33,520
even if the material

2810
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:36,719
is so massively nuanced and interactive

2811
01:44:36,719 --> 01:44:38,239
itself

2812
01:44:38,239 --> 01:44:40,400
so there's definitely a law on the table

2813
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:41,440
hopefully

2814
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:43,440
the table is set

2815
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:45,360
such that those who are

2816
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:49,920
5.8 hours in to paper number 41

2817
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:51,520
that they're more intrigued and

2818
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:52,960
motivated by

2819
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:55,440
rather than

2820
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:57,440
reflexively looking for that two-minute

2821
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:59,840
explainer video because some of these

2822
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:01,040
ideas

2823
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:02,800
may occur at a cognitive pace that is

2824
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:06,080
slower than that video in its whole

2825
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:08,560
and require regimes of attention that

2826
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:11,199
are not amenable to being

2827
01:45:11,199 --> 01:45:13,760
driven in the same way

2828
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:17,199
as um

2829
01:45:17,199 --> 01:45:19,679
addictive repetitive

2830
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:22,639
behaviors in other like micro mining

2831
01:45:22,639 --> 01:45:25,119
educational situations

2832
01:45:25,119 --> 01:45:27,440
blue

2833
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:30,880
so um there's a whole science behind the

2834
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:33,360
gamification of everything

2835
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:35,679
and i wonder if our ability to do that

2836
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:37,600
in an educational setting but also in a

2837
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:39,280
work setting i mean they like you know

2838
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:41,840
have performance metrics and everything

2839
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:43,679
i mean we have metrics for posts on

2840
01:45:43,679 --> 01:45:45,360
twitter how many likes do you get how

2841
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:47,920
many people liked the photo you put on

2842
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:50,400
facebook i mean we metric we have

2843
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:53,040
metrics for everything and so we can

2844
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:56,000
gamify um i mean we gamify things for

2845
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,159
ourselves but things are externally

2846
01:45:58,159 --> 01:45:59,920
gamified for us

2847
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:02,320
and i wonder if

2848
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:04,639
it's successful and it's very successful

2849
01:46:04,639 --> 01:46:06,320
i don't know that it's optimal because i

2850
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:08,960
think it leads to like other problems

2851
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:10,960
but but does the gamification of

2852
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:13,040
everything

2853
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:15,119
is that like a replacement of our

2854
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:17,520
preferences for just like

2855
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:19,520
winning the game

2856
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:22,159
like ultimately like do like you know i

2857
01:46:22,159 --> 01:46:24,000
would prefer to be happy

2858
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,159
i would prefer to engage meaningfully

2859
01:46:26,159 --> 01:46:29,360
with my colleagues and um you know

2860
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:31,360
fellow students in the class

2861
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:33,440
but instead we

2862
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:37,360
are like in this weird warped gamified

2863
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:39,360
way that we have to like everything

2864
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:41,679
conforms to that

2865
01:46:41,679 --> 01:46:42,960
even though it's not aligned with my

2866
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:44,560
preferences

2867
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:46,960
i shift like so so

2868
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:48,719
the preference for taking the game just

2869
01:46:48,719 --> 01:46:50,560
like or for winning the game just like

2870
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:51,920
takes over

2871
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:53,679
your entire model with all of your other

2872
01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:55,360
preferences like why does that work or

2873
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:57,119
how i wonder like can we active

2874
01:46:57,119 --> 01:46:59,280
inference that like the active inference

2875
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:00,800
of gamification that would be super

2876
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:02,960
interesting to just look at like what

2877
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:05,119
happens is that that one preference for

2878
01:47:05,119 --> 01:47:07,920
just like winning ticking up a notch or

2879
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:10,560
like gaining more metrics is that that

2880
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:12,159
just overrides all of your other

2881
01:47:12,159 --> 01:47:14,320
preferences or it just like hits harder

2882
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:16,239
with the dopamine or or what's going on

2883
01:47:16,239 --> 01:47:18,718
there right

2884
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:21,840
definitely a important area to model and

2885
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:24,480
it reminds me of mark miller at all's

2886
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:25,440
work

2887
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:27,759
on

2888
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:30,639
yes podcasts and paper so people should

2889
01:47:30,639 --> 01:47:33,440
for sure listen to how it's framed by

2890
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:36,080
him and by colleagues but like there are

2891
01:47:36,080 --> 01:47:38,880
the drives and the preferences on like

2892
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:39,840
thirst

2893
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:43,040
like blue just enacted or for um

2894
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:47,119
temperature and so within each drive

2895
01:47:47,119 --> 01:47:49,760
there is like a pretty clear preference

2896
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:51,679
like to be in a bounded range or like

2897
01:47:51,679 --> 01:47:54,000
more is better but then there's a second

2898
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,520
level process

2899
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:58,159
by which one is asking

2900
01:47:58,159 --> 01:48:00,560
are those optimizations

2901
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:02,560
across domains

2902
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:05,119
happening better or not as well as i'm

2903
01:48:05,119 --> 01:48:06,480
expecting

2904
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:08,880
like is this a balanced

2905
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:11,440
strategy where i just every time i get

2906
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:14,400
to 98 on my phone's battery

2907
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:17,520
i'm always charging it but like

2908
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:19,280
then all of a sudden i'm neglecting all

2909
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:20,800
this other stuff

2910
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:23,040
so i'm too attentive

2911
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:25,679
for example to the battery

2912
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:27,280
drive

2913
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:29,440
to a point of it not being any more

2914
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:32,480
adaptive of a policy selection than just

2915
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:34,560
waiting until it's at 70 percent most

2916
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:36,960
the time but the uncertainty about those

2917
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:40,480
times where you do need that 98 battery

2918
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:41,840
is what

2919
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:43,760
compels people to make base optimal

2920
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:47,679
decisions that may neglect other drives

2921
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:50,239
so being able to model that

2922
01:48:50,239 --> 01:48:52,400
what's called gamification

2923
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:53,840
and then the other piece it made me

2924
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:55,600
think about is

2925
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:56,639
we don't

2926
01:48:56,639 --> 01:48:58,000
get to see

2927
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,400
figure one and figure two

2928
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:01,679
we don't know

2929
01:49:01,679 --> 01:49:04,080
what's on the other side of the blanket

2930
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:05,280
if it's

2931
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:10,400
mere or adaptive or what it is

2932
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:12,560
and so

2933
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:14,480
it's not like we'll know figure one when

2934
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:16,159
we see it and we'll know figure two when

2935
01:49:16,159 --> 01:49:17,440
we see it

2936
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:19,199
and we'll have a super super clear

2937
01:49:19,199 --> 01:49:20,719
strategy for when to engage in the

2938
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:22,320
figure one way and when to engage in the

2939
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:24,480
figure two way

2940
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:26,159
it's more like

2941
01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:28,400
and potentially this is what learning

2942
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:29,920
and applying active inference in a

2943
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:33,440
personal capacity may look like for some

2944
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:35,840
what does it look like to engage

2945
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:38,560
with figure two as your null hypothesis

2946
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:40,320
rather than figure one as your null

2947
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:42,400
hypothesis and we'll have closing

2948
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:43,920
thoughts with none of you having the

2949
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:47,199
ultimate phrase dean please

2950
01:49:47,199 --> 01:49:49,040
i think i think what you're describing

2951
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:51,280
both of you are describing is maybe that

2952
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:53,760
service piece as gamified

2953
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:55,440
which isn't necessarily cooperative

2954
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:56,639
games

2955
01:49:56,639 --> 01:49:58,239
but that's essentially what we're

2956
01:49:58,239 --> 01:49:59,920
talking about so that's

2957
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:01,360
and i'm glad i got it in because i hate

2958
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:04,000
the final word

2959
01:50:05,119 --> 01:50:07,440
blue

2960
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:11,840
yeah thanks it's interesting

2961
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:14,320
uploading cognitive uploading

2962
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:15,920
what uh

2963
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:17,599
what what amount of uploading has been

2964
01:50:17,599 --> 01:50:20,000
done by gamification i wonder that like

2965
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
that's a curious thing

2966
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,840
for me to now think about i should be

2967
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:24,960
thinking about other things but now i'm

2968
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:26,960
going to think about that so thanks

2969
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:30,400
um steven wrote in the chat gamification

2970
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:33,520
pushes induction over abduction

2971
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:35,360
favors inductive logic and playing

2972
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:36,960
within the rules of the game rather than

2973
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:39,199
abductive logic which i hope we'll be

2974
01:50:39,199 --> 01:50:40,800
able to talk about later

2975
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:42,960
so the participation is tied into a

2976
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:45,440
reinforcement learning paradigm that

2977
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:47,440
limits meaningfulness

2978
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:48,719
because it's like

2979
01:50:48,719 --> 01:50:51,920
if game is about pragmatic value

2980
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:53,679
then mine more

2981
01:50:53,679 --> 01:50:56,400
but if the game includes an epistemic

2982
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:58,000
and a pragmatic component it's already

2983
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,400
opened up now what if it contains an

2984
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:02,480
improvisational and participatory

2985
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:05,440
element because it's not just like we

2986
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:08,159
expanded the pragmatic value into your

2987
01:51:08,159 --> 01:51:11,040
epistem and your pragmatics

2988
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:12,800
but their service

2989
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:14,639
to another

2990
01:51:14,639 --> 01:51:16,159
and to the environment

2991
01:51:16,159 --> 01:51:18,840
and so maybe that is a good place

2992
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:23,040
to end slash begin with 41

2993
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:25,679
and we'll head into a whole nother set

2994
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:27,520
of topics as we move forward so dean and

2995
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:29,679
blue thanks a ton

2996
01:51:29,679 --> 01:51:31,119
great

2997
01:51:31,119 --> 01:51:33,119
discussion and great and special times

2998
01:51:33,119 --> 01:51:34,560
and thanks steven and everyone else in

2999
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:37,760
the chat so peace out fellows

3000
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:38,639
bye

3001
01:51:38,639 --> 01:51:42,199
bye thanks team

3002
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:59,519
you
